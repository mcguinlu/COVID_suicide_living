"Child sexual abuse survivors: Differential complex multimodal treatment outcomes for pre-COVID and COVID era cohorts","Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a form of early-life trauma that affects youth worldwide. In the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to investigate the potential impact of added stress on already vulnerable populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal treatment program on mental health outcomes for youth CSA survivors aged 8-17. Secondary to this, we explored the potential impact of the COVID-19 on treatment outcomes. Participants of this study were children and youth aged 8-17 who were engaged in a complex multimodal treatment program specifically designed for youth CSA survivors. Participants were asked to complete self-report surveys at baseline and at the end of two subsequent treatment rounds. Surveys consisted of measures pertaining to: (1) PTSD, (2) depression, (3) anxiety, (4) quality of life, and (5) self-esteem. Median scores improved for all groups at all timepoints for all five domains. For the pre-Covid participants, the largest improvements in the child program were reported in depression (36.6Ã‚Â %, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05); in the adolescent program anxiety showed the largest improvement (-35.7Ã‚Â %, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006). Improvements were generally maintained or increased at the end of round two. In almost every domain, the improvements of the pre-COVID group were greater than those of the COVID-I group. A complex multimodal treatment program specifically designed for youth CSA survivors has the capacity to improve a number of relevant determinants of mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic may have retraumatized participants, resulting in treatment resistance.","Reeson, Polzin, Pazderka, Agyapong, Greenshaw, Hnatko, Wei, Szymanski, Silverstone","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105926","20221104","COVID-19; Children; Complex; Multimodal; Sexual abuse; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40301,""
"Searching for the 'Aha Moments': Healthcare Social Workers' Experiences of Hope and Meaning-Making during COVID-19","While serving as the leading mental health providers in healthcare systems during COVID-19, social workers have faced numerous career-defining moments, both negative and positive; however, limited research highlights how healthcare social workers process these pivotal professional and personal encounters to find hope and meaning. The purpose of this study was to gather a deeper understanding of how healthcare social workers navigated oppressive healthcare systems, social injustice, and their personal and professional caregiving roles to sustain hope, meaning, and purpose during COVID-19. Participants were recruited through healthcare social work professional organizations from October to December 2020. Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°54) completed an individual interview over Zoom or telephone. The study incorporated feminist phenomenology to understand how the predominantly female (96%) sample sustained hope amidst institutional, societal, and personal despair. Five themes emerged from social workers' responses: <i>withstanding existential dread; reclaiming family time and community; embracing ""aha moments""; answering the call to action; and yearning for normalcy while balancing personal risk.</i> Findings from this study highlight how social workers confronted oppressive systems and gendered social roles to find hope and meaning in the care that they provided for their clients, families, and communities.","Currin-McCulloch, Borrego, Kaushik, Chen, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1080/15524256.2022.2139337","20221104","COVID-19; health social work; hope; meaning-making","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40302,""
"Protecting mental health of young adults in COVID-19 pandemic: Roles of different structural and functional social supports","Concerning rates of psychological disorders are increasingly recognized in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the associations of different structural and functional social supports on depression, anxiety, and stress among young adults in Vietnam. An online cross-sectional study was performed on 236 respondents aged 16 to 30 years in Vietnam from June to July 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21); the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and the LUBBEN Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) was used to measure psychological health, functional and structural social support characteristics. Multi-level mixed-effect logistic regression was used to identify associations between social support and anxiety, depression, and stress. The rate of at least mild depression, anxiety, and stress were 30.1%, 34.8%, and 35.6%, respectively. Structural supports measured by LSNS-6 were not associated with the likelihood of having depression, anxiety, and stress (p&gt;0.05). Respondents having friends with whom they could share joys and sorrows were less likely to have anxiety (aOR = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.41-0.90) and stress (aOR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.45-0.96). Having family support in decision-making was also negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Meanwhile, those having family and friends who tried to help them were more likely to suffer stress (aOR = 1.94, 95%CI = 1.16-3.24) and depression (aOR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.11-3.92), respectively. This study highlighted a high rate of psychological problems among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Emotional support from friends and advice support from family were important components that should be considered in further interventions to mitigate the psychological problems in young adults.","Doan, Nguyen, Do, Nguyen, Vu, Do, Vu, Latkin, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276042","20221104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40303,""
"Changes in loneliness prevalence and its associated factors among Bangladeshi older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Worldwide, loneliness is one of the most common psychological phenomena among older adults, adversely affecting their physical and mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess changes in the prevalence of loneliness in the two timeframes (first and second waves of COVID-19 in Bangladesh) and identify its correlates in pooled data. This repeated cross-sectional study was conducted on two successive occasions (October 2020 and September 2021), overlapping with the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The survey was conducted remotely through telephone interviews among 2077 (1032 in the 2020-survey and 1045 in the 2021-survey) older Bangladeshi adults aged 60 years and above. Loneliness was measured using the 3-item UCLA Loneliness scale. The binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with loneliness in pooled data. We found a decline in the loneliness prevalence among the participants in two survey rounds (51.5% in 2021 versus 45.7% in 2020; P = 0.008), corresponding to 33% lower odds in the 2021-survey (AOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54-0.84). Still, nearly half of the participants were found to be lonely in the latest survey. We also found that, compared to their respective counterparts, the odds of loneliness were significantly higher among the participants without a partner (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20-2.08), with a monthly family income less than 5000 BDT (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.58-3.47), who lived alone (AOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.34-3.51), with poor memory or concentration (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.23-2.03), and suffering from non-communicable chronic conditions (AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95). Various COVID-19-related characteristics, such as concern about COVID-19 (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 0.94-1.73), overwhelm by COVID-19 (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.06), difficulty earning (AOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.54-2.59), and receiving routine medical care during COVID-19 (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.61-2.68), and perception that the participants required additional care during the pandemic (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 2.27-3.79) were also associated with significantly higher odds of loneliness. However, the odds of loneliness were significantly lower among the participants with formal schooling (AOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.89) and with a family of more than four members (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96). The current study found a decreased prevalence of loneliness among Bangladeshi older adults during the ongoing pandemic. However, the prevalence is still very high. The findings suggest the need for mental health interventions that may include improving social interactions increasing opportunities for meaningful social connections with family and community members and providing psychosocial support to the vulnerable population including older adults during the pandemic. It also suggests that policymakers and public health practitioners should emphasise providing mental health services at the peripheral level where the majority of older adults reside.","Mistry, Ali, Yadav, Khanam, Huda","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277247","20221104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40304,""
"Beyond COVID-19: the impact of recent pandemics on medical students and their education: a scoping review","Over the past two years, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has greatly altered medical student education as well as daily life. Medical schools across the world were disrupted and had to immediately adapt the educational experience to the online environment in order to continue the delivery of quality medical education. However, COVID-19 was not the only recent pandemic. This posed the question, were similar disruptions and adaptations also seen in recent past pandemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that could have prepared medical educators for COVID-19? This scoping review investigated the educational and personal impact of recent pandemics on medical students. This review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews. Nine databases including PubMed, ERIC, and EMBASE were systematically searched using keywords and subject headings related to medical students and SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19. Studies were limited to research studies published between 2000 and 2020 and in English. Based on exclusion and inclusion criteria, all studies were independently screened by two reviewers first by the title/abstract and then via full text. Data were extracted from the included studies and analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis. A total of 174 studies fit the criteria. Seven major themes emerged from those studies: educational adaptations and online modifications, knowledge and attitudes of students, mental wellness of students, student involvement and use of telehealth, student vaccination, physical wellness of students, and stigma. This review provided insights into how medical students were affected by recent pandemics and their perceptions of pivoting to online education, mental health, and knowledge of the diseases. Additionally, this review showcases the various educational adaptations that emerged uniquely during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as telehealth services or video conferencing tools, that can be utilized in a post-pandemic environment.","Bughrara, Swanberg, Lucia, Schmitz, Jung, Wunderlich-Barillas","https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2022.2139657","20221104","COVID-19; Medical students; educational adaptations; pandemics; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40305,""
"Enabling Rural Telehealth for Older Adults in Underserved Rural Communities: Focus Group Study","Telehealth is often suggested to improve access to health care and has had significant publicity worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited studies have examined the telehealth needs of underserved populations such as rural communities. This study aims to investigate enablers for telehealth use in underserved rural populations to improve access to health care for rural older adults. In total, 7 focus group discussions and 13 individual interviews were held across 4 diverse underserved rural communities. A total of 98 adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 years participated. The participants were asked whether they had used telehealth, how they saw their community's health service needs evolving, how telehealth might help provide these services, and how they perceived barriers to and enablers of telehealth for older adults in rural communities. Focus group transcripts were thematically analyzed. The term telehealth was not initially understood by many participants and required an explanation. Those who had used telehealth reported positive experiences (time and cost savings) and were likely to use telehealth again. A total of 2 main themes were identified through an equity lens. The first theme was trust, with 3 subthemes-trust in the telehealth technology, trust in the user (consumer and health provider), and trust in the health system. Having access to reliable and affordable internet connectivity and digital devices was a key enabler for telehealth use. Most rural areas had intermittent and unreliable internet connectivity. Another key enabler is easy access to user support. Trust in the health system focused on waiting times, lack of and/or delayed communication and coordination, and cost. The second theme was choice, with 3 subthemes-health service access, consultation type, and telehealth deployment. Access to health services through telehealth needs to be culturally appropriate and enable access to currently limited or absent services such as mental health and specialist services. Accessing specialist care through telehealth was extremely popular, although some participants preferred to be seen in person. A major enabler for telehealth was telehealth deployment by a fixed community hub or on a mobile bus, with support available, particularly when combined with non-health-related services such as internet banking. Overall, participants were keen on the idea of telehealth. Several barriers and enablers were identified, particularly trust and choice. The term telehealth is not well understood. The unreliable and expensive connectivity options available to rural communities have limited telehealth experience to phone or patient portal use for those with connectivity. Having the opportunity to try telehealth, particularly by using video, would increase the understanding and acceptance of telehealth. This study highlights that local rural communities need to be involved in designing telehealth services within their communities.","Hunter, Lockhart, Rao, Tootell, Wong","https://doi.org/10.2196/35864","20221104","access; barrier; barriers; choice; eHealth; elder; enabler; enablers; equity; facilitator; focus group; older adult; rural; telehealth; telemedicine; trust; underserved; underserved populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40306,""
"Preceptor support during the COVID-19 pandemic: Recommendations for continuing development","Ã‚Â Mentally fit preceptors may be more capable and flexible in providing students with system, emotional and cognitive support in the clinical learning environment (CLE) in the face of any life-threatening outbreaks. Existing professional development programmes for preceptors emphasise the development of preceptor competence in a normal CLE with minimal focus on their ability to engage with adverse events that challenge their mental health. Ã‚Â The study sought insight from preceptors' experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to identify their professional development programme needs while providing support to students during accompaniment. Ã‚Â A mixed methods convergent parallel design was used to collect data from 24 preceptors at a nursing education institution (NEI). Eleven preceptors responded to the survey that included the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Stress Scale (CSS) and Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT) to collect quantitative data. Semistructured interviews were conducted with five purposively selected preceptors to collect qualitative data regarding their experiences while accompanying students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ã‚Â Subscales within the CSS and BAT instruments were mapped against an existing preceptor support framework. Overall CSS data for each subscale indicated an average score varying from no stress to moderate stress, while BAT data shows that respondents rarely experienced burnout. However, some respondents experienced very high levels of stress and burnout. Qualitative data supplemented results. Ã‚Â The COVID-19 pandemic influenced preceptors' role in supporting students and reflecting that they amended their functioning role. Existing preceptor professional development programmes should be reviewed to ensure that the necessary concepts that foster resilience are integrated to enhance the functional role of preceptors in adversity.Contribution:Ã‚Â Existing preceptor professional development programmes should be reviewed to ensure that the necessary concepts that foster resilience are integrated to enhance the functional role of preceptors in adversity.","Hugo-Van Dyk, Nyoni, Williams, Botha","https://doi.org/10.4102/curationis.v45i1.2370","20221104","COVID-19; clinical learning environment; continuous professional development; preceptors; undergraduate nursing students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40307,""
"Participating as a research team during the COVID-19 pandemic benefits mental health of undergraduate medical students in Brazil","During the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate medical students (UMS) exposed to isolation, social distancing and complete or partial face-to-face educational activities interruption may present increased stress, depression and anxiety. This study was undertaken to evaluate if, during isolation, UMS involved in online group activities as investigators of a research project (volunteer group) would present better mental health than their colleagues, not involved in that research (control group). A Web-based survey, via the Google Forms platform, including details on demographic data, life habits, previous health conditions, worries with the COVID-19 pandemic, sleep pattern modifications and depression, anxiety and mental stress, using the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) was implemented from 20 July to 31 August 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0. A p-value &lt;0.05 was significant. A total of 684 UMS were included, 228 as a volunteer group and 456 as a control group. Mean age was 23.15 (3.16) years. The groups were paired for age, gender, ethnicity, life habits and previous health conditions. Older age, male gender, participation in the research project, unchanged sleep pattern during the pandemic, lack of fear from getting the COVID-19 and lack of previous health conditions were associated with lower DASS21 scores (better mental health).

"Key Stakeholder Perspectives of Community Engagement Efforts and the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally affected historically marginalized populations and their access to resources and healthcare. In times of crisis, authentic community engagement is more important than ever. This study was Phase 1 of a larger 3-phase study to conduct timely community-engaged research with community members to understand the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on historically underserved communities. The objective of this work was to conduct key informant (KI) interviews (1) to understand community organizations perspectives about the role that large academic health centers play as they interface with community organizations to support their work, (2) to leverage KI's expertise to identify needs and assets within the community, and (3) to inform both Phase 2 (focus group qualitative research) and Phase 3 (survey) of the broader study. A total of 24 key informants were identified through purposeful sampling and one-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted across 4 states using video conferencing. Barriers to access and lack of transparency were highlighted as major issues requiring reform-in particular, aggressive billing practices and insurance barriers exacerbated local distrust of medical institutions. KIs recognized the health institution's support for testing and vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic, but noted other significant gaps in care, especially regarding mental health support. Although communication with the health institution was consistent for some KIs, others experienced unsustained communication efforts that hindered cooperation and relationship building. Leaders in the community as key stakeholders can provide unique insights into the challenges and potential solutions required to promote health equity, and foster understanding between local communities and healthcare institutions.","Huang, Cleveland, Clift, Egginton, Pacheco-Spann, Johnson, Albertie, Cardenas, Phelan, Allyse, Barwise","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319221133076","20221104","COVID-19; access to care; community engagement; key informants; qualitative data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40309,""
"Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Mental Health Visits in Pediatric Primary Care","Describe the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on pediatric primary care visits for 7 mental health categories before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of Covid-19 pandemic on services for children and adolescents with ADHD: results from a survey of paediatricians in the United Kingdom","The Covid-19 pandemic has led to huge disruptions and multi-domain healthcare crisis, with additional impact on children and young people (CYP) affected by Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We conducted an online survey and obtained responses from 62 Paediatricians who provide ADHD services for CYP about their experience of Service disruption and adaptations during the first Covid-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom between March and June 2020. The responses were both quantitative and qualitative. The Paediatricians reported huge service disruptions such that almost half ceased the assessment of new patients with ADHD, and only 5% were able to offer physical monitoring for most patients. However, all respondents had adopted telemedicine, which allowed them to maintain high levels of non-physical service provision for existing patients. The Paediatricians used risk stratification strategies to determine which patients were more likely to benefit from the limited available face to face appointments for physical monitoring. The Paediatricians demonstrated clinical pragmatism to meet the needs of their patients such as starting medication without physical exam especially if the patient's behaviour was so challenging that it was presenting a crisis at home, and setting aside monthly limits for stimulant medications. Some respondents reported helpful cross-service collaborations to support CYP with ADHD and their families. The Covid-19 pandemic has had adverse effect on many CYP with ADHD and caused huge disruption to the ADHD services that support them. As the pandemic continues to cause disruptions to ADHD services, the service adaptations emerging from the literature including some of those identified in this study could be useful to support more stable and sustainable ADHD services, both during and after the pandemic.","Ogundele, Ayyash, Ani","https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2022037","20221104","ADHD; Covid-19; United Kingdom; child and adolescent mental health; disruption; paediatrics; service provision; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40313,""

This study collects and analyzes data from students on the impact of these new online learning techniques, and by collecting and analyzing the challenges and issues faced by college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was based on and extended the European Students' Union Survey and targeted higher education students concerning what student life looked like during the pandemic, including teaching and learning, their social contacts, habits/routines, as well as how they were coping with the situation emotionally and financially. The case of universities and distance learning education units in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic process. This article highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on students of all ages and their time schedules such as online learning and reflection, study environment, sleep habits, routines, and outcomes. It was found that the students generally require greater self-discipline and motivation to complete online classes. It was also reflected that the pandemic adversely affected student mental health, leading to an increased prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This may have a significant impact on their mental health issues such as frustration, stress, and sadness. This will significantly lead to cooperation between various local authorities and the private sector.","Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.925213","20221104","COVID-19; anxiety; higher education; lockdown; social life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40314,""
"COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors and mental health: A mixed methods study of women 6 months following a hypertensive pregnancy","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unprecedented challenges to both the physical and psychological health of postpartum women. The aim of this study was to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the diet, physical activity and mental health of women 6 months following a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Mixed methods sub-study of the Blood Pressure Postpartum trial, which recruited women following a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy from six Sydney metropolitan hospitals. Cross sectional analysis of baseline quantitative data, collected at 6-months postpartum from March 2019-February 2022, and qualitative data analysis from semi-structured telephone interviews, was performed. Dates of COVID-19 lockdowns for Sydney, Australia were collected from government websites. Diet (vegetable, fruit, alcohol, take away intake) and physical activity (walking, vigorous activity, strength training frequency and duration) were assessed using the self-report NSW Population Health Survey. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Edinburgh Depression Scale and GAD-7 scale, respectively. Outcome data were compared between women who completed surveys ""In Lockdown"" vs. ""Not in Lockdown"" as well as ""Prior to any Lockdown"" vs. ""During or Following any Lockdown"". Of 506 participants, 84 women completed the study surveys ""In Lockdown,"" and 149 completed the surveys ""Prior to any Lockdown."" Thirty-four participants were interviewed. There were no statistically significant differences in diet, physical activity, depression and anxiety among women who completed the survey ""In Lockdown"" vs. ""Not in Lockdown."" ""Prior to any Lockdown,"" participants were more likely to do any walking (95% vs. 89%, <i>p</i> = 0.017), any vigorous activity (43% vs. 30%, <i>p</i> = 0.006) or any strength training (44% vs. 33%, <i>p</i> = 0.024), spent more time doing vigorous activity (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and strength training (<i>p</i> = 0.047) and were more likely to drink alcohol at least monthly (54% vs. 38%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared with ""During or Following any Lockdown."" Our findings suggest that the confinements of lockdown did not markedly influence the mental health, diet and physical activity behaviors of women 6 months following hypertensive pregnancy. However, physical activity levels were reduced following the emergence of COVID-19, suggesting targeted efforts may be necessary to re-engage postpartum women with exercise. https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=376286&amp;isReview=true, identifier: ACTRN12618002004246.","Gow, Rossiter, Roberts, Henderson, Yang, Roche, Hayes, Canty, Denney-Wilson, Henry","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1000371","20221104","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; diet; hypertensive pregnancy; physical activity; postpartum; preeclampsia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40315,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health: A systematic review","The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused unprecedented disruption to the structure of children's daily lives due to school closures, online learning, strict social distancing measures, limited access to outdoor activities and many other restrictions. Since children are more susceptible to stress than adults and there is a growing concern about the potential debilitating consequences of COVID-19 for children's mental health, the present review aims to provide empirical evidence on the groups who are most at risk of mental health problems and uncover the risk and protective factors of children's mental health. A systematic search was performed, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, in the electronic databases Web of Science (including SSCI and A&amp;HI) and EBSCOhost (including ERIC, MEDLINE and APA PsycArticles and APA PsycINFO), for any empirical studies published between January 2020 and February 2022 that focused on children Ã¢â€°Â¤ 12 years old. An initial search identified 2,133 studies. A total of 30 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The evidence showed that many children were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and experienced internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Worsened child mental health outcomes reflected socioeconomic inequalities as most at-risk children had parents with low educational attainment, were from families of low socioeconomic status and lived in small homes. Key risk factors were identified, including unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (extended screen time, sleep disturbances and less physical activity), increased pandemic-related stressors among parents and deteriorated mental health of parents, which were directly or indirectly associated with the pandemic safety measures, such as home confinement or social distancing. Protective factors including parents' resilience, positive parent-child relationship and school connectedness in relation to children's mental health were reported. The overall results highlight the urgent need for the implementation of tailor-made interventions for children with signs of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Health promotion and prevention strategies by the government to maintain the mental health of children, particularly those from lower SES families who are at higher risk of worsened mental health are essential for post-pandemic policies.","Ng, Ng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.975936","20221104","COVID-19; children; externalizing behaviors; internalizing behaviors; mental health; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40316,""
"Suicidal behaviour amid first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia: Data from the COVID-19 mental health international (COMET-G) study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous social and life changes were implemented to curb the spread of the disease. The effect of lockdown and isolation predisposes the general population to various psychological health concerns. The existing determinants of suicidal behaviour were further added with social isolation, financial stress, depression, and other pandemic-related stressors. Hence, our study aimed to investigate suicidal behaviour and the associated factors among Malaysians during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey that used convenient sampling, where the survey was disseminated to the public <i>via</i> Google Forms through social media during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. This study is also part of a large international COVID-19 mental health international study for the general population (COMET-G). This research revealed concerns about issues related to suicidal behaviours during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicidal behaviours were associated with depression, sex, marital status, educational level, employment type, residential area, number of people living together, number of children, and family dynamics. The pandemic effects from psychological, social, and economic perspectives will definitely take more time for recovery. Future prevention and protection are needed especially for the highly at-risk group on top of the general population in any future unforeseen circumstances of the pandemic.","Razali, Saw, Hashim, Raduan, Tukhvatullina, Smirnova, Fountoulakis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.998888","20221104","COVID-19; Malaysia; mental health; pandemic; suicidal behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40317,""
"Psychological distress and post-traumatic growth in France during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mediation model of psychosocial safety climate as a determinant of work performance","The psychosocial safety climate (PSC) reflects workers' perceptions of senior management's concern for mental health. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated organizational issues, PSC could be a target for interventions attempting to preserve both the psychological health of employees and the economic health of companies. This study examines the direct and indirect relationships between PSC and work performance through two indicators of psychological health, psychological distress and post-traumatic growth, during a health crisis, i.e., prior to the second confinement in France. To this end, 2,004 participants from the French workforce completed a survey in October 2020. The results of mediation analyses indicate that PSC has a direct and positive influence on post-traumatic growth (PTG) and performance, as well as a direct negative influence on psychological distress. PSC also has an indirect positive influence on performance via psychological distress. Organizations that wish to jointly address mental health and performance at work would benefit from optimizing PSC.","Sandrin, Brun, Nguyen, Biron, Ivers","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.993458","20221104","pandemic crisis; performance; post traumatic growth (PTG); psychological distress; psychosocial safety climate (PSC)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40318,""
"Personality-related and psychosocial correlates of sick leave days in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings of a representative survey","The aim of our study was to assess the personality-related and psychosocial correlates of sick leave days in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from a representative online-survey covering the general German adult population (data collection: mid-March 2022). We restricted our sample to full-time employed individuals aged 18 to 64 years (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,342 individuals). Sick leave days in the preceding 12 months served as outcome measure. Validated and established tools were used to quantify personality characteristics and psychosocial factors (such as the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale or the De Jong Gierveld loneliness tool). Negative binomial regression models were used. After adjusting for various sociodemographic and health-related factors, regressions showed that a higher number of sick leave days was associated with lower levels of conscientiousness (IRR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.97), higher levels of openness to experience (IRR: 1.19, 1.04-1.35), less coronavirus anxiety (IRR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93), and more depressive symptoms (IRR: 1.06, 1.02-1.11). After adjusting for various sociodemographic and health-related factors, our study showed an association between personality-related and psychosocial factors with sick leave days.

"Anxiety and depression in the post-pandemic era: concerns about viral mutation and re-outbreak","The 2020 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has been raging for more than 20Ã‚Â months, putting significant strain on public health systems around the world. Despite the fact that the pandemic has been effectively managed in certain countries, regional outbreaks and viral mutations continue to pose a threat to people's lives. The likelihood of post-pandemic changes in people's psychological situations warrants more investigation. This study was conducted in the context of another outbreak in Zhangjiajie, China, respondents (infected patients, healthy population) were required to complete self-administered questions and standardized questionnaires, including the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). We conducted an anonymous questionnaire survey of infected patients (excluding critically ill patients) in the confirmed COVID-19 ward of Zhangjiajie City People's Hospital's East Hospital from August 14 to 24, 2021, and used convenience sampling to survey medical staff and the general public to assess the psychological reactions of different populations during the delta variant outbreak pandemic. Differences in anxiety and depression severity were compared between groups, with logistic regression models constructed to explore potential factors associated with scoring clinical significant levels of depression and/or anxiety. There is no significant difference (p valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.228) between anxiety and depression in patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°53), general public (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°97), medical personnel (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°103), and support workers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°65). Females reported higher scores on the GAD-7 and the BIPQ, reduced communication with family and friends appeared to be a risk factor for clinically significant anxiety and depression. There were no significant differences in anxiety and depression across populations explored in this study, but females had higher anxiety and illness perception than males, and effective communication may help improve mental health.","Li, Li, Li, Tian, Huang, Wang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04307-1","20221104","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40320,""
"Sustainability of the Collaborative Chronic Care Model in Outpatient Mental Health Teams Three Years Post-Implementation: A Qualitative Analysis","Our goal was to investigate the sustainability of care practices that are consistent with the collaborative chronic care model (CCM) in nine outpatient mental health teams located within US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers, three to four years after the completion of CCM implementation. We conducted qualitative interviews (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30) with outpatient mental health staff from each of the nine teams. We based our directed content analysis on the six elements of the CCM. We found variable sustainability of CCM-based care processes across sites. Some care processes, such as delivery of evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) and use of measurement-based care (MBC) to guide clinic decision-making, were robustly maintained or even expanded within participating teams. In contrast, other care processes-which had in some cases been developed with considerable effort-had not been sustained. For example, care manager roles were diminished in scope or eliminated completely in response to workload pressures, frontline care needs, or the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, processes for engaging Veterans more fully in decision-making had generally been scaled back. Leadership support in the form of adequate team staffing and time to conduct team meetings were seen as crucial for sustaining CCM-consistent care. Given the potential impact of leadership turnover on sustainability in mental health, future efforts to implement CCM-based mental health care should strive to involve multiple leaders in implementation and sustainment efforts, lest one key departure undo years of implementation work. Our results also suggest that implementing CCM processes may best be conceptualized as a partnership across multiple levels of medical center leadership.","Miller, Kim, Connolly, Spitzer, Brown, Bailey, Weaver, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-022-01231-0","20221104","Collaborative care; Implementation; Sustainability; Team-based care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40321,""

"Effects of forest environment (Shinrin-yoku/Forest bathing) on health promotion and disease prevention -the Establishment of ""Forest Medicine""","Humans have enjoyed forest environments for ages because of the quiet atmosphere, beautiful scenery, mild climate, pleasant aromas, and fresh, clean air. In Japan, since 2004, serial studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of forest environments (Forest bathing/Shinrin-yoku) on human health. My research team has established a new medical science called Forest Medicine. The Forest Medicine is a new interdisciplinary science, belonging to the categories of alternative medicine, environmental medicine and preventive medicine, which studies the effects of forest environments (Forest bathing/Shinrin-yoku) on human health. It has been reported that Forest bathing/Shinrin-yoku has the following beneficial effects on human health:1 Shinrin-yoku increases human natural killer (NK) activity, the number of NK cells, and the intracellular levels of anti-cancer proteins, suggesting a preventive effect on cancers. 2 Shinrin-yoku reduces blood pressure and heart rate showing preventive effect on hypertension and heart diseases. 3 Shinrin-yoku reduces stress hormones, such as urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline and salivary/serum cortisol contributing to stress management. 4 Shinrin-yoku increases the activity of parasympathetic nerves and reduces the activity of sympathetic nerves to stabilize the balance of autonomic nervous system. 5 Shinrin-yoku improve sleep. 6 Shinrin-yoku increases the levels of serum adiponectin and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. 7 In the Profile of Mood States (POMS) test, Shinrin-yoku reduces the scores for anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion, and increases the score for vigor, showing preventive effects on depression. 8 Shinrin-yoku may apply to rehabilitation medicine 9 Shinrin-yoku in city parks also has benefits on human health. 10 Shinrin-yoku may have preventive effect on COVID-19 by boosting immune function and by reducing mental stress.Taken together, these findings suggest that Shinrin-yoku may have potential preventive effects on non-communicable diseases.","Li","https://doi.org/10.1265/ehpm.22-00160","20221103","Blood pressure; Forest Medicine; Forest bathing; Immune function; NK; Nervous system; POMS; Phytoncide; Shinrin-yoku; Stress hormone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40324,""
"Chronic pain: Evidence from the national child development study","Using data from all those born in a single week in 1958 in Britain we track associations between short pain and chronic pain in mid-life (age 44) and subsequent health, wellbeing and labor market outcomes in later life. We focus on data taken at age 50 in 2008, when the Great Recession hit and then five years later at age 55 in 2013 and again at age 62 in 2021 during the Covid pandemic. We find those suffering both short-term and chronic pain at age 44 continue to report pain and poor general health in their 50s and 60s. However, the associations are much stronger for those with chronic pain. Furthermore, chronic pain at age 44 is associated with a range of poor mental health outcomes, pessimism about the future and joblessness at age 55 whereas short-duration pain at age 44 is not. Pain has strong predictive power for pain later in life: pain in childhood predicts pain in mid-life, even when one controls for pain in early adulthood. Pain appears to reflect other vulnerabilities as we find that chronic pain at age 44 predicts whether or not a respondent has Covid nearly twenty years later.","Blanchflower, Bryson","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275095","20221104","Child; Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; Chronic Pain; Child Development; COVID-19; Unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","",40325,""
