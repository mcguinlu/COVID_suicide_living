"Factors affecting the mental health of pregnant women using UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative interview study","Background: People using maternity services in the United Kingdom (UK) have faced significant changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing regulations. We focused on the experiences of pregnant women using UK maternity services during the pandemic and the impact of social distancing rules on their mental health and wellbeing. Methods: We conducted 23 qualitative semi-structured interviews from June 2020 to August 2021, with women from across the UK who experienced a pregnancy during the pandemic. Nineteen women in the study carried their pregnancy to term and four women experienced a miscarriage during the pandemic. Interviews took place remotely over video or telephone call, discussing topics such as mental health during pregnancy and use of UK maternity services. We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyse interview transcripts. Results: We generated six higher order themes: (1) Some pregnancy discomforts alleviated by social distancing measures, (2) The importance of relationships that support coping and adjustment, (3) Missed pregnancy and parenthood experiences, (4) The mental health consequences of birth partner and visitor restrictions, (5) Maternity services under pressure, and (6) Lack of connection with staff. Many participants felt a sense of loss over a pregnancy experience that differed so remarkably to what they had expected because of the pandemic. Supportive relationships were important to help cope with pregnancy and pandemic-related changes; but feelings of isolation were compounded for some participants because opportunities to build social connections through face-to-face parent groups were unavailable. Participants also described feeling alone due to restrictions on partners being present when accessing UK maternity services. Conclusions: Our findings highlight some of the changes that may have affected pregnant womens mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced social support and being unable to have a partner or support person present during maternity service use were the greatest concerns reported by women in this study, as this absence removed a protective buffer in times of uncertainty and distress. This suggests that the availability of a birth partner or support person must be prioritised wherever possible to protect the mental health of women experiencing pregnancy and miscarriage in times of pandemics.","Alison Ruth McKinlay; Daisy Fancourt; Alexandra Burton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.20.21265279","20211020","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-21","",18940,""
"Comparing mortality from covid-19 to mortality due to overdose: A micromort analysis","Objective To compare the mortality risk due to covid-19 with death due to overdose in British Columbia, Canada. The opioid epidemic was declared a public health emergency in 2016. Methods Mortality risk was calculated in micromorts with covid-19 data for Januaryâ€“October 2020, derived from the BC center for Disease Control, and illicit drug toxicity deaths for January 2010â€“September 2020, derived from the BC Coroners Service. Age-stratified covid-19 incidence and deaths per 100,000 population and age-stratified illicit drug toxicity death rates per 100,000 population were calculated. A micromort is a unit of risk equivalent to a one-in-a-million chance of death. Results During the covid-19 pandemic, illicit drug toxicity deaths reached 1.0 micromorts per day, representing an increase of 0.5 micromorts per day relative to 2019 rates. In comparison, covid-19 mortality risk was 0.05 micromorts per day among individuals from the general population living in British Columbia and 21.1 micromorts per day among those infected with covid-19. Covid-related mortality risk was significantly lower among individuals aged <60 years, relative to older adults, whereas drug toxicity-related mortality was highest for individuals aged 30â€“59 years. Conclusions The mortality associated with covid-19 is apparent and distributed unevenly across subpopulations. The mortality due to overdose has increased during covid-19 and exceeds mortality due to covid-19. Our results instantiate the triple threat caused by covid-19 (i.e., public health crisis, economic crisis and mental health crisis) and quantitatively highlight the externality of increased mortality due to deaths of despair in response to public health efforts to reduce covid-related mortality.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.059","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-21","",18941,""

"Questions pratiques en immunothÃ©rapie dans le cancer bronchique non Ã  petites cellules: dose, durÃ©e, rythme de traitement, rÃ©introduction: Practical issues in immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: dose, duration, rate of treatment, reintroduction","Lâ€™immunothÃ©rapie a dÃ©montrÃ© une efficacitÃ© dans le cancer du poumon non Ã  petites cellules (CBNPC) en premiÃ¨re ligne de traitement mais aussi pour les lignes ultÃ©rieures La question de la durÃ©e de lâ€™immunothÃ©rapie est encore discutÃ©e, compte tenu des contraintes liÃ©es Ã  la poursuite du traitement, de la toxicitÃ© Ã©ventuelle et du coÃ»t de maintien de lâ€™immunothÃ©rapie jusquâ€™Ã  progression de la maladie. Lâ€™utilisation de doses standardisÃ©es (flat dose) sâ€™est imposÃ©e pour la plupart des molÃ©cules ayant pour consÃ©quence une facilitÃ© dâ€™utilisation mais Ã©galement un risque de surdosage et de surcoÃ»t. Les travaux de pharmacologie ont permis un espacement des perfusions particuliÃ¨rement utile en pÃ©riode de pandÃ©mie. Lâ€™immunothÃ©rapie nâ€™est pas associÃ©e Ã  un sur-risque dâ€™infection sÃ©vÃ¨re Ã  COVID19 mais la vaccination Ã  ARNm est indiquÃ©e chez les patients avant ou en cours de traitement. Une troisiÃ¨me injection peut Ãªtre discutÃ©e dans certains cas. La rÃ©introduction de lâ€™immunothÃ©rapie aprÃ¨s une toxicitÃ© reste une question dÃ©licate Ã  aborder en RCP dÃ©diÃ©e. Â© 2021 SPLF. PubliÃ© par Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits rÃ©servÃ©s. Immunotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line setting as well as in further lines. Duration of immunotherapy is still discussed, taking into account constraints related to long term efficacy, toxicity and cost. Use of standardized flat dose became a standard. It is more flexible but also associated with a higher risk of overdose and overcost Pharmacological studies allow us to space infusions of immunotherapy. It was particularly useful in the period of pandemic. Immunotherapy is not associated with a higher risk of severe COVID19 infection. RNAm based vaccination is recommended in patients before or during treatment. A third dose can be discussed for some patients. Rechallenge of immunotherapy following previous toxicity is tricky and should be discussed in MTB. Â© 2021 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

"Stress detection and monitoring based on low-cost mobile thermography","The high level of stress in modern life is one of the huge problems of the 21st century society, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the pandemic, the need for inexpensive, portable and easy-to-use health monitoring tools (mental and physical) has increased. Of particular importance here is mobile (smartphone) thermography, as it enables the initial detection and self-control of stress, which being intensified nowadays, is the cause of many diseases, depression and health problems. The smartphone thermal imaging camera responds to the strict sanitary guidelines, offering contact-free, painless and non-invasive operation. Additionally, it is included in the group of low-cost solutions available for home use. It is an alternative to commonly used (often expensive and unavailable to everyone): EMG, ECG, EEG, GSR or other high-cost stress detection tools. Thermal imaging by analyzing abnormalities or temperature changes allows for detection application. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine the possibilities of a low-budget mobile thermal imaging camera in detecting stress, detecting and analyzing stress by identifying the characteristics of psychophysiological signals with the individual characteristics of the participants, along with the correlation. The participantsâ€™ reactions to the film introducing stress tension up to the climax of the action were recorded thermographically. Data was processed in OpenCV. In the usual observation, stress often remained unnoticed. However, the thermographic analysis provided detailed information on the impact of the filmâ€™s stressful situation on the participants, with the possibility of distinguishing the stages of stress. The results of the preliminary pilot study were presented, which indicated the variability of temperature and heart rate as important indicators of stress â€“ with the simultaneous significance of individual characteristics of the participant. Smartphone stress thermography is a promising method of monitoring human stress, especially at home.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.08.113","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-21","",18947,""
