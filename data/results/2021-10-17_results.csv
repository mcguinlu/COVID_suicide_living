"Psychiatric Manifestations and Associated Risk Factors among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Edo State, Nigeria","Objective The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had devastating effects globally. These effects are likely to result in mental health problems at different levels. Although studies have reported the mental health burden of the pandemic on the general population and frontline health workers, the impact of the disease on the mental health of patients in COVID-19 treatment and isolation centres have been understudied in Africa. We estimated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors in hospitalized persons with COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 489 patients with COVID-19 at the three government-designated treatment and isolation centres in Edo State, Nigeria. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) tool were used to assess depression and anxiety respectively. Binary logistic regression was applied to determine risk factors of depression and anxiety. Results Of the 489 participants, 49.1% and 38.0% had depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and combination of both were 16.2%, 12.9% and 9.0% respectively. Moderate-severe symptoms of COVID-19, [&ge;]14 days in isolation, worrying about the outcome of infection and stigma increased the risk of having depression and anxiety. Additionally, being separated/divorced increased the risk of having depression and having comorbidity increased the risk of having anxiety. Conclusion A substantial proportion of our participants experienced depression, anxiety and a combination of both especially in those who had the risk factors we identified. The findings underscore the need to address these risk factors early in the course of the disease and integrate mental health interventions into COVID-19 management guidelines.","Esther O Okogbenin; Omonefe J Seb-Akahomen; Osahogie I.

"Anti-inflammatory and antipyretic analgesics and drugs used in gout","Studies were directed at advancing treatment of acetaminophen overdose. A prospective observational study demonstrated that acetaminophen-protein adduct levels were useful in predicting development of hepatotoxicity following acetaminophen overdose. A small study showed that 4-methylpyrazole decreased generation of toxic acetaminophen metabolites. This supports continued investigation of 4-methylpyrazole in treatment of acetaminophen overdose. This year witnessed effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on global health. A retrospective study examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on deliberate self-harm cases (DSH) reporting to the emergency department. DSH cases increased and specifically overdoses of acetaminophen and NSAIDs. NSAIDs are associated with both cardiovascular (CV) and bleeding events. A nationwide cohort study was conducted in non-western patients to identify the association of NSAID use and thromboembolic CV and clinically relevant bleeding events in patients post-myocardial infarction. NSAID use was compared to non-use, and subgroup analysis investigated risks with specific NSAIDs. NSAID use was associated with increased risk for CV and bleeding events in the overall population. Three cases were published in which authors believed to be presenting the first reports of the identified condition. One case was drug-induced aseptic meningitis with patch testing confirmation of the causative agent, ibuprofen. Second, a report reviewed a case of naproxen poisoning resulting in severe hypocoagulability. Third, a presumed first report of acute interstitial nephritis with renal cortical necrosis secondary to naproxen use was described. Studies of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat indicated that the agents do not differ in their association with adverse cardiovascular events.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.seda.2021.08.011","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-17","",18901,""
