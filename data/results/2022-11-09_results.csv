"Too much is too much: influence of former stress levels on food cravings and weight gain during the COVID-19 period","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social restrictions had an extensive effect on peoples lives. Increased rates of weight gain were widely reported, as were declines in the general populations mental health, including increases in perceived stress. This study investigated whether higher perceived levels of stress during the pandemic were associated with greater levels of weight gain, and whether poor prior levels of mental health were a factor in higher levels of both stress and weight gain during the pandemic. Underlying changes in eating behaviours and dietary consumption were also investigated. During January-February 2021, UK adults (n=179) completed a self-report online questionnaire to measure perceived levels of stress and changes (current versus pre-COVID-19 restrictions) in weight, eating behaviours, dietary consumption, and physical activity. Participants also reported on how COVID-19  had impacted their lives and their level of mental health prior to the pandemic. Participants with higher levels of stress were significantly more likely to report weight gain and twice as likely to report increased food cravings and comfort food consumption (OR=2.3 and 1.9-2.5, respectively). Participants reporting an increase in food cravings were 6-11 times  more likely to snack and to have increased consumption of high sugar or processed foods  (OR=6.3, 11.2 and 6.3, respectively). Females reported a far greater number of COVID-19 enforced lifestyle changes and both female gender and having poor mental health prior to the pandemic were significant predictors of higher stress and weight gain during the pandemic. Although COVID-19 and the pandemic restrictions were unprecedented, this study suggests that understanding and addressing the disparity of higher perceived stress in females and individuals previous levels of mental health, as well as the key role of food cravings, is key for successfully addressing the continuing societal issue of weight gain and obesity.","Rachel  Louise Granger; Hans  Peter Kubis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.06.22282004","20221108","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40347,""
"Changes in Alcohol Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Wisconsin","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic increased stress levels broadly in the general population. Patterns of alcohol consumption are known to increase in times of increased stress like natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and economic turmoil. Wisconsin is an important place to study changes in alcohol consumption because it is one of the heaviest-drinking states in the United States. The primary aim of this study is to identify changes in alcohol use at three distinct timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic in a statewide sample. Methods: An online survey was sent to 5,502 previous Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) participants to ask about a wide range of topics related to COVID-19. The timepoints were taken May through June 2020 (Wave 1), January to February 2021 (Wave 2), and June 2021 (Wave 3) The sample included 1,290, 1,868, and 1,585 participants in each of the three waves respectively. Changes in alcohol consumption (whether they drank more, about the same, or less) were examined by race, age, gender, educational attainment, annual income, anxiety and depression status, remote work status, whether the participant experienced employment changes due to COVID-19, and whether there were children present in the home. Within-wave univariate changes in alcohol consumption were evaluated by demographics using a chi-squared test. Results: In all three waves, those with anxiety, a bachelors degree or higher, two younger age groups, and those with children in the home were significantly more likely to increase alcohol consumption. Those reporting depression, those in the highest income quartile, and those working remotely were more likely to report increased drinking in the first two surveys, but not in the third survey. Participants reporting changes in employment due to COVID-19 were more likely to increase drinking in the first survey only. Non-white participants were more likely to report decreased drinking in the first survey only. Conclusions: There may be subpopulations in Wisconsin at higher risk for the negative effects of heavy drinking during the pandemic like those with anxiety, those with children in the home, those with a bachelors degree or higher, and those in younger age groups, as these groups had consistently higher alcohol use that did not subside 15 months after lockdowns began.","Rachel Pomazal; Laura McCulley; Amy Schultz; Noah Stafford; Mikayla Schowalter; Kristen Malecki","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.07.22282029","20221107","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40348,""
"Mental health and spiritual well-being in humanitarian crises: the role of faith communities providing spiritual and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic","Across the globe, peopleâ€™s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying lockdowns highlighted, and continued to stress, the relevance of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in responding to crises, including in low-income and emergency settings. They also demonstrated the importance of faith practices and communities of faith as core needs and important coping mechanisms for many affected people in times of crisis. Drawing on data collected by World Vision International, the worldâ€™s largest child-focused humanitarian and development organisation, in the course of its response to COVID-19 in 70 different countries, this article explores the ways in which faith groups and faith leaders responded to the perceived needs of their communities. While keen to offer psychosocial support to people suffering anxiety and fear in the context of the crisis, this has often been integrated with spiritual support. Analysing their work from the framework of a rights-based approach to mental health, we conclude that they did contribute to psychosocial support through their MHPSS, in part through their provision of spiritual care. However, spiritual well-being should not be conflated with psychosocial well-being. While faith groups play an important role in MHPSS, their primary role is to offer spiritual care.","Goodwin, Ellen, Kraft, Kathryn","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41018-022-00127-w","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of International Humanitarian Action; 7(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40349,""
"A hopeful manifesto for a more humane academia","This article discusses working conditions and poor mental health of educational personnel. This essay is focused on a 2021 Education Support report surveyed 2,046 university staff: 53% showed signs of probable depression, 62% regularly worked more than 40 hours per week and 59% hesitated to get support for fear of appearing 'weak'. The overall picture is of considerable overwork and poor mental health and support. It gets worse. In 2010, the UK University and College Union conducted a survey in which 47% reported being bullied at work in the last five years;71% reported witnessing bullying. A decade later, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged, staff members reported feeling pressured to teach in person. It gets worse. Unsurprisingly, such pressure disproportionally fell on the more precarious: those on casual teaching-only contracts, those clinically vulnerable and those with greater career concerns.

"Guest editorial","In mainstream mental health services, there was a sudden move from face-to-face work to looking at new ways of working so that we could restore services as soon as possible. The problem for most services is that waiting lists were on hold for a while, then we had staff absences due to COVID resulting in a build of the waiting time as is common in all health services. In our service, we also had data previously collected on mental health and wellbeing assessment such as with the Psychological Therapies Outcome Scale ID II (Vlissides et al., 2017), which could be used to evaluate outcomes.

"Mental health literacy and young people","This book examines creative approaches to mental health literacy. In the wake of COVID-19, and the onslaught of major war breaking out once again in Europe, the mental health of young people is at stake, with increasing numbers struggling with anxiety, depression, and other psychological challenges. It provides an accessible, lively, and creative entry point to mental health literacy and young people at a time of unprecedented challenges to their psychological health, with increased uncertainty about physical survival, rising cases of anxiety, depression, stress, and loneliness, all compounded by hampered social connectedness, losses in educational attainment, and concerns for future employment opportunities. The book introduces the reader unfamiliar with this concept to the ways that the creative arts not only contribute to positive mental health, but may also be the best chance to advance understanding of and responses to mental health challenges. The first part focuses on improving upstream knowledge about and responses to the difficult transitional period young people aged 17-24 face to reduce or counter the development of specific mental health disorders downstream. The second part examines downstream mental health literacy when particular disorders are already part of the lives of young people given that 50% of mental disorders begin by age 14 with 75% beginning by age 26. The book concludes with a short review of creative and coproductive strategies for advancing mental health literacy with and for young people upstream and downstream. It should be of interest to young people in secondary and higher education, parents, teachers, caregivers, coaches, clergy, and more. It will also be of interest to undergraduates, postgraduates, academic researchers, clinicians, educators, charitable bodies and the wider public interested in the mental health of young people and/or the application of creative practices to enhance health and wellbeing.

"The use of online-based acceptance and commitment therapy (e-act) to improve the psychological wellbeing among university students","A notable deterioration in mental health, especially anxiety and depression, was seen among university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, immediate preventive action is required to remedy this concern by using the online-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (e-ACT). The effectiveness of this e-ACT on psychological flexibility and mental wellbeing was assessed among 52 Malaysian undergraduate university students aged between 18 and 23 years old during the pandemic. Based on a small group approach, participants received two online e-ACT sessions (a total of 5 hours). The paired sample t-tests result showed a significant improvement on mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and wellbeing among the students. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test showed a significant decrease in depression, anxiety, and stress. These findings support the use of e-ACT mental health education to promote psychological wellbeing among university students. Further empirical studies are needed to test the effectiveness of e-ACT on psychological flexibility and mental wellbeing.

"Adaptation of a Transdiagnostic Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Adolescents with Comorbid Mental Health Conditions and High Risk Behavior","Millions of adolescents seek treatment for mental health concerns and high-risk behaviors (e.g., suicidality, non-suicidal self-injury, substance use) each year. Use of services for mental health crises have only increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based treatments that can be readily employed in community settings are sorely needed to address the growing adolescent mental health crisis. To be most effective, they must be able to accommodate the common comorbidity and high-risk behaviors present among the treatment-seeking adolescent population, and be designed in a manner that can be readily adopted by clinicians that serve these youth within community-based organizations. Following the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework, we describe the adaptation and pre-implementation process of a transdiagnostic and modular cognitive-behavioral treatment, which integrates motivational interviewing and dialectical behavior therapy techniques, to address multiple adolescent mental health conditions and high-risk behaviors. Using a mixed-methods design, we collected data from community clinicians and/or other stakeholders on perceptions of the training protocol and treatment manual, self-efficacy and knowledge in manual use, use of modules with clients, and treatment adherence, to inform our REP efforts around modifications to the training and treatment manual. We present these data and describe modifications made using the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications (FRAME) to evidence-based interventions. Overall, data support our intensive training model and transdiagnostic treatment for use by clinicians in community settings. Stakeholder engagement, adaptations to the training and treatment materials, and participation in post-training consultation, appeared to facilitate successful pre-implementation efforts.

"Psychological distress and its correlation with weight change in young adults in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aims to investigate the correlation between psychological distress and weight change in Malaysian young adults after the pandemic-led lockdowns. Socio-demographics, body height, body weight during the Movement Control Order 3.0 (MCO 3.0), and post-lockdown body weight (as of January 2022) were self-reported by the young adults. Psychological distress was assessed using a validated 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Of the 536 young adults, 54.1% experienced mild to extremely severe anxiety, 47.0% suffered mild to extremely severe depression, and 30.0% experienced mild to extremely severe stress in the post-lockdown pandemic phase. In reference to absolute weight change, 50.6% of the young adults gained weight due to confinement, with an average weight gain of 3.41Â Â±Â 2.49 kg. Conversely, 32.0% of the young adults had a lighter weight during the MCO 3.0 than before, with an average weight loss of 3.96Â Â±Â 2.76 kg. Additionally, the trajectory in body weight was also expressed in relative weight change. Findings revealed that 23.1% of the young adults gained weight in the post-lockdown pandemic phase, with an average relative weight gain of 9.04Â Â±Â 3.90%. On the contrary, approximately one-fifth (17.4%) of the young adults lost weight, with an average relative weight loss of -8.57Â Â±Â 2.79%. There were no significant correlations (p&gt;Â 0.05) between depression, anxiety, and stress with absolute or relative weight change, even after controlling for the socio-demographic variation among young adults. The federal government of Malaysia should take necessary actions to alleviate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and reiterate the importance of sustaining a healthy body weight in young adults.

"Life, after Life: Textile Crafts in India and Communities of Practice","The Special Issue was conceptualized in/from India because of and at the height of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 that overturned the equilibrium of lives and livelihoods in every community in the world, with the second wave in 2021 being especially tragic for India. As some of us debated the consequences of lock down, virtual commuting, and work from home on mental health, we also remained acutely aware that this opportunity was not available to all. The diminishing livelihood of people, whose domestic and work lives were structured around organized labor networks involving on-site, collaborative work, with very specialized equipment and materials, was borne out in stark relief. India saw one the â€œlargest human displacement that the Indian subcontinent has seen since the India-Pakistan Partition in 1947,â€ as people involved in contract work (also known as waged labor) in cities were abruptly laid off, and many embarked upon very difficult journeys (often unassisted by any private or governmental aid) to their hometowns, seeking refuge, safety, and above all, dignity (Bansal 2021, 54). At the same time, people and communities engaged in various creative industries, especially traditional textile crafts in India, struggled to make ends meet. As textile goods and services were not considered essential services, the textile industry at large as well as the associated artisanal communities were adversely affected (Kanupriya 2021).","Chatterjee, Anuradha","https://doi.org/10.1080/14759756.2021.1993558","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Textile : the Journal of Cloth and Culture; 20(3):245-251, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40356,""
"â€œWaiting out the day, not living, not funâ€: a qualitative investigation of childrenâ€™s experiences of school closures due to COVID-19","Early school leaving (ESL) is considered a significant societal issue globally due to the negative effect on young peopleâ€™s health, affect, and quality of life. Continued absenteeism is a risk factor for ESL. This study aimed to explore Irish childrenâ€™s health and wellbeing experiences during school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These children were all considered at risk of ESL by their schools. Semi-structured interviews, adopting a â€œwrite, draw or tellâ€ method, were conducted with ten children ages 9 - 13 years old. The study used an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodology. The loss of routine, social ties, and sense of success and belonging experienced in schools had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of the children. They experienced adverse mental health effects, including anxiety, depression, anger, and loneliness. Their physical health and wellbeing were impacted by changes to sleep behavior, physical activity levels, boredom, and gaming usage. Children remain very vulnerable to the impact of school closures, contact restrictions, and living with the pandemic. Recommendations include improving online resources for young people and developing in-school programs to improve sleep hygiene.

"Five spiritually based tools for clinical practice during challenging, stressful, and apocalyptic times","Stress in America and across the globe is high with so many ongoing societal problems. The COVID-19 global pandemic along with accelerating climate change, increasing economic instability and inequality, divisive politics and an increase in authoritarianism, racism, and discrimination against those who are oppressed and marginalized are just a few current examples. Evidence suggests that mental health problems and demand for services have exploded as well. Psychotherapists who are well versed in spiritual and religious integration in their clinical work can help. While therapists cannot solve the country's and world's numerous problems, they can help their clientele better cope and manage the distress that they experience though highlighting several spiritual and religiously based tools that are commonly available and supported among diverse spiritual and religious traditions. The purpose of this clinical reflection is to encourage clinicians to use five especially relevant spiritual and religious tools with their clientele that include (a) underscoring the sacredness of all;(b) learning to accept others, even with faults;(c) focusing on spiritual modeling;(d) encouraging virtues of forgiveness, kindness, gratitude, and compassion;and (e) incorporating ethics into daily decision-making. A brief explanation of each tool along with clinical case examples are presented here.

"""Complicated grief during COVID-19: An international perspective"": Correction to Khoury et al, 2022","Reports an error in ""Complicated grief during COVID-19: An international perspective"" by Brigitte Khoury, Oscar Barbarin, German Gutierrez, Martina Klicperova-Baker, Prakash Padakannaya and Ava Thompson (International Perspectives in Psychology: Research, Practice, Consultation, 2022, Vol 11[3], 214-221). In the article (https://doi.org/10.1027/2157-3891/a000055) the article incorrectly started with the second part of the Impact and Implications statement. The Impact and Implications statement and the beginning of the article should be as follows in the erratum. (The following  of the original article appeared in record 2022-85486-010.) Cultures across the globe have evolved time-tested rituals to honor those who die and offer solace and support to survivors with the goal of helping them to accept the reality of the death, cope with the feelings of loss, adjust to life without the deceased, and find ways to maintain a connection to the memory of the deceased. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted these rituals and brought significant changes to the way we mourn. Specifically, public health responses to COVID-19 such as social distancing or isolation, delays or cancellations of traditional religious and cultural rituals, and shifts from in-person to online ceremonies have disrupted rituals and thus made it more difficult to access support and complete the psychological tasks typically associated with bereavement. This paper conceptualizes the common bereavement tasks including emotion-focused coping, maintaining a connection to the deceased, disengagement and reframing death and loss, and problem-focused coping. It provides examples of how the COVID-19 pandemic has altered mourning rituals across several cultures and religions and contributed to prolonged grief disorder as defined by the ICD-11 that includes depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress. Early evidence suggested that the suddenness of loss, the social isolation, and the lack of social support often associated with COVID-19-related death are salient risk factors for complicated grief. As a consequence, psychological assessments, grief counseling, and mental health support are needed by families of patients who died from COVID-19. These services must be essential components of any comprehensive public health response to the pandemic.

"When Young Children with Aggression Need Inpatient Level of Care: An Innovative Family-Based Care Pathway on a Child Inpatient Psychiatric Unit","Objectives: Even though young children may be less susceptible to the COVID-19 virus, they are one of the most vulnerable groups in terms of the psychological consequences of this pandemic. As outpatient care is overwhelmed with accommodating their needs, desperate parents have been showing up in local emergency rooms asking for help. Some of the children are admitted to acute inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric units that may be ill-equipped in caring for them. Typically, only specialized clinicians treat young children in outpatient psychiatric clinics. Literature on pathways or programs for young children on inpatient units is lacking. This Workshop will teach participants a new family-based treatment model, including pharmacotherapy strategies, for young children hospitalized psychiatrically with significant behavioral issues. Together with participants, we will discuss implementation of such a program in their respective places of work as well as potential barriers and limitations. Method(s): Our Workshop will consist of 4 main parts: 1) we will outline challenges that inpatient units face in treating young children;2) we will discuss the innovative care pathway for young children that was implemented on our inpatient psychiatric unit;3) we will review pharmacotherapy strategies for young children on the inpatient unit;and 4) we will invite the participants to design treatment plans for a variety of patients using case examples. Result(s): In this Workshop, participants will learn about an innovative family-based care pathway for young children who require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. They will be able to recognize that even young children suffer from severe mental health issues that sometimes require inpatient treatment. At the end of the Workshop, participants will identify behavioral modifications as well as psychopharmacological interventions for young children that can be successfully implemented on child and adolescent inpatient psychiatry units. Conclusion(s): There is a growing need for clinicians who are knowledgeable in acute young child treatments. This Workshop will allow participants to learn from and explore ideas with national experts on how to implement psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic treatment for young children on inpatient units.

"Cbt with Youth: The Essential Changemakers for the Next Normal","Objectives: Waves and surges continue to characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, fueling heightened uncertainty, anxiety, frustration, depression, and other behavioral health complaints. Mounting numbers of distressed young patients and their families are seeking mental health care. Therefore, child and adolescent psychiatrists need to be equipped to deliver as well as train others to implement effective CBT procedures. These goals are the precise foci of this practitioner-friendly Workshop. Method(s): Attendees will acquire the rudiments for delivering essential CBT changemakers when working with young patients and their families. More specifically, the fundamentals for implementing psychoeducational, target monitoring, basic behavioral tasks, cognitive restructuring, and exposure-based procedures will be explained and illustrated. Creative and innovative modifications of traditional techniques will be delineated. The Workshop material will be presented in a highly engaging and interactive manner. CBT skills will be spelled out through detailed didactic presentations augmented by clinical stories, case vignettes, demonstrations of techniques, experiential exercises, eye-catching graphics, and audio/visual recordings. Result(s): Participants will leave the Workshop with multiple psychoeducational, behavioral, cognitive restructuring, and exposure-based techniques for use with diverse patients in multiple settings. Additionally, attendees will gain familiarity with brief measures suitable for treatment planning and outcome evaluation. Conclusion(s): Child and adolescent psychiatrists will become well prepared to meet the need of an ever-increasing clinical caseload and armed with CBT skills to mitigate patients' distress. Accordingly, the Workshop content is completely aligned with the conference focus on translational research aimed toward improving the quality of clinical care delivered to young patients and their families, enriching training, and upgrading service delivery systems.

"An Examination of Electronic Health Records to Understand the Transition from In-Person to Telemental Health Services for Youth in or Adopted From Foster Care","Objectives: Experiences in foster care represent a significant risk factor for the future development of psychopathology, which underscores the need for accessible mental health services. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred additional complications that interfere with treatment utilization, despite a growing need for support. Given the unique needs and experiences of youth in or adopted from foster care, this study compares mental health service utilization before and after the transition to telemental health to investigate if client engagement changed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Using electronic health records, the number of sessions, accumulated session time, and average length of sessions for mental health services were compared across equal time points before and after the transition to telemental health. The analytic sample included 56 clients between the ages of 2 and 22 years (M = 9.89;SD = 4.43). Comparisons were made based on demographics, including age, race, gender, diagnosis, and treatment modality. Result(s): Clients attended a greater number of therapy sessions (p &lt;.01) and had more accumulated session time (p &lt;.05) via telemental health compared to in-person sessions, and telemental health had shorter session length on average (p &lt;.05). Overall, telemental health services were utilized at the same rate across most demographic groups. Female clients attended more total sessions and had more accumulated session time than males. Regarding psychiatric appointments and medication management, the level of engagement in-person maintained during the transition to telemental health. Conclusion(s): Telemental health can serve as a tool to maintain or increase client engagement for youth in or adopted from foster care who are receiving mental health services. Clients were more engaged in mental health services during telemental health compared to in-person, and they appeared to attend more sessions that were shorter in length. The ability for mental health clinics to embrace and adapt technology is critical for ensuring equitable access to care for all youth, especially for vulnerable populations that are at high risk for developing significant mental health problems.

"Tiktok Teens: New Research Reveals How Social Media Affects Mental Health","Objectives: Social media engagement among youth has rapidly become more prevalent and pervasive, particularly with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which time it became the default method of socialization for many. Typical characteristics of social media habits are evolving rapidly along with their effects on mental health, limiting the utility of older data and making an understanding of the latest research invaluable for practitioners. We present novel work by leading researchers documenting patterns and parameters of youth social media engagement and their significance for contemporary psychiatry. Method(s): Important unpublished and newly published studies inform how youth now use social media and how characteristics of the user and their use experiences interact with ramifications for their mental health. These data will be presented in the context of the authors' previous works, and its relevance for clinical care will be highlighted. The presentation will utilize a discussant and online audience polling to elicit questions and comments to support a robust dialogue. Result(s): Initiation of social media at an earlier age (10 years and younger) is significantly associated with problematic and risky digital behaviors, although parental restriction ameliorates some negative effects. Higher levels of adolescent social media engagement involve demands that increase ""digital stress,"" in turn associated with worsening of depressive symptoms over time. Young women who tend toward appearance comparison tend to suffer lowered confidence and increased body dissatisfaction upon viewing idealized images on social media, with related rumination and catastrophizing. Cyberbullying and sexting experiences vary greatly in their impact on youth mental health, with certain populations much more likely to suffer insult to their mental health and well-being. Conclusion(s): It is the duty of child and adolescent psychiatrists to safeguard the mental health of youth in a culture dominated by social media. The latest research regarding changes in social media norms among youth and ramifications for mental health enable us to best evaluate and guide young patients toward positive outcomes.

"Eveningness and Psychiatric Disorders: From Mechanisms to Clinical Care","Objectives: Eveningness is a circadian tendency characterized by a behavioral preference for later sleep and wake timing. It is common in adolescents and is linked with higher risk for mental health disorders. The goal of this session is to enable clinicians to appreciate and address evening preferences of young people with mental health disorders as a means to improve their sleep and mental health. Method(s): This presentation will include an updated literature review and discussion of empirical studies. Result(s): Reut Gruber, PhD, will briefly introduce key concepts related to the associations between mental health disorders and evening preference. Helen Burgess, PhD, will then present the results of the first study of the impact of heavy drinking on light sensitivity and explain their impact on sleep timing. Next, speakers will focus on empirical findings from studies examining the impact of innovative interventions targeting adolescents' eveningness. Lauren Asarnow, PhD, will present findings from clinical studies in which reducing adolescents' eveningness using the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention led to depression improvement in adolescents with an evening circadian preference and MDD. Jaime Zeitzer, PhD, will present findings from studies using passive phototherapy, which involves exposing adolescents to sequences of brief light flashes during sleep to advance the timing of the circadian clock and thereby extend sleep duration. Finally, Robert Levitan, MD, will then extract practical and clinical implications from the above discussions and from his own clinical research in order to guide clinicians aiming to assess and treat comorbid circadian issues in order to optimize mental health care. Conclusion(s): Circadian misalignment is common in adolescents and increases their risk of mental health disorders. Societal changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic have led already-delayed adolescents to be even more prone to extreme eveningness, exacerbating a worrisome and potentially dangerous public health issue affecting those with mental health disorders. This research Symposium will focus on explaining the interrelationship between circadian processes and mental health disorders and will provide practical foundations to support and guide the assessment and treatment of adolescents' evening preferences.

"Simon Wile Symposium: Pivoting in the Pandemic for Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Services","Objectives: The goal of this year's Simon Wile Symposium is to explore innovative strategies to adjust systems and services addressing pediatric mental health challenges in hospital settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric mental health needs climbed significantly during the pandemic, and pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry services (PCLPS) have been at the forefront of addressing these needs in our community health systems. They have also been critical in supporting emotional health and well-being of fellow healthcare workers. National experts will share their innovative approaches to pivoting their PCLPS in their respective institutions and communities during the pandemic. Method(s): Center for Inclusive Child Care (CICC) members were polled on preferred topics in collaborative care and pediatric consultation-liaison to be presented at the upcoming annual meeting. We sought those pursuing innovative strategies that also might be able to provide to a variety of regions and programs. The literature around the PCLPS provision during the pandemic was reviewed, resulting in the current Symposium submission. Result(s): We will share data and strategies to support emotional health and well-being of healthcare workers in a large hospital system in an urban area that was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. We will share data and lessons learned from one PCLPS in utilizing telehealth to support and augment pediatric mental health services in a large children's hospital. We will also review from a multisite survey of pediatric consultation-liaison and other data in comparison to one academic site, reviewing adaptations in services and utilization in children's hospitals across the country. We will present the recipient of the 2022 Simon Wile Award, who will present on a consultation-liaison or collaborative care topic. Conclusion(s): As child and adolescent psychiatrists continue to work to address the significantly increased child mental health needs in communities across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic, programs that have found innovative strategies to address these needs in children's hospitals and large health systems can help us learn how to respond to similar public health challenges in the future. Our speakers will share how child and adolescent psychiatrists can be at the forefront of meeting public health challenges now and in the future.

"MOBILITY: Lessons Learned From a Large Pragmatic Pediatric Psychiatry Trial Conducted Before and During COVID-19","Objectives: There is a dearth of data regarding the design and implementation of pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry and a need to educate child and adolescent psychiatrists about PCTs. We exemplify the differences, advantages, and challenges in designing and conducting a randomized, large pragmatic trial in child and adolescent psychiatry, including the adjustments needed due to the pandemic. Method(s): Metformin for overweight and OBese chILdren with bIpolar spectrum disorders Treated with second-generation antipsYchotics (MOBILITY) is a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded, large PCT that compares the effectiveness of metformin (MET) and a simple healthy lifestyle intervention (LIFE) vs LIFE alone that focuses on patient-centered outcomes in real-world community mental health settings in the Greater Cincinnati and New York regions. Enrolled patients are 8 to 19 years old, diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorders, overweight, or obese, and treated with second-generation antipsychotics. Each participant undergoes 2 years of follow-up assessments, with the primary outcome timepoint being at 6 months. MOBILITY seeks to inform decisions made by clinicians and patients about MET and LIFE in the overall randomized groups and relevant subgroups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PCORI supported a COVID enhancement supplement to MOBILITY (MOBILITY-TEACH), focusing on the effects of the pandemic on the MOBILITY cohort. Result(s): Since study inception in September 2015, there were 1624 subjects across approximately 50 sites who have been enrolled and 1555 who have been randomized. Analyzable 6-month data are available in 1139 patients, and 2-year data are available in 665 patients. Details about the design, implementation, and adaptation of the trial conduct before and during the pandemic, use of remote recruitment and assessment, and effects on recruitment and retention will be presented. Conclusion(s): Current best evidence from traditional explanatory trials is often not perceived by decision makers as relevant to clinical practice. PCTs have the advantage of broad inclusion and minimal exclusion criteria, enhancing external validity. MOBILITY highlights how conducting a multisite, patient-centered pragmatic trial is different from an explanatory trial and what adaptations are needed during a pandemic.

"The social determinants of migrant and refugee children's mental health: Grounding advocacy and care","Objectives: The objectives are to: 1) summarize the available evidence regarding the social determinants of migrant and refugee children's mental health;2) describe rapid shifts in the resettlement contexts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing social dynamics in North America and Europe;and 3) discuss implications for advocacy and care. Method(s): A review of the epidemiological and social science literature over the past 2 decades on the mental health and well-being of migrant and refugee children revealed reproducible evidence associating host-country characteristics and migrant-group profiles. This presentation will adopt a systemic perspective and highlight the viewpoints of migrant and refugee children, families, and their host communities. Result(s): These results illustrate that fleeing war and persecution constitutes a risk factor for mental illness in children and youth;however, the impact of migration varies as a function of complex relations between the migrant and refugee groups and their host communities. Over the past 2 decades, the rise in xenophobia in North America and Europe, associated with mounting uncertainties and increased social inequalities, has aggrieved the living environments of migrant and refugee children. There has been an upsurge in discrimination and politicized bullying along racial and ethnic lines. The evidence about majority-minorities inequities during the pandemic have fueled psychological distress in youth and families, mobilized community resilience, and heightened distrust toward healthcare providers. Conclusion(s): A coalition of practitioners working with migrant and refugee children and youth is warranted to restore safe, welcoming environments for our families facing social adversity settling into new communities. A multifactorial perspective, with direct engagement of communities, and training of mental health professionals may increase cultural sensitivity and help to restore trust toward healthcare providers.

"Supporting the Mental Health Needs of Unaccompanied Children in THE Office of Refugee Resettlement Care","Objectives: Participants will become familiar with the Mental and Behavioral Health Services Team in the Unaccompanied Minors Program in the Office of Refugee and Resettlement (ORR). Participants will be able to identify the challenges in delivering mental health care to a large, transient, population of children exposed to significant trauma, who arrive in the United States without a parent or legal guardian. Participants will learn ways to become involved in the care of migrant children. Method(s): This presentation will describe the mission of the Mental and Behavioral Health Services Team in the Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children (UC) in the ORR. The presenters will share information about the perils of the journey to the United States, the care of migrant children after referral from border control until re-unification with sponsors, and the logistical hurdles in identifying sponsors and establishing ongoing care after reunification or long-term foster care placement. We will discuss the challenges of delivering preventative and clinical mental health services during COVID-19, during large influxes of children, and in unique populations such as during the Afghanistan evacuation. Finally, we will discuss ways in which we are continuously improving our program with partners in academic and governmental agencies. Result(s): Between January 2021 and February 2022, over 150,000 UCs were referred to ORR care. While awaiting reunification with an identified sponsor, the majority of the children are cared for in over 200 state-licensed shelters scattered throughout the continental United States. The medical teams are charged with providing for their physical and mental health. The mental health team guides the care of these children through various methods, including the monitoring of documentation and consultation with care programs, ORR colleagues, and community mental health providers. Conclusion(s): Children who arrive in the United States without parents/guardians present with unique mental health needs. Cultural sensitivity and trauma-informed approaches to care are essential in meeting these needs. ORR continues to evolve to meet these challenges and invites child and adolescent psychiatrists in the community to engage with this population. IMM, SP, TRA Copyright Â© 2022","Ward, A.

"Hypothesis-Free: What We Can Learn About Mental Health From Person-Centered Analyses","Objectives: Person-centered analytic methods, such as latent profile analysis (LPA), can be used to uncover latent (or unobserved) groups within heterogeneous mental health symptom data. Participants in this seminar will learn: 1) the basics of LPA;2) LPA application to understand transdiagnostic symptoms in ASD and ADHD;and 3) LPA application to identify children and youth for mental health service referral during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): For ASD and ADHD profiles, data were collected through the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Network (POND;N = 634) and 4 symptom indicators (inattention, hyperactivity, social-communication, restricted/repetitive behaviors/interests) were used to identify profiles. For mental health profiles, data were collected through the Ontario COVID-19 and Kids Mental Health Collaborative (N = 1696) and 5 symptom domains (depression, anxiety, irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity) were used to identify profiles. Result(s): LPA identified 6 transdiagnostic symptom profiles in ASD and ADHD. LPA identified 5 profiles in mental health symptoms in children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 of which had elevated transdiagnostic symptoms indicated for referral: 23.1% with elevated depression and anxiety;14.7% with elevated inattention, hyperactivity, and depression;and 9.4% with elevated symptoms in all 5 domains. Conclusion(s): LPA is an effective method to identify profiles, or unmeasured groups, of participants who share similar symptoms within a larger, heterogenous sample. Person-centered approaches are meant to be hypothesis generating to compliment traditional analytic methods. DAM, R, PSP Copyright Â© 2022","Cost, K.

"Social Media Contagion: A Parallel Pandemic?","Objectives: This session aims to facilitate the following learning objectives: 1) to review the literature about mental health contagion and compare and contrast the phenomena we are seeing currently with tics, ASD, and dissociative identity disorder (to name a few) with suicide and self-harm contagion;and 2) to share our clinical experiences with these phenomena, identify the gaps in our knowledge and training, and propose next steps for child and adolescent psychiatrists. Method(s): Gisela Sandoval, MD, PhD, will discuss the history of somatic psychiatric symptom contagion before social media. She will discuss specific examples such as St. Vitus dance and discuss how a shared interpretation was central to the phenomenon. Latoya Frolov, MD, MPH, will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorders in children and adolescents with a special focus on functional movement disorders. Bonny Patel, MD, will discuss the risk factors for contagion of psychiatric symptoms. She will discuss predisposing traits, states, and precipitating factors. Jane Harness, DO, will discuss the role of social media in present-day contagion phenomenon, with a special focus on sick-role subculture on TikTok. Tareq Yaqub, MD, will discuss our gaps in knowledge about media-facilitated contagion and the future roles for the child and adolescent psychiatrist at the advocacy, consultant, and political levels when it comes to adolescent social media use. Result(s): Attendees will learn about psychiatric contagion phenomenon and clinical evaluation including risk factors, and be invited to think about our gaps in knowledge and future roles as child and adolescent psychiatrists.

"A Relational Mindfulness Intervention Delivered to Parents and Caregivers in an Early Learning Center: Strategies to Enhance Community Engagement in Community Mental Health Services","Objectives: A growing national mental health crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has disproportionately impacted Black and Brown communities. This crisis is deepened by the shortage of mental health clinicians of color and of clinicians using culturally responsive, healing-centered approaches to care. There is a pressing need for innovative approaches to providing mental health support in community-based settings to populations of color. This presentation describes how a relational mindfulness program serving primarily Black caregivers in an early learning center in Washington, DC, uses a healing-centered engagement (HCE) framework, equity-centered community design (ECCD), and community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to promote well-being, build authentic relationships with families, and design equitable, community-centered interventions in a virtual environment. The presentation demonstrates how community mindfulness facilitators can help fill gaps in care, improve trust in mental health professionals, and enhance care utilization. Method(s): The presentation describes: relevant frameworks and terminology;an overview of the sociocultural context;details of how equity-centered design thinking can be used to improve community engagement and innovate on research methodology;data derived from key-informant interviews and feedback from both community members and community partner organizations;aspects of program development, implementation, and sustainability;and a detailed account of the lessons learned. Result(s): Attendees at this session can expect to increase their knowledge of the benefits of a relational mindfulness program grounded in Black culture, liberatory practice, and HCE and CBPR principles and approaches, emphasizing the promise of these approaches for reducing disparities in mental health care. Conclusion(s): Experienced community mindfulness facilitators, grounded in equity-centered approaches, are viable paraprofessional supports to help mitigate the mental health needs in communities of color impacted by mental health disparities. Enhanced training and employment pathways for meditation teachers are needed to meet the growing demand for culturally attuned mental health supports in communities of color.

"Case Presentation Theme - ""I Cannot be Loved Unless I'm Special""","Objectives: This section aims to present a clinical case to illustrate the art of medicine and to portray a more personal lens with the audience in working with an Asian American (AA) youth struggling with an eating disorder. The case will aim to bridge the practice gap in comfort and cultural humility in working with AA youths with eating disorders. Method(s): We will present a clinical case of a 13-year-old Chinese American female who was born and raised in Hong Kong and immigrated in the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and was hospitalized and subsequently followed up with outpatient mental health treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN). Result(s): The patient (G) and her family had no experience with mental health treatment until she was first hospitalized for AN. She was also diagnosed with MDD with suicidal ideation, and generalized anxiety disorder. G started weekly therapy with family-based treatment and pharmacotherapy sessions. She struggled with her eating disorder but did make gradual progress in weight restoration. She frequently experienced emotional dysregulation and also reported feeling ""tired"" and would nod off. With treatment, G became more aware of her body and gradually more comfortable sharing underlying thoughts and feelings of being unloved by her parents and herself, which she regulated by her drive for perfection and thinness. She shared about how her Asian parents were uncomfortable with emotions. The role of Asian cultural collectivistic values affected G's clinical presentation and treatment, including values on family cohesion and interdependence, self-control and personal discipline, an emphasis on educational achievement, filial piety, and the use of shame for behavioral control. Conclusion(s): G initially experienced a fragmented sense of self, within one's community, family, and oneself, through her bicultural identity as an AA youth. Through treatment, G was more able to experience the world with a sense of agency and was less preoccupied with the drive for ""perfection,"" with slightly more acceptance of herself and others. This case portrays how Asian cultural values with its basis in collectivism can affect clinical presentation and treatment engagement, with challenges and opportunities, for AA youths struggling with an eating disorder.

"Meet Them Where They Are: Using the ECHO Model to Educate and Collaborate With Primary Care Providers Throughout Mississippi","Objectives: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic over 2 years ago has given rise to a new outlook on the need and utilization of distance learning to support child mental health. Such initiatives as the national establishment of Child Psychiatry Access Programs (CPAPs) are poised to address this need by integrating distance-learning models into their telehealth operations to support primary care providers (PCPs) in the identification and management of child mental health concerns. The aim of this presentation is to review how the Child Access to Mental Health and Psychiatry program (CHAMP) in Mississippi, established in Mississippi in 2018 by funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), is answering one of the charges from HRSA to provide educational training opportunities. Method(s): CHAMP initiated the use of the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model to impart knowledge about various topics and issues related to child mental health to PCPs across Mississippi. Outcomes data of ECHO offerings will be reviewed. Result(s): ECHO allows PCPs to learn about a specific topic through a brief didactic presentation followed by a case presentation that promotes collaboration in establishing treatment recommendations from those in the behavioral health field. This presentation will discuss how CHAMP has used the ECHO model with 254 PCPs and learners and will present information on learners' initial satisfaction and program effectiveness in increasing PCP efficacy to treat different aspects of child mental health as well as lessons learned from ECHO implementation and future steps in education. Conclusion(s): In addition to training PCPs, CHAMP seeks to enhance the medical training of psychiatry students and residents by enlisting their involvement in consultation calls during their regular rotation hours performed in the same specialty clinic where CHAMP programmatic operations are based.

"A Decade of Educational Outreach by the MC3 Program: What Has Worked and What We Are Still Learning","Objectives: This presentation aims to describe the development, assessment, and sustainability of educational outreach materials and methods within the Michigan Child Care Collaborative (MC3) platform since its inception over 10 years ago. Method(s): Historical data and current content related to education of providers and trainees enrolled in the MC3 program will be reviewed. Provider feedback is requested after each session, and the frequency of topics requested and presented will be provided. A discussion of modalities that have transitioned over time, such as regular practice case conferences, will also be discussed. Result(s): Over the last 5 years, MC3 has offered several types of educational programming, including: live presentations (n = 81), conferences, provider cafes, and recorded modules (n = 40). Examples of the topics include the following: Depression and Suicide Screening, Caring for Transgender and Gender Questioning Youth, Perinatal Trauma and Stress, and Managing Children's Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Comments and feedback provided following the provision of more tailored, community-specific programming, such as holding a day long Pediatric and Perinatal Conference in person for the Flint Community practices, will be discussed. Data related to provider feedback from live presentations and recorded educational modules will be presented to describe the perceived effectiveness by providers. Additional educational modalities, including the pediatric and perinatal psychopharmacology cards, and resources specific to COVID-19 and antiracism, will also be reviewed within the context of which platforms have been most accessible and sustainable to maintain. Conclusion(s): Providers value multiple modalities/learning platforms to supplement their experiences with individual, patient/case-based consultation. Providers appreciate having access to supplemental educational materials at any time through our web-based platform. Although virtual formatting allows us to extend our reach across the state, there are likely some limitations in terms of fostering more foundational relationships with some of the providers with whom we work. Ongoing community-specific collaborations have offered rich opportunities for collaboration, including work with the Inter-Tribal Health Authority and bidirectional cultural competency training.

"Adapting to Virtual Learning","Objectives: Policymakers across the world have weighed the risks and benefits of keeping school buildings open for in-person learning. In an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic, many communities have opted to move school activities to virtual classrooms. This shift to and from remote learning has dramatic mental health implications for children. In this talk, we will discuss the direct consequences of using technology to facilitate remote learning from a mental health perspective, and we will highlight innovative strategies that have been implemented to address the various challenges. Method(s): We will review the literature related to the impact of virtual learning on mental health. In addition, clinical cases as well as specific innovative practices will be reviewed. Result(s): The closure of school buildings and the shift to virtual learning has upended the lives of children and families. Emerging research suggests that this transition has taken a significant psychological toll on children. Social isolation, academic challenges, developmental concerns, and barriers to access are all likely contributors. In addition, preventative mental health resources and treatment interventions traditionally available through schools cannot be easily replicated in the virtual space. Schools, in collaboration with clinicians, have developed creative approaches to meet the needs of children in their communities. Conclusion(s): The transition to and from virtual learning has had far-reaching consequences for mental health. Many families have struggled to adapt to virtual learning. Schools and clinicians continue to develop creative approaches to address these unique challenges. Understanding and responding to these changes is critical for psychiatrists.

"Why Are Some Teens Thriving and Coping Better During the Pandemic?","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of teens in many ways, and teens are experiencing higher rates of depression and anxiety. The extent of this impact is variable and dependent on many factors. Although the impact has been negative for many teens, some teens appear to be cope better than others and show more resilience. This talk will explore and discuss the protective factors for teens who are thriving. We will look at factors such as age, gender, specific characteristics, coping strategies, educational status, degree of social connectivity, and more. Method(s): A literature review of the current and emerging research related to the impact of quarantine and COVID-19 on the psychological and mental health of teens will be conducted. In addition, clinical cases and experiences will be reviewed. Two or 3 cases will be discussed to delineate the contextual factors around teens who are thriving. Result(s): Early in the pandemic, some teens appeared to be thriving. Teens who were socially anxious, bullied in school, and overwhelmed with academic and social demands did well in some instances. They saw school closures as a break that provided relief. In the fall, many of these teens, especially those not able to return to school in person, started to struggle. The teens who have continued to do well share some protective factors and characteristics. These include strong self-discipline traits, prosocial behaviors, the ability to maintain a consistent structure, routine and healthy habits of exercise, sleep and nutrition, positive parenting, good coping skills, ability to self-advocate and ask for help from teachers/family, strong social connectivity, involvement in organized activities/sports, and creative outlets. Access to mental health care and extra educational support were protective for many. This also brings up social equity issues that can increase the risk. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of teens. Teens have had a significant disruption to their daily lives and their development. Some teens are coping better during these very stressful times. Understanding why and recognizing these protective factors can help inform care when working with teens and their families.

"Impact of Sleep on Physician Burnout","Objectives: This presentation will give an overview of the impact of sleep on physician burnout and wellness. We aim to discuss strategies to improve sleep among physicians. Method(s): A literature review was conducted to assess the available data. The audience will be engaged by utilizing polls throughout the presentation. Result(s): Multiple studies show that approximately 1 in 2 physicians, either in training or in practice, report burnout. Data also suggest that physicians sleep 6.5 hours on an average as compared to the recommended 8 hours. Nearly half of the practicing physicians attributed work schedules to poor sleep. Sleep deprivation is also attributed to the culture of medical training. COVID-19 has further added to the workload of physicians, resulting in reduced sleep. Poor sleep causes depletion of energy stores, contributing to burnout. Insufficient sleep can affect sleep architecture, worsen anxiety, increase stress, affect mental health, and thus result in burnout. Poor sleep can also cause fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness, impair cognitive functioning, and contribute to burnout. The relationship between job-related stress, sleep, and burnout symptoms has been noted in different studies. The increased demand of child and adolescent psychiatrists secondary to the pandemic appears to contribute to poor sleep and increased stress, thus contributing to burnout. Different strategies can be used to help improve sleep among physicians, including mental health providers, to help improve the overall well-being of physicians. Changes can be made on a personal level and institutional level to help with improvement in sleep among physicians. Conclusion(s): Sleep and physician burnout are closely related. There is increased stress on mental health providers including child and adolescent psychiatry providers, even more so during the pandemic. Measures taken on personal and institutional levels will help with improvement of sleep disturbances and mitigate factors leading to an increase in burnout.

"iCARE: Internet-Based Child Adult Relationship Enhancement for Families at Risk for Emotional Dysregulation and Child Maltreatment","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in school, daycare, and community supports, negatively impacting underlying mental health issues for both parents and children and further increasing the potential for child maltreatment. Internet-based Child-Adult Relationship Enhancement (iCARE) is a tier 2 intervention that aims to enhance parents' relationship with children with emotional and behavioral problems and those at increased risk of maltreatment. Parents are taught to connect with children of different ages, support social-emotional learning, give effective directions, and address mild problematic behaviors. Method(s): The presentation will focus on describing a 6-week parenting skills workshop called iCARE for parents of children aged 2 to 6 years. It will also provide preliminary qualitative and quantitative results on the feasibility and possible effectiveness of this intervention. Changes in parents' satisfaction and parenting attitudes, parent stress level, and child behavior problems will be shared. Result(s): Participants will learn about an intervention for parents who are already seeking psychiatric services in an academic outpatient center. They will understand the feasibility of using an internet-based group format as a mental health intervention. Participants will consider its potential effectiveness. Lastly, they will understand how this type of group may be implemented in their own practice. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 pandemic has created a mental health crisis. Many families are requiring mental health care. Providing accessible, effective interventions for families will continue to be of great importance.

"Mindful Parenting","Objectives: Mindful parenting (MP) can be defined as the process of intentional, kind, moment-to-moment awareness of one's experience, including parenting (Kabat-Zinn, 1997). MP can increase the parents' capacity for parenting calmly with more consistency, and in accordance with their goals and values, while fostering a warm and nurturing parent-child relationship, that can result in less parenting stress, more effective parenting strategies, and increased well-being in their children (Duncan, 2009). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a rise in parent and child stress has led to increased risk for, and prevalence of, parent and child psychopathology (Patrick et al, 2020). Telehealth offers a unique and effective way to reach families in need and to deliver parenting interventions to reduce parenting stress and improve parent-child functioning (Flujas et al, 2019). Telehealth MP interventions remain effective in decreasing parenting stress and improving the parents' and child's well-being (Potharst et al, 2019). This presentation will provide an overview of core MP skills and the evidence for MP interventions delivered via telehealth. Modifications for telehealth with its benefits and challenges will be discussed. Method(s): Presenters will review the key MP skills and current empirical evidence on online MP interventions and their impact on caregiver stress and well-being and improved treatment outcomes. Adaptations for MP interventions delivered in a telehealth format will be discussed, including the benefits and challenges. Case examples will be used to enhance learning. Result(s): Participants will learn the core aspects of MP and how MP can decrease caregiver stress and improve treatment outcomes for children, as well as online MP adaptations. Participants will also learn the benefits and challenges of online MP. Conclusion(s): Given the current climate of COVID-19, including the rise in family mental health needs and enhanced opportunities for telehealth services, supporting caregiver well-being and the treatment of young children is critical. Improving clinicians' understanding of MP interventions and best practices when delivering care via telehealth will support the growing need for these services.

"Internet-Based Interventions for Young Children and Families: Mindfulness, Icare, I-Pcit, and Space","Objectives: Teletherapy has become increasingly common due to increasing access to specialized treatments by overcoming geographical barriers, increasing efficiency, reducing cost, and diminishing stigma linked to mental health clinics. A number of studies have supported the treatment efficacy, feasibility, acceptability, sustainability, and satisfaction of telepsychiatry and teletherapy for treating children. Over the past 2 years, the wider dissemination of telehealth services has been expedited due to the COVID-19 public health crisis that resulted in a historic expansion of telehealth insurance coverage (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Method(s): Our presentation will consist of 4 main parts: 1) mindful parenting (20 minutes), Mari Kurahashi, MD, MPH, Stanford School of Medicine;2) internet-based Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (iCARE) virtual parent training and feasibility study (20 minutes), Matthew Young, PhD, and Andrea Mann, DO, University of Chicago;3) Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions (SPACE), a parent-focused intervention for children with anxiety and OCD (20 minutes), Yaara Shimshoni, PhD, Yale School of Medicine;4) internet-delivered parent-child interaction therapy (I-PCIT), an evidence-based treatment for children with disruptive behaviors (20 minutes), Magdalena Romanowicz, MD, Mayo Clinic;and 5) discussion (15 minutes), Bianca Busch, MD, Member of the AACAP Telehealth Committee. Questions will follow (25 minutes). Result(s): Participants will learn different innovative internet-delivered therapies for young children and their families. They will develop strategies to discuss therapy internet etiquette, treatment tools, and strategies for ways to engage children and their families via the internet. They will learn about treatment options for internalizing and externalizing disorders in young children that can be delivered effectively with fidelity online. Conclusion(s): There is a growing need for clinicians knowledgeable in teletherapy. This session will allow participants to discuss and explore ideas with international experts on a wide range of clinical questions in internet-delivered therapies for young children.

"Tics and Tic-Like Behaviors: Social Contagion in Pandemic Times","Objectives: Clinicians and researchers have noted significant increases in tics and tic-like behaviors in adolescents and young adults over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, often in the context of active social media use, notably TikTok. These presentations differ from typical presentations of Tourette's disorder (TD). Experts in functional neurological disorder (FND) and TD will discuss this phenomenon followed by a panel discussion with active audience engagement. Method(s): Jeff Waugh, MD, PhD, will provide an overview of FND, review the relevant literature on FND in youth, and discuss common FND features and demographics. Christos Ganos, MD, will compare and contrast primary tic disorders/TD with tic-like behaviors seen in FND. Tamara Pringsheim, MD, will focus on characteristics of patients who present with functional tic-like behaviors and discuss this in the context of the pandemic, social media usage (eg, TikTok), and the concept of social contagion. Joseph McGuire, PhD, will review evidence-based therapy for tics and use a case-based approach to discuss adapting and augmenting this therapy for youth with functional tic-like symptoms in order to enhance treatment response. Video vignettes will be shown. Dorothy Grice, MD, and Cathy Budman, MD, will lead a panel discussion and support audience participation. Result(s): FND is common in youth. Presentations of functional tic-like behaviors have increased during the pandemic, spurred by social media posts. Recognition of FND and how FND symptoms do, and do not, overlap with TD is important to establish an accurate diagnostic formulation and effective treatment. These patients often have an older age of onset, a skewed sex ratio toward females, abrupt symptom onset, prominent complex movements, and higher rates of self-injurious behaviors and other challenging symptoms. Recognizing the presence of life stressors and anxiety or mood symptoms is an integral part of care. Conclusion(s): The symptom course and symptom constellation of tic-like behaviors of FND differ from primary tic disorders. Evidence-based treatments for tics may be effective in decreasing symptom acuity;however, augmentation with additional therapeutic approaches is indicated, as is awareness of the overall psychosocial health of each patient. An understanding of FND and knowledge of tic disorders will help clinicians to provide optimal care for youth who present with these symptoms. TICD, ADOL, MED Copyright Â© 2022","Grice, D.

"Next Frontiers: Integration of Perinatal and Childhood Consultation Models to Address Mental Health Inequities","Objectives: A robust literature indicates that untreated and undertreated perinatal-childhood mental health conditions can have significant adverse effects on caregivers, children, and family well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront stark inequities in access to family mental health services. Perinatal and child mental health consultation ""access programs"" are an innovative model that can be leveraged to address health inequities in 2-generation family mental health. This Clinical Perspectives aims to: 1) describe this evidence-based care-delivery model to address the growing demand for mental health services;2) provide examples of perinatal and child access programs with varied levels of integration, with a focus on the challenges and opportunities for existing and future programs;and 3) discuss how integration of these models may address inequities in mental health access and future directions to increase the health equity focus in perinatal and child consultation. Method(s): Through peer-to-peer consultation, education, and resource/referrals, access programs increase access to mental health services. To date, this population evidence-based model has been implemented across the nation. Access program implementation is being tailored across states and regions in response to local variations in mental health resources, funding, and state policies. Four different states-North Carolina, Michigan, Louisiana, and Massachusetts-will describe their models including the level of collaboration/integration between perinatal and child models, and how these models can be leveraged to address inequities in family mental health. Result(s): Access programs can be leveraged to address inequities in family mental health. Understanding the challenges and opportunities to integrate these 2 models is crucial to inform future directions for implementation, practice, and policy. Knowledge of these innovative models is crucial for child and adolescent psychiatrists in order to increase dissemination, improve care, and best support children and families. Conclusion(s): Nationwide, access programs are transforming mental health systems of care. There is a need to leverage both perinatal and child mental health access programs to address the stark inequities in family mental health. EBP, INF, DEI Copyright Â© 2022","Tobon, A. L.; Gleason, M.

"Accomplishing Change in This Digital World","Objectives: The pandemic of COVID-19 brought about technological advancements. Amid in-person social isolation, the world became more connected socially through digital platforms than ever before. Prior to the pandemic, there were also rising concerns with screen, social media, gaming, internet, and gambling addictions. Newer generations have become savvier at understanding platforms, how to share appropriate information, and how to ignore misleading information. They may develop emotional and social relationships through social media and value their presence based on what others perceive them to be. They may have a hard time disconnecting from the internet itself and may form a sense of anxiety by withdrawing from technology. Method(s): In this presentation, participants will receive an overview of technology platforms, gain an understanding of how they may impact mental health of younger generations, and will learn how utilizing virtual telehealth software may help them to understand the issues better. They will be presented with cases related to addiction of digital media and technology. Result(s): Through understanding both the child and parent perspective about digital platforms and developing a sense of expectations and concerns, one can help them start to form a more trusting relationship and a common ground between them. Youth may begin to realize their habit-forming potential and parents can help them counteract addictive behaviors before it worsens. Conclusion(s): The digital age comes with advantages. Technology will bring about an accelerated advancement in knowledge, encourage convenience, develop a cost-reduction burden, and foster more time with interests. Technology may also develop harm and a habit-forming potential, lead to overstimulation, take away time from work and meaningful relationships, and can quickly lead to perceived rejection. Through developing a therapeutic relationship with patients and families, one can gradually encourage meaningful change.

"Reaching At-Risk Youth by Telehealth in Texas: Experience From the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine Program","Objectives: The Texas Senate passed a bill during the 86th legislative session known as Senate Bill 11 to address accessibility to mental health services for the youth of Texas. The bill leverages the expertise and capacity of the 12 health-related institutions of higher education in Texas to address the urgent mental health challenges in Texas. One of the 5 initiatives ordered in the legislation was the establishment of a statewide telehealth system providing direct mental health services to schools now known as the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine (TCHATT) Program. Method(s): The origins, objectives, and operation of the TCHATT Program will be described. Data from program operations will be shared to demonstrate its impact. Cases will be shared to illustrate the operation of the program. Methods to specifically reach children of low socioeconomic backgrounds, minoritized racial groups, sexual- and gender-minority youths, immigrants, and others who traditionally experience healthcare inequities will be described. Result(s): The TCHATT Program has made mental health services available to over 2 million Texas school children. Among the services available are urgent evaluations, brief therapy, psychiatric services, case management, and connection to community resources. Dell Med TCHATT works with school staff members to identify and assess the behavioral health needs of students, prioritizing the needs and care of at-risk children and adolescents who lack access to mental healthcare services in their communities. COVID-19 increased youth mental health problems, and TCHATT addressed these needs by providing accessible care through telehealth. Conclusion(s): The TCHATT Program has successfully increased access to mental health care by reducing the barriers. By involving the school staff and providing virtual appointments facilitated by the school, students and families are better able to engage in mental health care.

"Beyond Cultural Competence: Addressing Mental Health Needs in Youth of Color, Immigrant, Lgbt, and Refugee Populations in Schools","Objectives: The current pandemic has disproportionately affected the mental health of already-vulnerable young people: youth of color, immigrant, LGBTQ+, and refugee populations, and others who traditionally experience healthcare inequities. Financial hardships, systemic discrimination, cultural stigma, and lack of skilled practitioners are among the numerous global barriers to youth mental health and culturally competent care. Importantly, vulnerable populations have particularly limited access to mental health care, yet most continue to attend some form of school in person or virtually. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are uniquely positioned to transform these barriers by partnering with schools to provide culturally sensitive mental health services. Method(s): After the panel introduction, a brief review of the impact of COVID-19 and systemic discrimination on the mental health of youth will be presented by Kristie Ladegard, MD, and Anna Ordonez, MD, MAS (8 minutes). Presenters (18 minutes each) will discuss their specific school-based mental health service (SBMHS) initiatives and outcomes, including unique vulnerabilities, stigmas, and barriers that their patient populations face: Kristie Ladegard, MD, ""Culturally Informed Training: Lessons from Denver School-Based Clinics"";Brandon Johnson, MD, ""Addressing LGBTQ+-Related Mental Health in Schools"";Mina Fazel, MD, ""Lessons in Belonging: Tools to Help Refugee Children in Schools"";and Jane Ripperger-Suhler, MD, and Puja Patel, PhD, ""Reaching At-Risk Youth by Telehealth in Texas: Experience From the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine Program."" Shashank Joshi, MD, and Dr. Ordonez, as our discussants, will review each program's cultural dimensions and identify persistent challenges and their solutions (20 minutes), followed by panel questions and answers (20 minutes). Result(s): Models of SBMHS varied in their approach to cultural engagement, health promotion, school partnership, and treatment modalities. All demonstrated successful outcomes with youth who traditionally experience healthcare inequities. Conclusion(s): Providing culturally competent mental health care in school settings is essential to improving health equity to vulnerable and underserved communities. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must lead the way in advocating for culturally competent and evidence-based methods that increase global access to mental health treatment for all youth across the world.

"From the Family Dinner Table to Mental Health Court: Eating Disorder Interventions across a Developmental Lifespan","Objectives: Eating disorders carry a high burden of medical complications, risk of mental illness comorbidities, and high rates of mortality. The longer eating disorders persist, the greater possibility of medical and mental health decompensation. Adult models of anorexia nervosa (AN) suggest rates of mortality of 5% to 7%, although mortality can be as high as 18%. Promising for pediatric populations is that the prognosis for adolescents with AN is better than in adult populaces, implying the possibility of preventive means in limiting the progression of this disease. Method(s): Natalie Prohaska, MD, will provide education and strategies to initiate care with a multidisciplinary team performing outpatient treatment. Approaches to deliver these services during the COVID-19 pandemic will be shared. A clinical case will be introduced. Avanti Bergquist, MD, will explore the process of transitioning a patient to residential and partial hospitalization programming, and barriers to this intervention will be discussed. Elizabeth Wassenaar, MD, will aid in identifying patients requiring inpatient levels of care. She will offer education on medical complications that require this intervention. Libby Erickson, DO, will explore the role of involuntary treatment. Civil commitment will be discussed from an ethical and cultural vantage point not only to address its role in the field but also to speak to its risk on marginalized people. Dr. Erickson will revisit a case introduced by Dr. Prohaska. Result(s): Attendees will learn strategies to identify eating disorders and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to intervene in eating disorder processes. Further, providers will gain knowledge on how to deliver services remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. A knowledge base of higher levels of care for eating disorders will be obtained. Ethical concepts pertaining to involuntary treatment will be introduced. Conclusion(s): Eating disorders pose a high mortality rate in our field. We have the unique opportunity to prevent life-long struggles and mortality with early and appropriate interventions. Further education on monitoring these patients, collaborating with eating disorder specialists, awareness of higher levels of care and involuntary options are needed for our field to make further headway in combating this deadly disease.

"Successful Strategies for Building a Shared Understanding Between Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Providers, Patients, and Families About Identifying and Treating Mental Health Concerns","Objectives: The objective is to evaluate the impact of a cross-Canada effort to help patients, family caregivers, and intellectual development disorder (IDD) health and social service providers to address mental health needs of people with IDD during COVID-19. Method(s): Various point-of-care tools and clinical resources explaining contributors to mental health difficulties, healthcare communication, and strategies to address mental health concerns were adapted to the 3 audiences of patients, families, and service providers and taught during virtual courses offered to these 3 audiences in the first year of the pandemic. Result(s): Learners reported feeling more comfortable with healthcare communication and understanding mental health difficulties and treatment following their participation in the virtual courses. A common understanding of issues can help to build capacity within the system. Conclusion(s): Everyone has a role to play when it comes to recognizing and addressing mental health concerns. This can be facilitated through the promotion of tailored toolkits and resources, and through the co-delivery of material by people with disabilities, families, and mental health service providers.

"Integrated Mental Health Services Across Systems: Working Within the Family Justice Centers","Objectives: The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate how the public health sector and direct healthcare entities can advocate and collaborate to provide integrated care for families impacted by domestic violence. Method(s): The presentation will explore the interrelatedness between early childhood mental health, maternal mental health, and intimate partner violence. Relevant research will highlight the impact of parent-child dyadic relationships due to chronic stress and trauma covering adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and other social determinants of health including racism and healthcare inequities. A case discussion will be used to help contextualize the literature as it applies to working within the New York City (NYC) advocacy and public health spaces. We will highlight the novel integrated program: NYC Health + Hospitals Family Justice Center Mental Health Collaboration, which is a collaboration between the NYC Office of Community Mental Health, the NYC Mayor's Office, and NYC Health + Hospitals, which is the largest public city hospital system in the country. The presenter will discuss strategies for working in a mixed disciplinary setting, creating partnerships, and moving policy to meet the needs of families impacted by trauma. Finally, the presenter will also discuss strategies for addressing the systemic barriers brought on by COVID-19. Result(s): Participants will gain insight into how city-wide systems can be leveraged to bridge the gap to improve the mental well-being of families impacted by violence. Participants will also gain a perspective of how working in this type of nontraditional medical setting can allow services to be delivered where they are needed the most. Conclusion(s): Addressing the trauma of maternal mental health by meeting the families where they are is crucial for aiding early childhood mental well-being.

"Transforming Access and Quality of Trauma Treatment in North Carolina","Objectives: Transforming access to and quality of mental health treatment for children exposed to serious trauma and adversity in North Carolina (NC) began with a pilot program from 2006 to 2009 followed by legislative annual funding in 2013. The aims were to develop and sustain an implementation platform that: 1) focuses on disseminating an array of 5 effective target treatments across NC for children and families exposed to child abuse/trauma;2) promotes sustainability in diverse settings;and 3) utilizes implementation science to assure positive treatment outcomes. Maintaining quality training and coaching of providers serving underserved, vulnerable populations is a critical need during difficult times of Medicaid changes and the COVID-19 syndemic. Method(s): The NC Child Treatment Program (NCCTP) in the Center for Child and Family Health has trained the following number of cohorts of Medicaid-enrolled community mental health providers in trauma-focused CBT (26), parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT, 17), child-parent psychotherapy (8), structured psychotherapy for adolescents responding to chronic stress (SPARCS, 9), and problematic sexualized behavior (1). The NCCTP builds on the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) learning collaborative to create a roster of highly trained providers in each treatment. Strategies used before and during the syndemic include: agency teams are provided intense training and engage in quality improvement (QI) activities focused on use of standardized assessments, achievement of fidelity and clinical outcomes, enhancing organizational capacity, stakeholder outreach, data tracking, and provision of ongoing clinical and implementation supports. Result(s): A total of 888 clinicians have been rostered in the 5 treatment models to date across 100 counties (https://www.ncchildtreatmentprogram.org). The data and lessons learned will be presented for client-level clinical outcomes, training, and service transformation generally and specific to the impact of COVID-19 and racial/other disparities. Conclusion(s): The NCCTP has built capacity to improve the health and well-being of traumatized children across our state by increasing access to and supporting the changing and challenging needs of trained, dedicated, community providers.

"Movies Gone Viral: Seeing the Pandemic World through Teenagers' Lenses","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has immensely impacted youth and family mental health. School closure and loss of emotional connection and social support have a compounding effect on teens' physical and emotional well-being. Here we introduce filmmaking as an innovative intervention to capture pandemic experiences in teens with diverse cultural backgrounds. The program provides better understanding of the adolescents' perspectives through authentic sharing, as a means to inform caregivers and clinicians on where to focus resources and which problems to target. Method(s): Film Stylo Project (FSP) is a virtual multisite filmmaking workshop for teenagers to describe their ""pandemic routines"" and their ""views from home"" during the pandemic shelter-in-place. Films are then shared, first in peer support groups, and then in virtual exhibitions across different sites. Result(s): Audiences will be shown short videos clips of teenagers' films, and the early results from a related qualitative study will be discussed. Conclusion(s): FSP provides a creative platform for teens to cope through expressing vulnerable feelings, experiencing the ""ripple effect"" of virtual peer support, and learning cross-cultural empathy. Films may provide a therapeutic window: 1) for teens to objectively reflect on their pandemic experiences through filmmaking;and 2) for adult viewers to mentalize into the teen filmmakers' minds.

"Getting Water to the End of the Row: Highlighting Efforts From a Center on Rural Addiction","Objectives: Specialists in the treatment of adolescent mental health and substance use, more commonly located in academic, urban, and suburban settings, have training and expertise valuable to and needed by adolescents and families in rural communities. The increasing legalization of recreational cannabis, the opioid epidemic, and the mental health crisis accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic are all factors contributing to the increased demand for substance use and mental health services in rural areas. Increased demand has highlighted geographic constraints and underscored shortages of available evidence-based treatment. At the end of this presentation, participants will: 1) identify means of connecting with and supporting colleagues assessing and treating adolescent cannabis use in rural areas;2) recognize strategies for disseminating subspecialty expertise while strengthening capacity for local treatment within general practice settings;and 3) be able to create a stepwise plan for supporting colleagues and families in rural areas impacted by cannabis and other adolescent substance use. Method(s): The University of Vermont Center on Rural Addiction (UVM CORA) was established through a grant from the United States Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to support education, distribute resources, and disseminate evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders in rural communities in Northern New England. Strategies, lessons, key points, and reproducible methods utilized to expand the impact of addiction and mental health treatment experts are reviewed. Result(s): The principles reviewed include needs assessment, telephone or videoconferencing consultation, in-person and virtual training, site visits, and connecting local resources. Subspecialists and experts in child and adolescent psychiatry and addiction treatment expand their capacity to both disseminate expertise regionally and strengthen rural treatment locally. Conclusion(s): Increasing demand for screening, identification, and treatment of cannabis and other substance use disorders among rural adolescents can be alleviated when subspecialists increase capacity to disseminate evidence-based treatment and to educate primary care colleagues in rural areas.

"Bringing Inpatient Psychiatry to the Emergency Room","Objectives: The boarding times of children and adolescents in the emergency room requiring a higher level of care due to the lack of available inpatient beds is worsening. There was an upward trend in boarding times before the pandemic, but the boarding crisis has worsened to the point of youth waiting almost 3 times as long in emergency rooms now. This presentation will highlight how boarding in the emergency room now requires initiating treatment and provision of care that is beyond what would be expected in the emergency room setting, in order to help mitigate the detrimental effects of this crisis. Method(s): Consulting psychiatrists and clinicians have to broaden the scope of their practice in the emergency room setting during a time of high volume and acuity. This requires initiation of treatment in the emergency room setting. These treatment interventions can range from brief family interventions and psychoeducation, group treatment either in person or virtually, and beginning or titrating psychotropic medications for acute conditions during the boarding process. Result(s): These interventions at our institution have resulted in almost one-third of patients no longer meeting the criteria for a higher level of care during the lengthy boarding process and being discharged home with services. Utilization of the boarding time in the emergency room setting allows for close monitoring of the patient and medical workup, which can facilitate stabilization. Conclusion(s): During this national emergency of child and adolescent mental health, clinicians have to be innovative and creative in finding solutions to address the growing boarding crisis that is complicated by the lack of readily available treatment options further diminished by COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Boarding Crisis: A Background and Overview of Pediatric Patients Awaiting Psychiatric Placement on Medical Units","Objectives: The number of children and adolescents presenting to emergency departments (ED) in need of inpatient psychiatric care has risen dramatically in the last 2 years, in part related to the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds, these patients often are cared for in the ED or on pediatric medical units for prolonged periods of time while they are awaiting appropriate inpatient placement, a practice that is commonly referred to as ""boarding."" Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the current literature related to the boarding of pediatric patients awaiting psychiatric placement in EDs and pediatric medical units. Result(s): Boarding of pediatric patients presents unique challenges for patients and families, ED and pediatric providers, and consulting child and adolescent psychiatry teams. The practice also raises important ethical and medico-legal issues related to the care of these patients. Conclusion(s): Understanding common problems related to the psychiatric boarding of pediatric patients is essential to care for this patient population safely and effectively. More research in this area, including innovative approaches to care, is needed to address the current crisis.

"Pediatric Mental Health Boarding Crisis: Challenges and Opportunities for Developing Programs","Objectives: There is a substantial increase in emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for youth experiencing mental health crises, which has worsened with COVID-19. Youth requiring inpatient mental health treatment often stay in the ED or are admitted to an inpatient medical unit while waiting for placement as a psychiatric inpatient;this practice is referred to as ""boarding."" The participants of this Clinical Perspectives will learn about challenges related to the pediatric mental health boarding crisis and opportunities to develop clinical interventions and programs by innovative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary approaches. Method(s): The presenters are from different backgrounds and health systems around the nation, who use a combination of reviewing current research literature, clinical case examples, and best clinical practices. Presenters will highlight the challenges related to the boarding crisis faced by patients, families, staff, and health systems, and various treatment interventions and programs to address this growing boarding crisis. Result(s): In the first talk, Eric Hazen, MD, presents the background and overview of this boarding crisis for pediatric patients with emotional and behavioral health concerns. In the second talk, Jeremy Esposito, MD, a pediatric emergency medicine physician, will share his perspectives and discuss the need for close collaboration and effective change through a multidisciplinary approach. Zheala Qayyum, MD, discusses needs for innovative and creative ways of finding solutions and initiating treatment and provision of care in the ED setting. As the final talk in the session, Rebecca Marshall, MD, MPH, integrates these presentations and also discusses a state-funded program: Crisis and Transitions Services Outcomes Project, which provides 24/7 crisis services, in-home therapy, family peer support, and care coordination for 4 to 12 weeks or until youth and families are established with appropriate long-term mental health supports. Conclusion(s): The pediatric mental health boarding crisis continues to be a challenge around the nation, and it has worsened with the pandemic. This presentation will increase participants' understanding about challenges around the boarding crisis and various innovative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary approaches in finding solutions to address this growing boarding crisis.

"Suicidality in Black Children and Adolescents: A Second Look","Objectives: The purpose of this presentation is to educate child and adolescent psychiatrists, medical students, and psychiatry trainees about the external factors influencing the current Black youth suicide crisis and to discuss interventions and resources to address the issue. Black children experience significantly higher rates of suicide and depression when compared to children of other racial groups. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Black children under age 12 years, and the suicide death rate among Black youth has been growing faster than any other ethnic group. According to a recent CDC report, there was a 73% increase in suicide attempts among Black adolescents between 1991 and 2017 and a 122% increase in suicide attempt-associated injury among Black adolescent boys during this time period. These alarming statistics underscore the need for community interventions and research focused on addressing the Black youth suicide crisis, which is currently occurring against the backdrop of persistent racial health inequities. Method(s): Presenters will provide an overview of the current trends in Black youth suicide and how the COVID-19 pandemic, childhood trauma, and access to school-based suicide prevention resources have impacted suicide risk in this community. Attendees will also learn about the mental health disparities including suicidality among Black and other non-White LGBTQIA+ youth. Lastly, presenters will discuss practical approaches to addressing suicide prevention via school mental health models. Result(s): Black mental health has been an area of focus for AACAP. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must be well educated about the effects of racism and structural violence on children's mental health. Given the low numbers of Black and highly culturally competent psychiatrists, training and education in this structural competency is imperative for effective psychiatric practice. Conclusion(s): Black children's mental health is affected by structural and physical violence toward Black Americans. Child and adolescent psychiatrists require structural humility and must strive for competence to adequately address the needs of this population. S, ETHN, DEI Copyright Â© 2022","Al-Mateen, C.

"Racial Disparities and Bias in the Expulsions of Young Children","Objectives: Young children are expelled from early childhood programs at more than 3 times the rate of K-12 students, with clear race and gender disproportionality. Method(s): Results of large-scale surveys of early educators and parents will be shared, as well as results from a study of 132 early educators engaged in a study using eye-tracking technology to measure teacher gaze when prompted to expect misbehavior. Result(s): Black preschoolers are expelled and suspended at about 2 to 3 times the rate of other preschoolers, and boys at about 4 times the rate of girls. When led to expect misbehavior, early educators' eye gaze most closely followed Black children, especially the Black boys. Conclusion(s): At least a portion of the disproportionality in preschool expulsions may be explained by race, gender, and race/gender differences in early educator expectations. The added mental health strain of the pandemic on young children and early educators suggests a significant increase in preschool expulsions, and disparities in the toll taken by COVID-19 on communities of color is highly suggestive of dramatically increased expulsions, especially for young Black boys.

"A Tic or Not a Tic, That Is the Question","Objectives: Over the last 1 to 3 years, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been increased reports of new, sudden-onset tic-like behaviors in adolescents/transitional-aged youth. Functional tic-like behaviors are a well-described phenomenon and have been reported to occur endemically, such as the outbreak of tic-like behaviors in Le Roy, New York in 2012. During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased reports of such symptoms emerged worldwide. In some cases, typical tics may present alongside such tic-like behaviors, posing diagnostic and treatment challenges. Approaches for distinguishing tic-like symptoms from typical tics will be reviewed, and the roles of social media as well as social isolation will be considered. Treatment strategies for managing both typical tics and tic-like behaviors will be discussed. Method(s): Cathy Budman, MD, will provide case examples and highlight the current literature addressing the surge of tic-like behaviors in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approaches for evaluating and distinguishing typical tics from tic-like behaviors will be presented along with strategies for effective treatment. Result(s): Over the past 1 to 3 years, there has been a surge in reports of functional tic-like behaviors. Functional tic-like behaviors can be distinguished from typical tics in most cases, although both conditions may coexist. Clinical and family history, as well as state and trait factors, can help differentiate between these 2 conditions. Treatment of typical tics and tic-like behaviors may include similar and disparate approaches. Conclusion(s): Multiple factors appear to contribute to the increased observations of functional tic-like behaviors worldwide. Acute pandemic-related stressors, increased access to social media, and influencers with reported Tourette's disorder/social contagion, social isolation, and greater rates of anxiety/depressive disorders may all play a role. Typical tic exacerbations during COVID-19 do occur and require evidence-based treatments. In contrast, the treatment of tic-like behaviors does not usually include medication management, and instead should focus on the associated underlying stressors/conditions. Regardless of the etiology, youth with tics, functional tic-like behaviors, or both, will likely benefit from gold-standard behavioral tic treatments and increased psycho-social-educational support.

"Depiction of Self-Harm and Suicide in Anime","Objectives: Attendees will discuss and learn about anime, a Japanese style of animation with colorful graphics and extensive action-filled plotlines. Anime has surged in popularity in the United States, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the animated nature of this media, mature themes of self-harm and suicide have been noted throughout the medium. The objective of this talk is to discuss how self-harm and suicide depictions in popular anime series may affect the mental health of young viewers. Method(s): Miles Reyes, a medical student, will discuss existing literature regarding the impact of casualties and death in cartoons on youth mental health, and the background of anime. Content analysis of various anime scenes will be depicted through photos and clips to illustrate examples of self-harm and suicidal behavior in popular anime. Lastly, potential methods to utilize anime in clinical settings as a better way to understand the growing population of young anime viewers will be discussed. Result(s): In Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba-The Movie: Mugen Train, which is also the highest-grossing opening weekend foreign language film of all time in the United States, the main character is caught in a dream loop in which the only way to escape and cope with guilt is to repeatedly kill themself. From Attack on Titan, various fan-made compilation videos on deaths, kills, and suicide have been published on YouTube and received over 4 million views. In the vastly popular Naruto manga series, a character was depicted slitting their wrists to attempt to alleviate painful memories. Conclusion(s): Anime is incredibly rich in artistry and character development. However, caution should be taken when assuming that anime is appropriate for all age groups, and some scenes could be triggering for some who are unaware of the mature themes. As anime increases in popularity globally, child and adolescent mental health providers should understand that casual viewership of mature anime scenes warrants further discussion and prevention of suicide contagion.

"Indigenous Storytelling: Supporting Indigenous Children's Mental Health and Wellness","Objectives: The aim of this presentation is to describe a storybook series entitled Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine, which is designed to provide strengths-based, culturally relevant, and freely accessible public health and mental health educational resources to support the mental health needs of Indigenous children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Using a community-engaged approach, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health (JHCAIH) convened a national workgroup of Indigenous and allied child development, mental health, public health, and health communications experts to culturally adapt My Hero is You: How Kids Can Fight COVID-19, developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings. An Indigenous youth artist created illustrations to depict Indigenous youth and community experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic. Result(s): The Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19 and Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Honoring Our Teachings During COVID-19 books combine public health strategies to prevent and mitigate COVID-19, mental health education and coping tools, and cultural values and teachings. The 2 books are freely available on the JHCAIH website, and more than 85,000 print books have been distributed to Indigenous children and families from more than 110 tribes. Conclusion(s): By the end of the presentation, participants will be able to: 1) describe ongoing structural racism resulting in increased COVID-19 rates, mental health inequities, and underresourced mental health care for American Indians/Alaska Natives;2) identify a public health intervention strategy that can promote mental health and well-being among Indigenous children;and 3) describe an innovative dissemination strategy to ensure accessible public health and mental health promotion materials for Indigenous children and families.

"Commercial sexual exploitation of children in Zimbabwe: A threat to human and social development","Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) in child sex work is reportedly rising in Zimbabwe. While children of both sexes are affected, more females than males are forced to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money, food, access to shelter, education or some other gains from adults who control these means of survival and commodities. Drivers of CSEC include socioeconomic factors, negative peer pressure, childhood abuse, the influence of uncensored social media, and, more recently, the economic impact of COVID-19. Involvement in underage sex work exposes children to severe adversities, such as psychosocial and mental health disorders, physical and biological injuries, venereal diseases and HIV. CSEC is a growing concern for resource-limited countries, disenfranchises children and robs particularly the girl child of a better future. The worsening socioeconomic landscape in Zimbabwe and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated the problem. Solving the problem of CSEC requires a multipronged approach that involves stakeholders from several sectors, including public health, education, social services, security and the legal fraternity. There is a need to empower communities, empower civil society and development partners, enhance legal frameworks, provide messaging, education and vocational training, as well as rehabilitative services for affected children and their families. CSEC is a violation of the child's rights and a public health concern that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to preserve the next generation's human capital necessary for the sustainable development of Zimbabwe.

The main argu- ment in this study is whether this way of working affected female teachers more than male teachers. The results show that female teachers assumed the main role of care and domestic tasks, reconciling these demands teleworking from home, at the expense of reducing their sleep hours and having their physical and mental health affected (stress, depression, anxiety).","Solana-Villanueva, NÃ©lyda, De Los Heros - Rondenil, MartÃ­n Gabriel, Murillo-LÃ³pez, Sandra Carmen","https://doi.org/10.2l678/apuntes.92.1564","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Apuntes; 49(92):183-214, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40402,""
"COVID-19, Telemedicine and Emergency Department Referrals: Patient Presentations and Follow-up Times to a Community Mental Health Team","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes to how healthcare services are utilised and delivered. Objectives We examine the impact of COVID-19 on the pattern of emergency patient presentations referred on to the community mental health team and the impact of utilising telemedicine on time to follow-up. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all clinical records of patients currently attending our service. We identified presentations to the emergency department (N=119) who were subsequently referred on for mental health follow-up. Results Patients being referred to our team from emergency departments were significantly younger during, mean age 33.1 years (SD=12.3) compared to before the pandemic, mean age 40.0 years (SD=14.5), p=0.006 and a higher proportion were new patients during, 55.8%, compared to pre-pandemic period 33.3%, p=0.015. There was also a higher proportion of patients presenting with suicidal ideation and lower proportions of affective, psychosis and suicidal/self-injurious acts during the pandemic period compared to before, p=0.006. The ratio of female to male patients on the other hand were similar during both periods, p=0.853. There appeared to be no difference in median time to follow-up pre and during the pandemic (6.0 vs 5.5 days, p=0.995). Further analysis also found no significant impact on time to follow-up upon implementing telemedicine consultations, with median days to initial follow-up of 6 days pre-pandemic, 4.5 days during pandemic + prior to telemedicine and 6.5 days during pandemic + telemedicine, p=0.602.

"Mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the front-line health care workers in a tertiary care hospital in rawalpindi, pakistan","Introduction In these unprecedented times, the medical workers particularly at the frontlines of the pandemic are vulnerable to psychological trauma rooted in the new demands of their work, as well as the prevailing sense of insecurity and safety concerns for themselves and their loved ones. Objectives To explore the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the front-line health care workers in a tertiary care hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan Methods Frontline healthcare workers will include all doctors, nurses and paramedical staff performing duties that involve dealing directly with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at triage clinics, ICUs and isolation wards. Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and Impact of events scale-revised (IES-R) were administered to them to assess the mental health of these frontlines. Results A total of 94 frontlines were included in the study. 76(80.9%) had no significant depression while 18 (19.1%) had presence of significant depression. 62 (66%) had no significant anxiety while 32 (34%) had significant anxiety. Female gender and degree of contact with high clinical suspicion cases were significantly related with presence of anxiety and depression among the study participants. Being female, single, a nurse or a paramedic and degree of contact with high clinical suspicion cases was significantly related with presence of stress among the frontlines.

"Psychiatric morbidity among patients tested positive and isolated for COVID-19","Introduction In this crisis situation when everybody has been emphasizing on preventive measures, screening, early recognition and provision of necessary equipment, less emphasis has been laid on the mental health of the sufferers who have been listening news and following social media reporting catastrophe linked with COVID 19. Objectives To look for the psychiatric morbidity and associated socio-demographic factors among patients tested positive and isolated for covid-19 Methods All patients tested positive for covid-19 and admitted in Covid-19 ward of Malir hospital without any associated complications were included in the study. General Health Questionare-12 (GHQ-12) was administered to look for the presence of psychiatric morbidity. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were the tests applied to look for the relationship of various socio-demographic factors with presence of psychiatric morbidity among the target population. Results Out of 61 patients included in the study, 45 (73.7%) showed the presence of psychiatric morbidity while 16 (26.3%) did not show psychiatric morbidity when screened with GHQ-12. 43 (70.4%) were male while 18 (29.6%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 35.21 Â±2.355 years. Regression analysis revealed that advanced age and female gender have statistically significant relationship (p-value&lt;0.05) with presence of psychiatric morbidity among patients of covid-19.

"Moral Injury, Depression and Anxiety among Israeli Health and Social Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Role of Thwarted Belongingness","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic can affect the mental health of health and social care workers (HSCWs) who are frontline workers in this continuous crisis. Following exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) that undermine deeply held moral beliefs and expectations, HSCWs might experience moral injury (MI) and deleterious psychiatric consequences such as depression and anxiety symptoms. Objectives To examine associations between exposure to PMIEs, MI symptoms, depression, and anxiety symptoms. We also aim to assess the moderating role of thwarted belongingness in these associations. Methods A sample of 243 Israeli HSCWs completed online validated self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional designed survey in February and March 2021. Results About one-third (33.6%) of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder, 21.5% met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, and 19.1 % reported comorbidity of depression and anxiety. A moderated-mediation model shows that high thwarted belongingness intensified the relations between exposure to PMIEs and MI symptoms, and between MI symptoms and depression and anxiety symptoms. Importantly, the indirect effect of exposure to PMIEs on both depression and anxiety symptoms via MI symptoms existed only among those with high levels of thwarted belongingness. Conclusions The studyâ€™s findings highlight the mental burden of HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the contribution of MI to possible mental health consequences. Clinicians should be aware of the importance of high thwarted belongingness in depression and anxiety sequelae of exposure to PMIEs among HSCWs.

"Changes in psychiatric emergencies during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in El Bierzo (Spain)","Introduction The interest have focused in the effects of COVID-19 in mental symptoms. However, the pandemic and restrictions such as the lockdown decreed in Spain limited access to resources and lead to a change in assistance organization. Objectives to compare the incidence and characteristics of psychiatric emergencies during the Spanish 2020 Lockdown with the same period in 2019 Methods All the emergencies attended the the emergency room (Hospital El Bierzo) From 01/02/2019 to 30/06/2019 and those from 01/02/2020 to 30/06/2020 were analysed by two senior psychiatrists. Cases were selected if attended by any psychiatric reason. The cases were evalueated identifying ICD-10 diagnosis (according to clinical records and best criteria matching), sociodemographics, factors associated to the emergency and resolution. Results 23360 cases were attended in 2019 (799 psychiatric), 14907 (578) in 2020. That means a 36.19% of reduction in general emergencies and 27.66% in psychiatric emergencies (psychiatric emergencies proportion increased form 3.42% to 4.03%). The reduction started the week just before the lockdown declaration, minimal records coincided with the highest COVID-19 incidence and the recovery starts in early june for psychiatric and late June for general emergencies (figure 1). A decrease of 62.79% of anxiety cases and 45.9% of depresion was observed with no incresaes in any diagnosis. A slight increase in suicide attempts (two cases) was observed. Conclusions The lockdown seem to decrease psychiatric emergency care. Only suicidability was maintained/increased during the period. Psychiatry services must be aware of the risk of unattended inicidence that may cause an increase of cases after the lockdown.

"Has Suicide Really Increased After the COVID-19 Pandemic?","Despite being preventable, approximately 800,000 people die by suicide each year worldwide. Evidence suggests that suicide rates decrease during crises, but once the immediate threat passes, suicide rates are expected to increase. The COVID-19 pandemic likely affects risk and protective factors for suicide. Studies show mixed results regarding whether suicide behaviours have increased among adults during the pandemic. The results are however different for young people. An increase in suicidal behaviours has been identified in some countries among young people after lockdown period and when returning to schools. Data also suggests that there may have been a rise in deaths by suicide among those younger than 18 years in China, and during the first phase of lockdown in the United Kingdom. Studies have found significant decreases in hospital admissions for suicidal behaviours and visits to emergency departments both for adults and adolescents. Suicide can be prevented if evidence-based methods that exist are implemented in a systematic way. Wasserman, D., Iosue, M., Wuestefeld, A., & Carli, V. (2020).

"Suicide in the COVID-19 Pandemic","A literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar identified 64 articles assessing suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with the pre-pandemic period in the six WHO regions of the world. Most studies come from high- and middle-income countries. There is a scarcity of data from South America, and no studies from the African and East-Mediterranean Regions. Compared to trends in previous years, suicide rates remained largely unchanged globally or declined in the early phase of the pandemic. However, increased suicide rates were reported among non-white residents and Afro - American groups in the US, as well as among adolescents in China. Japan and India showed a statistically significant increase in suicide rates after an initial decline. Similarly in Peru, after an initial decline, suicide rates increased among men during the course of the pandemic. This is in line with previous findings in the context of natural disasters and other epidemics where a similar increased suicide trend can be expected in the post-pandemic period in other countries. Among adolescents, there were no significant changes in suicide rates during the period of school closure, but an increase has been observed in the period after coming back to schools. The assessment of suicidal thoughts and attempts during the pandemic was mostly conducted through online cross-sectional surveys and showed significant increases, particularly in females and the young.

"Digital solutions for mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic qualitative review and swot analysis","Introduction Since its early stages, the Covid-19 outbreak has posed immense challenges for effective, scalable and rapid interventions. Telehealth approaches have been considered as key part of an effective pandemic response. Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the role of digital solutions in fighting the mental health needs during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This review was conducted through searching four databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of mental health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019 to October 31, 2020, written in English language and published in peer-reviewed journals. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize the findings according a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Results 62 studies met the inclusion out of the 278 search results. Data converged on: strengths in minimizing the risk of Covid-19 transmission, reduction of travel time and costs, comparable effectiveness to in-person care;weaknesses i.e. decreased ability to detect non-verbal cues, lower therapeutic alliance, possible technical connection problems;opportunities in improving the healthcare system and expanding its accessibility for patients also for the future;threats such as privacy and legal issues, and risk to overlook vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly, marginalized ethnic minorities). Conclusions In the midst of a global mental health emergency, telehealth may represent a â€œvirtually perfectâ€ solution. However, further implementations facing issues of quality, justice and healthcare equity are required to ensure that all patients receive the care they need.","Vukovic, I.

"Non-participation to a longitudinal and interventional survey on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (PSYCOVER) in France","Introduction We conducted a national longitudinal survey among healthcare workers in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, (1) to assess mental health and (2) to describe the results of an intervention to improve capacity of resilience. Non-participation is rarely studied despite being an important methodological matter when performing studies on mental health. Objectives The study aims to describe and identify the factors associated with non-participation of healthcare workers to the intervention part of a national longitudinal study on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants were recruited from April to October 2021 via an Internet link widely disseminated. Data collected include participantâ€™ socio-demographic, occupational and working conditions, general health, professional burnout and mental health. The intervention proposed the use of tools for self-management of stress and resilience (PsySTART-ResponderÂ® and Anticipate.Plan.Deterâ„¢ program). A robust Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with non-participation. Results Among 724 participants, 41% participated to the intervention part. Factors associated to non-participation to the intervention were to work with few or no COVID-19 patients, and low scores in the anxiety scale. Social determinants, occupational characteristics or general health were not associated with non-participation. Conclusions Our study provides a better understanding of the participation of healthcare workers that was not frequently studied. The results logically suggest lower participation among those with better mental health and not directly concerned with management of COVID-19 patients. Non-participation to the intervention was not associated with social factors, which is an argument in favour of using such a design/intervention in a socially heterogeneous population.

"Depression, distress and their association with patterns of psychoactive substance use during the COVID-19 emergency state in latvia","Introduction The WHO warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could have psychiatric consequences such as elevated levels depression, increased alcohol and drug use, and other behaviours that exert a strong influence on health. In Latvia a state of emergency was announced on March 12th, was extended twice and lifted on June 10th. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of depression and distress in the general population of Latvia and association with substance use during the state of emergency. Methods The nationwide representative online study in the general population of Latvia was conducted in July 2020 during three week period. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to determine the presence of distress/depression. The structured questionnaire to determine psychoactive substance use was applied. Proportions of independent variables across the study groups were compared using Chi-square test. Results The study sample included 2608 respondents. The prevalence of depression and distress was estimated at 5.7% (95%CI 4.92 â€“ 6.71) and 13.5% (95%CI 6.85 â€“ 8.91), respectively. Patients with depression (28% vs. 7.4%, p &lt;0.001) and distress (30.9% vs. 7.4% p &lt;0.05) smoked more tobacco compared to respondents without distress/depression. Those with depression or distress were significantly more likely to consume more alcohol during the emergency state than people without depression or distress (14.0% and 17.7% vs. 6.6%, p &lt;0.001).

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic was immediately realized to pose a considerable threat both to the physical, and the mental health of people. For healthcare professionals, it marks frantic work rhythms, anxiety for their patients and exposure to an invisible enemy. Those who hold administrative positions are called upon to make unprecedented decisions, facing a high degree of uncertainty. Hence, hospital staff is expected to experience severe psychological distress. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological distress and possible associations with demographic characteristics, professional duties, hierarchy and predisposing factors to severe COVID-19 disease. Methods Online questionnaires were distributed to all employees of two hospitals in Thessaloniki, Greece, from March until May 2021. The questionnaires comprised two sections, one concerning the aforementioned purported risk factors, and another involving three psychometric scales, i.e. Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Coronavirus Reassurance-Seeking Behaviors Scale and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale. Results The psychological pressure experienced by healthcare professionals was low, compared to the literature. A history of COVID-19 disease, existence of predisposing factors to severe COVID-19 illness and frequent contact with infected patients were shown to significantly increase the likelihood of psychological distress. Furthermore, an age of 30-34 years, a higher level of education, existence of infected family members and non-vaccination were identified as possible risk factors. Conclusions Contrary to previous research results, our sample did not experience severe COVID-19-related psychological distress.

Fragestellung: Wie wirkte sich dies auf die Belastung von Muttern mit Kindern im ersten Lebensjahr und auf die kindliche Verhaltensregulation aus? Methode: In einer Online-Befragung schatzten 577 Mutter das Schrei-, Schlaf- und Futter-/Essverhalten ihrer Kinder (M = 7.3;0-12 Mon., SD = 3.25) und ihre eigene Belastung ein, zudem Stresserleben, depressive Symptomatik, Partnerschaftszufriedenheit und Bonding. Ergebnisse: Schlafprobleme traten bei 21.7%, schwer trostbares und haufiges Schreien bei 12.3% und exzessives Schreien bei 1.6% der Kinder auf. Mindestens jede funfte Mutter fuhlte sich durch Schreien oder Schlafprobleme belastet. Mehr Stress, beeintrachtigtes Bonding und weniger Partnerschaftszufriedenheit erklarten 17-21% der Varianz der mutterlichen Belastung durch Schrei- und Schlafverhalten. In der Zeit der starksten Beschrankungen zeigte sich signifikant mehr Belastung in der Gruppe von Muttern, die von vermehrtem Schreien und verlangerter Einschlaflatenz berichteten, sowie mit mindestens einem weiteren Kind im Haushalt (MANOVA).

"Negative emotions associated with self-growth among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic appeared globally (1), thus affecting the self-growth of the older population (2). Objectives The aim of this study is to identify and analyze the negative emotions felt during the pandemic, as well as their impact on self-growth of 226 older individuals of four nationalities: Mexican, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Methods Thus, a transnational qualitative survey was carried out. A content analysis was performed. Results Seven negative emotions were reported, namely: fear, sadness, anger, grief, annoyance, loneliness and shame. These emotions were considerably associated with the following themes: (1) Sharing experiences;(2) Availability of the partner;(3) Spirituality and religion;(4) Be active;(5) Interest in new projects;(6) Civic participation;(7) Sexual activity. Older participants with Mexican and Italian nationality reported that sharing experiences as the most relevant topic, while for the Portuguese and Spanish participants, having a partner available was more important. Conclusions This study demonstrated that negative emotions cooperated with the self-growth of older individuals during the Covid-19 pandemic. The heterogeneity of experiences lived by each culture was highlighted, underlining the positive side of negative emotions and their strong connection with the self-growth of the older people. 1.von Humboldt S et al.

"New way of Providing Care: the Role of Telemental Health","Telemental health care can be defined as the delivery of mental health care services at distance, by using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illnesses, as well as for research and education in the field of clinical psychiatry. While telemental health care practice was long established in many countries, its development proceeded with some variability worldwide. Over the past months, however, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly spread telemental health care practice worldwide, mostly to ensure the provision of care and assistance to psychiatric patients in spite of the governmental social contact restrictions. Although the process of rapid implementation has often happened at different rates and with different quality standards, across the various countries and sites, a global increase of the use of digital technologies has been reported. On the other hand, such recent events have also sparked a real paradigm shift in mental health care, significantly expanding the scope of e-mental health, given the recent availability of newer tools of digital psychiatry. In more detail, the use of mobile phones applications, of social media, of immersive reality and of chatbots is now driving psychiatry towards envisioning a more hybrid form of psychiatric practice, which holds the potential to finally overcome the traditional gap between the unmet needs of psychiatric patients and the relative lack of services and resources in mental health care. Here, the research evidence and the most compelling implementation issues in digital psychiatry will be reviewed.

"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on suicidal ideation admissions: a single adolescent and young adult psychiatry center experience","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown brought about a sense of fear and anxiety around the globe. This phenomenon led to both short and long term psychosocial and mental health implications for children and adolescents. Objectives To evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for suicidal ideation in a Portuguese adolescent and young adult psychiatry service. Methods We conducted a single-center, retrospective study including adolescent and young adult patients (15-25 years old) admitted to our service with suicidal ideation within a year before and a year after the declaration date of SARS-CoV-2 disease as a pandemic. Patients were divided in two groups: Group A - patients admitted before the pandemic (March 11, 2019 and March 11, 2020) and Group B â€“ patients admitted after the pandemic declaration (March 12, 2020 and March 12, 2021). The groups characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared. Results A total of 647 admissions were assessed (Group A, n= 372 and Group B, n=275). Demographic characteristics were similar between groups. 75 patients (vs 25 patients) were admitted with suicidal ideation in the year before the pandemic. There was a lower proportion of patients admitted with suicidal ideation during the year after the pandemic year - OR 0.374 (95% CI 0.228-0.614, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Our study showed a decrease in admissions for suicidal ideation in this service in the year after the pandemic. More studies are needed to understand the factors that may justify this decline and evaluate the longer effects of this pandemic in mental health.

"Suicidality in University Students Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted the day-to-day life of university students, as it has for the general population. University students have been reported to have high rates of mental health concerns, including suicidal ideation. Objectives Ascertaining the correlation of Covid-19 dissemination and proximity to University students in Vancouver, Canada, with suicidal ideation and suicidal plan. Methods We analyuzed weekly cross-sectional data from our Canadian World Mental Health International College Student survey by plotting the 30-day suicide ideation as a binary and the ordered 30-day suicide ideation outcomes using logistic and ordered generalized additive model (GAM) respectively, with a cubic spline and adjusting for demographics. We also ran an analysis on the association between binary 30-day ideation and different sample characteristics using logistic regression. Results The time trend analysis showed that suicidal ideation did not seem to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary, ideation levels were found to be high in the beginning (February 2020) with a downwards trend through June to September before gradually increasing around November, 2020. We identified sociodemographic risk factors that may be associated with suicidal ideation, and established that those most at risk were students who had been emotionally overwhelmed by Covid-19 and unable to find help. Conclusions Our results seem to indicate that, in general, students have remained resilient under the stress factors presented by the pandemic, and that trends in suicidality seem to follow seasonal or school calendar year stressors rather than respond to the pandemic. However, certain subpopulations appear to be more affected than others.

"Anorexia nervosa admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a Department of Psychiatry in northern Portugal","Introduction Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on mental health. In particular, patients with Anorexia nervosa (AN) may have faced increased symptom severity. Objectives To compare the clinical characteristics of inpatients with AN admitted amidst the COVID-19 pandemic versus the two previous years. Methods Retrospective observational study of inpatients admitted between January 2018 and December 2020 in a psychiatry inpatient unit of a tertiary hospital. Results There were 11 admissions of patients with AN in 2020 (8 from March onwards), a 22% increase relative to 2019, which in turn saw a 28% increase in admissions relative to 2018. Most patients had an AN diagnosis previous to the pandemic. The majority were undergoing outpatient treatment for over a year. Two patients were admitted within a month of outpatient treatment. There was an increase in admissions through the emergency service in 2020. The most frequent diagnostic was AN binge-eating/purging type in 2020 and 2019, whereas in 2018 the AN restrictive type was dominant. Mean BMI at admission and average length of stay were similar across the three years. Readmission in a 12-month period was 54,5% in 2020 (22,2% in 2019 and 42,9% in 2018). Conclusions Despite the widespread impression of a negative impact of the pandemic on AN patients, in our study the clinical characteristics of AN patients admitted in 2020 were mostly similar to the two previous years.

"Mental health evaluation of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and psychiatric comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The mental health of subjects with chronic medical illnesses, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD- Crohnâ€™s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis), is typically compromised and the current COVID-19 pandemic might have additionally increased this burden. Objectives The aim of the present study was to investigate, during the COVID-19 pandemic, if the presence of a comorbid psychiatric disorder has played a role as an aggravating factor on mental health in patients with IBD. Methods Twenty Five patients with psychiatric comorbidities (PC+) and twenty five without (PC-) comparable for age and gender, were recruited at the Gastroenterology department at Sacco University Hospital in Milan. Participants were assessed a psychiatric evaluation, collecting socio-demographic variables and measures of anxiety and depression [on the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)], sleep patterns [on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)] and general health status [on the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36)]. Comparative statistical analyses were performed with t test with Bonferroni correction. Results PC+ (n=25) showed more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms compared with PC- (n=25) (p &lt;.001) and worse sleep pattern (p&lt;.05). With respect to general health status, PC+ showed reduced physical activities (p&lt;.05), social activities (p&lt;.05), mental health (p&lt;.01) and role limitations due to physical health (p&lt;.05).

"Gender differences in reaction to Covid19 in people with Autism Spectrum Disorder","Introduction The Covid 19 pandemic has had an enormous psychological impact in which women were mentally more affected than men (Berthelot et al 2020 - Liu et al 2020). More over it exacerbated symptoms and suffering in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The question is how did it affect individuals with autism (ASD). And if so, did it affect women and girls more that men and boys or differently. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in patients with ASD Methods a combination of literature review and assessement of the population of individuals with autism spectrum disorders in a large specialized unit for individuals with ASD Results No seperate reports on individuals with ASD were found in the recent literature. Obviously the pandemic and confinement had great impact on individuals with intellectual disabilities amongst whom many individuals with comorbid developmental disorders as ADHD and/or Autism (e.g.Palacio-Ortiz et al 2020 - Guessoum et al 2020) In our population some remarkable outcomes were noted in the sense that a substantial part of the population with autism had positive experiences: e.g. clear social rules / less contact. Males enjoyed more online contact and games / experienced less loneliness - In females we found significantly more depressive symptoms, anxiety and suicidal behaviour. Conclusions Covid 19 has had a great psychological impact with marked gender differences. Remarkably in ASD men enjoyed some of the benefits of the confinement.

"Cognitive Trajectory of COVID-19 and Long COVID in Adult Survivors","Introduction Cognitive functioning and psychological well-being are considered negatively affected by COVID-19. An estimated 15%-40% of COVID-19 patients report disrupted cognitive performance. Higher rates of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances are also reported post infection. Objectives We examined the profile of cognitive changes in a group of adults with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, compared to those without a COVID-19 diagnosis (cross-sectional between-subjects investigation);and for a subgroup, compared to their pre-COVID-19 cognitive function (longitudinal within-subjects investigation). Methods One hundred and twenty-one adults (57 with no known history of COVID-19;64 with confirmed COVID-19;17/64 with long COVID symptoms) were assessed online for psychological well-being and cognitive function (attention, processing speed, working memory, episodic memory and executive function). Pre-COVID-19 cognitive data were available for 56 of 121 adults (24 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19;22 with no known history of COVID-19) through the MyCognition database. Results The COVID-19 group showed reduced processing speed in both cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations, and also showed significant attentional impairment when examined cross-sectionally. Five long COVID symptoms (abdominal pain, chest pain, sore eyes/conjunctivitis, sore throat and vomiting/nausea) were associated with reduced performance in multiple cognitive domains. Higher levels of depression and anxiety were also present in the COVID-19 group but these symptoms were mostly unrelated to cognitive performance. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors, especially those with long COVID symptoms, are very likely to experience cognitive disruption.

"Psychotic-like Experiences during COVID-19 Outbreak: A survey from Pakistan","Introduction Despite the fact that adolescents have been at higher risk of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of pandemic on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) is not well described. Objectives The studyâ€™s objective is to evaluate if PLEs are induced in young individuals aged 18-24 during the pandemic. Methods A total of 201 college students from Pakistan (ages 18-24) were recruited for a cross-sectional research. We investigated the incidence of PLEs in Pakistan during the pandemic, their links to socio-demographic factors, COVID-19-related characteristics, depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties. Community Assessment of Psychic Experienceâ€™s positive symptom component (CAPE), Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and IBM SPSS 25 were used. Results CAPE-Frequency and CAPE-stress were positively associated with PHQ total (p&lt;0.0010);GAD total (p&lt;0.001);time spent indoors due to COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001). Psychiatric disorder other than bipolar disorder or psychosis (p&lt;0.001 for CAPE-frequency and stress), family history of psychiatric disorders (p&lt;0.001 for CAPE-frequency and stress), chronic medical disease (p=0.021 CAPE-frequency and p=0.026 CAPE-stress), illegal drug usage (p&lt;0.001 for CAPE-frequency and stress) were associated with CAPE-Frequency and CAPE-stress.

"Bidirectional Associations Between Covid-19 Infection And Mental Disorders","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic brought unbearable psychological pressure to people worldwide, because of serious threats to oneâ€™s physical health and life. From early stages of this pandemic, concerns have been raised about its effect on mental health. However, we still know little whether pre-existing psychiatric disorder (PD) affects the susceptibility and evolution of this infection. Objectives We aimed to assess the interactions between COVID-19 infection and PD. Methods We conducted a litterature review through pubmed database, using the keywords :Â«COVID 19Â», Â«psychiatryÂ», Â«mental disordersÂ», Â« schizophrenia Â», Â« anxiety Â», Â« depression Â», Â«insomniaÂ». Results On one hand, prior surveys suggested that the infection is associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric symptom. Mental health disturbances mostly include anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder. On the other hand, recent studies showed that patients with pre-existing mental disorders were associated with high susceptibility to be infected, increased risk of intensive care unit admission and a high mortality. The susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 was associated with pre-existing mood disorders, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Infection severity was associated with pre-existing or subsequent mood disorders and sleep disturbances;or a pre-extisting schizophrenia. Mortality is increased in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Conclusions The complicated interactions between COVID-19 infection and PD have several implications. Enhanced psychiatric follow-up should be considered for survivors of COVID-19. Besides, early detection and intervention for PD are needed to control morbidity and mortality induced by the COVID-19 infection.

"The difficult symbolic construction of physiciansâ€™ and nursesâ€™ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units: A qualitative study on reports at a university public hospital in Southeastern Brazil","Introduction Humanistic studies that explore symbolic aspects of the experience of working on the COVID-19 frontline are necessary. Do these professionals have psychic time to symbolize such acute experiences? We expect these preliminary findings of this research provide subsidies for discussing psychological management in groups with these professionals. Objectives To interpret emotional meanings reported by physicians and nurses on their experiences of working at COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods Clinical-qualitative design. Data collection with semi-directed interviews with open-ended questions in-depth applied to a sample of six professionals, closed by theoretical information saturation, in a Brazilian university general hospital. Trigger question: â€œTalk about psychological meanings of your experience in face of management of patients with COVID-19 at ICUâ€. Data treatment by the Seven Steps of the Clinical-Qualitative Content Analysis. Theoretical framework of Medical Psychology using Balintian concepts. Results We raised 3 categories. (1) Psychic time and absence of symbolization in face of the pandemic;(2) Denial as a defense or psychosocial adaptation mechanisms;(3) Tensions and family support: triggers of ambivalent emotional experiences. Conclusions Raw experience of COVID-19 pandemic did not allow for realization of symbolization. Psychological defenses are manifested, either to maintain balance or to deny the existence of dangers related to mental health. Presence of families and health team confirm that the feeling of loneliness is avoided. Anxieties related to the fear of contamination are recurrent. There is dual relationship regarding the emotional experiences of health professionals, but the data point to importance of looking at how these individuals perceive and experience the pandemic.

"Media trust during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine","Introduction The worldwide pandemic exacerbated the new role of the media.If previously the discussion was on whether new or traditional media had primacy in popularity and exposure, nowadays the question is whether communicating health issues through social and traditional media leads to understanding their content better and to more trust in both types of media. Objectives We set the following objectives for this study:(1) to examine trust in the traditional and new media among university students,(2) according to the level of media trust to compose a psychological portrait,establish the most prevalent coping strategies,and emotional reactions to the pandemic. Methods 213 university students (55.9% women,Mage=19 years) were tested from December 2020-March 2021.We examined the attitude towards information on coronavirus presented in the media and to investigate the level of severity of neurotic states,the level of psychological stress,and basic coping strategies used by respondents. Results showed that although students generally prefer to use Internet news, trust in traditional media increased during the pandemic. We examined a general psychological portrait of young people derived from trust in the media. In the group of students who trust media information, we found indifference (39% of respondents) and helplessness (24.4%). In the group convinced that the media are hiding the actual state of affairs, anger prevailed (32.4%). The third group, confident that the media exaggerate everything, experienced indifference and anger (38.5% and 32.7%, respectively). Conclusions We may conclude that desire to learn more accurate and unbiased information firsthand indicates studentsâ€™ attitude towards traditional media as more reliable sources of information.

"Eating Disorders","Covid had a profound impact on services for eating disorders because of the huge increase in demand. Nevertheless, services quickly adopted a virtual form of working. This rapid change in prevalence was attributed to a number of factors, including a general increase in fear and fragmented social functioning, with a specific accentuation of higher risk associated with body weight. Recent advances in the conceptualisation of eating disorders include a move from a transdiagnostic to a more to a personalised approach. For example, it has been further demonstrated that reducing the duration of untreated illness within three years of onset is associated with a better outcome (1). This has led to the rollout of FREED, an early intervention service in the UK. Genetic associations have been compared and contrasted across the spectrum of eating disorders. People with binge eating disorders share a profile with those at risk of metabolic syndrome whereas people with anorexia nervosa have the opposite profile (2). This reconceptualization of eating disorders as conditions with both brain and body underpinnings has led to new treatment approaches. For example, there have been small proof of concept studies in which metreleptin has been administered. These show promise with rapid reductions in depression and other symptoms (3, 4). Meanwhile the value of â€œexperts by experience,â€ in co designing and delivering services is an area of active investigation which offers the much needed potential of improving treatment outcomes (5).

"Integrated efforts to promote mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Reflecting on the experience of a university helpline","Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is affecting numerous dimensions of our society since the beginning of the outbreak. A significant increase in emotional distress was expected in the general population, particularly among the high-risk groups such as the oldest, chronic patients, healthcare professionals, and psychopathology vulnerable people. There was an urgent need to adapt and create solutions to promote mental health. Given the recommendations to minimize face-to-face interactions, several helplines were widely developed. Objectives In this work, we aim to reflect on the experience of a university helpline, that integrated efforts with the regional mental health care services. Methods A University helpline was created to give support to the regional community outside academia. The team was created on an online teamwork platform, to communicate through the chat, carry videoconference meetings, and store useful files. A Manchester screening decision tree was adopted, to define a set of guidelines to provide support to the callers, based mainly on the guidelines defined by the Order of Portuguese Psychologists. Liaison with the mental health care services, including other specific helplines, was established. Results Notwithstanding all the efforts, the number of received calls was scarce, similarly to helplines created by other national universities and by other entities. Conclusions A new approach to psychological intervention in crisis is needed, maintaining integrated efforts, and taking advantage of the opportunity to foster personalized mental health care in the digital era. It is important to continuously assess the value of integrated efforts in patient care and to the healthcare system.","Torres, A.; Santos, I.

"Sport trainings as a stress prophylactic mean during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic assumed as an additional stress factor for people due to extraordinary work conditions, unclear expectations of the future, anxiety about the self-health and health of close people (Samanta et al., 2020;Pascale, 2020). Sport training can be considered as a mean of stress consequences prevention during COVID-19 pandemic (Jim<U+0435>nez-Pav<U+043E>n et al., 2020). It is known that moderate physical loads are related to strengthening the immune system and reducing the risk of disease, depression, anxiety (Landers, 1996;Schwellnus et al., 2016). Some authors recommend to maintain an active lifestyle in the COVID-19 period (Mattioli et al, 2020). Objectives The study was held in 62 professionals from different fields, who work remotely during the self-isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic and aimed to estimate sports trainings opportunities as a means of preventing stress of professionals in various fields of activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The assessment methods included: 1) authorâ€™s questionnaire about the attitude towards sports trainings;2) A.B. Leonovaâ€™s â€œChronic fatigueâ€ and â€œChronic stressâ€;3) Ch. Spilbergerâ€™s â€œTrait anxietyâ€. Results The results revealed that the low level of chronic stress (U=82;p=0,015), chronic fatigue (U=82;p=0,015) and trait anxiety (U=79;p=0,011) is more typical for those surveyed who experienced COVID-19 symptoms and engaged in sports trainings with moderate loads than those people with COVID-19 symptoms who did not attend sport trainings.

"Repeat Emergency Visits for Mental Health Patients: Before and during the Covid19 pandemic","Introduction Frequent users of Emergency Departments (EDs) are a diverse group accounting for disproportionate EDs visits. Psychiatric patients are more likely to visit EDs (Slankamenac, 2020). EDs utilisation by psychiatric patients increased by 4.4% during COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives to determine frequent users characteristics within an Ottawa University Hospital, and assess Covid19 impact on overutilization of EDs compared to other hospitals. Methods Retrospective study of repeat visits characteristics, data extracted from EMR database. Repeat visits defined as no less than 30 days first visit to any EDs. Period of observation: March 1st, 2018 - February 28th, 2021 Results. Results 64% EDS visits for MH, 35% for addictions. More men (57%), age groups: 16-34 y.o. (41%), 34-64 y.o. (51%), 65 +y.o. (8%). Top presenting reasons: suicidality, self-harm, depression (40.5%). Anxiety, situational crisis (16%), bizarre behavior (12%). Most prevalent diagnoses: schizophrenia (28.7%), stress and anxiety (25.2%), personality disorders (13.5%) and depressive episode (10.6%). Only 35.1% admitted after repeat ED visits, 35.1% came by ambulance. Increase during peak pandemic exceeding 20%. Clearly pandemic created more pressures for MH services needs.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on General Hospital Physicians Work and Mental Health: An International Cross Sectional Study","COVID-19 pandemic had an important impact in mental health across all countries and populations. However, health care professionals, particularly those in the front line have been subjected to increased levels of stress, workload, deterioration of work environment and working conditions while potentially being afraid of contracting the infection themselves or infecting love ones due to the higher risk of contagion when dealing with infected patients. Some studies have stressed out this impact showing increased levels of burnout, depression, hopelessness, stress and post-traumatic stress in all physicians however, the impact of the pandemic may have been different depending on the specialty. We intended to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic for doctors working at general hospitals and liaison psychiatrists dealing with COVID-19 patients in Europe. We developed and applied online questionnaires to physicians working at general hospitals and psychiatrists working at liaison services, in different European countries (Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Poland, Croatia), in order to determine what were their working conditions and it they reported mental health symptoms during the pandemic. This questionnaire included demographic data, questions about working conditions when dealing with general and COVID patients and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS).

"A case of trazodone induced prolonged hypogeusia","Introduction Plenty of antidepressants have been reported to induce unpleasant tastes and/or odors as well as altered chemosensations when administered alone or in combination with other medications. Trazodone induced hypogeusia (decreased taste sensation) is a rare side effect. In this report, we would like to present a male patient with with hypogeusia after trazodona use and persisting for 3 months after the drug was discontinued will be discussed. Objectives A 52-year-old male, Trazodone 50 mg/day was started 4 months ago due to difficulty in falling asleep. On the 25th day of her daily treatment, her sense of taste began to decrease and gradually became more severe. So he stopped his treatment and he applied to the internal medicine and neurology polyclinics. Routine blood tests were within normal limits. To rule out the possibility of covid 19, 2 pcr tests were done and it was found negative. No recommendations other than chewing gum.

"Film-based resources for grief management in medical education","Introduction Grief and bereavement are commonplace in clinical practice but have become a more pervasive issue because of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Consequently, the need for investigations, learning, and education about complicated grief and prolonged grief have been highlighted. Meanwhile, film-based teaching resources concerning grief care have been employed to complement curricula in medical education. Objectives To explore how the grieving experience can be better communicated and mitigated, and explain how a film-based resource can be applied to improve the understanding of this issue. Methods We reviewed and analyzed the meaning and cause of complicated, prolonged, disenfranchised grief, as well as related experiences (e.g., survivor guilt) featured in selected films. We discussed the interpretation of these films with medical students and faculty, based on a previously described approach [1]. Results We recaptured the roles of empathic communications and resilience skills in grief care. They bring a sense of coherence (SOC) or meaning to life by prompting the sharing of grief experiences, helping to reconstruct and contextualize a personâ€™s loss, and assuaging feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. Incidentally, recent studies have suggested that complicated and prolonged grief involves alterations in brain functioning of the reward system. Conclusions This film-based approach utilizes vicarious experiences to better understand grief management. It allows the learner to more easily recognize that SOC, flexible situation-adjusted empathy, and the sharing of resources for improved communication to promote self-care are essential for patients, their families, as well as psychiatrists themselves.

"The dark side of social ties: coronavirus 2019-induced fear and intergroup conflicts","Introduction The relationship between fear and social ties has been frequently discussed in the context of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but investigation of the nature of these experiences is still insufficient. Research suggests that people who respect social ties often experience better mental health outcomes. However, when socially isolated, excluded, or subjected to rumors, they may become more vulnerable to criticism, shame, and fear. Another potential problem of the COVID-19 pandemic is intergroup prejudice and distrust. Objectives To examine the development and mitigation of social ties, fears, and biases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We applied discourse analysis to relevant literature and their associated references that incorporated textual, social, and cognitive dimensions. The main databases used were PubMed and Web of Science. Results Although the importance of social ties was loudly vocalized as lessening loneliness, people also globally described stigma-related fear or intergroup conflicts. The sense of social ties appeared disproportionately amplified in the form of an in-group identity, group pressures, and empathic distress. Some people overstated worries about their COVID-19-positive status being revealed to others and causing distress for them. Furthermore, discrimination and vigilantism were manifested with fear-related stereotyping and hostility. Conclusions Our findings support the view that social ties can indeed function as both risk and protective factors. Context-adjusted perspectives and reciprocal dialogs seem crucial to alleviate these negative impacts. The subsequent mitigation of misunderstandings, fear-induced bias, and maladaptive distress appraisal may lead to a more reasonable and flexible recognition of social ties.

"An application for identification and stratification psychological crisis among pandemic frontline healthcare workers","Introduction The COVID-MENTA Screening Program was developed to monitor the mental health of frontline healthcare professionals and identify those at high risk for suicide at the Kiskunhalas Mobile Disease Control Hospital. Objectives Our post hoc analysis aimed to investigate the association between psychological distress and suicide ideation based on passively collected data during the screening work. Methods A sample of 50 healthcare professionals was analyzed from 167 participants in the COVID-MENTA Screening Program between the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was performed during the breaks of healthcare professionals at work. Half of the group (N=25) perceived severe distress (scored &gt; 5/10 on Distress Thermometer). The crisis monitoring application was based on Klonsky and Mayâ€™s 3-step theory (2015) and was built by adapting the questions on the appropriate international scales (Psychache Scale, Beckâ€™s Hopelessness Scale, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Suicide Capacity Scale).

"COVID-MENTA: an integrated mental health protection system for pandemic frontline healthcare workers","Introduction At Kiskunhalas Semmelweis Hospital, a special mobile container hospital was set up to care for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. Objectives We aimed to create a proactive integrated mental health protection system for the frontline healthcare workers that provides an opportunity for psychophysiological monitoring of stress and crisis during shifts, as well as providing staff with more lasting methods of coping with difficulties. Methods From the ascending branch of the second wave, every two weeks on the workersâ€™ rest day, mental helpers initiated a phone call to each employee participating in the program. If it was necessary, we provided psychological counseling, crisis intervention, brief psychotherapy, and psychopharmacotherapy. In addition, self-operated psychophysiological screening devices were used at the frontline work site, which provided an opportunity for continuous telemedicine monitoring. Results In our department, three psychologists and three psychiatrists kept in touch with an average of 150 frontline workers per month. Interventions were needed for a total of over 24% in December and January, over 17% in February and March, almost 9% in April, and only 4% in May. Helpers rated an average of two-thirds of these cases as moderate. They faced severe stress 2-3 times a month in sum, and for 2-3 workers needed medication. Conclusions Without a mental support system, self-report-based data suggest that nearly half of responders working at the frontline reached the threshold of clinically significant mental syndromes (Greenberg et al, 2021). Using our mental health support system, one-fifth of the workers needed intervention.

"Ms Noemi Monika Szeifert","Introduction Working in COVID â€“ 19 Health Care Units â€“ Psychological impacts (PTSD, Depression, Anxiety Disorders) Working in the frontline during COVID-19 has put under extreme psychological and physical pressure the health care workers. The severe psychological symptomps can emerge on short, mid and long term as well. Our research is focusing on the psychological impacts of front line health care workers. Objectives In our lecture, we summarize our reserach made in the National Traumatology Center, Budapest, Hungary among health care workers who worked in the front and in the second line during the most severe period of the pandemic in Hungary, and discuss probable risk factors for PTSD and chronic psychological distress related to COVID-19. Furthermore we make an overview on the most frequently used coping skills for dealing with the psychological stress caused by the pandemic among the health care workers. The sample taking was processed in July 2021, after 3 month the 3rd COVID â€“ 19 wave officially ended in Hungary. Methods 123 health care workers completed the online survey anonimously, included Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger Anxiety State Inventory, PTSD Checklist, Lazarus Coping Scale. Results 23% of HCW reported symptomps of depression, nearly 25% dealing with sleeping disorders and 38% with chronic fatigue, 42,50 % HCW suffering from anxiety disorders, 22% HCW experiencing symptomps of PTSD.

"Telepsychiatry for the Elderly","For many old people with mental health problems, access to psychotherapeutic and psychiatric help is often difficult. This is partly because going to a psychiatrist is still stigmatised, especially among the older generation. On the other hand, therapists with an interest in and competence for older people are often not sufficiently available even in the well-supplied western countries. In this situation, digitalisation offers various opportunities. Basically, the internet is a good way to promote health literacy. Classic psychoeducation can certainly be offered on the internet. And psychotherapy can also be administered with the help of the internet. Especially in the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibilities of internet-based therapies, for example Zoom or other techniques, were practised. This means that people with limited mobility can also receive therapy over long distances. This technology also makes it possible, for example, for the migrant population to receive therapy in their national language. All these possibilities are under development, but may become routine in the future. With the help of the digital possibilities, it is possible to organise helper conference. The professional exchange between relatives, family doctors, psychiatrists and other people in the help system can be easily organised in this way. The method also saves travel time, which is often not reimbursed in the health systems.

"Mental health of healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic: Analysis of the psychological problems faced by the healthcare workers over a period of three months during Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction SARS-COV 2 virus and the disease caused by the virus is a challenge for the healthcare workers since the beggining of the Covid-19 pandemic. Working with huge number of patient who need hospital care at the same time but also having scare information about the virus resulted with physical exhaustion, increased workload and mostly fear among the healthcare workers. Objectives The purpose of the study was to expand our knowledge about the mental health of the healthcare workers and explore most common psychological problems they faced during the Covid-19 pandemic over a period of three month. Methods All participants in the study work in the same public hospital in Skopje, North Macedonia in one of the following job positions: physicians, nurses, paramedics, and hygienists. They anonymously filled out a google form answering questions about their mental health. Questions in the form were created based on Beck Depression Scale and the GAD-7 Scale for Anxiety along with questions about the gender, age, and job position. Results The results we gained from this study are showing that the participants experienced insomnia, reduced concentration, intense feelings of restlessness and fatigue, less energy and mostly lack of job satisfaction.

"Dissociation and emotional dysregulation in pathological personalities related to the fear of SARS-COV-2: a case report","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic represented a serious strain on the mental health resilience worldwide. Implementation of restrictive rules implied the disruption of social networks, eliciting emotional exhaustion and intense response to fear. This was amplified by media spread of panic and fake news, representing risk factors for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fear can be dangerous, especially accounting premorbid psychopathological vulnerability, such as pathological personality traits. Emotional dysregulation increases fear levels, mediated by the relationship between emotional dysregulation and lack of tolerance. Objectives Clinical case presentation of patient who developed dissociative and behavioral symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Bibliographic research. Methods Bibliographic research using PubmedÂ®. Clinical file consultation and patient interviews. Results Heightened psychophysiological reactivity can result from the persistent fear experienced during a traumatic event and repeated memories related to it, leading to a sensitization of the response to fear. We present 57 year-old female patient, admitted to the COVID ward after trying to escape from home isolation due to positivity to COVID-19. In the hospital setting she developed dissociative symptoms, trying to escape from the ward and infect other people. Conclusions Intense fear responses to COVID-19 are likely explained by poor emotion regulation capacities as well as dissociative mechanisms. Studies have shown that this pandemic was experienced as a real traumatic event and some studies have found that it may lead to the development of PTSD. Pathological personality is positively related to PTSD symptoms, attributable to higher levels of mood instability, cognitive/perceptual disorders, interpersonal dysfunctions and negative affection.

"Attempted suicide and pregnancy in COVID-19Â´s times","Introduction Pregnancy is a special risk factor for suicide attempts among females (Andrew E. Czeizel et al. 2011). Situational factors such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have also been reported to impact on individualâ€™s mental health. Objectives Examine the effect of COVID-19 and its association with mental health and attempt suicide risk in pregnant population. Methods A cross-sectional study that includes 113 pregnant women from Spain, through an anonymous, voluntary and multiple response type online survey which included questions about socio demographic aspects, COVID-19â€™s aspects and mental health. Results Of the 112 pregnant patients surveyed, only 2 reported suicidal ideation. The age of the respondents was 32 and 33 years, both of whom were in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Both report that it was the first pregnancy and affirm a worsening of their economic situation since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of them did not have a partner / marriage and was living with a relative, in turn this respondent was unemployed. Both responded that they were â€œalwaysâ€ worried about the possible outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic and that their fears had increased, being difficult to control and let them pass. It is very relevant that both agree that they â€œneverâ€ felt that the professionals who carried out the pregnancy controls asked or inquired about their current state of mental health. Conclusions Antepartum suicidal ideation is an important and common complication of pregnancy, specially in COVID-19â€™s times, healthcare professionals who follow pregnancy should detect high-risk suicidal patients and be able to carry out a suicide prevention program.","Solis, M.

"Zooming in on Agoraphobic Behaviors: a Case Study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic brought many new challenges that people had to overcome with ingenuity. However, many patients already suffering with psychiatric diseases saw their access to conventional health care limited, aggravating their statuses. E-Medicine is the branch of health care that provides access through the Internet, and it has been growing in the last few years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care workers shifted towards E-Medicine, aiming to provide support to patients, especially with the social distance policies that were implemented worldwide. Objectives Provide an example of how e-Medicine can be a tool in establishing a therapeutic alliance, and patient follow-up Methods Case report with a brief literature review on the subject Results RG is a 19-year-old female that contacts her family doctor through e-mail, expressing concerns over not being able to leave her house for over a year, also manifesting anxiety and depressed humor. This started in April 2020 and was slowly worsening throughout the year, culminating in a panic attack. RG started counselling and follow-up appointments via Internet and started treatment with vortioxetine. Three months later, improvements were stated, namely decreased anxiety, better sleep patterns, and leaving the house for small periods. Conclusions Without E-Medicine, RG wouldnâ€™t be as able to reach out to her family doctor, and follow-up would be much more arduous since the patient avoided leaving her house, and telephone appointments lack the visual aspect of the clinical interview.

"The individual patterns of anxieties and defense mechanisms in COVID pandemic context","Introduction The COVID-pandemic context is characterized by a global ambiguity, reflecting the unexpected onset of pandemic, unpredictability and amplitude of the related dangers, questionability and the side effects of the policy measures used to protect people. Objectives The development of theoretical framework for understanding variability in the reactions to COVID situation and self-regulatory mechanisms. Methods Conceptualization and analysis of individual psychotherapy cases in the framework of psychodynamic approach. Results Five typical patterns of anxiety, defensive functioning and mentalization structures were identified: Paranoial pattern is marked by flooding with persecutory anxiety, exaggerated subjective uncertainty. reflected in chaotic boundlessness, incoherence, fantasies of hostility, splitting and polarization of self and others. Depressive pattern reflects inability to sustain ambiguity due to deficiency of internal supports, overly dependence on others, conformity, obedience to authority and denial of personal standards and individuality. Noogenic pattern refers to negative affective states, generated by the ambiguity, contradictions and ambivalence of information. The means to regulate it include the lowering of the level of psychical functioning, with cognitive simplification, preference for order, routine and predictability. Transgression pattern suggests maniacal fascination with the dissipation of limits, normative restraints and rules, and the triumph of the narcissistic-perfectionist permissiveness. Constructivity pattern consists of the pleasure from explorations and insights, creation of new meanings, creative reappraisal and reconstruction of ambiguous situations.

"Peculiarities of mentalization that hamper consultations of patients with BPD","Introduction The uncertainty of COVID-pandemia, vital danger and disruptions in the habitual social contacts can be paralleled to the experiences of severe emotional stress and violence, usually found in the people with Borderline Personality Disorder. Both can be regarded as hampering the ability to categorize and express thoughts, feelings and experiences. The implementation of distant forms of psychological counseling may accentuate the mentalization deficiency. Objectives To develop a theoretical framework for an empirical typology of impairments of mentalization. Methods The model of consciousness proposed by L.S. Vygotsky was used for theoretical generalization of the levels of categorical structures of mentalization observed in previous empirical studies. Results The following structures were identified: (1) the syncretic type of mentalization with low differentiation and complexity of object representations, their negative affective tone, autistic, chaotically mutable motivation and low emotional investment in relationships were described in patients with schizotypal disorders;(2) the â€œcomplexâ€ type, with literal, non-generalized, field-dependent and rigid, or unstable, representation of the self, others and relationships as a result of the â€œfusionâ€ of cognitive representations with the current emotional states. Similar types of mentalization were previously described in people with BPD and self-harming behavior (Sokolova, Laisheva, 2017). Conclusions The â€™syncreticâ€™ and â€™complexâ€™ types of mentalization produce affective-cognitive distortions of the image of a psychotherapist, hamper the understanding of the conditional and metaphorical character of the therapeutic process, render difficult the de-traumatization of the unbearable experiences, and lessen the effectiveness of consultations of people with BPD.

"Clozapine induced pneumonia: A case report of diagnostic difficulties in the time of Covid-19","Introduction Clozapine is a drug that can cause several side effects. Among the less commonly described is a drug-induced lung disease. Due to its non-specific clinical presentation, it represents a diagnostic challenge. The diagnosis is made based on: 1. Association of exposure to the agent and development of symptoms, 2. Pulmonary infiltration, 3. Exclusion of other causes, 4. Withdrawal of symptoms when the agent is excluded from therapy. To date, there have been only a few descriptions of this condition. Objectives Case report of rare side effect of clozapine. Methods Case report Results Case report: male patient (37) with schizophrenia, was hospitalized after a brutal suicide attempt. The PCR test for COVID-19 that was routinely performed on admission was negative. After the introduction of clozapine into therapy, the patient became febrile. There was a drop in oxygen saturation, a Lung CT scan showed inflammatory changes (â€žground-glass opacitiesâ€œ), and COVID-19 pneumonia was suspected. Due to the worsening of the mental state, the dose of clozapine was increased. The physical condition further deteriorated: febrile, sO2 declining. After repeated PCR tests for COVID-19 (all negative), interstitial pneumonia caused by clozapine was suspected, and clozapine was excluded from therapy. The physical condition started to improve. Quetiapine was introduced, and occasional episodes of agitation were relieved with intramuscular diazepam. In the following days, the patientâ€™s mental state improved and he was discharged. Conclusions Despite its superiority over other antipsychotics, clozapine was with good rationale ranked third in treatment guidelines for schizophrenia.

Results Students bereaving the death of a significant other (n=93, 15.7%;n=25, 26.9% reported cause was SARS-CoV-2;time since death: &lt; 3 months to 1-year), compared to those who did not (n= 498;84.3%), described poorer psychological health, higher psychological distress (depression, anxiety, lack of control) and sleep difficulties, higher levels of stress (higher impact of COVID pandemic in daily life, and higher behavior changes in response to COVID-19) and more social isolation. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic-related stress is a source of additional stress for bereaved students. Grief is also associated with social isolation, poor mental health (depression, anxiety, lack of control) and sleep difficulties. Screening efforts, guidance, and counseling from professionals of mental health care, primary health care, and universities health care services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic could be extremely beneficial for bereaved students, particularly for those at higher risk of developing prolonged grief disorder.

"The role of financial stress in mental health changes during COVID-19","Using longitudinal data before and during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic for a representative sample of Dutch households, we examined the role of financial stress, defined as the subjective experience of lacking financial resources to cope with demands, in mental health changes. Also, we examined financial stress and mental health relations with householdsâ€™ income, savings, and debts. The data revealed that average mental health did not change during the first six months of the pandemic but showed considerable underlying heterogeneity. Results showed that financial stress changes significantly explained this heterogeneity. Increases in financial stress predicted decreases in mental health, whereas decreases in financial stress predicted increases in mental health. While income did not explain financial stress changes, fewer savings and more debts were related to increased financial stress, which was, in turn, negatively related to mental health. We discuss the implications of our findings for mental health care and financial security policy and provide suggestions for future research.","Simonse, Olaf, Van Dijk, Wilco W.; Van Dillen, Lotte F.; Van Dijk, Eric","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+role+of+financial+stress+in+mental+health+changes+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: npj Mental Health Research; 1(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40456,""
"The Development of a Complex FEP Program at Semmelweis University","Introduction First episode psychosis (FEP) programs target the first 3-5 years after the first manifestation of a psychotic episode. Although follow-up results after 10-15 years are mixed, reported results of the first 5-10 years are promising in improving relapse prevention, functional outcomes and reducing mental health care costs, compared to treatment as usual. Objectives Our objective was to develop the first complex FEP program in Hungary. Methods Male and female inpatients, (age:17-40years), hospitalized due to a first psychotic episode and consenting to participate, were included, since 2019 October. Drug induced psychosis and organic background in the etiology of the psychotic episode were excluded. Duration of the program is 2-3 years, based on the individual needs of the patients. The program provides detailed clinical and neuropsychological examinations, MRI, pharmacotherapy, various psychosocial interventions, and support group for relatives. Results Twenty-eight patients [15 male,13 female, mean age=22,4 (18-40)years] were included. The program has been repeatedly limited by COVID-19 pandemic. Psychiatric control, pharmacotherapy, psychoeducation and supportive therapy, however could be continously provided via telepsychiatry, even during the lockdown. During the first 2 years, 90% of the patients remained in treatment, showed good compliance with pharmacotherapy;10% of the patients were rehospitalized due to relapse. In the presentation, besides clinical experiences, preliminary clinical outcome data will also be presented. Conclusions The first complex FEP program in Hungary, although limited repeatedly by the pandemic, show promising clinical results with low relapse rates and high level of adherence to therapy in the first 2 years after a first psychotic episode.

"Depression and health-related quality of life in critical COVID-19 survivors","Introduction Long-term neuropsychiatric consequences of critical illness are well known. Therefore, it is expected that critical COVID-19 patients might also present several psychiatric symptoms such as depression, with inevitable negative effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), commonly used as an indicator of illness and treatment impact. Objectives To identify depressive symptoms in critical COVID-19 survivors and to examine its association with HRQoL domains. Methods This preliminary study involved critical COVID-19 patients admitted into the Intensive Care Medicine Department (ICMD) of a University Hospital, between October and December of 2020. Patients with an ICMD length of stay (LoS)=24h, terminal illness, major auditory loss, or inability to communicate at the follow-up time were excluded. From 1-2 months after discharge, all participants were evaluated by telephone at follow-up appointment, with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (depression) and EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level EQ-5D-5L (HRQoL). This study is part of the longitudinal MAPA project. Results Eighty-three patients were included with a median age of 63 years (range: 31-86) and the majority were male (63%). The most reported problems on EQ-5D-5L domains were usual activities (82%) and mobility (76%). About 27% presented depressive symptoms, and with more problems of self-care (68%vs41%;p=0.029), pain/discomfort (86%vs49%;p=0.002), and anxiety/depression (96%vs54%;p&lt;0.001). Conclusions These preliminary results are in line in previous studies in critical COVID-19 survivors, with depression being associated with worse HRQoL. Bearing this in mind, follow-up approaches with an early screening and treatment of these psychiatric symptoms will be fundamental to optimize the recovery of these patients.

"The intensity of coronavirus anxiety and its associations with depressive symptoms and burnout among Polish nurses and firefighters: a preliminary cross-sectional study","Introduction Nurses and firefighters are professions characterized by exposure to high occupational stress. Objectives The purpose of the present study was to investigate the intensity of coronavirus anxiety and its associations with depressive symptoms and burnout in samples of Polish nurses and firefighters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Fifty nurses and 55 firefighters were recruited for the study. Respondents were administered the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlations and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data. Results Nurses scored significantly higher than firefighters on the CAS (M = 2.76, SD = 4.18 vs. M = 1.15, SD = 2.24;p &lt; 0.05), the CESD-R (M = 11.64, SD = 10.80 vs. M = 5.85, SD = 7.34;p &lt; 0.01) and both dimensions of the OLBI, i.e. exhaustion (M = 2.38, SD = 0.56 vs. M = 1.91, SD = 0.55;p &lt; 0.001) and disengagement from work (M = 2.28, SD = 0.48 vs. M = 1.93, SD = 0.43;p &lt; 0.001). In the both study groups coronavirus anxiety significantly correlated with depressive symptoms and exhaustion, and only in nurses also with disengagement from work. Conclusions This study demonstrated that coronavirus anxiety was more pronounced in nurses than in firefighters.

"Psychological impact of COVID19 outbreak and coping strategies among Tunisian medical students","Introduction The COVID19 pandemic came with unprecedented measures that impacted every aspect of the studentâ€™s life making them vulnerable to psychological distress. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms in relation to the coping strategies during the COVID19 pandemic among medical students. Methods We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study among Tunisian medical students. We used an anonymous survey comprising sociodemographic characteristics, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and the brief COPE. Results A total of 216 students participated in the study;78% were female and most respondents were enrolled in first and second year of medical studies (53%). The frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively 28% and 40%;females experienced significantly higher depression and anxiety scores (p&lt;10Â¯Â³ and p=0.02 respectively). Most used coping strategies were self-blame, planning, acceptance, distraction, positive reframing, active coping and religion (99%-96%). The least used coping strategies were substance use (13%) and denial (52%). We found that gender was associated with a significant difference in the coping styles where females scored higher on religious coping and denial whereas males used more humor coping. Depression and anxiety were significantly associated with denial coping. Humor, acceptance, positive reframing and active coping were significantly associated with lower depression rates. Humor coping and active coping were associated with lower anxiety rates. Conclusions Our study shows alarming rates of depression and anxiety among Tunisian medical students during the COVID19 pandemic.

Objectives Children with mental health issues are heavily dependent upon the attitude of their caregivers towards disease control and prevention. There is also a high risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in the mental health clinics (hospitals) for children. Methods The data from the Municipal Department of Health and Medical records of patients who were treated at the clinic from January to June in 2019 were compared. Statistical processing was carried out using the Chi-Square for 2 x 2 Contingency Table method. Results The study demonstrated the statistically significant difference in the types of mental health conditions that require more attention and in-patient emergency treatment options during the pandemic, including decompensation, exacerbation or manifestation of endogenous diseases, anorexia nervosa and suicidal manifestations. To prevent the spread of infection, a specific separate clinical unit was created for patients with severe mental health disorders and symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, multiple changes were implemented in treatment protocols, staff duties and interactions with the patientsâ€™ caregivers. Conclusions There was a higher demand for in-patient emergency treatment for children with severe mental health disorders in 2020, as compared to 2019.

"Perceived social support as a factor in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Support from a different sources can have a critical impact on a personâ€™s mental health in a stressful situation. In situations of prolonged stress, it is necessary to identify the links between specific sources of support and mental health. Objectives To identify the connections between different sources of social support and mental health indicators in different periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods DASS (Lovibond, Lovibond, 1995) and MSPSS (Zimet et al., 1988) were applied. The study involved 855 people aged from 18 to 60 years (M=32.9;SD=13.88). The study was conducted online in the spring of 2020 (N=426) and in the winter of 2021 (N=429). Results Post Hoc Scheffe revealed that perceived peer support in spring 2020 was significantly lower than in winter 2021 (p&lt;0.05). With Pearson correlation coefficient, we tested the connections between perceived social support from family, friends, and significant others and the level of depression, anxiety, and stress. In spring 2020, all mental health indicators were associated with the perceived social support from all three sources (friends, family, and significant others). In the winter of 2021, depression levels were still associated with the perceived social support from all three sources, while the levels of anxiety and stress were associated only with perceived family support. Conclusions Thus, the study has revealed the dynamics in dependence of mental health indicators on the perceived social support from various sources at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Dynamics of indicators of mental health and mental wellbeing among university students during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction University studentsâ€™ lifestyle has changed dramatically due to the spread of COVID-19. They had to face adaptation to the online learning format, as well as strict and long-term restriction of social contacts. Objectives To trace the dynamics in the main indicators of mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress) and mental wellbeing among students during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods DASS (Lovibond, Lovibond, 1995) and WEMWBS (Tennant et al., 2007) were applied in the research. The study involved 733 students at Russian universities aged from 18 to 23 years (M=20.0;SD=3.23), of which 88.1% were girls. The same design was used in the spring (N=245), in the autumn of 2020 (N=270) and in the winter of 2021 (N=218). Results It was found that the indicators for all DASS scales significantly differ (p&lt;0.05) across the three periods. With Post Hoc Scheffe, it was shown that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in autumn 2020 and winter 2021 were significantly higher than in spring 2020 (p&lt;0.05).

European countries experienced a tragic growth in the number of Covid-19 cases although several restrictions have been imposed. Objectives The study is aimed to describe the first experience of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in the city of Bergamo, Northern Italy. Methods The most relevant clinical characteristics of aged patients with COVID-19 and mental disorders have been described. Results According to the experience of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, medical departments, after appropriate training of all healthcare workers, have been rapidly converted into specific units aimed at treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Specifically, we directly observed a rapidly growing request of psychiatric interventions in aged patients with COVID-19 infection due to the emergence of severe delirium (mainly hyperkinetic) which was reported in approximately 30-50% of cases increasing with age, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. When compared with younger subjects, we found that subjects aged 65 or above with prolonged hospitalization in our hospital are more vulnerable to: 1) environmental factors (e.g., social isolation and distance from family members, stay in intensive/subintensive units, communication difficulties due to therapeutic devices);2) individual factors (e.g., COVID-19 possible neurotropic properties, impairments in insight and cognitive dysfunctions, comorbid medical conditions, and use of multiple medications).

"The psychological burden of long-term care facilities personnel during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic â€“ a national survey in poland","Introduction The high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are observed among residents in long-term care facilities (LTCF) worldwide. Employees of LTCF, who are facing a critical epidemiological situation endangering the vulnerable residents, are exposed to pandemicâ€™s psychological consequences daily. Objectives The main aim of this study was to assess psychological consequences (somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression) among LTCF employees exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis. Moreover, we investigated if factors such as: personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, safety guidelines or access to psychiatric and psychological support at the workplace, correlated with the level of psychological distress experienced by personnel. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among personnel of LTCF in Poland. The survey consisted of the sociodemographic section, the authorsâ€™ questionnaire with questions related to COVID-19 exposure, working conditions, access to PPE and mental health services, GHQ Questionnaire-28. Results show that access to PPE (P= .018), to workplace safety guidelines (P= .031), psychological support at workplace (P&lt;0.01), fixed shift schedule (P= .05) and feeling that the right number of staff are employed in the workplace (P= .009), were related to the lower severity of psychopathological symptoms evaluated with the GHQ-28. Conclusions The study indicates an evidence that LTCF personnel are susceptible to the development of anxiety, depression, insomnia and social dysfunction during the pandemic crisis. However, these can be modified by: access to PPE, safety guidelines and psychological support.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals and associated factors: A review of literature","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic represents a stressful event for humanity. The spread of this disease mainly affects health professionals and interests them closely. Objectives Identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare personnels and associated factors exposing them to increased psychological fragility. Methods The current article is a narrative review of the existing literature. A search on electronic database like PubMed was undertaken using the search terms â€œcoronavirus mental health healthcare workersâ€. 20 articles were included in this review. Results Studies revealed that health care workers have prensented considerable psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, stress, insomnia, somatization, mental and physical exhaustion, addiction and obssessive compulsive symptoms. The prevalence of these symptoms varies from study to another with almost a more notable prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The following factors that predispose to developing mental distress were noted: being a frontline health worker, having direct contact with infected patients, working in a city with a high infection rate, female sex, isolation, being a suspected case, stigmatization, change of organization, lack of materials, lack of information, lack of communication, lack of support, fear of contamination or of contaminating loved ones, having an organic pathology.

"Mechanisms and Effectiveness of Online CB-ART Interventions in Reducing Covid-19-related Distress","Introduction The combination of cognitive behavioral interventions and art therapy provides a unique tool for image transformation as a strategy for managing distress in extremely stressful situations. Previous studies offer evidence of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral- and art-based (CB-ART) interventions in reducing stress related to community crises such as wars and earthquakes. Objectives This study aimed to extend current knowledge by investigating the effectiveness of CB-ART interventions in the Covid-19 context, and the mechanisms underlying them. Methods Online CB-ART interventions were implemented during the first national lockdown in Israel with 15 women. The intervention included drawing three pictures related to: (1) Covid-19-related emotions and thoughts;(2) resources that may help them cope with the pandemic outcomes;and (3) integration of the stressful image and the resource picture. To examine the intervention effect, participantsâ€™ Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs) values were measured using a pre-post design. Results Participantsâ€™ initial distress levels decreased on completion of the intervention. Another key finding is the reduction of the initial size of the stressful image and enlargement of the resource images within the integrated drawing. This may be the proposed mechanisms underlying the reduction of the SUDs values. Conclusions The new perspective derived from the compositional transformations performed by the participants may have increased their sense of control and competence, enabling them to perceive the Covid-19-related stressors as less threatening. The described art-based tool can be easily implemented online by mental health professionals with diverse populations in times of community crises.

"The Impact of Violence and Abuse on Mental Health of Women â€“ Current Data","Violence against women is widely recognised as a violation of human rights and a public health problem. The most common forms of violence against women are domestic abuse and sexual violence, and victimisation is associated with an increased risk of mental disorders. It is reported that a three times increase in the likelihood of depressive disorders, a four times increase in the likelihood of anxiety disorders, and a seven times increase in the likelihood of post-traumatic disorder (PTSD) for women who have experienced domestic violence and abuse. Significant associations between intimate partner violence and symptoms of psychosis, substance misuse, and eating disorders have also been reported. Furthermore, systematic reviews of predominantly cross-sectional studies report consistent relationships between being a victim of domestic violence and abuse and having mental disorders across the diagnostic spectrum for men and women, but since women are more likely to be victims, the population attributable fractions are higher for women. In this presentation, the focus will also be on clinical guidance on the role of mental health professionals in identifying violence against women and responding appropriately, poor identification persists and can lead to non-engagement with services and poor response to treatment. After a literature review, we will present and discuss current data from parental consultation and a survey on violence during the Covid-19 pandemic in Berlin.

"Suicide presentation and the risk at the time of the mandatory quarantine for the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic: medico-legal and forensic aspects","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic is the most important health emergency of the 21st century. Since the high number of infected people and as there is still no specific therapy worldwide, the pandemic has been countered through the application of prevention measures based on social distancing and home isolation. These elements are known risk factors for the development of various psychiatric conditions. From a forensic point of view, these pathologies are related to a high suicide rate. Objectives It is no coincidence that during the previous pandemics that have occurred in history there has been a significant increase in suicides. By this work, we therefore want to highlight the psychological consequences of a pandemic and the importance of preventive strategies. Methods It is important to focus not only on physical well-being but also on the psychological aspects that the pandemic produces in the daily life of each individual Results If the infecting agent causes the death of millions of people around the world, the socio-economic context that is created indirectly determines as many deaths. Conclusions Therefore it is necessary to underline how it is advisable to implement preventive measures in order to significantly reduce deaths from suicide, a problem with an important impact in the social and forensic fields.

"Tunisianâ€™s largest Psychiatric emergency department in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction General Lockdown was first declared in Tunisia from March 20th to May 4th 2020 to contain the spread of COVID19 pandemic, the last sanitary lockdown period was declared from July 12th to august 1st in 2021. Psychiatric emergency access and consultation has been affected by the confinement. RAZI Hospital Emergency Department (RHED) is the only emergency department in Tunisia specialized in psychiatry. Thus making it the most representative psychiatric emergency health care service in Tunisia. Objectives To assess changes in patients flow and admission rates in RHED in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown Methods We examined emergency room records and the hospitalâ€™s computer admission database during the first and the last COVID19 lockdowns and compared it to the same period of the previous year. Results The number of consultations was significantly lower in 2020 lockdown (N = 577) compared the same period in 2019 (N = 1525) (p&lt;10-3). We observed a drop in RHED emergency hospitalization rate from 45.57% to 29.81% during this study period. The number of consultations per day was significantly lower during the first lockdown (N= 12.44) compared to the last lockdown (N=26.61) (p&lt;10-3), the hospitalization rate rose from 29.81% during the first lockdown to 44.36% during the last.

"The early Impact of stress related to COVID-19 Pandemic on physicians in Tunisia","Introduction Contagious disease outbreaks can have major repercussions on medical stuff. Doctors in Tunisia were requested to act as the first-line filter in managing active cases during the beginning of COVID19 pandemic. Objectives This study aims to assess perceived stress in Tunisian doctors during COVID19 pandemic early stages and to identify factors associated to stress in order to guide prevention strategies. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey, from April 18th 2020 to June 6th 2020. A 62-item semi-structured survey was created, consisting of 5 series of questions and scales. Linear regression models were performed to identify the associations between the study variables and the perceived stress score of the participants. Results We included 203 physicians in this study. Stress levels were high among Tunisian doctors with a mean perceived stress score (PSS) of 28.6. One hundred fifteen participants (56.3%) scored for high PSS. This study identified vulnerable subgroups too stress. The female gender, working in the capital and working in critical medicine units were risk factors for high PSS. Managing COVID19 patients was not itself correlated to stress, however social isolation, stigma and luck of access to information were correlated to high stress levels. Conclusions Several stressors can affect the well-being of doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can lead to adverse psychosocial outcomes.

"Anxiety and Depression in Ireland during COVID-19 â€“ a narrative review","Introduction Ireland has been one of the worst affected countries affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Many primary studies from Ireland have documented prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders during the pandemic and their correlates. Objectives To study the prevalence range of anxiety and depression in Ireland, and their correlates during the pandemic. Methods We systematically searched Pubmed, PsycInfo and the WHO COVID-19 global research database using key words ( January 2020 - September 2021). We removed duplicates and extracted data into an excel database and carried out a narrative synthesis of the extracted data. Results From a total 127 studies, we included 22 studies that met our criteria in our narrative review. Depending on the tool used and the type of population studied, the prevalence of general anxiety disorders varied between 20% and 49.5% while prevalence of depressive disorders ranged between 20.4% and 53.8%. Younger people, health care workers, those who had to give up physical activity, people who had lost income, those who lived alone, infected by COVID-19, or had a higher perceived risk of the disease had a higher prevalence of both anxiety and depression disorders during the pandemic. There was conflicting evidence on prevalence levels among men and women and on whether they had children or not.

"Burnout or anxiety?! A medical trial regarding resident doctors in a first line University Hospital during COVID 19 pandemic","Introduction Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported as a worldwide emergency. Due to the extensiveness of spread and death, it has been declared as a pandemic. Objectives To highlight how COVID-19 pandemic psycho-emotional affects the medical staff of a frontline University Hospital in the â€œbattleâ€ with new coronavirus. Methods We employed a cross-sectional survey of 71 resident doctors from a frontline Hospital after a one-year pandemic and analyzed the prevalence and associated factors with work-related psychological distress among our study group. Results Out of the hospital resident doctors, 71 participated and completed the questionnaire, offering an overall response rate of 100%. The majority of participants were women (86% - 61). The average age was 29 years. Most respondents were unmarried. A total of 67% of participants were non-smokers, 5% stated that they occasionally consumed alcohol, none of them used drugs. As a result of the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data, aspects related to anxiety (21.12% - 15), exhaustion (15.49% - 11), and depression (11.26% - 8) are highlighted. In our study, no people were identified who would reach extreme exhaustion in the work process, due to good resilience and due to a well thought out program of work and rest during the pandemic. Conclusions The psychological pressure at work, as well as the one felt after limiting and restricting mobility for shorter or longer periods, had an impact on the psycho-emotional state of health care workers, requiring further psychological reassessments and psychological support.

"How Covid-19 changed emergency department access: observational study comparison of patient stage of the day access in the psychiatric emergency department over three years","Introduction A few studies have analyzed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric Emergency Department (ED) accesses. The pandemic may indeed have influenced the phase of day accesses for patients with psychiatric disorders. Objectives Aim of this cross-sectional study is to analyze how COVID-19 weighed on psychiatric patients daily accesses over the course of three years. Methods Data on 219 patients were retrospectively collected from the ED in the Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome. According to the stage of the day, accesses were divided into 4 groups: between 00:00 and 6:00;between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m.;between 12:00 a.m. and 18:00 p.m.;between 18:00 p.m. and 00:00 p.m. Results Performing a regression analysis, a relation was found between psychiatric symptoms, stage of the day admission and year. In 2019 the admissions seem to be homogeneously distributed, however during 2021 and 2020 the admissions rates have a delayed evening trend. Conclusions Despite the low number of accesses considered, the Covid-19 pandemic appears to exert an effect that still lasts in terms of both accesses and worsening or new onset of psychiatric symptoms. Measures taken to prevent the spread of infections may have affected access in the ED of patients in various ways. However, the trend of increasing evening accesses could be related to a saturation of territorial psychiatric services that work mainly until the afternoon. Thus, an enhancement of territorial psychiatric services seems highly necessary to cope with what could be an increase in psychopathology in patients without previous diagnosis.

"The implementation of teletherapy with patients with Severe Mental Illness during the COVID-19 first wave and its longitudinal association with hospitalisations: A retrospective multicenter study from Spain","Introduction The COVID-19 related restrictions such as social distancing forced the search for feasible alternatives to the provision of care for patients with severe mental illness (SMI), with services opting for teletherapy as an substitute of face-to-face treatment. Objectives To examine the implementation of teletherapy (telephone, videoconference) with patients with SMI during the COVID-19 first wave, and explore its associations with reduced hospitalisations after the first wave was over. Methods We performed a retrospective assessment of 270 records of patients visiting fifteen outpatient mental health services across Spain during 2020. We retrieved sociodemographic and clinical data, including modality of received therapy (in-person, telephone, videoconference) in three time points (before, during and after the first COVID-19 wave) and hospitalisation rates two, four and six months later. Results During the first wave, services implemented teletherapy (telephone and videoconference) extensively, whilst they reduced face-to-face therapy, though this returned to previous levels after the first wave. Hospitalisations two months later did not differ between patients who received teletherapy, and those who did not (p=.068). However, hospitalisations were lower for the first group of patients four (p =.004) and six months later (p &lt;.001). Multilevel analyses suggested that receiving teletherapy by videoconference during the first wave was the factor that protected patients most against hospitalisations six months later (OR=0.25;p=.012). Conclusions Our findings suggest that teletherapy plays a protective role against hospitalisations, especially when face-to-face therapy is not feasible. Therefore, it can be considered a valid alternative to ensure continuity of care to patients with SMI. Disclosure No significant relationships.","SÃ¡nchez-Guarnido, A.

"Quality of sleep in Tunisian patients with Multiple Sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has affected human communities around the world, and there is fear that people with chronic diseases such as Multiple sclerosis(MS) are more vulnerable to negative psychological effects. Objectives The aim of the present study was to assess the quality of sleep in patients with (MS) in comparison with healthy controls(HCs), during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify its associated factors. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey study conducted with patients followed at the neurology department of Hbib bourguiba university hospital in sfax(Tunisia), during the month of november2020. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI). The PSQI is a questionnaire assessing participantsâ€™ sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleep disturbances and their severity during the past month.Participants with a PSQI =5 are classified as â€˜good sleepersâ€™. Results Fifty two patients were included in the study. The mean age was 33.69 years(SD=9.21 years)and the sex ratio(F/H)was 4.77. Overall, our patients had higher scores of(PSQI)compared to HC and these diffÃ©rences were statistically significant(p &lt; 0.05). The mean score of(PSQI)was 11.04(SD=3.003)and 11.53%were classified as â€˜good sleepersâ€™. Unemployment was related to a poor sleep quality(p=0.0001). Patients with high EDSS(r=0.7;p=0.0001), high number of relapses(r=0.58 ;p=0.0001)were more likely to have sleep disturbance. There was a positive correlation between a poor sleep quality and the duration of disease(r=0.38;p=0.005).

"The impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk of social stigma","Introduction Social stigma indicates a process of negative connotation of a person which results in discrimination. The victim of stigma experiences a condition of social exclusion that negatively affects his relationships. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread the fear of being â€œcontaminatedâ€, which has led to the discrimination of a part of population. Objectives The purpose of this work is to analyze which people have suffered from stigma due to the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the negative effects on their health during this period. Methods A literature review of peer-reviewed articles was performed on Pubmed NCBI database by inserting the keywords: stigma and COVID-19 in the period 2020-2021. Results The data showed that the categories most at risk were positive patients and their families;healthcare workers in COVID-19 wards;Asian people. Discrimination has included avoidance attitudes, physical or verbal abuse, hypersurveillance in public places. Negative effects on victims included anxiety, depression, feelings of rejection and shame, self-harm and suicide. COVID-19 patients attempted to hide the disease by avoiding access to hospital;health personnel developed risk of burnout;Asian restaurants experienced a drop in reservations, even after quarantine period. Conclusions Social stigma is a public health problem and greater efforts are mandatory to reduce it including correct information, with the help of social and mass media;social interventions aimed at generating empathy;avoiding the use of negative language focused on stereotypes that could generate fear or discrimination.

In addition, the correlations between emotional reactions and hardiness components were also analysed. Methods Data collection was carried out between 29 May and 06 July 2020. A total of 129 medical and non-medical students participated in the study. The DASS-21 was used to measure depression, anxiety, and stress levels, while the Personal Views Survey-III examined hardiness. Both questionnaires were adapted for use in Russia. Results We found that medical students were less likely to be depressed than non-medical students (M = 4.03 and M = 6.01 respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Medical students had higher levels of the component of hardiness such as commitment (M = 20.95 and M = 18.43 respectively, p &lt; 0.05). In both groups, all hardiness components have negative relationships with depression, anxiety, and stress, but in the medical group control is associated only with depression (rx = -0.446, p &lt; 0.01), whereas the other group also has associations with anxiety (rx = -0.356, p &lt; 0.01) and stress (rx = -0.407, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions Hardiness was negatively related to depression, anxiety, and stress in a pandemic setting. Medical students were more adaptable to the pandemic than non-medical students.

"Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Patients in Opioid Substitution Treatment","Introduction The many negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic especially on vulnerable groups like patients suffering from drug addiction have been anticipated by experts early on. While drug consumption patterns of patients in opioid substitution treatment (OST, N=24) seemed hardly influenced at the early stage of the pandemic in Austria, the impact on the mental health of this population remained unclear. Objectives The main goal was to investigate long-term consequences of the pandemic in terms of PTSD and clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress among patients in OST between December 2020 and February 2021. Methods In a cross-sectional survey study (N=123) an adapted version of the impact of event scale (IES-R) was applied to evaluate PTSD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21), and respective changes due to the pandemic were documented. Sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors, as well as data on drug consumption patterns were collected. Results A binary logistic regression analysis confirmed the negative long-term consequences of psychological and economic COVID-19 related factors on a higher risk for PTSD due to the pandemic. The high-risk PTSD group also demonstrated higher levels and a deterioration of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms since the pandemic. Conclusions Among our sample of patients in OST, 27% were at risk of PTSD due to the pandemic, and 30 to 50% reported concerning levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Health care facilities might use these findings as a valuable source of information, when special attention is needed.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental heath","Introduction As countries adopt strict quarantines and lockdowns, increasing attention has been given to the impact on mental wellbeing. The influence of this on perinatal mental health and service provision is important to consider, as these women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects already seen in general and psychiatric populations. Objectives The impact on global mental health of Covid-19, and the isolation measures used to combat itâ€™s spread, is increasingly acknowledged. We were interested in the effect the pandemic has had specifically on the mental health of women in the peripartum period. By reflecting on our experiences, we hope to generate ideas to improve services. Methods We considered the effects of the pandemic in this high-risk population during each stage of contact with services. This included pre-conception, antenatal and postnatal periods, as well as the potential longitudinal and service effects. Recent case examples were identified and described from our busy and diverse South London perinatal psychiatry service. Results Recent referrals to our service suggest the current crisis has been a key trigger for the deterioration of many womenâ€™s mental health. This includes women who have been impacted by various factors related to the pandemic, at all stages of the perinatal period. Conclusions It is vital to maintain equality of access to perinatal services and to continue to consider how to deliver best care. This will involve adapting to the new working environment, and optimising care delivery using remote technologies where appropriate, in a way that is safe, accessible and acceptable to service users.","Rose, E.; Manoharan, M.; Powell, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+maternal+mental+heath","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S273-S273, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40484,""
"Comparison of prevalence, clinical evolution, and vaccination rate against covid 19 in a population of patients diagnosed with dual depression and non-dual depression","Introduction Since the beginning of the pandemic, 4,745,519 cases, 396,878 hospitalizations and 82,884 deaths with COVID-19 have been reported in Spain. As of August 24, 2021, 76.4% of Andalusians over 12 years of age have the complete vaccination regimen Objectives Main: to calculate the prevalence of COVID 19 infection, clinical evolution and vaccination rate in a population of patients diagnosed with dual depression. Secondary: compare these data with those obtained in patients diagnosed with non-dual depression Methods Retrospective descriptive study. The study population is made up of patients diagnosed with dual depression and non-dual depression (according to DSM 5 criterion). Infection, admission, death, and vaccination data were obtained from the patientâ€™s medical history Results Of the 10 patients diagnosed with dual depression, the prevalence of COVID 19 infection, since the beginning of the pandemic is 0% and of the 30 patients diagnosed with non-dual depression the prevalence is 3.33% (1/28). Of the patients with COVID 19 infection, none required hospital admission and no deaths occurred. The vaccination rate in the group of patients with dual depression is 30% (3/10) and in the group of non-dual depression is 86.66% (26/30), finding statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.01) between both groups. Conclusions In our study the prevalence of COVID 19 infection in patients diagnosed with dual depression is 0% and the vaccination rate is 30%.

"Psychiatric Admissions, Referrals, and Suicidal Behavior Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Denmark: A Time-Trend Study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health globally, but the impact on referrals and admissions to mental health services remains understudied. Objectives To assess patterns in psychiatric admissions, referrals, and suicidal behavior before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Methods Utilizing hospital and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) health records covering 46% of the Danish population, we compared psychiatric in-patients, referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior in years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to levels during the first lockdown (March 11 â€“ May 17, 2020), inter-lockdown period (May 18 â€“ December 15, 2020), and second lockdown (December 16, 2020 â€“ February 28, 2021) using negative binomial models. Results The rate of psychiatric in-patients declined compared to pre-pandemic levels (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94 â€“ 0.96, p &lt; 0.01). Referrals were not significantly different (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.92 â€“ 1.10, p = 0.91) during the pandemic;neither was suicidal behavior among hospital contacts (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.94 â€“ 1.14, p = 0.48) nor EMS contacts (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00 â€“ 1.18, p = 0.06).

"Age and gender differences in coping and mental health during and post COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction As a reaction to growing number of COVID-19 cases in Quebec, the government issued a lockdown to prevent further spread of the virus in March 2020. The novelty of the imposed restrictions warranted an assessment of adult coping and potential effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms. Objectives The purpose of the present study was to evaluate methods of coping employed during Quebecâ€™s lockdown and their potential ramifications on anxiety and depressive symptoms post-lockdown in Quebec. Methods In a retrospective longitudinal design, two-hundred and twenty-three (n = 223) adults (65.5% female;34.5% male) completed the study online. They were asked to fill out several questionnaires and provide demographic information. Results Analysis revealed significant improvement in anxiety symptoms post-lockdown relative to during lockdown across the entire sample. Depressive symptoms also improved significantly across the sample, but the difference was less pronounced among 18â€“34-year-olds than those 35 and above. Male adults aged 18-34 utilized maladaptive coping strategies to the greatest extent. Moreover, maladaptive coping was significantly associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms and predicted depressive symptoms post-lockdown. Further investigation revealed that young adult males differed from females in their use of substances and self-blame to cope. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that the lockdown adversely affected anxiety and depressive symptoms among the general population. Furthermore, young adults, particularly males, were most susceptible to depressive symptomatology due in part to their methods of coping with the novel context. A follow-up study is warranted. Future studies should also seek to recruit individuals whose self-identified gender is non-traditional (e.g., non-binary).

"Persistent emotional stress, fatigue and impaired neurocognitive function in recovered COVID-19 patients: a longitudinal prospective study","Introduction Several surveys report that post-COVID-19 patients (pts) could be at risk of persistent emotional distress, fatigue and impaired neurocognitive function (NCF). Objectives The aim was to assess emotional distress, fatigue and NCF in order to provide adequate care. Methods Patients with persistent physical or mental symptoms, at least 8 weeks post-COVID-19, were eligible for this ongoing prospective longitudinal single center trial. Data on depression, anxiety, cognition, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and fatigue were collected using 4 validated questionnaires at study entry (T0) and at 6 months (T1). Results Ninety-three pts were recruited between November 2020-March 2021. Test results from 64 eligible pts (15 male pts) were analyzed at T0;63 pts (98%) were treated in outpatient settings. Median age was 47 years [range 27-75]). Median time since COVID-19 was 29 weeks [range 8-53]. Twenty-two pts (34%) had a history of psychiatric disorders. According to the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), 44 pts (73%) reported anxiety symptoms and 26 pts (41%) reported depressive symptoms;48 pts (69%) reported cognitive complaints according to the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire and 29 pts (45%) suffered from PTSS, according to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Fifty-five pts (86%) had an elevated score on the Fatigue Severity Scale, indicating severe fatigue. Twenty-seven pts (42%) were still on sick leaf.

The signs and symptoms are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are usually manifested as cognitive impairment (brain fog, loss of concentration or memory issues, etc.), headache, sleep disturbance, peripheral neuropathy symptoms (pins and needles and numbness), dizziness, anosmia, symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue. Patients complain of reduced quality of life and impairment on daily functioning. Although the burden of disease is high there is until now very few data available, the etiopathology is still unknown and treatment strategies are not established. Objectives The objective of this study is to gather standardized data of patients with long-covid syndrome who suffer from neuropsychiatric symptoms in order to better understand the complexity of this syndrome. Methods Patients were referred from the long-covid outpatient unit of the internal medicine department to our specialized outpatient unit, so that the previous infection was confirmed. A standardized psychiatric interview and a thorough neuropsychological assessment was conducted.

"Decreasing suicide mortality in Hungary â€“ What are the main causes?","Introduction Depression and suicidal behaviour are major public health problems everywhere but particularly in Hungary where until 2000 the suicide rate was among the highest in the world. Objectives To analyse the possible causes of declining national suicide rate of Hungary. Methods Review of the scientific literature on Hungarian suicide scene published in the last 40 years. Results The peak of Hungarian national suicide rate was in 1985 (46/100.000) but due to a steady and continuous, year by year decline, in 2019 it was only 16/100.000, which represents a more than 65% decrease. Rate of unrecognised/untreated mood disorders, availability of health/psychiatric care, antidepressant and lithium prescription, unemployment, smoking and alcohol consumption as well as lithium and arsenic contents of drinking water were the most investigated possible determinants of suicide mortality of the country. More widespread and effective treatment of psychiatric/mood disorder patients, decreased rate of unemployment and smoking as well as the continuously improving living standards were the most important contributors to the great decline of the national suicide rate. However, in 2020 â€“ the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ the national suicide rate rose by 16%, which was almost totally accounted for by the increase of suicides among males. Conclusions Suicidal behaviour is preventable in many cases, but as it is a complex, multicausal phenomenon, its prevention should involve several medical/psychiatric, psychosocial and community interventions.

Objectives We investigate whether individuals with a history of depression in the past, react to the COVID-19 pandemic with increased depressive symptoms. Methods Longitudinal Data stem from the NAKO-Baseline-Assessment (2014-2019, 18 study centers in Germany, representative sampled individuals from 20 to 74 years) and the subsequent NAKO-COVID-Assessment (5-11/2020). The sample for analysis comprises 115.519 individuals. History of psychiatric disorder was operationalized as lifetime self-report for physician-diagnosed depression. Depressive symptoms were measured with the PHQ 9. Results Mean age of the sample at baseline was 49.95 (SD 12.53). It comprised 51.70 women;14 % of the individuals had a history of physician-diagnosed depression. Considering a PHQ-Score with cut-off 10 as a clinical relevant depression, 3.65 % of the individuals without history of depression and 24.19 % of those with a history of depression were depressed at baseline. The NAKO-COVID-Assessment revealed 6.53 % depressed individuals without any history of depression and a similar rate of 23.29 % in those with history of depression.

"Mental Health Impacts of Quarantine: Insights from the COVID-19 International Border Surveillance Study in Toronto, Canada","Introduction Nations thorughout the world are imposing mandatory quarantine on those entering the country. While such measures may be effective in reducing the importation of COVID-19, the mental health implications remain unclear. Objectives This study sought to assess mental well-being and factors associated with changes in mental health in individuals subject to mandatory quarantine following travel. Methods Travellers arriving at a large urban international airport completed online questionnaires on arrival and days 7 and 14 of mandated quarantine. Questionnaire items such as travel history, mental health, attitudes towards COVID-19, and protection behaviours were drawn from the World Health Organization Survey Tool for COVID-19. Results There was a clinically significant decline in mental health over the course of quarantine among the 10,965 eligible participants. Poor mental health was reported by 5.1% of participants on arrival and 26% on day 7 of quarantine. Factors associated with greater decline in mental health were younger age, female gender, negative views towards quarantine measures, and engaging in fewer COVID-19 prevention behaviours. Conclusions While the widespread use of quarantine may be effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, the mental health implications are profound and have largely been ignored in public policy decision-making.

"Depressive disorders among Tunisian high school teachers in the face of COVID-19","Introduction The constraints linked to COVID-19 may reduce resilience and intensify depressive feelings especially in vulnerable populations such as teachers. Objectives To understand the psychological distress in terms of depression of the COVID-19 pandemic among secondary school teachers in Sfax, Tunisia and to determine the correlated factors. Methods This was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study of 97 medium and high school teachers from Sfax, Tunisia. The study was conducted on google drive in May 2021, including an information sheet and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 to assess depression. Results In our study, the sex-ratio (M/F) was 0.32 and the average age was 44.23 years old. The median professional seniority was 16 years (minimum=1, maximum=37). Suicidal thoughts were described by 10.4% of teachers while 54.2% reported the presence of sleep disturbances since the onset of the pandemic. The median PHQ-9 score was 8 (Q1=4, Q3=15). The distribution of scores indicated that 59.7% of participants had no to mild symptoms of depression while 40.3% had moderate to severe depression. Furthermore, the presence of depression was associated with an age = 40 years old (p=0.037), a professional seniority = 20 years (p=0.035), the female gender (p=0.005), the presence of sleep disturbances (p&lt;0.001) as well as with suicidal thoughts (p=0.006).

Methods This was a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study. We used an online questionnaire on Facebook, on June 2020. The heteroquestionnaire included epidemiological data and two scales: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Form Y-1) to evaluate the anxiety level at the time of the study, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) to detect a characterized depressive episode. Results We included 121 participants. They had an average age of 36.52 years with a sex ratio (M/F) of 0.41. The mean STAI score was 43.12 while the PHQ score was 7.46, indicating that 30.8% of the participants suffered from depression. Both scores were correlated to female sex (p=0.01 for STAI and p=0.02 for PHQ), a history of anxiety (p&lt;0.001) and depressive disorders (p&lt;0.001) and to poor sleep quality (p&lt;0.001). The STAI score was also associated with a family history of high blood pressure (p=0.004), while the PHQ score was correlated to a family history of diabetes (p=0.02), a widowed or divorced marital status (p&lt;0.001) and to a single lifestyle (p=0.03). Furthermore, the two scores (STAI-Y and PHQ 9) were also associated (p&lt;0.001;r=0.67). Conclusions The psychological impact of Coronavirus epidemic seems not negligible requiring psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups.","Regaieg, N.; Elleuch, M.; Hentati, S.; Masmoudi, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+the+COVID-19+virus+and+confinement+on+the+mental+health+of+the+tunisian+population:+Anxiety+and+depression","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S275-S275, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40495,""
"Depressive disorders among physician parents in times of COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Studies have shown that physicians manifest a clear duty to work. For parents, reconciling work with parenthood is not easy and can even lead to depression. Objectives To determine the prevalence and the factors for depression in Tunisian physician parents. Methods This was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study of 93 Tunisian physician parents, conducted on google drive in March 2021, including a questionnaire containing the parentsâ€™ personal and professional data and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results In our study, the sex ratio (M/F) was 0.05. The average age was 34.43 years old. Almost three-quarters of doctors (71.3%) were providing on duty services in the hospital while 69% were providing at least one call per month in COVID units. The average BDI score was 6.16. According to the BDI score, 60.9% of participants had depression. The BDI score was correlated with several types of dissatisfaction: dissatisfaction with the relationship with his child (p = 0.002), time devoted to the partner (0.001), time devoted to the child (p = 0.004), childâ€™s educational style (p &lt;0.001), time spent on leisure or personal activities (p &lt;0.001), childâ€™s academic performance (p = 0.001) and childâ€™s behavior (p &lt;0.001). Furthermore, the BDI score was associated with postponing having a child for career reasons (p = 0.038) and thinking that his career is slowed down by parenthood (p &lt;0.001). Conclusions Depressionâ€™s rate among physician parents appears to be significant. Itâ€™s associated with a feeling of guilt and dissatisfaction, hence the necessity of an early detection and management.

"Impact of the COVID19 pandemic on patients followed in psychiatry","Introduction In the literature, some studies consider psychiatric patients to be vulnerable to COVID-19, in contrast to other studies that find them rather protected. Objectives To determine the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on patients undergoing psychiatric care. Methods This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study that took place in the psychiatry department A at Razi hospital in Tunisia. We conducted a comparison of patient follow-up between the period of March 2018-2019 and March 2020-2021. For this we used a form including socio demographic data, data concerning the COVID-19 situation, clinical data while comparing the follow-up of patients (hospitalizations, mode of relapses, consultations in the emergency roomâ€¦) Results 100 patients were included, 60% were men, mean age 44 years (+/- 11 years) [19-65 years]. Ninety-seven percent of patients had no personal history of COVID-19 infection. Comparing the pre-pandemic year (2018-2019) and the pandemic year (2020-2021), we note an increase in the rate of emergency room visits of (17.5%) as well as a relapse rate requiring hospitalization in our department in 48%, this figure was 30% in 2019. A statistically significant increase was noted for depressive and anxiety relapses (p=0.04;r=0.7). Fear of catching the virus while attending hospital facilities (17.6%), geographical isolation (17.6%), unavailability of treatment (17%) and poor insight (41.2%) were the primary causes of poor adherence.

"Mental health and associated factors among undergraduate students during Covid-19 pandemic in Chile","Introduction Very few studies have explored mental health among undergraduate students in Chile, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. International studies have estimated the prevalence of depression at around 28%. Objectives i) To determine the prevalence of mental health problems among undergraduate students at a private university in Chile;ii) to explore the associated factors in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, approved by the Ethical Committee of the Universidad de los Andes, Santiago Chile (CEC201984). Undergraduate students completed an online survey between August and September 2020. Mental health was assessed using The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21;suicidality, using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale;insomnia using the Insomnia Severity Index;and several individual, family, and university factors. Variables regarding the Covid-19 were also assessed, such as personal and family history of covid-19 contagion and death of family members due to Covid-19. A multivariate logistic analysis was performed. Results 5,037 students responded to the survey. 70.4% were female, mean age, 21 years. 37.1% had depression;38%, anxiety;54.6%, stress;32.6%, insomnia;and 20.5%, suicidal ideation (last month). The most important risk factors were non-medical use of benzodiazepine and fear of contracting Covid-19;the most relevant protective factors were high family functionality and a high sense of university belonging.

"â€œProtect, test, vaccinateâ€: dealing with Covid-19 in outpatient psychiatric care","Introduction Curbing the spread of the coronavirus and stabilizing the overall psychosocial situation requires compliance with preventive measures: â€œProtect, test, vaccinateâ€. Objectives Population groups with psychosocial problems which are difficult to reach and have a high risk of infection, morbidity and mortality as well as unfavorable help-seeking behavior and generally lower vaccination rates need support. Methods In the outpatient psychiatric facilities of the Psychosocial Services in Vienna (PSD-Wien), specific concepts to support â€œprotect, test, vaccinateâ€ were implemented to protect patients and employees. Information about the benefits and risks of vaccination, relieving fears and support in registering and attending vaccination appointments were of special significance. Results Analyzes of selected data from 1,319 patients at PSD-Wien show (period: 1st half of 2021) that these measures made it possible to achieve a significantly higher vaccination willingness in people with severe mental illnesses (84 %) than in the general Austrian population (based on the date of examination, currently approximately 60 %). The same applies to vaccination rates: at least 47 % have received a partial vaccination, of which about half have already received both partial vaccinations. Conclusions High vaccination willingness and rates as well as the necessary protection (wearing masks, keeping distance, complying with hygiene rules) and regular testing must not be a phenomenon of privileged population groups. Psychosocial support is needed so that the trilogy â€œProtect, test, vaccinateâ€ becomes possible for everyone, including people with severe mental illnesses.

"Association between self-efficacy, social support, knowledge of COVID-19, COVID-19 perception and stress, anxiety, depression of healthcare providers: the role of news media exposure as moderator","Introduction All pandemic outbreaks because of their rapid spread and high mortality rate cause to everyone considerable stress and anxiety. Objectives The aim of the present study is to investigate how news media exposure moderates the relationship between stress, anxiety, depression and self-efficacy, social support, knowledge of the coronavirus and coronavirus perception. Methods 223 healthcare providers, men 46 (20.6%) and women 177 (79.4%), working in hospitals in Greece participated in the study. independent t-test, one-way ANOVAs, Pearsonâ€™s correlation, multiple-linear regression and moderatorâ€™s analysis were analyzed with SPSS23. Results Organization support, friends support, covid-19 knowledge and covid-19 perception are most significant predictors to stress, F (4,218) = 11.47, p &lt; .001 and Adjusted R2- .159. Friends support, covid-19 knowledge and self-efficacy, working with covid19 patients and gender are most significant predictors to anxiety, F (5,217) = 11.16, p &lt; .001 Adjusted R2- .186. Friends support, covid-19 knowledge and self-efficacy and organization support are most significant predictors to depression, F (4,218) = 16.37, p &lt; .001 Adjusted R2-squared: .217. News media exposure did moderate the predictive power of almost all predictors for stress, anxiety and depression, at p&lt;.05.

"PRESTOapp for health workers with mental health symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant impact on the mental health of health workers that has brought many hospitals to launch immediate preventive mental health programs. Objectives (1) To adapt and enhance a smartphone app (PRESTOapp) for health workers with mental health symptoms related to the COVID-19, and (2) to demonstrate its potential effectiveness in significantly reducing anxiety-depressive and PTSD symptoms in this population. We aim to incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based techniques in a chatbot user-interface that will enable a more personalized and accurate monitoring and intervention. Methods An 18-months study with a 6-months preliminary phase to adapt PRESTOapp to health workers, enhance it with NLP-based techniques and chatbot user-interface, and evaluate its feasibility, and effectiveness in 12-months. Results PRESTOapp has the potential to provide a prompt, personalized and integral response to the mental health demand due to the COVID-19. It will help by providing an innovative digital platform, that will allow remote monitoring of the symptoms course, provide brief psychotherapeutic interventions, and detect urgent situations. If the preliminary results of this study point to a potential effectiveness of the intervention, PRESTOapp may be easily adapted to the general population. Conclusions PRESTOapp may be one of the key digital platforms that may help preventing and treating potentially severe mental health consequences. Considering the unresolved problem of burnout in health workers even before the COVID-19, this project will develop the necessary technology for implementing cost-effective mental health solutions, not only during the pandemic.

"MDMA-Assisted Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) â€“ One step further toward a patient-centered treatment pathway","Introduction PTSD is a chronic, debilitating condition with limited treatment efficacy. Accessing traumatic memories often leads to overwhelming distress, impacting treatment process. Current approved pharmacological treatments have exhibited small to moderate effects when compared with placebo. Evidence suggests 3,4,-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine(MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy as a viable option for refractory PTSD. Objectives Comprehensive review of early clinical research, proposed mechanisms, safety and emerging therapeutic models. Methods Eligible studies will be identified through strategic search of MEDLINE. Results Pre-clinical and imaging studies suggest memory reconsolidation and fear extinction as candidate psychological and neurological mechanisms, involving MDMAâ€™s combined effects of increasing serotonergic activity, as well the release of oxytocin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in key memory and emotional circuits. Resulting reduction in amygdala and insula activation and increasing connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus may create a â€œtolerance windowâ€ of neuroplasticity for emotional engagement and reprocessing of traumatic memories during psychotherapy. Early clinical trials report impressive and durable reduction in PTSD symptoms, with a safety profile comparable to that of SSRIs. A recently completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial reported full remission of PTSD symptoms in 67% of patients at 2 months, with no increase in suicidality, cardiovascular events or abuse behavior. Emerging treatment models underline the importance of unmedicated therapeutic sessions for preparation for the experience and subsequent integration as essential for full benefit and safety of the clinical context. Conclusions The psychological impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is an reminder of the emotional and economic burden associated with PTSD. MDMA-assisted therapy may be a breakthrough approach meriting further multidisciplinary investment and clinical research. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Pratas Penedos, S.; Freire, M.

"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on peripartum affective psychopathology","Introduction Despite COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacting mental health, few studies evaluated effects on perinatal mental health. Objectives Therefore, we aimed at assessing pregnant and puerperal women during first and second COVID-19 waves. Methods 70 women (41 pregnant and 29 puerperal) consecutively afferent to our outpatient service for Perinatal Mental Health (March 2020-March 2021) were administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19-S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience questionnaire (WDEQ). Results Women who reported last menstruation date (LMD) in 2019 second semester showed higher EPDS scores (p=0.026), those with estimated delivery date (EDD) in 2021 second semester showed higher CAS scores than those with EDD in 2020 first semester (p=0.020) or in 2021 first semester (p&lt;0.001). Women with clinically significant EPDS Scores reported higher FCV-S-19 (p=0.005) and CAS (p=0.003). Subjects with a previous psychiatric hospitalization showed higher FCV-S-19 (p=0.003). A weak positive correlation (r=0,290;R2=0,084;p=0.015) has been observed between FCV-S-19 and EPDS.

"Psychiatric care in Croatia during COVID-19 lockdown and earthquake: significant decrease in admissions to University Psychiatric Hospital Vrapce in Zagreb","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on both physical and mental health of people around the world. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate the number and characteristics of people seeking emergency psychiatric help during combined psychosocial stressful events in March 2020. Methods Data for 3927 patients seeking emergency psychiatric help were collected and analyzed for the months preceding, during and after lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant earthquake that took place on 22nd March 2020 in Zagreb, and compared with the same months of 2019. Results A significant decrease in both the number of visits and admissions to the hospital was found for the month of lockdown. There was a significant decrease in the number of out-patients visits and day hospital admissions. Compared with other months, more women and younger patients sought help. There was a significant rise in the number of patients presenting with suicidal thoughts, as well as a larger percentage of involuntary admissions. Conclusions Overall less people sought psychiatric help in the face of an unpredictable acute threat, which was interpreted in the light of prioritizing fear of infection over mental health issues. Alternatively, it is possible that people threatened with immediate danger mobilize short- term compensatory psychological resources which help deal with or put off mental illness.

"Impact of the pandemic (COVID-19) on eating behavior and physical activity routine in Brazil: an internet-based survey","Reduced mobility and interpersonal contacts were recommended to the entire population for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to measure the main effects of this social restriction in terms of eating habits, physical activity, and weight change, of Brazilians. This is a cross-sectional study, based on data collected from an Internet survey. The prevalence of changes in food intake and physical activity was represented. Dietary patterns were revealed using hierarchical cluster analysis. The factors associated with the variation in body weight were explored using a generalized linear model. 2,907 participants were evaluated, 75% of whom were female, and the mean age (sd) was 42 (14) years. As for body weight compared to before the pandemic, 11% of eutrophic people became overweight;and 23% of those who were already overweight, progressed to obesity. As for the practice of physical activity, 40% of those who were active, became sedentary. The foods with the greatest increase in consumption were bread (40%), sweets (39%), chocolate (30%) and wine (27%). Body weight gain was associated with a higher age group, physical inactivity, low-intensity physical activities, less education, adherence to Western standard diets, and simple carbohydrates (p=0.01). Factors related to lifestyle changes in the pandemic have been reported, such as: anxiety, fear, stress, depression, malaise, change in family and work routine, difficulty sleeping, physical inactivity, binge eating, insecurity, increased work and change in mood.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of acute and transient psychotic disorders","Introduction Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have demonstrated its considerable psychological impact. The isolation and social distancing, the increased fear of being infected or infecting others and the insecurity generated by the economic impact, could contribute to an increase in the incidence of mental health issues, such as psychotic disorders. Objectives The aim is to discuss four clinical cases in order to provide further evidence on this matter. Methods We report on three females and one male with no personal psychiatric history who were admitted to a tertiary hospital during the first three months after the declaration of the pandemic. The average age was 44,25 Â± 14,97 years. Results All patients met the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for acute and transient psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were triggered by the stress generated from the COVID-19. Complementary tests were unremarkable. They all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid discharge with favorable response to relatively low doses of antipsychotics was possible with a mean length of stay of 7,25 Â± 2,86 days. In two of the cases the delirious content was predominantly marked by the coronavirus itself. Conclusions It has been suggested that the intense psychosocial stress associated with a new life-threatening disease and national lockdown restrictions could be triggers for new-onset psychotic disorders. Some authors have reported cases similar to ours, which means that we could be experiencing and increase in the incidence of psychotic disorders due to the exceptional circumstances we are living around the world.","PÃ©rez-Balaguer, A.; Solari-Heresmann, L.

"The Prevalence of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms Among Healthcare Workers of East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction COVID-19, caused by the most recently discovered corona virus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2), has already reached pandemic scale worldwide. And it is expected for health care workers to feel stressed and worried during these times due to their exposure to infected individuals. Objectives This study aims to identify the relationship between the demographic profile and health-related traits of EAMC employees, and their perceived stressors that aggravate psychologic distress experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this cross-sectional study of 390 health care workers, we use two brief mental health screening tools, namely Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a validated tool for depression, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) a validated tool for anxiety. Results Factors such as marital status, occupation and employment status appear to have association with the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Perceived stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic include long working hours, inconsistent administrative policies, exposure to Covid-19 positive individuals, inadequate time off from work and increasing number of patients but without commensurate additional work force. For our sample population, 31.8% did not have depressive symptoms, 35.6% had mild, 21% moderate, 9.7% moderately severe and 1.8% had severe depressive symptoms. While for anxiety, 57.7% had no to minimal symptoms, 26.9% mild, 9.7% moderate and 5.6% had severe anxiety symptoms.

"The Portuguese adapted version of the fear of covid-19 scale for the postpartum period","Introduction The Portuguese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S;CabaÃ§os et al. 2021), composed of seven items, presented good validity and reliability to be used in general population. To be used within perinatal context, specifically in the postpartum period, we have added an item related to the baby (item 8 â€“ â€œIâ€™m afraid my baby will be infected with coronavirus-19â€). Objectives To analyze the psychometric properties of Portuguese adapted version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale for the postpartum period (FCV-19SP), namely construct validity, internal consistency, and convergent validity. Methods 207 women (mean age= 33.51 Â± 5.23 years) recruited in the postpartum period (9,06 Â± 8,52 months after delivery) fill in a set of self-reported validated questionnaires: Perinatal Depression Screening Scale (PDSS), Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) and Coronavirus-19 Fear Scale for the postpartum period (FCV-19SP). Results CFA revealed that the unifactorial model composed of eight items presented good fit indexes (X2/df=1.508;CFI=.991;GFI=.974;TLI=.983;p[RMSEA=.01] = .049), better than those of the seven items version (X2/df=3.963;CFI=.957;GFI=.909;TLI=.905;p[RMSEA=.01] =.219). Cronbach alpha for the FCV-19SPP was a=.880. The total score significantly (p&lt;.01) and moderately correlated with PDSS (r=.262) and PASS (r=.371).

"Adherence Scale to the Recommendations for Mental Health during the COVID-19 pandemic from the Portuguese General Directorate of Health (ASR-MH-COVID19) - Development and validation","Introduction The COVID-19 crisis has generated an increasing stress throughout the population. Objectives To develop and validate the Adherence Scale to the Recommendations for Mental Health during the COVID-19 pandemic from the Portuguese General Directorate of Health (GDH) (ASR-MH-COVID19). Methods The items content was based on the GDH guides for the prevention of mental health and psychosocial well-being of the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. After content and facial validity analysis, the preliminary version of the ASR-MH-COVID19 (8 items to be answered on a Likert scale) was completed by 413 individuals (69.2% female;mean age=31.02Â±14,272), in September-December 2020 (Sample1) and then by 967 (70.9% female;mean age=34.02Â±14,272), in February-May 2021 (Sample2). Sample1 was randomly divided in two sub-samples. Sample1A was used for exploratory factor analysis/EFA and Sample1B for confirmatory factor analysis/CFA;CFA was then replicated with Sample2. The online surveys also included the Adherence Scale to the Recommendations of Portuguese GDH to minimize the impact of COVID-19 (ASR-COVID-19;Pereira et al. 2020). Results CFAs were informed by EFA and showed that the unidimensional model presented acceptable-good fit indexes (Sample1B: <U+03C7>2/df=2.747;RMSEA=.0980, p&lt;.001;CFI=.973;TLI=.918, GFI=.972;Sample2: <U+03C7>2/df=3.327;RMSEA=.0490, p&lt;.001;CFI=.993;TLI=.983, GFI=.990).

"Relationship between personality, adherence to (mental) health behaviours and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Public health authorities around the world have been disseminating messages to support mental health and psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the Portuguese guidelines, we have developed the Adherence Scale to the Recommendations for Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic (ASR-MH-COVID19) to better understand this health behaviour. Objectives To analyse the relationship between sociodemographics, personality traits, Adherence (to the Recommendations for Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic) and psychological distress. Methods 413 individuals (69.2% female;mean age=31.02Â±14,272) completed an on-line survey, in September-December 2020, including sociodemographic questions, ASR-MH-COVID19, NEO-FFI-20 and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Health Perception Scale. Results Adherence scores did not significantly differ by gender, age and years of education. Women presented higher DASS and Neuroticism scores (p&lt;.01). Adherence were negatively correlated with Neuroticism (r=-.247) and with Depression/Anxiety/Stress (all rÂ».-200), positively with Openness to Experience (r=.174), Conscientiousness (r=.194) and Perceived Health (Physical, r=.173 and Psychological, r=.215) (all p&lt;.01). Mediation analysis (Haysâ€™ Macro Process - Model 4) revealed that Adherence is a partial mediator between Openness and DASS and Conscientiousness and DASS;when considering Neuroticism, only the direct effect was significant. The effect of Perceived Health (both Physical and Psychological) on DASS was also mediated by Adherence. Conclusions The Health Behaviour Model proposes a pathway linking personality and health that applies to these results about adherence and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personality and perceived health (also a trait) influence both adherence to mental health behaviours and psychological distress. Understanding personality is vital for health care providers.

"COVID-19 Pandemic: Another Source of Stress for Medical Students","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed the experience of higher education with potentially negative consequences for studentsâ€™ wellbeing. Objectives To compare medicine/dentistry studentsâ€™ depression/anxiety/stress levels before versus during the pandemic and to analyse the role of COVID-19-related stressors in their psychological distress. Methods Students from the Faculty of Medicine University of Coimbra answered socio-demographic and personality questionnaires and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale/DASS before (academic years 2016-2017-2018-2019 - SAMPLE1;n=1000) and during (September-December 2020 and January-March 2021 - SAMPLE2;n=650) the COVID-19 pandemic. Mean age (21.12Â±3.75), personality traits scores, and gender proportions (Â»75% girls) did not significantly differ between samples. SAMPLE2 also filled in the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and a new version of the Inventory of Sources of Stress During Medical Education/ISSDME, containing a COVID-19 -related dimension (restrictions on training and on socializing with friends/colleagues). Results SAMPLE2 presented significantly higher mean scores of depression (3.89Â±3.55vs.3.33Â±3.34), anxiety (3.27Â±4.08vs.2.86Â±3.29), stress (7.07Â±5.72vs.6.18Â±4.59) and total DASS (12.28Â±10.55vs.13.65Â±11.13) than SAMPLE1 (all p&lt;.05). Fear of COVID-19 was a significant predictor of DASS score (adjusted R2=2.9%, p&lt;.001). COVID-19-related stressors continued explaining significant increments of DASS variance after controlling for each of the ISSDME dimensions: Course demands (R2 Change=1.8%), Human demands (2.5%), Lifestyle (2.3%), Academic competition (5.5%), and Academic adjustment (5.2%) (all p&lt;.001). Conclusions This study adds to the evidence of the negative impact of COVID-19 on students and emphasizes its pernicious role on medical studentsâ€™ psychological distress, which is already higher due to the individual and academic stressors to which they are more exposed.

"From Perceived Vulnerability to Disease to Psychological Distress in times of COVID19 pandemic","Introduction Perceived vulnerability to disease/PVD may influence psychological reactions to COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives To analyse the role of PVD in psychological distress/PD during the COVID-19 pandemic, testing whether it is mediated by perceived risk of COVID-19, fear of COVID-19 and repetitive negative thinking/RNT. Methods Participants (N=413 adults;69.2% women) were recruited from September until December 2020, via social networks. They completed the following self-report validated questionnaires: Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Questionnaire/PVDQ;Perceived Risk of COVID-19 Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale;Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale. As women had significantly higher levels of PVD, COVID-19 perceived risk and fear, RNT, and psychological distress/PD, gender was controlled in mediation analysis (using PROCESS macro for SPSS;Hayes 2018). Results All the variables significantly (p&lt;.01), moderately (r&gt;.20) and positively correlated. The serial mediation model 6 with the three sequential mediators resulted in significant total effect (c=.326, se=.0791, p&lt;.001, CI:.1702-.4814), non-significant direct effect (câ€™=.111, se=.065, p=.087, CI:-.0162 to .2380), significant total indirect effect (.2149, se=.065, CI:.1079-.3278);most indirect effects were significant, including the indirect 7 (.0144, se=.0077, CI=.0017-.0320), that goes through all mediators (PVD-&gt;COVID19 perceived risk-&gt;COVID19 fear-&gt;RNT-&gt;PD), meaning full mediation. Conclusions The effect of PVD on psychological distress operates by increasing the perception of risk and the fear of COVID-19, which intensify related worries and ruminations in times of pandemic. People with high perceived threat, aversion and discomfort in situations associated with increased risk of infection should be helped to decrease dysfunctional cognitive contents and processes in times of pandemic.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paramedicsâ€™ mental health in Greece","Introduction Converging evidence substantiates a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of frontline workers. Nonetheless, there is paucity of research on paramedics. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in frontline paramedics in the Athens region, Greece, and to investigate the coping skills that are associated with less favourable mental health outcomes Methods A total of 100 ambulance paramedics participated in the study. The online questionnaire encompassed the DASS-21 for assessing mental health outcomes and the Brief-COPE for measuring coping skills. Information about socio-demographic characteristics and personal/relativesâ€™ vulnerability to COVID-19 was also gleaned. Results The prevalence for moderate to severe cases was found to be 7.2% for stress, 9.4% for anxiety and 11.3% for depression. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that men demonstrated significantly higher stress [B = -2.28, 95%CI = -3.88 - -0.68] and depression compared to women [B = -1.69, 95%CI = -3.19 - -0.19]. Similarly, the use of denial was found to be associated with higher stress [B = 0.69, 95%CI = 0.11 -1.37] and anxiety [B= 0.55, 95%CI = 0.13 â€“ 0.98]. Moreover, emotional support was linked to heightened anxiety [B= 0.71, 95%CI = 0.36 â€“ 1.06] and self-distraction to depression [B = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.16 â€“ 1.04]. Personal or relativesâ€™ vulnerability to COVID-19 did not impinge on mental health outcomes. Conclusions Healthcare initiatives should be tailored at the mental health needs of frontline paramedics, especially men.

"Assessment of stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in caregivers of children with ASD","Introduction An infectious disease such as COVID-19 can have a great impact on mental health due to the fear of contracting it as well as the social isolation itself due to the containment measures. Such events are considered stressors, as they can be perceived as threatening or challenging, and can have cumulative effects that are harmful to mental health. Along with this scenario, anxiety can occur in association with stress, and it is defined as extreme concern and somatic symptoms that generate tension, hindering the proper functioning and development of basic life functions. In people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their families, such events can occur more intensely, as changing routine and adapting to different activities are usually challenging. The study examined stress, anxiety and coping strategies during the pandemic. Objectives To analyze stressful events, anxiety and coping strategies in caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD and typical development. Methods Forty caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD and 40 of typically developing participated in the study. The assessment instruments used were: 1. RSQ COVID-19;2. Semi-structured interview;3. Stateâ€“Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults. For statistical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) or chi-square were used. Results Caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD showed greater stress and anxiety, in addition to using less adaptive coping strategies.

"Whis is the opinion of Italian psychiatrists regarding Telepsychiatry?","Introduction Italy was the first European country to face up with COVID-19 pandemic, which posed challenges to National Health System (NHS), including the need to adapt mental health services/infrastructures and implement digitalization. Objectives Despite telepsychiatry (ie., delivery of psychiatric care remotely through IT), is extensively used in non-European countries, only during the COVID-19 pandemic, became a convincing alternative to face-to-face modality for many psychiatrists in their clinical practice. Our aim was investigating Italian psychiatristsâ€™ opinion about telepsychiatry. Methods A questionnaire, disseminated during the third Italian phase, constituted by three sections (socio-demographic, opinions and personal experience about/with telepsychiatry) was build by adapting the 42-item questionnaire by Schubert (2019) and CAMHâ€™s Client Experience Survey from the psychiatristâ€™s perspective. Results 90 questionnaires were collected from a sample of 54 women (60%) with an average age of 43(SD=11.4). Mostly were psychiatrists (85.6%) working in NHS (66.7%) with an average working years of 13.7(SD=11.5) and a previous experience in telepsychiatry (71.1%). Overall, participants do not believe that telepsychiatry is comparable with face-to-face modality. A significant positive opinion was reported among younger psychiatrists compared to those more experienced, regarding efficacy, feasibility and mental health access (p&lt;0.05). No significant differences were reported in psychiatristsâ€™ opinion, according to the level of telepsychiatry use in their clinical practice.

"Digital Psychiatry in the COVID-19 Era: the First Italian Cross-National Survey","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of digital psychiatry (DP) in everyday clinical practice, resulting in the need for a skilled healthcare workforce. Objectives Our purpose was to investigate the level of training, knowledge and expertise of young mental health professionals and medical students in DP, as well as exploring their beliefs and experiences in this field. Methods An ad hoc cross-sectional survey was designed and administered to Italian medical students, psychiatry trainees, and early career psychiatrists. Results Most of the sample declared that the topic of DP was never discussed within their academic training (89.1%), mainly revealing an overall lack of knowledge on DP. Nevertheless, they mostly declared that DP represents a valuable therapeutic tool in mental health (80%) and that the academic background should include a dedicated course/module (54.4%). Moreover, most subjects declared that DP is less effective than in-person interventions (73.2%), despite the emerging evidence that being trained in DP is significantly associated with the belief that digital and in-person interventions are comparable in their effectiveness (p=0.05). Conclusions During the current pandemic, DP represented an ideal response to the need for physical distancing by ensuring the advantage of greater access to care. However, DP interventions are still uncommon, and there remains a certain resistance to their use in mental health care. The lack of formal training during the academic training could be a limiting factor. Therefore, addressing these issues in academic settings could be crucial to spreading this innovative practice also in the post-COVID-19 era.

"An observational naturalistic study on non-suicidal self-harm behaviours in a cohort of adolescents and young inpatients during COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction Non-suicidal self-harm (NSSH) include deliberate behaviours with the intent to self-injure. NSSH prevalence ranges 15.5%-31.3% in adolescents and young adults&lt;25 years-old. Objectives Our aim is characterizing the psychopathological domains occurring in adolescent and young adults with NSSH during the second COVID-19-related wave (October 2020-August 2021). Methods A cross-sectional study recruited inpatients aged 15-24 consecutively afferent to psychiatric ward due to NSSH, by investigating anger rumination(ARS), emotional regulation (DERS), dissociation (DES-II), metacognitive capabilities(MCQ-30), perceived stress (PSS), self-criticism (LOSCS), emotional intelligence (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test-RMET), aggressiveness (AQ), impulsiveness (BIS-11), hopelessness(BHS), alexithymia (TAS-20). NSSH were characterized by using suicide score scale(SSS) and deliberate self-harm interview (DSHI). Results A 7-fold increase in young inpatient access was observed from 2019 to 2021. DSHI median was 2 (95%CI=1,17-2,73), SSS-12months median was 5 (95%CI=4.2-6.7), SSS-lifetime median was 5 (95%CI=3.4-5.3) and MINI median was 5 (95%CI=3.4-4.7).

"Boredom, loneliness and modern type depression in a cohort of Italian university students","Introduction COVID-19-related physical isolation, fear and anxiety determined de novo mental illnesses, by potentially facilitating the emergence of Hikikomori traits (i.e., a severe social withdrawal condition). Objectives The present study aims at screening a cohort of university students for the Hikikomori traits and assessing a set of psychopathological determinants associated with Hikikomori, particularly boredom and loneliness dimensions. Methods A cross-sectional web-based survey was carried out by administering Hikikomori Questionnaire (HQ-11), Italian Loneliness Scale (ILS), Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Results 1,148 respondents (767 women and 374 men, mean age: 23.2Â±SD=2.8 years old) were recruited. 70.7% declared to have experienced psychological distress. HQ-11 average total score was 18.4Â±SD=7.5 with statistically significant higher values in the males (p=0.017) and amongst students studying Informatics, Mathematics/Physics/Chemistry, Science of Communication and Engineering. The HQ-11 positively correlated with ILS (r=0.609), MSBS (r=0.415), TAS-20 (r=0.482) and DASS-21 (r=0.434). Conclusions This study represents the first screening of the Hikikomori phenomenon in Italian university students. Hikikomori traits appear to be particularly represented in the Italian youth population and should be carefully investigated in future studies.

"Gender differences in depression, anxiety, and stress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in serbia - results from an online survey","Introduction COVID-19 outbreak has significantly affected the mental health of people worldwide. The first wave of the pandemic began during the beginning of March 2020, and included significant preventative measures. Previous research on mental health differences between the genders has found that women were more likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objectives The aim of our study was to assess the differences between the genders in depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods An online survey designed for the purposes of this study was distributed using the snowballing method during April and May of 2020. The survey consisted of two parts: sociodemographic and clinical data, and COVID-19 related data. Participants also filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) - a well validated, self-questionnaire instrument. T-test for independent samples was used to evaluate the differences between the genders. Results Out of the initially sent 563 surveys, a total of 161 were included in further analyses (28.6% response rate). Mean age of the sample was 42.2Â±10.2 and 65.2% of the participants were female. Mean scores on DASS-21 were as follows: 8.78Â±6.66 on depression, 9.78Â±7.39 on anxiety and 7.76Â±7.14 on stress. Females scored significantly higher on depression (t=-2.25, p=0.029), anxiety (t=-2.25, p=0.028), stress (t=-2.44, p=0.017), and total DASS-21 score (t=-2.44, p=0.016). Conclusions The results of our study imply that female participants exhibit higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Larger, population-based studies could provide a mroe in-depth answer to the importance of these differences for the general population.","Opankovic, A.; Latas, M.; Jerotic, S.; Ristic, I.; Milovanovic, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Gender+differences+in+depression,+anxiety,+and+stress+during+the+first+wave+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+serbia+-+results+from+an+online+survey","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S270-S271, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40521,""
"Mental health in children and adolescents during the pandemic year 2020: Results from a department of child and adolescent psychiatry in Romania","Introduction Infectious diseases can disrupt the environment in which children live and have negative consequences for the well-being, development and mental health of this population. Objectives Our aim is to compare the number and diagnoses of patients admitted during the first COVID-19 pandemic year to patients admitted during the same period in the previous year. Methods Retrospective observational study of patients admitted between March 1, 2020 and February 29, 2021 and the analogous period of 2019-2020 in a child psychiatry unit. Microsoft Excel was used for descriptive statistics. Results In our first pandemic year, there were 47.9% less admissions to our inpatient unit (n=717), comparing to the previous year (n=1376). Regarding the outpatient-type evaluations, there were 37.7% more admissions than the previous year (n=1813). Considering the fact that the number of inpatiens was limited in 2020 due to the restrictive measures imposed, most of our patients were consulted on an outpatient basis. During the 5 weeks nationwide lockdown, 72 children were consulted, 42.8% representing psychiatry emergencies. Regarding the diagnoses made in the whole pandemic year, disorders of psychological development were the most common, with almost half of the total of admissions (44.4%). The number of autistic outpatients in the pandemic year (n=1004) was almost double than the one before (n=572). Conclusions Even though there was a reduction of admissions to the child psychiatry inpatient unit during the first pandemic year, we did not identify major differences regarding the discharge diagnoses comparing to the year before.

"Cognitive impairment in health care workers recovering from COVID-19 infection: a cross-sectional comparative study","Background The COVID-19 outbreak has infected people all over the world where many clinics are being constructed to diagnose and treat lingering symptoms or long COVID. Neurological and long-term cognitive consequences are very worrisome. Many of COVID-19â€™s neurological symptoms are likely the result of the bodyâ€™s extensive immunological response to infection rather than the virus attacking the brain or nervous system directly. At the same time, the extent and type of COVID-19â€™s cognitive consequences are unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the cognitive functions of healthcare workers 2 weeks to 3 months after COVID-19 infection. Ninety-two healthcare workers participated in the study;32 were post-COVID-19 cases, and 60 were healthy people (the comparison group). The cognitive functions of the participants were assessed using the Addenbrookeâ€™s Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) test, which evaluated attention, memory, language, and visuospatial skills, as well as the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety GAD-7 and Depression Assessments PHQ-9. Results The study revealed that there was a highly significant direct correlation between post-infection with COVID-19 and scores of both anxiety and depression and an inverse correlation in the case of attention and memory. On the other hand, there is no statistical effect of post-COVID-19 on verbal fluency, language scores, and visio-spatial abilities. Using multiple linear regression, there was a powerful significant decrease effect of post-COVID-19 on memory scores controlling both anxiety and depression degrees (Beta = - 0.745, P &lt; 0.001). Also, there was a strong negative correlation post-COVID-19 on attention scores controlling both anxiety and depression degrees (Beta = - 0.745, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The study showed a strong negative effect of post-COVID-19 on the attention and memory of patients. Furthermore, both anxiety and depression scores increased significantly among the post-COVID-19 patients.","Omar, Ahmed Khaled Abd-Elrazzak, Dahesh, Salwa M.

"The COVID-19 pandemic impact on prenatal anxiety","Introduction Anxiety manifestations are one of the most described symptoms during pregnancy. Meanwhile, the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health and anxiety distress in particular, of pregnant and postpartum women remains unclear. Objectives The purpose of our study was to evaluate anxiety among prgnant women during covid19 and describe its associated factors Methods It was a comparative cross-sectional case- control study in a Tunisian gynecologic department. All women were in the third term of pregnancy. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The data were compared to a control group assessed in a similar study conducted before the pandemic in the same city. Eighty pregnant women was investigated during the covid pandemic and 100 pregnant women investigated before the COVID-19 outbreak in Tunisia was assigned to the control group. Results Pregnant women during COVID-19 scored less on BAI than controls (15.49Â±9.223 vs 17.40Â±7.410). Less patients presented moderate to severe anxiety during pandemic (38.8% (n=31) than controls 51% (n=51)). The difference between groups in means and prevalence values was not significant. The negative results could be related to the low power of the test (P=0.36).

"COVID 19 survivors : Feeling suicidal ?","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with several psychiatric manifestations leaving undoubtedly psychological consequences. However by escaping death ,do COVID-19 survivors present a higher risk for suicide ? Objectives In this study, we aimed to explore suicidal risk among recovering COVID 19 patients . Methods Our literature review was based on the PubMed interface and adapted for 2 databases: Science Direct and Google Scholar using the following combination ( suicide [MeSH terms]) AND (COVID-19 survivors[MeSH terms]). Results Recovering COVID 19 patients are at risk for developping posttraumatic stress disorder , anxiety , depression and sleep abnormalities , especially in severe forms. Added to that ,cognitive impairment was largely described in COVID 19 causing judgment and reasoning decline. These manifestations would partially explain the suicidiality among survivors regardless to their medical hisotry. Nonetheless,many COVID-19 survivors experience persistent physical symptoms and psychiatric disorders leading to post-COVID syndrome which is associated with increased suicidal ideation and behavior In addition , social factors are considered as a suicide risk factor such as isolation ,loss of loved ones ,loss of job and economic instability . Conclusions Over the course of illness , COVID 19 survivors may suffer from psychiatric and medical conditions leading to serieous suicide risk.

"The moderated mediating effect of gender in the relationship between unemployment, depression, and suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic: An examination based on big data","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequent recession, have caused a decline in the job market, with the resultant job insecurity increasing the risk of depression. While this affected all genders, suicidal thoughts were observed to be more common among women than men, suggesting that the impact of unemployment on depression varies by gender, with gender differences affecting the outcome of depression. Objectives This study aims to verify the moderating effect of gender on the structural relationship between unemployment, depression, and suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic by using online search trend data. Methods The study utilized the search trend data from Naverâ€™s Data Lab service, by analyzing the searches of men and women under 65, between March, 2020 and September 12, 2021. The search terms were â€œunemployment,â€ â€œdepression,â€ and â€œsuicide.â€ The analysis examined 1121 searches using the Model 7 research model through the SPSS Process Macro to verify the moderating effect of gender on the mediating pathways for unemployment, depression, and suicide. Results We observed that searches for â€œunemploymentâ€ significantly increased with searches for â€œdepressionâ€ (B=1.860, p&lt;.001) and â€œsuicideâ€ (B=.860, p&lt;.001). The analysis further revealed that the correlation between the increase in searches relating to depression and unemployment was seen more in women than men. This resulted in an accompanying increase in the volume of searches for suicide (B=2.341, p&lt;.001). Conclusions The job insecurity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to varying degrees of depression according to gender. Thus, social security measures related to unemployment, depression, and suicide interventions require a gender-specific approach. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Noh, Y.; Kim, H.

"Descriptive analysis of adherence to mindfulness-based group therapies: online versus face-to-face interventions","Introduction The use of technological supports in psychotherapeutic interventions has been widespread in recent years. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase has been greater. The feasibility of online group interventions has been proved in previous studies. Research comparing dropout rates in group interventions with clinical population that include mindfulness training is infrequent. Objectives To compare the difference in dropout rates between online and face-to-face mindfulness-based group interventions. Methods This study was carried out in a Mental Health Unit in Colmenar Viejo (Madrid, Spain). One hundred thirty-five adult patients with anxiety disorders were included in group interventions (74 face-to-face;61 online). The group treatments were Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and a Mindfulness-based Emotional Regulation intervention, during 8 weeks, guided by two Clinical Psychology residents. A descriptive analysis of dropout rates (participants attending 3 or fewer sessions out of the total number of participants starting the intervention) was performed. Results Of the 135 patients included, 8 did not participate in the interventions (5 face-to-face;3 online), which represents a 5.93% rejection rate;6.76% for the face-to-face intervention and 4.92% for the online intervention. Of the remaining sample (127 participants), a total dropout rate of 12.6% was obtained, with 8.69% in the face-to-face intervention versus 17.24% online. Conclusions A higher dropout rate was obtained in online interventions compared to face-to-face, with an increase of almost double.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and service use of people with severe mental illness","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the provision of mental health care. Particularly the limitations of face-to-face contacts and the access to treatment facilities can be expected to have significant negative effects on the practice of psychiatric treatment and outcomes. To date the extent and the severity of these effects in people with severe mental illnesses are rarely investigated in Germany. Objectives We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and service use of people with severe mental illness in Germany. Methods As part of a pragmatic randomized trial on the effectiveness of an integrated community mental health care program that started immediately after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, 1000 people with severe mental illness from different regions in Germany have been asked for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health care and on their general living conditions. Multivariate regression models were computed to estimate the effects of the patientsâ€™ COVID-19 experiences on the outcome parameters empowerment (EPAS), psychosocial impairment (HoNOS) and unmet needs (CAN). Results Using prospective data in a large sample of people with mental illness, we will be able to examine the extent to which the pandemic has affected participantsâ€™ mental health, their social lives, but also the use of mental health care services. Conclusions The data will help to examine the impact of the pandemic on people with severe mental illness in a comprehensive way and will provide evidence where immediate action is needed to reduce further burdens and inequities.

"Digitised remote delivery of simulation in psychiatry during the pandemic and for the future","Introduction Surrey and Borders NHS Foundation Trustâ€™s AVATr (Augmented Virtual-reality Avatar in Training) is a unique ground-breaking Virtual Patient simulation system, which uses the Xenodu platform to train learners in essential clinical and complex communication skills. Over 30 patient scenarios have been developed after identifying learner-specific development needs, including exploration of overt psychosis, assessment of capacity, sharing bad news, and neglect in care home residents. During the session, the trainee is projected on to a large screen, using a camera and video special effects, which results in a life-like interaction with the Virtual Patient. Trainees can view themselves interacting with the Virtual Patient in real-time, from a unique â€™out-of-bodyâ€™ perspective, immersed in a customdesigned interactive virtual environment. This is different to a first-person perspective used in virtual or augmented-reality systems in several clinical specialties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we evolved the AVATr model to remote or hybrid sessions, where simulations were digitally enhanced, and have been run through Microsoft Teams. The simulation facilitator is connected to a multi-user video call, enabling the Virtual Patient to be projected as an attendee using Microsoft Teams. Objectives To evaluate the feedback from Doctors in training taking part on the education sessions. Methods We collected qualitiative and quanttaive infromation from participants after the teaching session.

"Impact of WPAâ€™s Telepsychiatry Global Guidelines on Clinical Practice, International Collaboration, and Education","Introduction Telepsychiatry is the best-documented e-Mental Health application. It refers to the use of videoconferencing in the provision of mental health services. During the COVID19 pandemic, in response to physical distancing, mental health services worldwide have turned to online consultations. For the vast majority of clinicians, it was the first time they use telepsychiatry, and very few have received training in how to do it. Objectives - to present the main objectives and messages of the WPA Global Guidelines for Telepsychiatry related to competencies & skills, educational & legislative needs, and international collaboration. Methods A structured review of the main challenges, innovations, and settings in the first Global Telepsychiatry Guidelines, published by WPA in February 2021. Results The benefits of increased access to telehealth services are apparent for telepsychiatry, but benefits can only be realized if the tools are used by clinicians who have the appropriate training and guidance. With proper preparation and thoughtful risk management, telepsychiatry can be an invaluable tool for allowing greater access to care. However, certain prerequisites must be fulfilled to achieve the desired goals. These prerequisites are e.g. choice of the technology, settings, patient/provider preferences as well as competencies and skills described in this document. Conclusions The need for training among health care professionals is the highest priority. The urgent need for clinical training and skills building around e-mental health inclusive telepsychiatry, will determine the influence that psychiatry can have in addressing the mental health sequelae of the COVID19 pandemic via competent practice and increased international collaboration.

"Dynamics of emotional disorders in students of medical university in the context of the covid-19 pandemic","Introduction The covid-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the mental health of the entire population. Objectives To determine the dynamics of emotional disorders in medical students in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. Methods Methods of research. An online survey of medical university students was conducted during the covid-19 pandemic. The Beck scale was used. Results Results and its discussion. According to a dynamic study of emotional disorders in medical students, which was held during 12 months of covid-19 pandemic, emotional disturbance in the form of depressive manifestations associated with the covid-19 pandemic did not reduced. In addition, the results of the study indicated a change in the structure of depressive manifestations in the surveyed in favor of milder depressive manifestations (27.2%;24.0%) and a decrease in the prevalence of moderate and severe manifestations of depression (3.0%;5.3%). Conclusions The long-covid pandemic has a negative effect on the mental health of medical students and lead to emotional disturbances in the form of depressive manifestations of varying severity. The compensatory possibilities of mental activity proceed unilaterally with a change in the structure of emotional disorders;adaptation to a stress factor is not formed.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychopathology and Treatment of People with EDs","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic a mental health deterioration has been detected in the general population and especially in people affected by pre-existing psychiatric conditions, and mental health care has moved towards online treatment. Literature studies have been reviewed to gather evidence regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people affected by eating disorders (EDs) exploring changes in ED-specific and general psychopathology;mechanisms of vulnerability and resilience;change in treatment delivery service;patientsâ€™ perception of online treatment and potential barriers and/or advantages of this method and its effectiveness. A wide variability characterized the response of people with EDs to the COVID-19 pandemic. A trend toward worsening of ED specific psychopathology with respect to the pre-pandemic period was observed as well as a deterioration in general psychiatric symptoms. Feelings of uncertainty and social isolation were the most common vulnerability mechanisms. Resilience factors such as heightened self-care and reduced social pressure also occurred. The treatment has largely switched to online delivering strategies which, despite considered the best alternative to the face-to-face approach, were suffering from some concerns about their quality. The exacerbation of specific and general psychopathology supports the hypothesis of an emotional and post-traumatic nature of EDs and outlines the importance of internalizing symptoms. In front of the great variability observed across ED patients during the pandemic, the identification of risk and resilience variables as well as of subjective factors affecting the perception of online treatment may inform clinicians and promote more targeted and individualized approaches.

"The elephant in the room: the stressful psychological effects of COVID-19 pandemic in mental healthcare workers","Introduction Despite the large amount of research concerning the impact of COVID-19 on health care workers, to date few targeted MHWs. Moreover, none has investigated the vulnerability due to exposure to previous traumatic events among health care workers. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress in MHWs after the first lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the more impacted regions of the North of Italy, to understand which COVID-19, sociodemographic and professional variables as well as previous stressful life experiences, could have had greater negative effects. Methods The online survey occurred from 28-June to 10-August 2020. This included questions regarding sociodemographic factors, professional information, COVID-19 exposure. Moreover, three validated self-report questionnaires were administered: Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). Results 271 MHWs completed the survey. At least 20% had elevated levels of psychological distress with post-traumatic symptoms. Stratifying for professional roles, the nurses resulted the most affected, with significantly higher scores in terms of intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal and avoidance behaviors. Several variables affected psychological distress in MHWs, but stronger effects were done by age, professional roles, increased workload and worst working environment during COVID-19 pandemic, to had experienced the separation of family members, but also had experienced during their life of a severe human suffering (physical and/or psychological) on oneself or on a loved one.

"COVID-19 Psychiatric Inpatient Unit- experience and challenges","Introduction On January 2021 the Department of Psychiatry became the only unit exclusively dedicated to COVID patients with severe mental illness in acute decompensation. Only patients in risk of rapid medical deterioration were excluded and forwarded to intensive care. Objectives Discussion of this unprecedented experience. Methods Analysis of 28 patients hospitalized during 3 months with both an acute psychiatric disorder and an SARS-CoV-2 infection;description of the multidisciplinary intervention made. Results Our sample was characterized by a majority of patients with an acute psychotic episode derived from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (42%) or a bipolar affective disorder (21%). Only 3% of the patients had a diagnosis of severe major depressive disorder. And 10% of patients developed severe respiratory symptoms requiring oxygen or urgent transfer to COVID medical wards. Most patients presented periods of psychomotor agitation, lack of impulse control and self-aggression. Psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions had to be adapted to these unusual conditions. Most of them had already gone through a period of isolation in the buffer ward created to exclude false negatives, which promoted atypical deliriums and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. The psychiatric team was faced with the emergent need to adapt an intervention model based on trust to a model that had to prioritize physical safety. Conclusions The pandemic experience was transformative for all who lived through it. From the challenge perspective, it may have been enriching. But the maintained confrontation with the antithesis of therapy, defined by â€œcaring, supporting, communicating, approachingâ€, was devastating in ways that we consider essential to be debated.

"An increase in somatization in pandemic time in association with lexical characterictic of statements about pandemic","Introduction One of the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may be an increase in somatization. Objectives identification of implicit characteristics of texts indicating the peculiarities of the opinion about the pandemic by people with high somatization level. Methods Survey (03/23/2020â€“01/29/2021, N=1188). Used: SCL-90-R, COPE, Constructive Thinking Inventory (CTI). It was offered to express an opinion on the pandemic. The statements were divided into the two text arrays - â€œhigh somatizationâ€ and â€œlow somatizationâ€ (based on the parameter â€œsomatizationâ€ SCL-90R). The frequency of words in these text arrays was estimated (LIWC). Results The analysis showed an increase in somatization as the pandemic developed (Std.J-T Statistic=4,327). The relationship between somatization and anxiety, sleep disturbances, and depression was revealed. Higher rates of somatization are associated with a decrease in emotional coping, Â«global constructive thinkingÂ» and Â«personal superstitious thinkingÂ», an increase in Â«categorical thinkingÂ». The connection between somatization and a number of non-constructive copings is shown. Texts associated with high somatization demonstrate higher number of pronouns of the first person (30.77%, 17.19%), a decrease in the tonality of words, a vocabulary (LIWC) of suffering, negative sthenic emotions (1,53%, 0,93%), a decrease in the vocabulary of motivation and resistance (0,93%, 1,49%), a decrease in vocabulary associated with the body (0,20%, 0,32%). Conclusions The connection between somatization and high emotional distress, which manifests itself in negative emotional vocabulary and is associated with a low level of emotional coping, is shown.

Objectives To analyze response to COVID-19 pandemic in people with high level of esoteric thinking. Methods Internet survey 23.03.20-29.01.21 (N=621);Constructive Thinking Inventory(CTI);SCL-90R. It was proposed to assess statements: â€œThe authorities are hiding the true scale of the coronavirus pandemicâ€, â€œCoronavirus is the result of biological weapons developmentâ€, â€œCoronavirus is a punishment or a sign sent to people from aboveâ€, â€œThe emergence of the coronavirus is the Earthâ€™s response to its pollutionâ€. It was offered to express an opinion about pandemic. The answers were coded on the basis of qualitative semantic analysis. Results The growth of â€œesoteric thinkingâ€ was revealed (Std.J-T, p=.025). With a high level of esoteric thinking, emotional statements (â€œfear, anxiety, panicâ€) are more common (27.8% versus 16.9% for group with high and low level of Â«esoteric thinkingÂ»). Correlations of the level of Â«esoteric thinkingÂ» with level of depression (Spearmanâ€™s correlation ,085*), anxiety (,097*), GSI (,130**), Â«fears for the lifeÂ» (23.4% versus 14.5%) show high emotional distress.

"Survey of rural and urban happiness in Indonesia during the corona crisis","The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed urban life, and it can be said that the time is at hand when cities and rural areas should promote symbiotic projects. These projects are diverse and include medical conditions, socioeconomic activities, working conditions, information technology, food conditions, culture as well as education. According to previous studies, medical conditions are excellent, but well-being of the mental health of people in developed countries is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Meanwhile, developing countries tend to have higher levels of well-being in urban life, while rural areas have lower levels of well-being and mental health, because of a focus on lagging economic activities and vulnerability in medical care. Preliminary interviews in Bali, Indonesia, the author's study area, revealed no livelihood change in subsistence farming villages during the COVID-19 disaster indicating no effects by the pandemic. Meanwhile, urban residents faced difficulties obtaining food due to the government curfew and halt in economic activities. Most workers lost their jobs and suffered hardships in the tourism industry. With this situation, the conditions are slightly different from the previous studies in developing countries mentioned above. Previous studies did not reveal any mental health and well-being assessment for life in the rural areas of developing countries during the corona disaster. This study aimed to clarify the reality of urban and rural well-being during the Corona Disaster in a developing country, namely Bali. The hypothesis is that in Bali, Indonesia, a developing country, the level of well-being under the corona disaster is higher for rural residents than for urban residents. Six groups were surveyed with 71 questions from the survey items of previous studies including the World Happiness Report conducted worldwide, WHR2020, AHI and The Oxford Happiness Survey. Face Sheet, Mental Health, Anxiety, Happiness, Good things due to corona, and Corona infection control behaviors were included. The questionnaire was categorical to allow for a quantitative analysis and began in September 2021. I collected 280 samples from two villages, each in rural and urban areas of Bali, and analyzed the results with simple cross-tabulations and a difference of means, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and structural analysis of covariance. The analyses revealed a tendency toward inward self-loneliness in the urban areas and outward anxiety about one's surroundings in the rural areas. Under the corona disaster, subjects in rural areas stayed optimistic about external stress, in contrast to those in urban areas, who became inwardly oriented and negative. This point does not imply that well-being is higher among rural people, but it suggests that they are more mentally stress-tolerant because they are more likely to positively view the situation. Although the hypothesis was not proven, life in rural areas, where people have optimistic feelings and are not lonely, can be considered relatively humane and mentally healthy. This may indicate that the level of well-being of people living in rural areas is higher than people living in urban areas. The results of this study differ from previous studies in which people in rural areas of developing countries had lower levels of happiness and mental health. However, this study provides new knowledge about the situation of the corona disaster in developing countries by surveying the well-being of both rural and urban residents.","Mayuzumi, Yoko","https://www.google.com/search?q=Survey+of+rural+and+urban+happiness+in+Indonesia+during+the+corona+crisis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science;: 1-39, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40541,""
"Teaching adolescents to BREATHE: The implementation of the learning to BREATHE curriculum in schools through remote learning","There has been a significant rise in mental health needs in adolescents, and the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disturbed everyday life, causing an increase in anxiety and social isolation amongst adolescents throughout the world (CDC, 2017;Yale Child Study Center, 2020). Effective Tier 1 social-emotional universal interventions to foster social-emotion well-being are crucial in that ensuring school districts have the tools to better support high school aged students and their social-emotional needs. The Learning to BREATHE (L2B) program is a preventative Tier 1 program that has been proven to promote social-emotional well-being in students at the secondary level (Broderick, 2014). However, it is not known if the program is effective when administered through remote learning. The aim of this study was to examine whether the L2B program administered as a Tier 1 intervention at the high school age-level through remote learning was effective in (1) fostering emotion regulation and (2) increasing mindfulness skills. Additionally, the researcher gathered treatment acceptability data to determine whether participants viewed the L2B program as a helpful social-emotional intervention when delivered through remote learning. Thirty-six high school student participants received the L2B program through remote learning. Participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-15) at pre-intervention and post-intervention. Paired t-tests found that participants reported a statistically significant mean difference in (ERQ) cognitive reappraisal (p &lt;= .001) and expressive suppression (p &lt; .002) skills with a small effect size (d = .25, d = .24). A second paired t-test also found that participants reported a statistically significant mean difference in (FFMQ-15) mindfulness (p &lt; .001) skills with a large effect size (d = 1.05). Eighty-eight percent of participants reported that the L2B program was beneficial to their social-emotional well-being through remote learning. Eleven percent of participants reported that the L2B program was not beneficial to their social/emotional well-being through remote learning. These results suggest that the L2B program fosters both emotion regulation and mindfulness skills through remote learning. L2B also had a very high satisfaction rate amongst participants with implementation through remote learning. Implications of the study and suggestions for further research are offered.

"The effects of compassion and fears of compassion on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational study across 21 countries","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented detrimental impact on mental health in people around the world. It is therefore important to examine factors that may buffer or heighten the risk of mental health problems in this context. Objectives This study explores the buffering effects of different flows of compassion (for self, for others, from others) and the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. Methods 4057 adult participants collected from the general community population across 21 countries from Europe, Middle East, North America, South America, Asia and Oceania, completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, compassion, fears of compassion, depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. Results Self-compassion moderated the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, whereas compassion from others moderated the effects of fears of COVID-19 on social safeness. Fears of compassion moderated the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of fears of COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across countries. Conclusions Our findings highlight the universal protective role of compassion, in particular self-compassion and compassion from others, in promoting resilience by buffering against the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Furthermore, our results reveal that fears of compassion have a magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness.

"Depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life in critical COVID-19 survivors: Preliminary results of 1-year follow-up","Introduction A higher risk of mental health consequences in critical COVID-19 patients is expected due to several reasons, including prolonged mechanical ventilation with exposure to high sedation. In this context, post-discharge depression has been reported in previous COVID-19 studies, with a profound impact on patientsâ€™ health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Objectives To identify depressive symptoms in COVID-19 survivors 1-year after hospital discharge and to analyse its association with HRQoL. Methods As part of the longitudinal MAPA project, this study enrolled critical COVID-19 patients admitted in the Intensive Care Medicine Department of a University Hospital (March-May 2020). Participants were assessed through telephone by an intensive care nurse and a psychologist, with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (depressive symptoms), EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) (global health status patient record). Results A sample of 55 survivors (median age=66 years;69% males) were included, with 20% showing depressive symptoms. Pain/discomfort (67%) and anxiety/depression (67%) were the most EQ-5D-5L domains reported. Survivors scoring for depression had more problems in all HRQoL areas (mobility:91%vs.48%, p=0.015;self-care:64%vs.27%, p=0.035;usual activities:91%vs.50%, p=0.017;pain/discomfort:100%vs.59%, p=0.010;anxiety/depression:100%vs.59%, p=0.010). Moreover, they had a lower EQ-VAS median, corresponding a worse self-perception of health status (50vs.80, p=0.010). Conclusions Even after 1-year, a significant proportion of survivors presented depressive symptoms with repercussions in all HRQoL dimensions and association with worse self-perception of global quality of life. Taking this in mind, early screening and treatment of depression in COVID-19 survivors will be crucial, minimizing its impact on quality of life.

"Post-discharge depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life of critical COVID-19 survivors","Introduction Survivors of critical illness stay frequently experience long-term mental health morbidity, suggesting that many critically ill patients with COVID-19 may also show a high prevalence of psychiatric conditions. Objectives To describe depression in COVID-19 survivors 4-months post-hospital discharge and to examine its association with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods This pilot study involved COVID-19 adult patients admitted in Intensive Care Medicine Service (ICMS) of a University Hospital. Exclusion criteria were: ICMS length of stay (LoS)=24h, terminal illness, major sensory loss and inability to communicate at the time of assessment. All participants were evaluated at ICMS scheduled telephone follow-up appointment, with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (depression) and EQ-5D-5L (HRQoL). Critical-illness severity was assessed with APACHE-II and SAPS-II. Results Twenty patients were included with a median age of 62(range: 24-77) y.o., the majority male (75%) and married (70%). Median (range) APACHE-II and SAPS-II was 17 (5-34) and 32.5 (7-77), respectively, and LoS was 18 (4-58) days. Overall, 25% patients presented depression symptoms and most reported problems on EQ-5D-5L domains of pain/discomfort (65%), anxiety/depression (55%) and mobility (50%). Depression scores were higher in patients with problems in EQ-5D-5L domains of usual activities (median 4 vs 1.5;p=0.046), pain/discomfort (median 0 vs 4;p=0.004) and anxiety/depression (median 4 vs 0;p&lt;0.001). Conclusions These preliminary findings show that depression is frequent in COVID-19 survivors and it is associated with worse HRQoL. This pilot study highlights the importance of psychological assessment and treatment of COVID-19 survivors, in order to minimize its negative impact on HRQoL, optimizing their recovery.","Martins, S.; Ferreira, A.

"The psychological well-being of family caregivers of autistic people during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Introduction People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently need support due to the elevated prevalence of psychiatric and medical comorbidities. The Covid-19 outbreak has severely affected the routinary functioning of healthcare services, thus causing severe consequences for autistic people and their caregivers, an already fragile population prone to mental health diseases. Objectives 1. To compare the levels of psychological well-being, insomnia, and family distress perceived by caregivers of autistic people to those perceived by caregivers of people with other types of disability. 2. To evaluate predictors of individual and family distress reported by caregivers of autistic individuals. Methods We collected data through a cross-sectional web-based observational study from April 19 to May 3, 2020. Socio-demographic information were collected, and psychopathological variables were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Brief Resilient Coping Scale, and the Family Distress Index. Results No significant differences emerged between the two groups of caregivers in terms of well-being, sleep quality, family distress, and level of resilience. The risk of individual distress during the pandemic was higher in people caring for younger autistic people. Lower levels of resilience predicted higher levels of individual distress among caregivers of autistic people. Conclusions Our study confirmed that caregiversâ€™ mental health is worthy of attention and that people with disabilities may benefit for well-organized healthcare support networks (e.g. in-home services). The non-significant differences found between caregivers of ASD and non-ASD individuals may be related to the severe distress that Covid pandemic caused on the entire population.

"Creation of a brief group intervention to reduce caregivers burden in an intensive home treatment unit","Introduction Intensive home-treatment (IHT) for people experiencing a mental health crisis has been progressively established in many European countries as an alternative to in-ward treatment. However, the management of acute episodes at home can cause burden in the caregivers of these patients. Objectives To create a brief group intervention (BGI) to reduce burden in the caregivers of the patients admitted to an IHT unit. Methods A preliminary version of the BGI (BGI 1.0) was designed based on literatureâ€™s review. It consisted of 4 sessions of 90 minutes (one per week), on-line (COVID-19), focused on caregivers burden, stress and self-care, communication skills, and self-compassion. All the caregivers of the patients admitted for IHT from 10/01/2020 to 06/01/2021 were offered the BGI 1.0. At the end of the intervention, participants (caregivers and therapists) were asked about their opinion on its contents and usefulness. Results A total of 31 caregivers received the BGI 1.0. Most of them felt satisfied with the intervention. Opinions varied as to which contents should be expanded or included. The therapists thought that the number of sessions should be increased to take a closer look at some contents or to include new ones. They also believed that the on-line format hindered the adherence and the interaction between the participants. Conclusions The BGI 1.0 seems to be a good starting point to design the final version of the intervention. However, an exhaustive assessment of the construct of burden in a larger sample of caregivers should be performed prior to its design.

"Teacher efficacy in response to mental health: A qualitative study","Teachers are increasingly sought after to support students that are experiencing mental health concerns. Some of the most common mental health concerns include, but are not limited to, depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems (Centers for Disease and Control Prevention [CDC], 2020a). In the United States, these mental health diagnoses have been observed in children as young as 2 to 17 years of age (CDC, 2020a). As a result, teachers have become first responders in meeting the mental health needs of students. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to further explore teachers' self-efficacy and collective efficacy and how they are responding to the mental health challenges of third-grade elementary school-aged students. Participants included 15 third-grade teachers from five schools from one school district: two traditional K-5 schools and three K-8 schools. Using Bandura's self-efficacy and collective efficacy frameworks, data revealed how teacher knowledge, skills, and strategies were influenced, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in addressing mental health concerns. Several findings emerged suggesting that teachers have a stronger sense of collective efficacy by working closely with school counselors, while teachers with a lower sense of collective efficacy do no seek collaborative relationships and other sources. In addition, teachers with a stronger sense of self-efficacy recognized the process in pre-identifying student mental health, while teachers with a lower sense of self-efficacy, lacked the tools to properly pre-identify students. This study has implications for teacher professional development and training, along with increasing specialized support staff. In addition, the study has implications for recognizing the coordination of education and mental health services to strengthen teacher self-efficacy and collective efficacy.

"Covid-19 and impulsivity: an evaluation of self-harm admissions in emergency care","Introduction Several studies highlighted how COVID-19-related isolation and quarantine deeply weighed on the mental health of both the general and psychiatric population. There has been limited investigation about self-harm and impulsivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate how COVID-19-related lockdown affected self-harm rates in an Italian hospital. Methods Data on 59 patients were retrospectively collected from the Emercency deparment of the Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, from March 11 to May 4, 2020 (Italian mass quarantine) and the same periods of 2019 and 2021. Demographics, psychiatric history, substance use/abuse, types of self-harm and admission in psychiatric acute unit (PAU) rates were recorded. Results No statistical difference was reported in self-harm rates [9.8%(26/266) in 2019 vs 13.2%(10/76) in 2020 vs 10.7%(23/215) in 2021;p&gt;0.05]. In 2020 subjects were younger (31.9Â±12.1 vs 39.2Â±14.4,p=0.22;vs 38.1Â±14.4;p=0.15) and had higher incidence of psychiatric history [90%(9/10) vs 73.1%(19/26), p=0.42;vs 65.2% (15/23),p=0.29],than 2019 and 2021 respectively. Substance use/abuse rates were significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2021 [10%(1/10) vs 53.8%(14/26),p=0.04;vs 60.9% (14/23), p=0.02]. In 2020, subjects committing self-harms were more frequently admitted to PAU compared to 2019 and 2021 [60%(6/10)vs19.2%(5/26),p=0.04;vs 17.4% (4/23), p=0.04). Conclusions Consistent with the literature, lockdown-related measures negatively impacted on younger people, with higher rates of self-harm between March and May 2020. This, together with a higher rate of admissions to PAU, should warn the mental health system to target with specific programs to support adolescents and youngers.

"Worries during the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ which were the most prevalent and disturbing?","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional worries and challenges to peopleâ€™s lives, with potential implications for psychological well-being. Objectives To understand which worries and life changes have affected most the Portuguese general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyse which contents are associated with higher levels of repetitive negative thinking/RNT and psychological distress/PD. Methods In September-December 2020, 413 Portuguese adults (69.2% female;Mean age= 31.02Â±14.272) were asked one open questions, with reference to the COVID-19 pandemic period: â€œwhat was your biggest worry?â€;the answers were independently categorized by two researchers. Participants also filled the validated Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale and the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire. Results The most prevalent worries were about: 1) fear of contamination (oneself and others-48.7%;2) physical and mental health and well-being (self and others)-27.2%;3) studies and profession-13.3%;4) uncertainty about the future-7.7%;5) economic-financial issues-6.5%;6) miscellaneous-3.3%;7) no worries-0.7%. Participants who had worries of the theme 4 had the highest RNT and PD mean scores, followed by themes 3 and 5, and then themes 2 and 1. These thematic groups significantly (p&lt;.01) differ between each other (except 3-5) and from the other groups. RNT was a significant predictor of PD (R2=37.0%, ÃŸ=.609, p&lt;.001).

"Assessing the impact of mental health capacity building of Primary Health Care (PHC) personnel","Introduction COVID-19 poses an immense challenge to health systems and societies, associated with a burden of mental health in the population. The pandemic is uncovering treatment gaps in mental health systems, especially in Low and Middle-Resource Countries, as Georgia. The high burden calls for renewed efforts to integrate mental health into Primary Health Care (PHC) to address increased mental health needs of the population. The capacity building of PHC personnel is ongoing since October 2020, according to mhGAP algorithm. Family doctors (FD) are trained in identification and management in priority mental conditions. Objectives The overall aim of the study was to assess the impact of capacity building of PHC personnel. This was an implementation research seeking to understand how effective was the offered capacity building process and what could be lessons learnt. Methods We employed a mixed-methods process evaluation design utilising a series of instruments specifically designed to provide data for the domains as training/capacity building, service delivery and user satisfaction. Results FD were able to identify the most prevalent conditions - Anxiety (74%) and Depression (39%);in 22.8% the comorbidity was recognized. The psychoeducation was the most common method of management used by 72%. In 39.4% FD were able to recommend at least one medicine to their patients. 83.3% of patients reported improved conditions. Conclusions The family doctors are able to identify and manage certain mental health conditions after proper trainings and regular supervision.

"E-tool for mental health prevention: a study of the receptivity and engagement in a large-scale group of subjects","Introduction Due to the Covid-19 effects, mental health conditions are now, more than ever, affecting our daily lives - both personally and professionally. The average delay between the onset of first symptoms of a mental health disorder and seeking suitable healthcare is 11 years. The WHO states that the only sustainable way to reduce mental healthcare burden is by acting earlier. Objectives The aim of this project is to assess the receptivity and engagement of a mobile app for mental health prevention, amongst a large-scale and heterogeneous group of individuals. The main hypothesis under testing is that people are receptive to actively act towards mental health prevention, despite still being a very neglected and stigmatized topic. Methods A mobile app for mental health improvement and disease prevention was developed through the digitalization of positive psychology strategies, such as mood tracking, journaling, breathing exercises, among others, which are personalized to the user through biofeedback. The app aims at teaching people how to autonomously cope with mental health conditions, identifying early signs and redirecting them to proper mental health professionals. The app is being released for a population of 35,000 subjects resident in Portugal. Results Receptivity and engagement metrics will be assessed on a weekly and monthly basis, for 3 months, segmented by different subject profiles. Mental health metrics will also be assessed, namely anxiety, depression, and burnout levels - using standard psychiatric scales. Conclusions We have yet to draw conclusions from the project;however, we aim to achieve first results in due time.

"Impact of Covid-19 on mental health of Portuguese health professionals â€“ longitudinal study, phase I","Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic brought enormous challenges for health professionals. As in past epidemics, the uncertainty, danger and fear of contamination and an excessive load of work under dramatic conditions may contribute to aggravate the mental health of health professionals. Objectives Explore how the Covid-19 crisis impacted the mental health of healthcare workers and how their mental status relates with perspectives on the recent past and near future. Methods A longitudinal study will be applied in two phases, Q1 and Q2, one year apart, to evaluate depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress among health professionals from a healthcare center in Portugal. Phase Q1 is concluded and comprised the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale â€“ Revised (IES-R) and a questionnaire about the past and the future. Results The IES-R scale revealed that nurses are at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than other professionals. The levels of depression and anxiety in the DASS-21 show no significant differences. Interestingly, professionals who worked almost exclusively at inpatient wards show higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than those who worked at several hospital units (emergency, inpatient and outpatient units). A positive correlation was found between depression and anxiety and negative perspectives about the past and the future. Conclusions Covid-19 posed a terrible challenge for health professionals.

"Psychiatric intervention on patients recovering from hospitalization due to Covid-19","Introduction According to recent reports Covid-19 patients may exhibit psychiatric co-morbidities that cause dysfunction, loss of autonomy and emotional suffering even after the physical illness is treated. Considering the high impact Covid-19 may have on mental health, we have created a psychiatric consultation dedicated to the study, observation and support of patients that developed mental illness after being hospitalized due to Covid-19. Objectives We aim at 1) describe the profile of patients that developed psychiatric comorbidities following a hospitalization due to Covid-19 and 2) recognize and treat early psychiatric symptoms in Covid-19 patients. Methods Based on what was described in other epidemic crisis, we established a semi-structured interview to evaluate several dimensions of the patientsâ€™ life that may have been affected by Covid-19 and that may impact on mental health. The interview included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale â€“ Revised (IES-R) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Each patient was observed multiple times over several months. Our evaluation was done in parallel with consultations in Internal Medicine. Results Most patients complained of symptoms directly related with the infection of SARS-CoV-2, namely fatigue, short breath and reduced tolerance to efforts. Importantly, many patients also reported de novo or aggravation of anxiety, stress, depression, sleep disturbances and grief often associated with feelings of existential emptiness and lack of purpose.

"Mental Health Sequelae in Health Professionals in Spain during the COVID Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised several concerns regarding its mental health effect on patients and professionals.

The professionals had to face several unprecedented challenges: improvised hospitals, living in hotels to avoid infecting the family, deciding, as in wartime, which patients could be intubated and which could not, doubling shifts, and above all, the uncertainty about the disease, the high severity and the contagiousness that isolated the patients from their family, leaving the health professional with the responsibility of being a caregiver in the broad sense of the word. With this picture several studies have reported a high prevalence of mental disorders. A survey of 9138 Spanish professionals conducted during the first wave of the pandemic showed that 45.7% had a mental disorder (depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder and SUD), 14.5% had any disabling current mental disorder and 8.4% had suicidal thoughts. In Spain, managed by the Galatea Foundation, there is a special programme of confidential care for doctors with a mental illness or addiction. During the pandemic, a 30% increase of requests for help were registered, 70% of which came from primary health care professionals. The presentation provides also qualitative data with testimonies of professionals and anti-stress protection measures implemented by some health institutions.

"PTSD symptoms and coping before and during COVID-19 pandemic among help-seeking veterans: prospective cohort study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the mental health of individuals around the world. Ex-combatants have been repeatedly shown to be increased risk of experiencing social and psychological problems during emergencies. Objectives To compare the severity of overall posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and PTSD clusters among help-seeking veterans before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second aim was to identify coping strategies used and track possible changes during the timeline. Methods Male war veterans receiving outpatient treatment at the Referral Center for PTSD were assessed at baseline (t1=12-18 months before the COVID-19 pandemic), during the first lockdown (March-June 2020) and 12 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2021). A total of 132 veterans participated in all three measurements. The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and The Brief COPE were used. Results Exposure to COVID-19 pandemic related stressors increased over time. The great majority of participants (91.0%) followed the preventive measures. The severity of the overall PTSD symptoms significantly decreased during timeline (t1=56.9, 11.15;t2= 47.24, SD=12.87;t3= 44.1, SD=14.09). At t2, all participants still fulfilled the PTSD diagnostic criteria, and at t3, 23 participants (17.42%) did not meet all of the criteria for PTSD. The participants used adaptive coping rather than dysfunctional coping during the pandemic. Conclusions Despite the expectations of worsening the symptoms, help-seeking veterans with PTSD appeared to develop adaptive adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic stressors, which is in line with the results of the recent longitudinal research and will be discussed.

"Postpartum Depression, Catatonia and Covid-19 Infection: One Case, Different Clinical Presentations","Introduction Post-partum depression may occur in the first year after childbirth in approximately 25% of women, at times presenting with psychotic symptoms and catatonic states. Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome that occurs in association with various neuropsychiatric disorders and can be described according to the characteristics of its manifestation in types such as retarded or agitated. Objectives We report the case of a patient with postpartum depression and catatonic syndrome who, after a session of electroconvulsive therapy, was infected with Sars-COV-2, suspended treatment, and had her condition aggravated with distinct clinical manifestations. Methods Clinical case report and non-systematic review of articles consulted in the PubMed platform. Results A 24-year-old patient develops depressive symptoms and obsessive behaviour 6 months after delivery and deteriorates with mutism, stupor and motor immobility. She was hospitalised and medicated with lorazepam, with no improvement. One session of electroconvulsive therapy was carried out with improvement of the symptoms. Due to an inpatient Covid-19 outbreak, in which the patient was infected, treatment was suspended. During isolation, deterioration of the patientâ€™s condition was observed with psychomotor agitation, bizarre behaviour, and perseverative speech. The patient resumed treatment with ECT, with total remission of the catatonic syndrome and improvement of the affective symptoms. Conclusions Catatonic syndromes are relatively rare, but its association with post-partum depression is not so uncommon. The occurrence of different presentations of catatonia, although described as possible in the same episode in the literature, were not found in any clinical studies reviewed, which leads us to conclude that it is an uncommon situation.

"Mental health status, hope and resilient coping in Portuguese higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The current pandemic crisis disturbed the life of universities and college campuses leading to an overwhelming effect on the educational system, social life, and mental health of students. In this scenario, coping strategies like resilience and hope provide a counterbalance in periods of uncertainty and stress. Objectives This study aims to: a) evaluate the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic;b) characterize the hope and resilient coping levels of graduate students. Methods Using a convenience sampling method, online self-reported data were collected between April 2020 to January 2021. The information gathered includes a Sociodemographic Form, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Herth Hope Index (HHI). Results A total of Portuguese 1522 students (75.1% women and 24.9% men) took part in this study. The sample mean age was 22.88Â±6.93 years [range 18-59 years]. We identified a significant prevalence of symptoms of stress (35.7%), anxiety (36.2%) and depression (28.5%) in our population. The BRSCS score indicated that 60.2% of students exhibited low, 22.7% moderate and 17.1% high levels of resilient coping. The HHI mean was 35.53Â±5.92 [range 12-48]. Conclusions The study findings indicate a substantial portion of the students is at high risk of psychological consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study recommends that is needed to get a wider picture of todayâ€™s â€œnew normalâ€ education and to develop supportive strategies to enhance studentsâ€™ mental health and well-being in future pandemics.

"Telehealth in Australia","Introduction There is a significant psychiatry workforce shortage in Australia, particularly in rural and remote communities. Given the large distances involved, telehealth â€“ providing consultation via videoconference â€“ has been widely accepted. Psychiatrists were among the highest users of telehealth services in Australia before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a major transformation to service delivery across Australia. Private psychiatrists and state public mental health services had to rapidly transition to largely telehealth delivery to ensure continuity of care for consumers. In March 2020, additional telehealth item numbers were added to the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to encourage physical distancing for those accessing medical services during the pandemic. Objectives To provide an overview of the increase in telehealth activity since the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The MBS is the list of services for which the Australian Government will pay a rebate. Key data on MBS telehealth activity since March 2020 was examined. Results The use of telehealth has increased during the pandemic. A survey of Royal Australian and New College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) psychiatrists found that 93% supported retention of telehealth MBS item number numbers following the COVID-19 pandemic, noting increased accessibility for consumers. Positive feedback has been received from consumers. Conclusions During 2020 and 2021, the RANZCP worked with the Australian Government to ensure there were appropriate MBS telehealth services available for consumers. The RANZCP continues to work with the Government as they plan for a longer-term transformation of telehealth services beyond 2021.

"Pregnancy and dysfunctional anxiety in women recovered from Covid-19","Introduction Studies have shown an increasing prevalence of mental health issues in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, pregnant women are a specific population at particular mental risk. Objectives The objectives of our study were to assess dysfunctional anxiety in women recovered from COVID-19 and to identify the impact of pregnancy on coronavirus-related dysfunctional anxiety. Methods This was a cross-sectional case-control study. The women in the case group have been infected with Sars-Cov 2, with a benign or pauci-symptomatic clinical form, and cured for one to two months at the time of the study without any post-COVID complications. Women included in the control group have not been infected with Sars-Cov 2 .Anxiety was assessed by the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). Results In total, we recruited 30 women in the case group and 30 women in the control group.The average age of the case group was 35.8 Â±6.8 years versus an average age of 35.3 Â± 6.33 years in the control group. In each group, four women were pregnant (13.3%). Nearly one-third of the patients in the case group had a CAS score indicating dysfunctional anxiety probably related to coronavirus (33.3%), with a significant difference with the control group (p=0.026). In the case group, pregnancy was a risk factor for dysfunctional anxiety with p=0.036, OR=19.46 and CI95% = [1.21-314.00]. Conclusions COVID-19 has a negative impact on perinatal mental health.

"The Usefulness of Telemedicine in Perinatal Mental Health Services During and after COVID-19 Pandemic Detailed Experience of the Team of â€žTogetherâ€ Baby-Mother-Father Unit in Budapest","Due to the nature of the perinatal period, it affects generations who are more at home in the electronic space, hence some form of telemedicine can be used in a number of areas. The â€œTogetherâ€ Baby-Mother-Father Integrated Program has been running since 2004. Both the condition of those affected and the current epidemic makes it difficult for patients and their families to access adequate perinatal specialist care. At the beginning of the epidemic, the switch to telemedicinal psychiatric care has been rapid and focused mainly on the use of Phone, Skype, Viber and Email. To our findings the advantages include, easier access to care, and more frequent contacts. The home environment is accessible and the families are more involved. Also, care does not compete with the scarce resources of time and space. Some of the possible disadvantages are, that more work on intimacy is needed, and the treatability of certain diseases is questionable (e.g., psychoses). Care is less documentable with the current regulations, and funding has not yet been adapted to the changes. The telemedicinal care and support network in Hungary - among many - contains an online medical system (EESZT) including e-prescription. Online- psychotherapy, consultation, peer-group platforms. There is a non-stop hotline for patients, etc. In 2021 the total number of our cases increased by 34%, but realistically the visit number was also higher, due to the amount of shorter telephone and e-mail interactions.

"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mother-Infant Mental Health Relationship","Maternal health cannot be separated from infant, child and adolescent health, which includes mental health as well. Expecting mothers go through a number of changes during their pregnancy. Due to the specific alterations of their physique and immune system, pregnant mothers are more vulnerable to the Covid-19 infection. This highlights the importance of the vaccinations in their cases. During the pandemic, mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and stress aroused in greater numbers. This affected mothers, and younger children as well. Expecting mothers, without pre-existing mental disorder (&gt;50%) reported a weightier level of anxiety in their first trimester. Also, infants can suffer developmental disadvantages, as their infected mothers are separated from them. Even though evidence is not yet clear in this topic, vertical transmission seems to be fairly uncommon. Treatment guidelines, that could help Covid-19 infected mothers to handle their infants, are scarce. Hence the importance of telehealth has started to be outlined. Separation from the children might be necessary, while the mental health of mother and infant is continuously screened, since the long-term consequences of the symptoms are still unknown. Hence, prevention is imperative to avoid any negative effects. Even still, WHO advises mothers to breastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene, emphasizing the importance of skin-to-skin contact of newborns and sharing the room with them.

"Systematic review on ensuring the global food security and covid-19 pandemic resilient food systems: towards accomplishing sustainable development goals targets","Covid-19, one of the most critical and widespread global pandemics, has resulted in extraordinary risk corollaries engulfing millions of people's lives and has caused an unprecedented economic downturn while amplifying food insecurity. A systematic review of 132 scientific communicationsÂ was performed over a 15-year period, using articles from the ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases (2006â€“2021). In addition, 24 policy briefs, country papers, and publications from the UN, WHO, FAO, and OECD were cited. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on agricultural food systems, as well as potential strategies for building robust, resilient, and sustainable food systems to ensure global food security, safety, and endeavors regarding future global emergencies, as well as new research policies while achieving SDG targets. This would fillÂ a research gap while also having long-term implications for health, agricultural, and food resilience policy development in a rapidly changing world. Covid-19 demonstrates how human, animal, and environmental health are all interconnected, emphasizing the need for one health legislation and a paradigm shift in planetary health. Furthermore, it identifies potential mechanisms for rebuilding better systems by shifting priorities toward policy coherence, innovative food system governance, re-engineering market access, and nexus thinking in the food system approach. According to our findings, the COVID-19 posed unavoidable impediments to achieving SDG targets for food security and household poverty.

"Study of mental health of medical staff in a specialized hospital for COVID-19 in Novi Sad","Introduction The highly infectious novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and soon became a global pandemic. COVID-19 is escalating medical staff psychological stress and creating an increasingly heavy professional burden. Fear of transmitting the virus to family, community perception of frontline workers as potential disease carriers, extreme workloads and moral dilemmas add additional stressors. In Novi Sad Clinical Centre of Vojvodina (CCV) for the past 2 years there has been a continuous struggle against the COVID-19 crisis. Both senior specialist doctors and newly hired young doctors, some without work experience, were hired immediately after completing their studies. Objectives To investigate the mental health of clinical first-line medical staff in COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This is a cross-sectional study involving CCV staff who worked in the first line of patient treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were given a self-administered questionnaire which included information on demographic and socio-economic characteristics and the validated Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scaleâ€“Revised (IES-R) instrument. A total of 190 medical workers were involved. Results Sixty-two (32,6%) participants screened positive for anxiety, 38 (20%) for depression, 68 (35,8%) for stress, and 22 (11,5%) for clinical concern of PTSD.

"â€œPre-Existing and New-Onset Cognitive Impairment in Patients with COVID-19â€","Recently, many reports have been available related to neuropsychiatric complications in the course of COVID-19 infection, and its long-term consequences. Many of them are related to psychological factors, such as: isolation, change of existing habits, fear of getting sick and dying, fear of losing a job and fears related to the financial situation, which resulted in an increase in the occurrence of diseases and mental disorders such as adaptation and anxiety disorders, depression. t has been also reported that treatment in conditions of intensive care unit lead to high prevalence of psychiatric disorders like PTSD in discharged patients. In our own studies we observed that patients with new appearing psychiatric symptoms were mostly those, who were professionally active, but did not work remotely. The time the patients spent at home had a negative impact on their well-being, they generally felt worse, their family life suffered more frequently. The most common cognitive symptoms, which are reported embrace: problems with short- and long-term memory, lack of mental clarity, feeling eclipsed, lightheaded, poor concentration, mental fatigue.

"Variable feelings of cohesion, trust, individualism and exclusion and their consequences on Swiss public mental health during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The first cases of COVID-19 in Switzerland were related to the Milan cluster in February 2020. Border crossing restrictions were imposed and economic support measures worth 40 billion Swiss francs were announced. By 24th September 2021 Switzerland achieved a fully vaccination rate of 54%, confirmed 836â€™000 cases and 11â€™060 deaths. Objectives The objective was to describe and analyse the mental health of the general Swiss population under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and itâ€™s social changes: including a case description, transgenerational influence and psychosocial treatment opportunities Methods To answer the research question, I used deepened internet research, population interviews among different age gropus and colloquies with healthcare providers and federal authorities. Results Different psychosocial phenomena lead to the transgenerational influence. Unfortunately, vaccination rate is slowed down by this pandemicâ€™s impacts on public mental health. While during the first wave the positive feelings of cohesion and trust dominated, the mood changed afterwards to anxiousness and reactive individualism. Among all generations the fear of infection was shown to be a general booster of anxiety and distress. In fact, Swiss experts perceive the corona crisis as a catalysator for depression and anxiety disorders. Conclusions Specific psychosocial treatment has to address general and individual vulnerability factors. However, staying in touch with family members, pursuing meaningful activities and being physically active can all help to overcome COVID-19 related mental health issues.

"Parental concerns during COVID-19-related school closures: childrenâ€™s behaviors and media usage","Introduction Coronavirus Disease 2019 has prompted widespread school closures and physical distancing measures. Concerns regarding COVID-19 school closures often increase stress levels in parents. Objectives This study examined whether higher levels of parental concerns were associated with childrenâ€™s problematic behaviors and other factors during COVID-19-related primary school closures. Methods Participants were 217 parents who responded to a web-based questionnaire covering parental concerns, subjective stress, and depression;childrenâ€™s sleep patterns, behavioral problems, and changes in activity level after COVID-19;previously received mental health services;and media usage during the online-only class period from community center in Suwon city. Results The number of parental concerns was associated with childrenâ€™s behavioral problem index (BPI) score (Pearson correlation 0.211, p &lt; 0.01), sleep problems (0.183, p &lt; 0.01), increased smartphone usage (0.166, p &lt; 0.05), increased TV usage (0.187, p &lt; 0.01), parentsâ€™ subjective stress levels (0.168, p &lt; 0.05), and parental depression (0.200, p &lt; 0.01). In families with children who previously received mental health services, the children reportedly suffered from more sleep and behavioral problems but not increased media usage, and parents noted more stress and depression. Parental concerns are related to family factors such as change of caregiver, no available caregiver, decreased household income, and recent adverse life events. Economically vulnerable people also reported higher rates of reported caregiver burden during COVID-19-related primary school closures, thus will require the potential heightened mental health needs.

"An Impulsive Suicide Attempt in a Patient with No Psychiatric History and a Recent COVID-19 Diagnosis: A case report","Introduction The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted concerns regarding increased suicide rates and exacerbation of underlying mental illness symptoms. â€¢There is evidence suggesting neurocognitive changes as well as immune response in COVID-19 infection may increase a patientâ€™s propensity for suicidal ideation. â€¢ Patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 may be affected by psychological factors of anxiety, stress related to having this novel virus as well as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep disorders throughout treatment and post-treatment of continued concerns. â€¢The combination of psychiatric, neurological, and physical symptoms associated with COVID-19 may elevate suicide risk Objectives We present a case of a female with no prior psychiatric history who impulsively attempted suicide after a recent COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent quarantine. Will explore possible link between increase of suicidal ideation and COVID-19 infection. Methods A case report. Results Link between increase of suicidal ideation and COVID-19 infection has not been clearly established but there have been reports, as in our case, of the possible vulnerability to mental illness and new onset suicidal ideation that COVID-19 survivors may experience. It may be useful to screen all patients for depressive symptoms after a COVID-19 infection. Early identification and treatment of depression in recovered COVID-19 patients will help to improve psychological impact on COVID-19 survivors and potentially reduce suicide rates.

"Covid -19 pandemicâ€˜s impact on the clinical presentation of brief psychotic disorders","Introduction A major increase in mental health issues was noted since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic even in patients with no history of mental health illness, specifically brief psychotic disorders. Objectives Establish the covid-19 pandemic circumstances as precipitating factors of psychosis independently from other stressors Methods This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study carried out in the psychiatric department of the University Hospital of Mahdia including two groups of patients over a period of 15 months: From October 2018 to December 2019 are pre-covid cases, and the second group consists of the ones admitted between June 2020 and August 2021. We have collected the data of patients diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder according to DSM-5. We have focused on two clinical characteristics of the psychotic episodes (theme of delusions, stressors). Results We have collected 19 patients, 12 among them during the pre-covid period. In our pre-covid period, brief psychotic disorder presented mostly with marked stressors (33.3%) whilst in the middle of the pandemic, marked stressors are present in only 14.3% of the cases. Which could suggest that this state of alarm can singlehandedly trigger psychosis. For the theme of delusions, in the pre-covid period, the religious theme appeared to be the most frequent (58.3%), whilst during the pandemic, persecution became the most prevalent (71.4%), showing how living in fear of contracting the virus could manifest itself in delusional content. Conclusions Living in a prolonged state of alarm is, in itself, a marked stressor, theoretically capable of increasing the psychosis rate and altering its characteristics.

"Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on people with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder","Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic has had a deleterious impact on populations across the world. Yet it remains unclear how this pandemic is affecting the psychological health of people with a previous history of mental illness. Objectives This study aims to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on patients with established mental disorders. Methods The PubMed and science direct databases were systematically searched using the keywords combination â€œCovid-19â€ and â€œpsychiatric disordersâ€, â€œthe pandemicâ€ and â€œmental disorders â€œ, from inception up to November 2021. We adopted a broad inclusion criterion for the study requiring patients to have a pre-existing mental disorder, excluding narrative reviews and preclinical studies. In addition, a search of google scholar was conducted to identify any additional relevant publications. Results We have found 26 studies but only 19 met our inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 2020 and 2021. 2 major results were identified. Symptoms deterioration was reported in individuals with severe mental disorders and those with schizophrenia in particular, such as depressive or anxiety symptoms, substance use and suicidal ideation, due to the psychological stress and physical distancing measures associated with the Covid-19 outbreak. The symptomatic treatments used in Covid-19 had frequent interactions with the most used antipsychotic drugs leading to a substantial increase in relapse rates in people with mental disorders.

"COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s burden on healthcare professionalsâ€™ mental health","Introduction Healthcare professionals report about anxiety, depression, and fear during pandemic COVID-19 worldwide. Resilience becomes the high-powered important mechanism that reduces stress impact on the emotional state of healthcare professionals. Objectives We suggested that effective resilience is associated with less COVID-19â€™s fear, as well as less anxiety, and depression;healthcare professionalsâ€™ mental health depends on age, gender, as well as involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19. Methods 211 healthcare professionals participated in the study and were evaluated with the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-item scale (CD-RISC-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale, PHQ-9, GAD-7. Results A negative correlation between resilience and fear of COVID-19 (p=0,01), anxiety (p=0,01), and depression (p=0,001) was found. Positive correlations were found between depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 (p=0,001), between age and fear of COVID-19 (p=0,05). No statistically significant association between age and depression, anxiety, or resilience was found. The significant difference of COVID-19 fear depending on gender â€“ female vs male (p=0,05) was found. No statistically significant difference in resilience and emotional state in healthcare professionals depending on the involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19 were found. Conclusions Resilience is associated with better mental health in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety and depression are connected with the fear of COVID-19 and highly comorbid in healthcare professionals.

"The epidemiology of distress: prevalence and associated factors of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness at the end of the first wave of COVID-19 in Qatar","Introduction There is paucity of epidemiological studies from the Arab world and most of the focus of available international data is on the early months of the pandemic. Objectives We conducted the first cross-sectional national phone survey of adults in Qatar during the end of the first wave of the pandemic (December 2020 -January 2021) to estimate the prevalence and determinants of depression and/or anxiety. Methods We used the Physician Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 with cut-off scores of =10;the revised UCLA loneliness scale;and questions related to COVID-19 status, death of family or friend, quarantine, health and changes in living arrangements. Bivariate and logistic regression models estimated associations between thirteen variables and combined depression-anxiety (score of 20 or higher). Results The two-week prevalence of depression was 6.5% (95%CI: 5.1-8.4), of anxiety 5.1% (95%CI: 3.8-6.9), but only 2.5% sought mental health professional help since the pandemic started. When including loneliness (OR=1.57, p (&lt;0.001) in the model, the following variables were statistically significantly associated with depression-anxiety: female gender (OR=1.90, p=0.037), Qatari nationality (OR=2.37, p=0.018), Arab ethnicity (OR=3.14, p=0.007), and COVID-19 death of family or friend (OR=3.06, p=0.003). Without adjusting for loneliness, younger age (18-29 versus 40+ years of age: OR=2.9, p=0.004) and chronic health conditions (OR=2.0, p=0.029) were significantly associated with depression-anxiety.

"All that was missing from the students of the University of Patras and the return to a new daily life after quarantine","Introduction The pandemic that broke out by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the imposition of restrictive measures to reduce the dispersion, affects both the physical and mental health of all population groups. Objectives The main objective of the study was to investigate how these measures have impacted the students during the first quarantine period (Spring 2020). Also we wanted to know what they lacked most after the six-weeks-lockdown. Methods More than 2,000 students from all Schools of the University of Patras participated in the research, completing an online questionnaire. Emphasis was placed on the question â€œWhat is the FIRST thing you will do immediately after lifting the measuresâ€. The open last option â€˜Otherâ€™ was qualitative investigated with thematic analysis by gender. Results The answer options of the evaluated question were to â€˜Go out for coffee/food/drink/fun with friendsâ€™ (58%) or â€˜with familyâ€™ (5%), to â€˜Visit beauty and hair salonsâ€™ (16%), to â€˜Travelâ€™ (6%), or to â€˜Go shoppingâ€™ (2%). The option â€˜Otherâ€™ was answered by 246 (13%) students. The thematic analysis revealed 13 categories, with first place â€˜Restoring immediately social life without restrictionsâ€™, followed by â€˜Seeing and being together with boyfriend/girlfriendâ€™, but at the same time â€˜Continue to be careful and take self-restraining measures after the end of the quarantineâ€™.

Researchers continually report widespread mistrust and negative attitudes towards vaccination, but only a little focus on its association with the emotional well-being. Objectives We aimed to investigate the attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19, as well as its relationship with well-being and religiosity after one year of the pandemic duration amongst Polish students. Methods We conducted an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between 12th April â€“ 1st June 2021 amongst Polish students (n=1202). To evaluate emotional distress, we used the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), for measuring spirituality/religiosity we used The Duke University Religion Index. Results The highest rate of vaccinated individuals was noted in a group of medical students (69.9%), the lowest - among responders studying science (1.9%). Students who wanted to be vaccinated had higher levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms compared to those who were already vaccinated (p=0.04);they also had higher depressive symptoms than unvaccinated and unwilling participants (p=0.028). Students who didnâ€™t want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 showed the highest religiosity compared to those who would like to be vaccinated (p&lt;0.001) or were vaccinated (p=0.003). There was a negative correlation between the level of religiosity and severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms (p=0.002). Conclusions 1. The attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19 depended on the fields of study. 2. Religiousness has been linked with the attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination as well as level of depression and anxiety amongst Polish students.

"Positive responses to stress in the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic (in Russian sample)","Introduction The aim of the study was to adapt the Coping Self-efficacy Scale for research Russian population in the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic for researching positive personal resources to overcome peritraumatic COVID-19 distress. To solve this task we also used Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz) and Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Tadeshi & Calhoun) - both adapted by M. Magomed-Eminov. These two methods allow us to assess the connection coping self-efficacy with both the traumatic experience and the experience of post-traumatic growth. And to use the results to prevent mental health. Objectives 342 participants (students and masters;18,2% male, 81,8% female;age: 20-30 years). Methods Russian version of Coping self-efficacy scale developed in Psychological Helping and resocialization Department Lomonosov Moscow State University;Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory â€“ PTGI (Tadeshi & Calhoun), Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz), - both adapted by M. Magomed-Eminov. Results Russian version of Coping self-efficacy scale has high reliability-consistency (Cronbachâ€™s a = 0.916).

"Prevalence of depression among college students living alone in pandemic 2020","Introduction The prevalence of depression differs between groups, such as race, gender, and age group. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is one of the leading causes of death in the age group of 15-29 years-old. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries, including Indonesia, ordered a nationwide physical distancing and limited public activities. Indonesia also restricts the public mobilities, leaving the college students, studying in different regions, isolated and confined to their flats, boarding houses, and apartments. Objectives To find out the prevalence of Depression in College Students, living alone, in Pandemic 2020. Methods College students aged 18 to 28 years old, were assessed using Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory (BDI-II), through Google Form, and shared using social media. We also grouped the participants to age, gender, religion, and types of housing, and did the multivariate analysis using median comparison and multinomial logistic regression. Results A total of 84 college students, who are living alone during the Pandemic 2020, participated in this study. We found that 33.3% of the population suffered from depression. The median score for the group of females, prefer not to say their religion, and living in the owned house have a higher median. While multinomial logistic regression study does not have any significant odd risks in the variables.

"Public Mental Health Approaches for Building Resilience in Communities","Crises such as the corona pandemic, but also climate change associated events such as extreme weather events are major stressors for people on an individual, but also on a population level. Such crises often lead to highly burdened individuals with reduced quality of life, decreased well-being, mental health problems and an accumulation of psychiatric illnesses, especially in vulnerable population groups. These create a high demand and need for low intensive (psychosocial) support and primary and clinical care that can often no longer be adequately met by the existing infrastructure. However, good mental health and mental health care is a necessary prerequisite for people to lead fulfilling and productive lives and for communities and their settings (such as families, schools and workplaces, etc.) to function well. Therefore efficient supporting (public mental health) approaches are urgently needed. This presentation will introduce and discuss public mental health approaches and their effectiveness with a focus on mental health promotion and prevention.

"A latent profile analysis of intuitive eating behaviors related to wellbeing, eating behaviors, and physical activity during the early COVID-19 pandemic","Intuitive eating (IE) is a promising approach to improve eating behaviors that is primarily focused on eating in attunement with one's internal signals of hunger and satiety. Intuitive eating is related to an array of benefits including improved physical and mental health;however, many gaps exist in the IE literature. The current work utilized a novel approach in the IE context, a latent profile analysis (LPA) of 947 adults, to identify common patterns of responses to the four subscales of IE during the early COVID-19 pandemic, a time period currently understudied in the IE field. The study employed independent LPAs for two subsamples (n = 446 undergraduate students and n = 501 community members) to detect potential differences in model structure. The derived profiles were then used to test associations between COVID-19-related changes in dietary behaviors and weight concern, gender, weight loss attempts, physical activity, and mental health. LPAs of the combined sample resulted in a four-profile model. This model structure was not replicated in the undergraduate and community subsamples which showed notably different profile solutions. The two undergraduate profiles distinguished patterns of responses that were associated with lower overall (Low) and moderately high (Mod-high) levels of IE. Men were more likely to be in the Mod-High profile compared to women and the Low profile was associated with higher amounts depression, anxiety and weight loss attempts, increases in food eaten during the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher probabilities of increased weight concern during the pandemic. The community subsample showed a four-profile solution. 1: high levels of Unconditional Permission to Eat (UPE) and low levels of Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons (EPR), Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues (RHSC), and Body-Food Choice Congruence (B-FCC), which was related to increases in amount of food eaten, depression, and anxiety, and higher probabilities of increases in weight concern compared to the other profiles. 2: moderately high levels of UPE and very low levels of EPR, RHSC, and B-FCC, which showed the highest rates of weight loss attempts as well as high probabilities of increased weight concern. 3: moderate to high levels of all 4 IE subscales characterized by fewer weight loss attempts than profiles 1 and 2. 4: highest overall levels of IE which had the most stability in their weight concern compared to the other profiles. There were no gender differences between the four profiles of the community subsample and there were no associations with physical activity in either the undergraduate or community subsamples' profiles. These findings support the hypothesis that multiple, distinct profiles of IE exist and have unique relationships with health-related behaviors and outcomes. However, profile structures did vary between the undergraduate and community subsamples, suggesting limited generalizability between the two groups. Together, results suggest that IE levels both globally and in specific, naturally-occurring combinations of subscales are differentially related to eating and dieting behaviors, body image, and mental health. In application, findings suggest there may be benefits to recognizing varying patterns of IE to create tailored techniques for interventions seeking to increase these adaptive eating behaviors. Future research should continue to employ person-centered approaches alongside variable-centered ones to study more diverse populations and non-pandemic conditions.

"BAD NEWS FOR HYPOCHONDRIACS: Covid-19 Associated Aggravation of Somatic Symptom Disorder with Psychotic Depression","Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic has brought with it far-reaching consequences that affect the mental health of a significant population. Those suffering from somatic symptom disorder (SSD) present a significant focus on physical symptoms, with excessive thoughts and behaviours, to an extent that results in major distress and dysfunction. Aggravation of SSD could be associated with various stressors, including the current pandemic, and culminate in an increased severity of the base presentation. Objectives The authors present the case of an elderly man with previous diagnosis of SSD which began to aggravate and evolve into a depressive psychotic state, precipitated by the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods The authors conducted a non-systematized literature review with focus on those articles most pertinent to the topic in question as well as presenting a clinical case as compliment. Results With the pandemic overwhelming the globe, the literature has demonstrated a significant correlation with aggravation of mental health and psychiatric cases. The patient in question was previously followed in consultation for SSD. With the pandemic acting as precipitating stressor, the patient demonstrated a significant aggravation in his base presentation with the development of psychotic depression. He was subsequently hospitalized with implementation of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological methods, with remission of the psychotic state, with poor response of the SSD. Conclusions External stressors are an important influence on psychiatric disorders. Whenever potential life stressors, especially those that exert influence on a global scale, the psychiatrist should be attentive to the possibility of significant aggravation of a stabilized clinical picture and offer support.

"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Social Determinants of Mental Health and Psychiatric Decompensation","Introduction The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has propelled changes in healthcare delivery, incorporating new technologies and resulting in interruptions of care and access to treatment. Objectives To understand the ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health, particularly in those with psychotic disorders. The unique nature and scale of the COVID-19 pandemic today presents an opportunity to learn more about the challenges faced by our patients and improvements that can be made in the delivery of mental healthcare. Methods We report five cases of patients with preexisting psychotic disorders seen on an inpatient psychiatry unit who decompensated for reasons relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a review of the literature by searching the PubMed database for the keywords â€œmental health,â€ â€œpsychosis,â€ â€œCOVID-19,â€ â€œepidemic,â€ â€œpandemic,â€ and â€œcoronavirus. Results The prevalence of psychotic disorders in the US is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.64%. In the context of an epidemic or pandemic, the incidence of psychotic symptoms in those infected with a virus is estimated to be between 0.9% and 4%, demonstrating increased risk to this group. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to psychiatric decompensation. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to identify ways in which our patients are at risk and how we can attempt to alleviate those risks to provide improved care going forward.

"Baseline beliefs, depression, anxiety, and stress in humanities students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as mental trauma. The concept of baseline beliefs helps to explain the extent to which mental trauma affects individuals. Objectives The study aimed to investigate baseline beliefs in humanities students in Russian universities and analyse the relationship between baseline beliefs and emotional reactions. Methods Data collection was carried out between May and July 2020 using a Google form that we developed. A total of 92 humanities students participated in the study. The WAS-37 was used to examine baseline beliefs, and the DASS-21 was used to determine depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Results We found that the mean values of the scales â€œBenevolence in the Worldâ€ (M = 34.8Â±6.5), â€œSelf-imageâ€ (M = 27.2Â±4.4), â€œLuckâ€ (M = 32.7Â±5.7) and â€œControlling beliefsâ€ (M = 27.9Â±4.0) were above the normative mean values for the Russian population and only the values of the scale â€œJusticeâ€ (M = 20.8Â±3.8) were below these. All components of baseline beliefs had negative associations with depression, anxiety, and stress;only â€œBenevolence in the Worldâ€ was associated exclusively with anxiety (rs = -0.223, p &lt; 0.05), and â€œJusticeâ€ with depression (rs = -0.223, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions In a pandemic, the world around them is perceived by humanities students as less fair. Trust in the world, beliefs about the fairness of the world and a positive self-image are correlated with a more favourable emotional state. By this, we support the view that individualsâ€™ implicit beliefs (baseline beliefs) are related to the severity of the traumatic event.

"Psychotropic drug repurposing for COVID-19: a systematic review","Introduction Recently, several antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics have been suggested to have favorable effects in the treatment of COVID-19. Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to collect evidence from preclinical and clinical studies concerning the scientific evidence for the repurposing of psychotropic drugs in COVID-19 treatment. Methods Two independent authors searched PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycInfo, Clinical Trial Registration Site US (ClinicalTrials.gov) databases, and reviewed the reference lists of articles for eligible articles published up to May 31st, 2021. All preclinical and clinical studies on the effect of any psychotropic drug on Sars-CoV-2 or patients with COVID-19 were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for the quality assessment of clinical studies. This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. Results 22 studies were included in the synthesis: 9 clinical studies, 9 preclinical studies, and 4 computational studies. The use of antidepressants, both SSRI and non-SSRI, was associated with a reduced risk of severe complications of COVID-19. Several antipsychotics showed an increased risk for both Sars-CoV-2 infection and severe complications during COVID-19. Conclusions The current evidence supports a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 role for several antidepressants, while the evidence on mood stabilizers or antipsychotics remains controversial.

"Stress and sleep: impact of the main contributing factors to poor sleep experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoplesâ€™ sleep quality and mental health. Objectives The aim of the current study was to prospectively identify decreased sleep quality and associated risk factors in general population during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a prospective, observational online study on a Romanian sample of 667 respondents aged &gt;18 years. Sleep quality and quantity was evaluated with Athens Insomnia scale (AIS) and the main concerns associated with the pandemic context were evaluated through a multiple-choice question. Results The data collected identified important evidence regarding the prevalence and intensity of insomnia. The average score for AIS was 6.13 (cut-off point for was set at 8). However, it is worth noting that 179 respondents (26.8%) meet the criteria for insomnia. Of the 8 self-assessment items, daytime sleepiness was the criterion evaluated with the highest average score (1.01), all other items getting subunit values. A low quality of sleep was linearly related with fear of illness/death (p=0.053), fear of illness/death of close people (p=0.032), social isolation (p&lt;0.001), economic impact (p=0.003), losing the job (p&lt;0.001) and social stigma associated with COVID-19 infection (p=0.009). Conclusions More than a qurter of respondes scored above the threshold of 8 at the insomnia scale, while losing the job, social stigma associated with COVID-19 infection and social isolation are the main risk factors for a low quality and quantity of sleep.

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression among students and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are experiencing severe mental distress. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns have developed. Objectives The aims of this study was to report the levels of depressive and anxiety within active population in Romania, and to identify possible risk and protective factors for mental health. Methods Data collection occurred between February-March 2021. The online survey included questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 620 responses were validated (331 students and 289 workers). Results Among active population, risk of anxiety symptoms is lower in those who already were infected with SARS-Cov2 (p=0.026, df=2, Phi=0.109), while positive screening for anxiety or depression in this study was statistically significant associated with younger age (p=0.026, df=4, Phi=0.134) and female gender (p=&lt;0.001, df=2, Phi=0.166). Even though anxiety and depression scores are similar among students and employees, there are different aspects regarding symptomatology between these two groups. Students have experienced more frequently tendency to worry and sudden feelings of panic (p=0.004, df=3, Phi=0.146). Also, their ability to laugh and see the funny side of things is affected (p=0.019, df=3, Phi=0.127) and they feel less enthusiasm about future (p=0.001, df=3, Phi=0.159). Participants living with someone else scored lower on anxiety and depression subscales and those are not influenced by the person with whom they are cohabitating or residing (p=0.020, df=3, Phi=0.138).

"Recent Trends in Russian Psychiatry with Particular Emphasis on Training in Womenâ€™s Mental Health","There will be two main foci to this presentation. Firstly, Designing and implementing a new educational program entitled â€œWomen victims of domestic violence: Detection, clinic, helpâ€ â€“ that is mainly based on the teaching of several modules, WPA International Curriculum for Mental Healthcare Providers on Violence Against Women. Our program is a follow-on to the one held during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, at which interest was expressed in sharing ideas and resources. Secondly, Informing on the recent trends in Russian perinatal psychiatry. This covers the psychiatric training in the assessment domain, case management, and service evaluation. We will introduce and review some resources for use in womenâ€™s mental health practicals, propose innovative pedagogical structures for practical teachings, such as Problem Based Learning, â€˜Vicarious Learning,â€™ and encourage discussion of how the practical aspects of womenâ€™s mental health teaching can be supported and enhanced. Teaching modules and training pathways will be delivered (â€œnot too much;not too little and in the right orderâ€), and dimensions of quality in continuing professional development in womenâ€™s mental health (i.e., Sophistication, Credibility, Timeliness, and Utility) will be outlined. This will be followed by a discussion exploring the different prioritization of the teaching modules across various organizations.

"Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Youth Mental Health","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in national lockdowns in several countries. Previous global epidemics led to an increase in the number of psychiatric patients presenting symptoms of anxiety or depression. Knowledge about the impact of early lockdown initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of healthcare interactions is sparse. Objectives To investigate both the impact of the Danish lockdown event on psychiatric patientsâ€™ contact with the healthcare system, stratified by type of contact (face-to-face (FTF) or virtual) and ICD-10 diagnosis, and how acute contacts were impacted in the five regions in Denmark. Methods Contacts in this study include all recorded FTF and virtual treatment interactions between patients and healthcare systems. An interrupted time series analysis was applied to determine the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown event on the number of contacts with psychiatric hospitals in Denmark, from February 25, 2019 to May 3, 2020. The analyses took a Box-Jenkins approach to fit an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Results Virtual contacts replaced most FTF contacts during the lockdown. For most patient groups, the total number of contacts did not decrease significantly. However, for child and adolescent patients diagnosed with F 10â€“19, 70â€“79, and 80â€“89, the number of contacts decreased during lockdown. The number of acute contacts with the psychiatric system decreased significantly during lockdown. Conclusions The Danish healthcare system was forced to introduce innovative tele-psychiatry to mental health care during the lockdown. Disruption to service delivery was minimized because the resources were in place to sustain the transition from FTF to virtual contacts.

"How are medical schools supporting studentâ€™s mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted medical students in many ways. They are not exempt from personal struggles caused by the health crisis, and many have faced similar challenges adapting to a new learning experience. The University of East Anglia (UEA) has initiatives in place to support medical students including the society Headucate UEA and the Wellbeing Champions scheme established by Norwich Medical School (NMS). Objectives Headucate aims to improve mental wellbeing by educational online webinars and social events aimed at university students. NMS Wellbeing Champions offer support and signpost students to resources and the wider student support system at the UEA. Methods Headucate was established in 2012 by NMS students that began running workshops at local secondary schools. Their work has expanded to include wellbeing workshops, social events for students and mental health first aid training, so members can provide peer support. Wellbeing Champions are medical student representatives responsible for completing mental health first aid training, communication between students and faculty, providing resources and signposting, creating mental health bulletin newsletters, and running socials exclusively for medical students. Results 100% of Headucate workshop attendees who completed anonymous feedback agreed that they enjoyed it and that it was useful. No feedback has been collected regarding the success of the Wellbeing Champions. This should be carried out to assess and enhance the project further.

"The Importance of Cognitive Appraisal and Social Support in Pregnancy During COVID-19 from an Interdisciplinary View","Aim: To describe how a US-based psychiatric Mother-Baby Unit adopted a virtual platform during the pandemic. Objectives: When the Covid-19 pandemic descended, mental health clinicians world-wide were faced with maintaining access and care delivery. Pregnant and newly postpartum women experienced the pandemic and lockdown through the lens of impending parenthood and new parenthood--amplifying distress, isolation, and lack of social and family support. The lockdown prevented those with most acute illness from accessing daily treatment in our structured, supportive intensive treatment setting. We acknowledged the urgency of developing a method to continue to treat our patients in a group environment that offered psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, dyadic and family intervention, and social support. Methods: The hospital purchased â€œZoom for Healthâ€ platform to ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines. Cameras for individual computers were purchased with philanthropy funds, obtaining them quickly, compared to waiting for hospital funding. The clinical team designed a schedule of groups and individual sessions, each with their own zoom link. Each morning, a team member, sent the daily schedule through the patient portal of the EMR. Conclusion: Before the pandemic, the census was 12 pts per day. The full-day program paused for 7-10 days although individual sessions and medication management were conducted by phone as the virtual platform was constructed. Once established, census resumed normal levels. Challenges to running the Day Hospital virtually included: technology glitches, family demands and distractions, and privacy concerns. Overall, the program was a success wherein women requiring intensive treatment were able to receive treatment and social support.

"Illness anxiety disorder","Introduction The diagnosis of hypochondria has disappeared in the new classification of mental illness. About 25% of patients who were diagnosed with hypochondria now fall into the category illness anxiety disorder. This disorder constitutes a new diagnostic category in DSM5 and is included within the somatic symptom and related disorders. Objectives We propose to carry out a bibliographic review off the new diagnostic category of illness anxiety disorder. Methods We present the clinical case of a 27-year-old man in the context of the Covid19 pandemic. Results The illness anxiety disorder is characterized by being concerned about having or acquiring a serious illness. Somatic symptoms are not present, but if they are, they are of mild intensity. The level of concern is excessive or disproportionate if there is any disease or if there is a high risk of developing it. There is a high level of health anxiety and the individual is easily alarmed by personal health status. It is a disorder that tends to be chronic and recurrent. The exact comorbidity is still unknown. However, it is important to keep in mind that hypochondria concurs with anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Treatment is based on the cognitive restructuring of bodily symptoms. In addition, exposure therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy are also effective. Regarding pharmacological treatment, SSRIs are useful in relation with comorbidity. Conclusions Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by significant attention to somatic concerns in medical places, making it very useful for primary care professionals.","Higueras, P.

"Changes in the practice of electroconvulsive therapy at Semmelweis University before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The Department of Psychiatry at Semmelweis University is the largest electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) centre in Hungary, where a total number of around 300 treatments are conducted every year. Certain changes were administered in 2018 and 2019 in our logistics and internal protocols that helped to increase the number of treated patients and improve quality of care. The COVID-19 pandemic caused serious disruptions in the Hungarian mental health care system , therefore there was a realistic fear that many patients who required ECT would not receive this form of tretament. Objectives Our goal was to assess the effects of the pandemic on our ECT service, and to analyse whether patients were able to receive treatment, despite the logistical difficulties. Methods We retrospectively gathered data from our internal documentation to compare the number of ECT treatments with the previous years. We also had to take into account the fluctuation in our general caseload of psychiatric patients, since our Department acted as a COVID-19 treatment centre for several months. Results Total number of ECT treatments decreased in 2020 after a peak in 2019, however the numbers were not much lower compared to the years before changes in 2018. Unfortunately, we see a more direct effect of the 3rd wave of the pandemic. Conclusions We can conlude that there is a decrease in the number of ECT treatments due to the pandemic, however, the fact that we still provided service in most parts of 2020 and 2021 for patients with the most severe conditions is a serious achivement.

"The impact of Gender Identity Clinic waiting times on the mental health of transitioning individuals","Introduction Waiting times for gender identity services, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, have been a cause of concern. Despite the waiting time standard for planned elective care in the NHS being a maximum of 18 weeks, the average waiting time for a first appointment with a gender identity clinic is 18 months. This study aims to analyse the effect that these timings have on the transgender community, and whether they impact the risk of developing mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. Objectives This studyâ€™s main aim is to analyse the correlation between waiting times and mental health burden in the transgender community. Methods A literature review and analysis on a transgender individualâ€™s mental health and waiting times for Gender Identity Clinics;looking at any key themes and conclusions. Research papers were taken from MEDLINE, The International Journal of Transgender Health, Oxford Academic, SpringerLink and Emerald Insight, with studies publishing date ranging from 2014 â€“ 2021. Results The transgender population were found to have higher rates of suicidal ideation, depression and self harm compared to the general population. Longer waiting times were found to contribute to feelings of low mood and suicidal ideation, as well as decreasing overall quality of life.

"COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality rates in people with severe mental illness: findings from two UK cohort studies","Introduction Recent systematic reviews have highlighted that people with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) have higher risks of infection, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19, although the full extent of these disparities are not yet established. Objectives Utilising electronic health records, we investigated COVID-19 related infection, hospitalisation and mortality among people with schizophrenia/psychosis, bipolar disorder (BD) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD) in two large UK samples: the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort study and GP-registered patients in Greater Manchester (GM). Methods We sampled 447,296 adults with and without SMI from UKB (inc. schizophrenia/psychosis=1,925, BD=1,483 and MDD=41,448, non-SMI=402,440) and 1,152,831 adults from GM (inc. schizophrenia/psychosis =46,859, BD=3,461, recurrent MDD=134,661, non-SMI = 922,264). Primary care, hospital and death records were linked to identify COVID-19 related outcomes. Logistic regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) to compare differences in COVID-19 outcomes by diagnosis, controlling for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. Results We will report the findings of unadjusted and adjusted analyses, comparing ORs for people with and without SMI, by diagnosis. Findings will be compared between the two datasets, with attention to the demographic and clinical profiles of each sample. We will consider the role of demographic characteristics and comorbidities in attenuating outcomes. Conclusions Emerging evidence suggests that people with SMI have higher risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality.

"Healthcare workersâ€™ knowledge and management skills of psychosocial and mental health needs and priorities of individuals with COVID-19","Introduction Individuals confirmed with COVID-19 were isolated or treated in medical and well-designated units;however, such a situation probably causing psychological and mental health problems that require prompt intervention. Objectives The purpose of this study was to identify the knowledge and management of healthcare workers regarding psychosocial and mental health priorities and needs of individuals with COVID-19. Methods This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. The data collected conveniently at one single point in time from 101 healthcare workers in Jordan directly managing the health of individuals with COVID-19. Results healthcare workers have moderate to a high level of knowledge of psychological distress related to COVID-19;mean ranged from 50-70% agreement and confidence. Healthcare workers had moderate to a high level of management of psychosocial and mental health needs. In general, healthcare workers were able to identify mental and psychosocial health needs and priorities at a moderate level.

"Psychological impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the operating room paramedical staff","Introduction the recent covid19 pandemic is not devoid of psychological risks on paramedical staff. Among them, those who work in the operating theaters are exposed to such risks. Objectives to determine the perceived stress level and the psychological impact of COVID-19 on paramedics in the operating room. Methods This is an observational, descriptive and analytical study carried out in the operating rooms of Sahloul University Hospital during a 3 month period. The data collection tool was a self-administered questionnaire composed of 5 main parts (socio-demographic characteristics, occupational characteristics, exposure to COVID-19, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Hospital Anxiety and depression scale (HADS)). Results 96 paramedical staff participated in our study. The average perceived stress score was significantly higher among anesthetists. 48% of participants had anxiety. Anesthetists had significantly higher anxiety scores (p = 0.001). 26.1% of participants had definite depression. Of those with definite depression, 35.3% were anesthetists (p = 0.028). Factors significantly associated with the occurrence of anxiety were: psychiatric history, increased workload, contact with a positive coronavirus patient in the operating room, and severe perceived stress. However, the factors significantly associated with the occurrence of depression were: initial training in the management of covid-19 patients, personal infection with SARS-COV2 and severe perceived stress. Conclusions Covid-19 pandemic is causing significant symptoms of anxiety and depression among operation room staff. Primary and secondary prevention strategies must then be undertaken.

"Sudden Death of Mental Health Service Users During a Pandemic;a follow up study of consecutive unexpected deaths during the current pandemic compared to a previous consecutive cohort of persons who took their own lives","Introduction The Covid pandemic has mental health consequences. This study examined service user suicides for thirteen months during the pandemic and â€œlock downâ€ restrictions in Ireland .It compares variables from this group with a previous 2016 study examining service user suicides conducted in Ireland. Despite a previous trend of improving suicide there was an increase in people who were involved with mental health services completing suicide during the pandemic. Objectives To hypothesize that social disequilibrium caused by the Covid pandemic and its control measures may remove the benefit of protective factors in suicide. Methods The 2016 study used the Suicide Support and Information System- Psychological Autopsy Model as its methodology.The Rosenberg criteria were used to make a determination of suicide. This 2021 study used an anonymous clinical record review to repeat some key variables identified in the SSIS-PAM work. Statiscal comparisons were made. Results The pandemic group had a different pattern of suicide with low levels of significance between four variables. The majority were female, in a relationship, had jobs, no history of self-harm, no family history of mental illness, less addiction problems and in-patient care. Like the 2016 group they did have diagnoses of mental illness, were in regular contact with services and were prescribed medication. Their suicides were predominantly hanging and drowning. Conclusions During the pandemic suicide increased. Protective factors such as relationships and employment were increased in pandemic suicides who also had less vulnerability factors such as addiction problems and self-harm. â€œReal timeâ€ suicide data collection such as a suicide observatory model might identify more significant trends.

"Perceived Stress and risk of infection among Covid-19 frontline Healthcare workers","Introduction Working at Covid-19 frontline may threaten physical and mental health healthcare workers (HCWs). Assessing perceived Stress in HCWs is important to prevent serious mental illness Objectives Assess the association between perceived stress and risk perception among healthcare workers working in the Covid-19 unit. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers working in a COVID-19 unit between March and July 2021 through a self-administered questionnaire. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was used to assess perceived stress. The perceived risk of getting infected was assessed by a 5-item Likert Scale. The perceived risk of family membersâ€™ infection was evaluated by a Scale from 0 to 10. Results A total of 85 participants were included. The mean age was 31Â±6 years. About 87% of participants lived with their families. Seventy-six per cent of HCWs rated their health status greater than or equal to 8/10. A percentage of 18,8% of HCWs have been infected with the Covid-19. Our population consisted of 44.7% technicians and 24,7% nurses, and 80% of the participants reported direct contact with COVID-19 confirmed patients. The level of the perceived risk of getting infected was high to very high in 95% of the HCWs. The mean score of the perceived risk of family members contracting the virus was 5.7 and 27,1% rated it greater than or equal to 8. The PSS-10 showed moderate and high perceived stress in 82,3% and 7,1% of participants, respectively. Only 10,6% of HCWs presented low-stress perception.

"The consequences of the pandemic among patients with psychiatric history","Introduction Throughout this period we were confronted with news and information about the Corona virus and its consequences. Which led to the development of a huge sense of fear among people. Although fear has helped to maintain restrictions, it has also had a significant impact on mental health, especially among patients with a psychiatric history. Objectives In this paper I will highlight the consequences of the nocebo effect of the pandemic among people with a psychiatric history. Methods To complete this work I used medical articles, studies, and specialized information on the subject. Results The pandemicâ€™s restrictions have made it difficult for psychiatric patients to be compliant treatment by avoiding regular psychiatric exams.Isolation and fear of infection has led to new decompensations in existing psychiatric pathologies.

"Anxiety and Depression among Patients Admitted at COVID wards of East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) Using the Validated Filipino Version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-P)","Introduction COVID-19 is a multifaceted disease establishing differences in terms of its occurrence, manner of clinical presentation and disease predilection. While mental health becomes one of the less analyzed aspects, addressing anxiety and depression allows clinicians to provide more patient-centered care in this pandemic era. Objectives This study determined the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among patients admitted for at least 14 days at COVID wards of East Avenue Medical using the validated Filipino version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-P), and described the socioeconomic, psychosocial, clinical factors affecting its development among COVID-19 patients. Methods 232 patients admitted at COVID ward of East Avenue Medical Center for at least 14 days were included in the study. Participants were interviewed using the validated Filipino version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS-P) questionnaire. STATA 13.1 was used for data analysis at 95% confidence interval Results Anxiety was significantly correlated with hypertension (p= 0.044), diabetes (p= 0.008), employment status (p= 0.038), and with patients who had family members with COVID- 19 (p= 0.033). Depressive symptoms occurred more likely in Chronic Kidney Disease and in COVID-19 suspects. Most participants had a normal HADS-P anxiety (6) and depression (4) median scores. Mild symptoms of anxiety (n=55) and depression (n=30) were noted among participants. The severity of COVID-19 classification was a statistically significant variable for developing anxiety symptoms.

"Depression in quarantined patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Quarantine for suspected patients of being infected by the COVID-19 can lead to negative consequences for mental health and the appearance of depressive symptoms. Objectives To assess the prevalence of depression in quarantined patients, and to analyze the associated factors. Methods This was a descriptive and analytical survey, carried out from April 4 to May 30, 2020, with 149 patients consulting the COVID-19 sorting box at the Hedi Chaker CHU in Sfax. Suspected COVID-19 patients were contacted by phone during their quarantine and invited to participate in our study. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale was used to assess the severity of depression. Cutoffs of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe levels of depression based on PHQ-9 scores. A cutoff score of 10 determines major depression. Results The results showed a prevalence of major depression of 10.7%. Of all patients, 89.3% had minimal to mild depression;10% had moderate to moderately severe depression and 0.7% had severe depression. The PHQ-9 score was statistically correlated with travel to a suspect area during the 14 days preceding the consultation (p = 0.008), contact with a subject confirmed COVID-19 (p = 0.01), previous follow-up in psychiatry (p = 0.047), the change of residence during quarantine (p = 0.045), the fear of transmitting the disease to relatives (p = 0.00) and the positive result of the nasopharyngeal swab (p = 0.00).

"Psychological problems in tunisian children during the covid-19 pandemic","Introduction The Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown have profoundly impacted familiesâ€™ daily life. Children may be among the most exposed to the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic. Objectives To assess the psychological well-being of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a descriptive study shared on social media during the period from 8 to 20 April 2021, targeting mothers of children aged 2 to 18 years. The first part included socio-demographic data of mothers and children. Then, to assess the behavior and coping skills of children and adolescents, we administered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results Our study included 65 middle-aged moms = 35.28 years. Among mothers, 1.5% reported having at least one child with a psychiatric, medical or genetic illness. The average age of the children was 8.54 years, the sex ratio was 1.03 and they were in primary school in 52.3%. Moms had talked to their child about COVID in 93.8%, using scientific data in 69.4% of cases. The total average SDQ score was 10.82;and overall mental health was at risk in 15.4% of the children. They had risky emotional symptoms in 9.2%, risky aggressive behaviors in 12.3%, risky hyperactivity-inattention symptoms in 16.9%, relationship behaviors with at-risk pairs in 24.6%, and risky prosocial behavior in 9.2% of cases.

"Tunisian mothers facing the covid-19 pandemic: what are the risks for their mental health?","Introduction Covid-19 pandemic put parents under great pressure, and the most vulnerable parents may have become too overwhelmed to find appropriate ways to be supportive caregivers and to address childrenâ€™s fears and insecurities. Objectives Assess the level of parental stress experienced by mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with that experienced by fathers. Methods This was a descriptive and comparative analytical study, shared on social networks during the period from 8 to 20 April 2021, targeting mothers of children aged 2 to 18 years. The mother answered the questionnaire for herself and her child. The level of stress experienced by the mother in the parent-child relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed by the brief version of the Parental Stress Index (PSI-SF). Results The total number of participants was 65 mothers. Parental stress level in mothers was high in 58.5%, the average PSI score was 94.25;the mean score of the parental distress subscale was 34.06;the mean score of the dysfunctional child-parent interaction subscale was 27.86;and the average score of the child difficulty subscale was 32.32. The mean scores of the parental distress subscale, the child difficulty subscale, as well as the mean PSI total score were significantly higher in mothers than in fathers, with p= 0.010;p= 0.022 and p=0.017 respectively.

"Assessing weight gain anxiety and weight-related behaviors in emerging adulthood","Health behaviors and obesity are often overlooked in Emerging Adulthood (EA;ages 18-25). Weight Gain Anxiety (WGA) is a novel concept used to examine psychological factors contributing to healthy weight-related behaviors, emphasizing differences between WGA and fear of weight gain, body image concern, and generalized anxiety. Little is known about how emerging adults have shifted in their mental health status and weight-related behaviors since the onset of COVID. A nationally representative sample of emerging adults ages 18-25 (n= 450) participated in an online survey. Descriptive statistics, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and a two-way MANOVA followed by Descriptive Discriminant Analysis (DDA) were run to (1) Examine WGA as a measure and relationships with health behaviors, (2) how health behaviors changed as a result of COVID-19, and (3) to examine intrinsic health beliefs related to BMI and WGA. Overall, healthy behaviors decreased during the pandemic (M=-3.88). The CFA demonstrated good model fit (CFI=.95, TLI=.93, RMSEA=.076[.062-.089], SRMR=.060) and indicators of WGA significantly contributed to the latent construct. WGA was negatively correlated with healthy diet (R=-.14) and positively related to food acceptance (R=.59), but not related to physical activity (R=.05). Dietary habits were positively correlated with physical activity (PA;R=.28) and negatively with food acceptance (R=-.13). Food acceptance and PA were not correlated (R=.04) There was a significant interaction effect between BMI and WGA (F(20, 1433.73)=1.71, p=.027, LAMBDA = .93, partial eta2 = .019). The DDA revealed that this interaction effect was explained by perceived benefits of healthy behaviors (rs=93, B=.87). WGA is a novel construct that impacts health behaviors and health beliefs and was differentiated from similar concepts and defined in this dissertation. However, WGA did not relate to healthier behaviors as hypothesized. Additionally, health behaviors were reported to decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic, warranting investigation on how to buffer these effects. Finally, WGA and weight-related health behaviors were categorized into four groups, and these groups interacted with BMI categories. Participant perceptions of perceived benefits of healthy behaviors may be a gateway to understanding the interaction between WGA and BMI. Changes in health behaviors and mental health are two components of emerging adulthood that should be examined further in the context of WGA, diet, and COVID-19 to ensure appropriate supports are developed and implemented.

"Dynamics of emotional reactions among Russian students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The pandemic of a new coronavirus infection can be considered as a long-term traumatic event. It is known that chronic stress is characterized by dynamics of emotional state caused by processes of adaptation and maladaptation. Objectives Our study aimed to investigate the dynamics of depression, anxiety, and stress levels among Russian students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data were collected from May to July 2020 (the first pandemic wave) and from October 2020 to April 2021 (the second wave). A total of 170 non-medical university students participated in the study. We used the DASS-21 to determine levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Results We found that during the first wave of the pandemic, 57 % of students showed no symptoms of depression, 77 % had no symptoms of anxiety, and 76 % showed no signs of stress. In the second wave, 50 % of students showed no depression, 65 % no anxiety and 67 % no stress. Analysis of mean values showed that the second pandemic wave provoked higher levels of anxiety (M = 3.32Â±4.25 vs M = 4.71Â±4.71, p &lt; 0.05) and stress (M = 6.50Â±4.50 vs M = 7.99Â±4.97, p &lt; 0.05) . Conclusions The second wave of the new coronavirus pandemic provoked more severe emotional reactions among Russian students than the first. By these results we suggest that the duration of the pandemic harms the emotional state of the general population. Therefore, it is essential to develop and implement psychotherapeutic programs to restore the mental health of Russian citizens.

"Hopelessness and externality as predictors of experiencing anger during COVID-19 lockdown in Russia","Introduction Following Italy and many other European countries Russia entered a nationwide lockdown in March 2020. Since quarantine had impact on mental health (Gualano et al., 2020, Stanton et al., 2020), this study aimed to study the psychological predictors of low mental health and anger in Russian university students. Previous studies have shown that young people are most vulnerable part of population during Covid-19 pandemic (Pervichko et al., 2020). Objectives The purpose of this research was to assess the effects of externality and hopelessness on anger and irritation during COVID-19 lockdown. Methods The sample comprised 120 university students (86% women, M=18.84, SD=1.58) from Moscow. Online survey has been conducted in April 2020. Measures included Russian externality-internality scale based on Rotterâ€™s scale and three new scales specific for COVID-19 pandemic developed for this study to assess feeling of hopelessness (a = 0.72), anger (a = 0.70) and positive reformulation (a = 0.84). Results Anger shows significant correlations with hopelessness (r=0.43;p&lt;0.001), externality (r=0.29;p&lt;0.01) and positive reformulation (r=â€“0.41;p&lt;0.001). Structural equation modeling confirms theoretical model according to which the effect of externality on anger is mediated by hopelessness and positive reformulation (negatively) (indirect effects sig. at p&lt;0.01, <U+03C7>2 = 1.32;df = 1;p = 0.251;CFI = 0.995;TLI = 0.969;RMSEA = 0.052. Conclusions Conclusions. Anger and irritation regarding the necessity to stay at home during COVID-19 lockdown may be caused by external locus of control which effect on anger is mediated by hopelessness and limited capacities for positive reframing.","Gordeeva, T.; Sychev, O.; Dovger, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Hopelessness+and+externality+as+predictors+of+experiencing+anger+during+COVID-19+lockdown+in+Russia","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S282-S282, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40626,""
"New measure of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Individualsâ€™ beliefs about COVID-19 pandemic may affect their health-related behavior including self-isolation. â€œPositiveâ€ beliefs may be realistic (constructive belief that efforts help to prevent infection and spread of the virus) or rose-colored glasses (defensive belief that coronavirus problem is exaggerated aimed to cope with anxiety) with different consequences for behavior and mental health. Objectives Objectives: The aim was to develop the scales of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic (DCO-Covid) and analyze their psychometric properties, factor structure using CFA, internal consistency and validity. Methods The sample comprised 1403 university students (68% women, M=20.59, SD=3.66) from large cities of Russia. Online survey conducted from 10/4/2020 till 25/4/2020. Test battery included the scales of constructive and defensive optimism (each of 3 items) and measure of dispositional optimism (LOT-R, Scheier et al., 1994). Part of the sample (N=306) completed anxiety in a pandemic questionnaire (Tkhostov, Rasskazova, 2020). Results CFA indicated a good fit for the two-factor model (<U+03C7>2=27.11, df=8, p&lt;.001, CFI =.985, TLI=.971, RMSEA = .041, p[RMSEA=.05] = .78) with negative correlations between factors (â€“.28). Cronbachâ€™s alpha for defensive optimism and constructive optimism were a=.75 and a=.70 respectively. As expected constructive and defensive optimism correlated with dispositional optimism (r=.24;p &lt; .001 and r=â€“.06;p&lt;.05 respectively) and anxiety (fear of infection, r=.08;n.s and r= â€“.23;p &lt; .001). Conclusions The results show that DCO-C is a reliable measure of defensive and constructive optimism towards COVID-19 pandemic. The construct validity of these scales is confirmed by CFA and obtained correlations.","Gordeeva, T.; Sychev, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=New+measure+of+defensive+and+constructive+optimism+towards+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S283-S283, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40627,""

"Mental Health in the Consorci Sanitari del Maresme workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A descriptive cross sectional study","Introduction The global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals in an unprecedented challenge, considering them extremely at risk population. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of clinically significant mental disorders and to assess associated factors among Consorci Sanitari del Maresme workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We made a descriptive cross-sectional study. All workers were invited to participate in an online survey during May 2021. Individual characteristics and frequency of direct exposure to COVID during professional activity were assessed. We used three Spanish versions of psychometric scales: the Patient Health Questionnaire to evaluate depressive symptomatology, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, which detects anxiety, and the 4-item version of the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 for PTSD screening purposes. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results A total of 355 workers participated. Overall, 31% met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (PHQ-9&gt; 9), 36% for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7&gt; 9) and 22% for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PCL-5&gt; 7). It has been found that young adult, women, those with prior mental disorders or those with greater exposure to COVID-19 are risk factors for any current mental disorder. Conclusions There are large mental healthcare needs among healthcare professionals. There is a clear need to closely monitor the extent to which these needs are adequately met. In the design of measures and interventions to reduce this impact, an individualized approach should be considered while taking into account sociodemographic variables, psychiatric history and the frequency of direct exposure to COVID-19.

"Promoting physical activity among university students with a co-constructed program during Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, sanitary context and e-learning has greatly modified studentsâ€™ lifestyles. An increase of sedentary behaviors, a reduction in physical activity (PA) and a stronger tendency to move towards unhealthy diet have been demonstrated. Most of the research is largely descriptive and to date, no interventional studies have been conducted to prevent the deterioration of studentsâ€™ health. Objectives The objective of the present research aims to evaluate the effects of an intervention program on the lifestyle and psychological state of student. Its primary objective is to promote PA among students, to improve both physical condition and motivation to engage in physical activity for oneâ€™s health by promoting motivational levers. Its second objective is to reduce and/or prevent the deterioration of the health of university students. Methods Students from University of NÃ®mes were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the two following conditions: an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group participated to an 8-weeks program of PA (co-constructed by users during design-based innovative workshops) whereas the control group did not. For each group, measures of PA, sedentary time, anthropometric data, sleep, physical condition and psychological variables (anxiety, depression, motivation, body appreciation, perceived control, well-being, â€¦) were carried out before (T1: october 2021) and after (T2: December 2021) these 8-weeks in order to evaluate the benefits from the PA program.

"Depressive Symptoms of Centenarians during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Results of an Exploratory Study in Switzerland","Introduction Depression is one of the most frequent mental health problems in older populations.1 To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of depressive symptomatology (DS) among centenarians in Switzerland is unknown. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may have had a negative impact. As part of the study SWISS1002, we intend to provide key information on centenariansâ€™ levels of DS. Objectives To describe the DS of Switzerlandâ€™s centenarians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Randomly selected centenarians from across Switzerland and their proxy relatives were invited to participate. Data are collected via telephone. The questionnaire includes the assessment of DS via the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)â€“ 5 items.3 Preliminary data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results Telephone interviews were completed with 51 centenarians, and for 19 of them, proxy relatives also answered. The MAge of the centenarians was 101.41 (1.47) years, 34 (66.67%) were female and 27 (52.94%) lived at home. The mean score of the GDSâ€“5 was 1.32 (SD=1.49). Considering a cut-off =2, 18 (36%) centenarians were screened positive for possible depression. Descriptive statistics indicated effects of gender (men: M=1.41, SD=1.46;women: M=1.27, SD=1.53) and living situation (private: M=1.07, SD=1.36;institution: M=1.61, SD=1.62). Centenariansâ€™ and proxy reports were significantly related (<U+03C1>=0.56;p&lt;.05). Conclusions Clinically relevant DS are highly prevalent among centenarians during the COVID-19 pandemic (36%), which is consistent with a recent study4 reporting a prevalence of 32% in a sample of younger older adults (MAge: 77.6, SD=6.9). To conclude, DS in centenarians should be screened systematically, especially in this time of unprecedented health crisis.

"Mental health of israeli employees with autism spectrum disorders following COVID-19-related changes in employment status","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic caused employment related challenges worldwide. Adults diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are especially vulnerable, due to pre-existing employment challenges, intolerance to changes and uncertainty and high levels of related anxiety. Objectives To examine COVID-19 related changes in work experiences and mental health of employees with ASD who held a steady job before the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Data were collected from 23 participants diagnosed with ASD (4 females), aged 20â€“49, who answered an online administered survey at two timepoints: prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and during the outbreak. Self-reports included measures of background and employment status;mental health (General Health Questionnaire-12);job satisfaction (Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire);and satisfaction of psychological needs at work (Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration â€“ Work domain). Results Participants who continued to physically attend work maintained pre-COVID-19 levels on all assessed variables. Participants who transitioned to remote work from home preserved their salary levels and job satisfaction, but showed a marginally significant deterioration in mental health and a significant decrease in the satisfaction of their needs for competence and autonomy at work. Unemployed participants showed a significant decrease in mental health. Conclusions Results highlight employment as a protective factor from the potential negative implications of COVID-19 on mental-health of employees with ASD. Employees who transition to working from home require personalized work-support plans due to the possible negative effects of this transition on mental health. Maintaining the routine of physically reporting to work should be preferred, when possible.","Goldfarb, Y.; Gal, E.; Golan, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+of+israeli+employees+with+autism+spectrum+disorders+following+COVID-19-related+changes+in+employment+status","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S268-S268, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40633,""
"Emergency Psychiatry before and during COVID-19 pandemia","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact worldwide. Consultations in the Emergency Service of the Hospital ClÃ­nic of Barcelona varied in terms of reasons for consultations, psychopathology, and other aspects, before and after the pandemic. Objectives To examine changes in the profile of patients admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to our Psychiatric Emergency Service. Methods All children, adolescent and adult psychiatric inpatients admitted from December 4th 2019 to March 31st 2021 to the Psychiatric Emergency Service of Hospital ClÃ­nic of Barcelona, Spain, were retrospectively included for analysis and divided into two groups â€“groups 1 or 2- including the first one all patients who attended before lockdown and the second group those who attended during the pandemic. Results A total of 1991 patients were included -1224 in the first group and 767 in the second group. The majority of patients were male (52.08%), with a mean age of 41.21 years (SD 16.53). A proportion significantly higher of men was found in the second group (p&lt;0.05). The proportion of patients consulting with substance use disorders was significantly higher in the second group (p&lt;0.05).

"Changes in alcohol consumption in the Russian Federation during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Excessive alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for various mental health disorders and can exacerbate the already high burden of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic itself can adversely affect alcohol consumption and thus contribute to alcohol-related problems, including mental health problems. Objectives This study was aimed to assess changes in alcohol consumption that may have occurred as a result of the COVID-19pandemic and determine associated factors among population of Russian Federation. Methods By distributing a link to take part in an anonymous online survey,changes in volume and frequency of alcohol use,and frequency of heavy episodic drinking(6 or more servings of alcohol at a time)in the first months of COVID-19pandemic were assessed. 819respondents from Russia:321 men and 498women, submitted their responses during May-July,2020. Associations between changes in alcohol use were assessed in a univariate analysis with socio-demographic factors,alcohol use over the previous 12months,stress, individual perceptions of changes in daily and social life and other negative consequences of pandemic.The statistical significance of associations was assessed using the Pearsonâ€™s<U+03C7>2 test. Results Individuals with initially higher alcohol consumption increased their alcohol use, while those who drank less, decreased alcohol use even more during pandemic (p&lt;0.05). Severe restrictions of social/everyday life were associated with more frequent alcohol use and in larger volumes (p&lt;0.001). Negative professional/financial consequences of pandemic and stress were associated with increase of typical drinking volume (p&lt;0.001), more frequent alcohol use (p&lt;0.001)and heavy episodic drinking (p&lt;0.05).

"The Pandemicâ€™s Impact on Patients with Bipolar Affective Disorder in a Non-COVID Medical Unit","Introduction Bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness is a mental disorder which consists of abnormal and long-lasting changes in a personâ€™s mood, energy, and ability to function. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions precipitate the condition of those with bipolar affective disorder. Objectives We searched for significant differences before and during the pandemic by analyzing socio-demographic data. Methods We carried out a research activity at the I Psychiatry Clinic of the Clinical Hospital of Neuropsychiatry Craiova. We formed two groups of hospitalized patients during 2019 and during 2020, when the pandemic broke out. The inclusion criterion was the presence of bipolar affective disorder as a primary diagnosis. Results The number of cases and the total number of hospitalization days was higher during the pandemic, 101 cases versus 94 cases, 1667 days versus 1184 days. We identified a predominance of females during the pandemic, whereas in the previous year the distribution by sex was approximately equal. Regarding environment, the number of patients from urban and rural areas was approximately equal in 2019, while during the pandemic those in urban areas predominated, possibly due to easier access to psychiatric services. The ages of patients maintained a Gaussian distribution with a concentration of cases between 35-55 years. Conclusions While other psychiatric disorders were less present in the clinic during the pandemic, the number of bipolar affective disorder cases increased. Bipolar affective disorder is a major challenge due to the wide range of symptoms which cross with comorbidities that increase the likelihood of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"â€œI have brain fogâ€¦â€ About cognitive impairment after COVID-19","Introduction Much has been learned about SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism of short or long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms remains unclear. several hypotheses, including lack of oxygen caused by lung damage, inflammation affecting brain cells, or Lack of blood flow caused by swelling of the small blood vessels in the brain, have been advanced to explain these symptoms. Objectives Herein, we presented a case of cognitive impairment diagnosed after infection with COVID 19. Methods We discussed, through a clinical case, the possible mechanisms and risk factors of cognitive impairment following COVID 19 infection. Results This case concerned a 28 â€“year-old patient. He had no personal or family psychiatric. In August 2021, he presented a SARS-CoV-2 infection without hypoxemia or respiratory failure. On day 10 the patient recovered. Two days after, he consulted our psychiatric department as he experienced impairment in memory. He had impairment in attention and executive function, and in particular verbal fluency. He said that his thinking was sluggish, fuzzy, and not sharp. He denied any alcohol or drug abuse. He was euthymic and he had no depressive symptoms. Arterial blood gas, laboratory, and clinical findings were normal. A brain CT scan with contrast was performed and did not show any abnormality.

"Investigation of prospective effects of emotion-regulation difficulties and empathic dimensions on depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in poland","Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic people experience higher levels of negative emotions, as well as face many negative and intense emotions felt by others. Thus, it is important to look for risk and protective factors that allow and help individuals to regulate these negative emotions and adapt to the hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives The main aims of the study were to (i) test how empathic dimensions (perspective taking, empathic concern and personal distress) and emotion regulation abilities were related to intensity of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland, as well as to (ii) check if emotion regulation difficulties and personal distress predicted slower decrease in depressive symptoms over the two months in which the number of COVID-19 cases declined in Poland. Methods A total of 792 participants took part in the three-wave panel study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of gender, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online questionnaires: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, and Brief version of the Empathic Sensitivity. Results Significant positive correlations were found between depressive symptoms and both personal distress and emotion regulation difficulties during the lockdown. Moreover, emotion regulation difficulties were the only significant predictor of slower decrease in depressive symptoms over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions It seems that interventions focused on improvement of emotion regulation abilities could be particularly beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms during the pandemic and preventing potential negative long-term outcomes.","Gambin, M.; Wozniak-Prus, M.; Sekowski, M.; Holas, P.; Wnuk, A.; Oleksy, T.; Cudo, A.; Hansen, K.; Huflejt-Lukasik, M.; Lys, A.; Gorgol, J.; Kubicka, K.; Kmita, G.; Lojek, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Investigation+of+prospective+effects+of+emotion-regulation+difficulties+and+empathic+dimensions+on+depressive+symptoms+during+the+COVID-19+outbreak+in+poland","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S255-S255, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40639,""
"COVID-19 treatment corticosteroids-induced mania","Introduction Psychiatric disturbances induced by substances are registered in both CIE-10 and DSM-5. It is also well known, since many years, the association between mania and corticosteroids (more than 200 results in PubMed found), recently widely used during the last pandemic against COVID-19. Objectives To remember and to point out the association of substance-induced mental disorders, warning about the experimentation in new clinical settings and raising awareness to prevent or treat its possible consequences in mental health. Methods A two cases clinical series with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with high-doses intravenous corticosteroids during more than a week. Two women, after theirs 50s, with no personal or family psychiatric history, developing after finishing the hospital treatment, insomnia, motor and behavioral hyperactivity and dysphoric mood with irritability, but preserving clinical insight. Results At first, these states were assessed by internists and psychologists as reactive stress anxiety and were treated with benzodiazepines and psychotherapy, without success, during more than two weeks. After a psychiatric evaluation, considering the medical history and recent use of corticosteroids, the hipomania diagnosis was pointed out. Antipsychotic treatment (low doses olanzapine chosen) was induced with total remission of symptoms in less than 15 days with restitutio ad integrum. Regarding these cases, an updated bibliographic review on corticosteroid-induced mania and its treatment was carried out. Conclusions With this presentation, the authors would like to highlight, in these times of pandemic, the importance of remembering the influence and relationship of drugs use in major psychiatric syndromes, both in the causal origin and in the treatment.

"Psychiatric admission among migrants: a retrospective study in acute psychiatric ward in Bologna, Italy","Introduction Numerous evidences point out how migrants use health services differently than the natives. Migrants turn more frequently to the ED for psychiatric problems and less to territorial psychiatric services than the native population. Other differences can be found in terms of diagnosis, type of discharge, type of hospitalization. Objectives Our study has the objective of evaluating the incidence of psychiatric hospitalizations of migrant patients compared to natives in a well-defined area of the metropolitan city of Bologna and evaluate the effect of the Covid 19 pandemic on the incidence of psychiatric hospitalizations among migrants and on their clinical characteristics. Methods The study conducted is of an observational and retrospective type on migrant and native patients admitted to the psychiatric unit â€œSPDC-Malpighiâ€ of the DSM-DP of Bologna AUSL between 01/01/2018 and 31/12/2020. Results Migrants were more likely to be admitted via ED and less likely to be referred from a CMHC or from non-psychiatric hospital unit compared with natives. Most migrants were discharged at home while natives more frequently chose to self-discharge. With regard to diagnosis, migrants were more likely to be admitted due to a SSD, while natives were more likely to be diagnosed with a MD or SUD. Conclusions We confirm the presence of differences in access to care, type of discharge and type of diagnosis between migrants and natives.

"Creating a Digital Psychoeducation Programme for bipolar disorder in the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic profoundly affected delivery and accessibility of mental health care services at a time when most needed. The OPTIMA Mood Disorder Service, a specialist bipolar disorder service, adapted group psychoeducation programme for delivery on-line. Objectives We report the feasibility of creating a digital psychoeducation programme. Methods The OPTIMA ten session group psychoeducation programme was converted into a â€˜Digitalâ€™ intervention using video-conferencing. Sessions offered a range of key topics, derived from the initial Barcelona Group Psychoeducation Programme. At the time of writing, OPTIMA had fully completed two 10 session digital courses. Results A total of 12 people (6 in each group) consented to be part of a service evaluation of the digital groups. Just over half of the participants were women (7/12;58.3%) and one identified as being non-binary (8.3);remaining participants were men. Age of participants ranged from 25 years to 65 years (Mean=42.3;SD=13.1). Data showed a high level of engagement (77%) All participants reported some improvement with a mean Bipolar Self-Efficacy scale (BPSES) post-group score of 105.6 (SD=14.8). At group level, this change was not statistically significant (F (1, 15) = 0.71, p=0.41). At an individual level, two out of five showed a reliable change index &gt;1.96. Conclusions Delivering a â€˜digitalâ€™ group psychoeducation programme was possible due to careful planning and programme development.

"Long-term Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alcohol Use Disorder","Introduction Vulnerable groups like patients suffering from alcohol use disorders (AUD) are expected to be particularly affected by the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a prior study (N=127), we found that psychosocial COVID-19 factors and living alone elevated the probability for relapse during the initial stage of the pandemic, whereas long-term effects on mental health have yet to be investigated. Objectives Here we aimed to investigate the risk of PTSD, as well as levels and developments in depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients with AUD. Methods Data was collected from a clinical sample of patients with AUD (N=136) in late 2020 and early 2021. PTSD symptoms due to the pandemic were assessed using an adapted version of the impact of event scale (IES-R). Levels in clinical symptoms were collected on the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21), and changes since the onset of the pandemic were assessed additionally. Results The high-risk PTSD-group showed higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, and reported more severe deteriorations in these symptoms, when compared to the low-risk group. A binary logistic regression model revealed psychological and social aspects of the pandemic to increase the probability for PTSD, whereas sociodemographic and other COVID-19 related factors showed no significant effects. Conclusions About 30% of patients with AUD indicated an elevated risk of PTSD due to the pandemic, as well as deteriorations in levels of depression, anxiety and stress.

"Mental health in medical, dental and pharmacist students: a cross-sectional study","Introduction Health studentâ€™s mental health is considered a public health issue that dramatically increased with COVID 19â€™s pandemic. However, very few studies assessed the prevalence of mental health in medical, pharmacist, and dental students. Objectives Our goal was to assess mental health in health students from the same university one year after pandemicâ€™s beginning and look at for associated factors. Methods An online survey was realized in Paris university which has the 3 specialties (medicine, pharmacy, and dental). We used the Hospitalization Anxiety and Depression scale, Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory (with 2 versions (Student survey and Human Services Survey). We also asked for 12 months of suicidal ideation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and sexual aggression. We did multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify Major Depressive Episode (MDE) associated factors. Results We included 1925 students: 95 dental, 233 pharmacists, 541 medical preclinic, 587 medical clinic and 469 residents. Overall prevalence of 7- days anxiety symptoms, 7- days depressive symptoms, 12-month MDE, 12-month suicidal ideation, humiliation, sexual harassment and sexual aggression were 55%, 23%, 26%, 19%, 19%, 22% and 6% respectively. There were significative differences between groups for anxiety and depressive symptoms and MDE (p&lt;0.001 for all). Associated factors to MDE in multivariable logistic regression were humiliation (OR=1.71, IC95[1.28-2.28]), sexual harassment (OR=1.60, IC95[1.19-2.16]), sexual abuse (OR=1.65, IC95[1.04-2.60])) and moderate (OR=1.49, IC95[1.17-1.90]) or important (OR=2.32, IC95[1.68-3.20]) subjective financial difficulties.

"What can we say about the impact of teleconsultations on preventing psychiatric inpatient treatment during COVID-19 pandemic?","Introduction Telepsychiatry was proved effective and satisfactory in settings like the emergency department and mental health services, but its use is historically restricted. Although there are several studies about telepsychiatry pros and cons, more is needed to know about its effect on patientâ€™s follow-up and its influence on inpatient treatment rates, specifically during COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives The aim is to look for an eventual change on psychiatric inpatient admissions, during COVID-19 pandemic, when psychiatric patients are in follow-up through teleconsultation. Methods We compared the number of hospitalizations for 3 different 6 months periods of time: the 2nd semester of 2019 with no teleconsultations, March-August 2020 only with teleconsultations (except some few 1st consultations) and the 1st semester of 2021 with face-to-face and teleconsultations. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on a 1050 patients sample. Results The statists showed that the type of approach in consultations didnâ€™t lead to statistically significant differences in hospitalizations (F test-statistic = 0.33086, p = 0.718345). Conclusions There is a plethora of advantages about telepsychiatry and it was already shown to be as effective as in-person contact. Some articles show an association of telepsychiatry with a decrease in hospitalization rates, but mostly display similar clinical outcomes. In this study, the authors found that the results follow the latter tendency, although we must consider the COVID-19 pandemic as a possible decompensation and worsening clinical factor.

"SSRIs treatment did not completely restore affective state in patients with the initial clinically confirmed major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder after COVID-19 disease","Introduction The major clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in the brain are associated with its deleterious neurological and mental health actions. Today, there are limited findings concerning the studying of neuropsychiatric action for SARS-Cov-2 in humans after COVID-19 disease. Objectives The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of SSRIs (escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine) for 6 months therapy on the affective profile of man and women with the clinically confirmed Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) cases following COVID-19 disease. Methods . For the assessment of affective profile in man and women (30-55 years) with the initial clinically confirmed MDD or GAD cases after COVID-19 disease, we used the different tests: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and anxiety scale (ShARS Scale). The hormonal and monoamines levels in the serum blood were measured by ELISA tests before and after SSRIs therapy. Results After 6 months of SSRIs therapy, MADRS Scale showed a incomplete disappearance of the depressive/anxiety manifestations in both men and women with the initial clinically confirmed MDD case after COVID-19 (p&lt;0,05). We found that SSRIs were able to reduce depression/anxiety levels only on 20% in man or on 30% in women with the initial MDD case after COVID-19 before treatment. Conclusions SSRIs treatmet alone failed to produce the decrease of depression/anxiety in the patients of both gender with the initial MDD or GAD diagnosis after COVID-19.

"Burnout among pharmacists in Tunisia during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Both public and private sector pharmacists were instrumental in containing this health crisis in Tunisia. The high workload had a considerable impact on their mental health during the outbreak of the Corona Virus. Objectives This study aims to assess burnout and the psychological toll of the pandemic among pharmacists in Tunisia during covid-19. Methods 258 Tunisian pharmacists working in the public and private sector participated in a questionnaire. Burnout was assessed by the Maslach burnout scale. Regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the pandemic on Tunisian pharmacists. Results 80% of the respondents were women. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 62, 60% were married, 57% had at least one child, and 42% had been working for less than five years. The burnout scale revealed 76% burnout among them. Univariate linear regression showed that female gender (p = 0.014 &lt;0.05) was associated with the development of burnout.

"Developing A Smartphone-Based Application for the Behavioral Cognitive Therapy of Panic Disorder","Introduction Even though cognitive behavior therapy is proven to be an effective treatment for panic disorder, the scarcity of psychiatrists cause many patients not to get a sufficient therapy. E-mental health applications are being developed to address this shortage, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, none of the e-mental health applications developed so far has offered a structured cognitive behavioral therapy. Objectives We are developing a mobile application which will integrate with psychiatric interventions that aims to make cognitive behavioral therapy more accessible. Methods Our algorithm consists of multiple choice questions and answers to determine the progression of the algorithm. The first three sessions consist of psycho-education of the application and the cognitive therapy model of panic mostly. During the psycho-education sessions, patientsâ€™ symptoms during panic attacks and their catastrophic thoughts will be questioned to be used in following sessions. After the panic log has been introduced in the third session, patients will enter the details of their panic attacks right after they experience it and this information will be investigated in the following sessions. Progress for the cognitive restructuring will be monitored as the sessions proceed. Later session will also include in-session symptom induction exercises. Results We are still on the development phase of the mobile application. Hence we do not have any data to present at the moment.

"The level of depressive, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive psychopathological dimensions in symptomatic versus asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women","Introduction The neurotropic valence of SARS-CoV-2 has been revealed in several studies. Depressive and anxiety symptoms are more frequent in the perinatal period leading to maternal and neonatal negative outcomes. Accordingly, depressive and anxiety symptoms are more frequent in the perinatal period leading to negative consequences in both mothers and their neonates. Objectives To determine the level of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms depending on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection of pregnant women. Methods Based on the RT-PCR test, thirty-eight pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized in Bega Clinic in Timisoara, were assessed concerning the presence of psychopathology. The severity of infection was dichotomized based on the presence or absence of the symptoms. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory were administered to all participants. Results Of 38 recruited pregnant women, 12 (31,5%) had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women had a higher average score of depression (p = 0.001) and state and trait anxiety (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) compared to their asymptomatic counterparts. There were no differences in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &gt; 0.05) in relation to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly interferes with the psychological status, thus jeopardizing the mental health of pregnant women.

"Post-traumatic stress symptoms and professional quality of life among healthcare professionals working in COVID departments","Introduction The COVID pandemic had a heavy impact on the mental health of people in general and healthcare professionals in particular. Objectives Our study aimed to examine the the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among healthcare professionals working in COVID departments, and assess their professional quality of life. Methods Our sample consisted of 23 healthcare professionals who are working in the COVID departments of the Hospitals of Sfax. We collected their sociodemographic data, their medical history and COVID-related details. Their mental health was assessed by the Impact of Event scale (IES-R) and the professional quality of life scale (ProQOL-5) Results The sex ratio in our study was 17:6, with a mean age of 31.79 years. They carried out 5.43 nightshifts per month, 57 hours of work per week including 27.38 hours of direct contact with COVID positive patients. A rate of 21.74% of the patients had a high IES-R score, indicating severe post traumatic stress symptoms. As for the subscales of the professional quality of life score, 21.73% of the participants had a low compassion satisfaction score, 65.21% of the participants had a moderate one and 13% had a high one. A rate of 91.3% of the participants had a moderate burnout score, the mean was 29.39.

"The impact of the COVID pandemic on the attitude and mental health of healthcare professionals working in COVID departments","Introduction The COVID pandemic brought an overwhelming impact on hospital systems and personnel in the world. Objectives Our study aimed to examine the impact of the COVID pandemic on the attitude and mental health of healthcare professionals working in COVID departments. Methods We included 23 healthcare professionals working in the COVID departments of the Hospitals of Sfax. Sociodemographic data, medical history and COVID related details were collected from the participants. Their mental health was assessed by the Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Results In our sample, 26.1% were men and 73.9% were women, they were aged from 26 to 52. They worked for 57 hours per week, including 27.38 hours of direct contact with COVID positive patients and 5.43 nightshifts per month. A rate of 52.2% of the participants claimed having enough protection tools and 13% confirmed having enough equipment for patient management. 30.4% feared the lack of equipment and 39.1% considered themselves trained enough to manage COVID patients. As for the protective measures, 95.7% reduced contact with family members, 30.4% stopped visiting their parents, 8.7% left the family house and 4.3% didnâ€™t take any particular measure. The mean HADS depression score was 9.61, and 60.86% had a Depression score equal or greater than 8, indicating depression. As for the HADS Anxiety score, its mean was 10.61 and 69.56% had a score equal or greater than 8, indicating anxiety.

"Alternatives to emergency departments for mental health crisis - a system wide approach can lead to better patient outcomes","Introduction In Camden and Islington (North Central London) we have restructured our emergency mental health services significantly. Prior to January 2020 all emergency mental health presentations, including those detained in public by the police (S136) were supported through our three emergency departments and their respective liaison mental health teams. In January 2020 a new â€˜Health Based Place of Safetyâ€™ (for those detained by police) was opened to avoid people spending time in emergency departments unnecessarily. When the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold in the UK in March 2020 a second unit, a â€˜Mental Health Crisis Assessment Serviceâ€™ (MHCAS) was set up again away from the acute sites, encouraging people in MH crisis to attend a designated MH ED away from the acute sites. This study aims to review the system and patient outcomes since the development of the pathway. Objectives Relieving pressures on ED by reduction in patient numbers that could be better supported elsewhere and free up resource for alternative assessments and patient needs. Methods A retrospective cohort study to review the outcomes of the new system in relation to emergency mental health crisis presentations. Comparison to be made with ED data for 2 years prior to new system. Results Pending final results but initial data suggests 25% reduction in ED presentation for MH cause with new system. Reduction in psychiatric inpatient admissions of between 3-5%.

"The impact of Covid-19 on the Mental Health of the Portuguese Population","Introduction Covid-19 does not only have repercussions on the physical level, representing a new way of life, both individually and in society. The pandemic results in invisible consequences for the populationâ€™s mental health. Objectives This study aimed to explore the consequences of Covid-19 on mental health in Portugal with a view to understanding and promoting the well-being and happiness of the Portuguese. Methods The study included 111 young people and adults, aged between 18 and 58 years (M= 21.81, SD= 5.34), with 43.7% males and 52.7% females. A sociodemographic questionnaire was applied to all participants, as well as the Ã‰chelle de Mesure des Manifestations du Bien-ÃŠtre Psychologique (ÃˆMMBEP;MassÃ© et al., 1998 - Portuguese translation by Monteiro, Tavares & Pereira, 2012) which translates into a response scale 5-point Likert type, with five subscales, including happiness. In addition, a semistructured interview with data collection instruments was administered. Results The results obtained demonstrate the negative impact of Covid-19 on the level of well-being, regardless of the participantâ€™s gender or age. Conclusions The data presented point to the need to sensitize individuals to the risk of the pandemic in terms of mental health, thus increasing societyâ€™s awareness of the psychological effects of this new global disease.

"Increase in the Use of Alcohol and Other Substances in Adolescents During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restriction measures have a great impact on patterns of substance use throughout the general population. Interestingly, in contrast to initial expectations on an overall negative impact, data of large surveys show a differentiated picture of impact. A recent systematic review (Roberts et al., 221) showed mixed tendencies towards increased alcohol consumption, contrasting with a clear trend towards the use of other psychoactive (illicit drugs and prescription drugs) substances. patterns of use before COVID-19 (e.g. habit of drinking at home) and availability (illicit drug traffic changes) are among the significant factors. In addition, mental health factors (depression, anxiety) and social isolation are common correlates with substance use. These factors may be of specific importance impacting substance use in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exemplary is an increase in the use of sleeping medication among Belgian adolescents and young adults. In the current presentation data of national (Belgium) surveys on substance use in adolescents will be presented and discussed within the context of findings in international surveys.

"How to deal with Substance Abuse in a Telepsychiatric Setting","Body Alcohol and (illicit) substance abuse are among the most common psychiatric disorders within the general population and their impact can not be underestimated. Reputedly for these disorders, there is a large treatment gap and treatment delay, i.e. large numbers of afflicted individuals never receive appropriate treatment and if they do so often many years after the onset of the disorder. The Covid19 pandemic has only aggravated these gaps. In many countries, due to the Covid 19 pandemic and its associated restriction measures telepsychiatric tools have become increasingly implemented (and funded) as regular parts in the possibilities in delivering interventions. With respect to substance abuse treatment, a vast body of research already showed promises both in the field of telepsychiatry as broader the use of digitalization (e.g. the use of virtual reality designed treatment interventions, digital monitoring).

"Experience in the Child/Youth Mental Health Centre of LeganÃ©s (Madrid) during the first lockdown","Introduction The municipality of LeganÃ©s has been very vulnerable to the effects of the crisis derived from the COVID-19 pandemic (both due to the incidence of the infection and the socioeconomic situation). Multiple studies show that children and adolescents, especially those with a psychiatric background, have been one of the most affected groups during the confinement. Objectives Firstly, to describe the characteristics of clinical care at the Child/Youth Mental Health Centre of LeganÃ©s (Madrid) during the first lockdown (March-June 2020). Secondly, to present data on the clinical evolution of the patients along this period (n = 720). Methods Descriptive study and literature review. Results Clinical care during the period of strict confinement was mainly by telephone, although the most serious cases were attended in person. In addition, referral to Intensive outpatient programs was interrupted. The results show 56% of patients remained stable. Anxious symptoms (35%) and behavioural disturbances (24%) were most frequently referred (Figure 1), It is noteworthy that the most critical cases (such as suicide attempts or domestic violence) were observed in adolescents and that at least 11% of patients increased their use of electronic devices. Conclusions The first confinement stage was particularly stressful for families and especially for children and adolescents, although most patients remained psychopathologically stable. However, other studies have found a significant increase in child and adolescent mental health problems during the following months (de-escalation stage).

"Young and lonely? Results from the COMET study","Introduction The sudden changes in daily routine due to the containment measures adopted for facing the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on the mental health of the general population. In particular, young adults are exposed to a higher risk compared to the general population to suffer from the consequences of the pandemic, in terms of anger and irritability, depressive symptoms and somatic complaints, insomnia, lack of motivation and loneliness. In particular, loneliness can be particularly pronounced during young adulthood. Objectives This study aimed to describe the levels of loneliness in a sample of Italian young people during the national lockdown in 2020, evaluating clinical and socio-demographic differences and the role of coping strategies and levels of resilience. Methods A sub-analysis of a sample of adults aged 18-34 years has been drawn on a larger cross-sectional observational national trial (COMET, 2020) in which, among other psychopathological dimensions, the levels of loneliness have been assessed by the UCLA scale short version. Results Levels of loneliness were particularly severe in a third of cases (risk factors: unemployment, low income and vulnerability in mental health), in association with depression, anxiety, stress, OCD symptoms, higher rates of suicidal ideation, sleep disturbance and excessive use of Internet. Levels of loneliness tended to increase over time. Conclusions Overall, during the Italian COVID-19 lockdown young people have experienced quite high levels of loneliness: this dimension could represent a useful domain to assess in routine clinical practice.

"Binge eating disorders in the age of coronavirus outbreak","Introduction Lockdown imposed by the Tunisian government had a psychological impact such as depression, stress and anxiety, which triggered the development of eating disorders especially binge eating disorder. Objectives To screen the binge eating disorder among general population in Gabes (south of Tunisia) and to identify factors associated with it. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical web-based survey, from April 19, 2020, to May 5, 2020 on Facebook on citizens living in south of Tunisia. During this period, the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 900 in Tunisia. We used a self-administered anonymous questionnaire containing citizenâ€™s sociodemographic and clinical data. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria were used to assess Binge-Eating Disorder. Results A total of 331 persons were included. They were females (65%) and singles (43,2%). 71% of our population were aged between 20 and 40 years old. Among citizens of southern Tunisia, 6,9% suffered from binge eating disorder during this period of the lockdown. Binge eating disorders were associated to past psychiatric history (2,1% vs 4,53%, p&lt;10-3), history of eating disorder (4,5% vs 2,4%, p&lt;10-3), social isolation (5,1% vs 1,8%, p=0,015) and lack of physical activity (3,3% vs 3,9%, p=0,025).

"Effects of the pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents review and current scientific evidence of the SARS-COV2 pandemic","Introduction The coronavirus crisis has had an impact on the mental health of children and adolescents Objectives Determine how it has affected this population and what mental pathologies are occurring Methods Literature bibliographic review Results School closures and lockdown have been seen to have produced higher levels of anxiety, anger, and sleep and appetite disruption. On the one hand, the children had more anxiety and regressive behaviors, and the adolescents had more isolation, depressive symptoms and even autolytic ideation. The economic crisis and lockdown have affected the family environment, having reported greater situations of domestic violence and substance use among parents. Studies show a prevalence up to 28-34% of post-traumatic stress symptoms among adolescents. In Spain it has been determined that Â¼ children present anxiety and / or depression. Their parents noticed in them greater irritability, less concentration and greater feelings of loneliness There has been an increase in addiction to new technologies. This is partly a method of maintaining social relationships, but prolonged use is associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Regarding to patients with mental pathology, they have presented greater tantrums, especially ADHD and ASD, due to the loss of structure and routine. Conclusions Confinement and fear of COVID have affected mental health of children and adolescents, with anxiety and depression occurring more frequently.

"Hospital readmissions in the group of users on the Flexible Assertive Community Treatment â€“ experiences from RECOVER E Montenegro samples","Introduction As a part of Horizon 2020 program, RECOVER-E project activities were initiated in Montenegro in 2018. The initial step involved a thorough situation analysis of the setting and circumstances of treatment of users with severe mental health illnesses, followed by the establishment of the community mental health team (CMHT) within the Special Psychiatric Hospital Kotor. The CMHT became responsible for the treatment of a group of clients with severe mental health illnesses, based on the principles of â€žFlexible Assertive Community Treatment (FACT â€“ A Dutch model). Objectives The main objective of this research was to establish whether there were substantial differences regarding the hospital readmissions in the group of patients treated by the CMHT, compared to usual mental health care in Montenegro. Methods Within the RECOVER-E project, a sample of 202 patients, users of mental health services, were recruited in Montenegro. Patients were randomized into two similar-sized groups - intervention group, whose treatment was managed by the multidisciplinary CMHT, and control group where treatment as usual was continued. To estimate and follow-up the frequency of hospital readmissions, medical documentation was used. Results Patients in the intervention group had less hospital days during the 18 months follow-up period. However, the differences between two groups regarding number of readmissions, and total length of hospital days were not statistically significant measured by independent T test.

"Belief in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and a tendency to conspiracy thinking as factors that may exacerbate symptoms of anxiety and depression among Polish citizens","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become the subject of intense discussion on social media platforms. Fake news and conspiracy theories about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particular its origin, spread, impact on health and prevention, have become especially popular. The social crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a growing tendency to believe in conspiracy theories, which in turn may contribute to an increase in anxiety tension and thus deteriorate the psychological health of citizens. Objectives The aim of the study was to determine the relationships between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic and the severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression among the surveyed Polish citizens. Methods The study included 700 Polish people aged 24.7Â±6.34 years. We used questionnaires such as: COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale to measure the level of belief in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale to measure tendencies to believe in conspiracy theories, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results Belief in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with a slight increase in the severity of both anxiety symptoms (b=0.044;p=0.021) and depression (b=0.048;p=0.004).

"IPA and WPA-SOAP Strategies to Promote the Human Rights in Mental Health Care of Older Adults","The number of persons with 60 years and more worldwide is estimated to triple by 2050. With the raising burden of the mental health conditions that accompany population ageing, mental health care for older adults has to be under pined by a dignity and human rights based approach. The extraordinary number of human rights violations of the older population during the COVID-19 pandemic has come to the forefront, as consequence of this population vulnerability, the lack of political will to give prior attention to this group needs and the disseminated ageistic attitudes. Discrimination based on age can lead to catastrophic social consequences such as elder abuse, neglect and all forms of violences. Their access to services become reduced, including health, social and justice services. These negative attitutdes, more than only morally unacceptable, are source of unnecessary suffering and increase morbidity and mortality rate. Intersecting across psychiatric diagnoses and interventions are the principles of dignity, autonomy, respect and equality which are all at the base of the call for an United Nations Convention of Rights of the Older People. Keeping all thes points in mind, the World Pschiatric Association Section of Old Age Psychiatry and the International Psychogeriatric Association are working together to promote the Human Rights of Older Adults. The presentation of a webinar, the publication of joint position statements, the organization of symposia in several international congress and the publication of a recent special issue of the America Jornal of Geriatric Psychiatry (October 2021 - https://www.ajgponline.org/issue/S1064-7481(21)X0010-3) are some examples of this common effort.

"Factors associated with suicidal ideation in the French nationwide EPICOV study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic seems associated with a worsening in mental health issues as well as a widening of pre-existing social and health inequalities. Assessment of its impact on suicidal behavior might therefore be relevant. Objectives To assess factors associated with suicidal ideation in the general population, using data from the French nationwide Epicov study Methods In the nationally representative Epicov study, data on occurrence of suicidal ideation from November 2019 to November 2020 were available, including timing with respect to Franceâ€™s lockdown periods. We studied the incidence of suicidal ideation among participants without a prior history of suicidal behavior, after May 11, 2020, when first COVID-19 related lockdown was suspended. Studied factors assessed sociodemographic and health status, including mental health, as well as COVID-19 related information such as symptom. Associations between selected factors and suicidal ideation were assessed in sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models. Results In the Epicov study, prevalence of suicidal ideation was of 2,9%, as opposed to around 4% pre-pandemic. Among 48 702 female and 41 016 male participants, health or financial issues were associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation. Interestingly, Covid19-like symptoms were also associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation. While an impaired mental health has been observed in survivors of past pandemics, given the unprecedented context of the current pandemic, this association needs further investigation. Conclusions While the COVID-19 pandemic might have lowered suicidal ideation, itâ€™s aftermaths may reverse the trend. To prevent this rise, identification of vulnerable groups is crucial to promote tailored public health strategies.

"DEVELOPMENT OF PAPER-BASED MICROFLUIDIC ANALYTICAL DEVICE (ÂµPAD) FOR DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2","Paper-based biosensors are highly preferred today as a self-operating microfluidic biosensor as a new generation biosensor due to its portability, low cost and simple fabrication. Biosensors known as paper-based microfluidic analytical devices (ÂµPAD), which have been used in a wide range of point-of-care analysis (Point-Of-Care-POC) applications in recent years, have begun to replace traditional diagnostic devices, especially in biomedical applications. Today, there are many different methods for the production of ÂµPADs such as photolithography, inkjet printing, wax printing, paper cutting, plotting and plasma treatment. As an alternative to all these production methods, a new fabrication method has been developed for paper-based microfluidic devices created with toner using a laser printer. Washburn test was performed to examine the capillary flow performance of hydrophilic channels created on paper with the help of toner. In addition, the wettability of hydrophobic barriers created with toner was determined by measuring the water contact angle. In order to test the success of the created system, the detection of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been tested on the system. Since the fabrication of the developed system is made with the toner used in laser printers, it is one of the lowest cost and most accessible methods performed until now, and it has a commercial product potential that can be used in the diagnosis of many diseases.","Das, Ruken, Ates, Sezen Canim","https://www.google.com/search?q=DEVELOPMENT+OF+PAPER-BASED+MICROFLUIDIC+ANALYTICAL+DEVICE+(ÂµPAD)+FOR+DETECTION+OF+SARS-COV-2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Fresenius Environmental Bulletin; 31(9):9839, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40669,""
"Prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of psychological health problems in inhabitants of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship during the COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction Psychological health problems, especially emotional disorders, have become an important topic of considerations for many scientists, because the epidemiology of these disorders is strongly influenced by stressful events, such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate selected parameters of psychosocial functioning as well as socio-demographic correlates of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and perceived stress among the residents of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Methods An online questionnaire was completed by 323 participants, in whom the parameters of psychosocial functioning were assessed: symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), severity of sleep disorders (AIS) and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Results The majority of the respondents (75.2%) scored high on the Perceived Stress Scale, almost half of the respondents (47.1%) had sleep disorders and 26% of the participants had no depressive symptoms. Age statistically significantly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. Parental status statistically significantly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms. There was a strong correlation between the severity of depression and anxiety and a strong correlation between depression and sleep disorders. Conclusions Age and parental status contributed to the severity of depressive symptoms and the occurrence of sleep disorders among the residents of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Some of the residents of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship showed high levels of stress or insomnia.

"How to Manage Suicidal Risk at Digital Distance","Suicide prevention remains very difficult to achieve for many reasons, notably because we do not have any indicator of risk prediction, short-term risk factors being little explored, and evaluations being retrospective they are biased. Furthermore, patients at risk are not followed up, because of their lack of confidence in care, stigma, shame. On the other hand, the gap observed during the covid19 pandemic between distress and less occurrence of suicides could be linked to more virtual contacts. Then, the smartphone might be a good tool to stay connected to a protective network. We will discuss the opportunity offered by the smartphone to monitor patients with ecological momentary assessment, allowing to better characterize their acute states and detect an increased risk in real time, and thanks to the ecological momentary intervention 24/7 availability, improve access to care and better coordinate resources, and encourage self-care.

"Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in chronically ill children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: Preliminary findings of a pediatric hospital in Italy","Introduction Psychological problems are common among the pediatric population suffering from a chronic illness, especially compared to the normal population. Stressful life events, such as social distancing measures implemented to counter the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, can strongly influence their epidemiology. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence rate of depressive and anxiety symptoms among an Italian pediatric population affected by chronic illness and already under a Children Hospital psychological follow-up program during COVID-19 lockdown. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 54 Italian children and adolescents affected by chronic illness (mean age: 15y;range: 8.9-18y) during the COVID-19 epidemic period. We assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) questionnaire during scheduled follow-up checks or teleconsulting. Results Preliminary results showed an elevated prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (51% and 48% respectively) among chronically ill children during the COVID-19 outbreak. When compared with a non-ill pediatric population (Zhou et al. 2020), rates are + 7.3% higher for depression and + 10.6% for anxiety. Conclusions Chronic ill pediatric patients are a vulnerable group and require careful consideration. For this reason, the healthcare system should be able to implement and guarantee adequate mental health support programs and continuity of care. Further research is necessary since the COVID-19 outbreak could be repeated.","Correale, C.; Di Pastena, M.; Tondo, I.; Milo, F.; Santato, F.; Amodeo, G.; Capitello, T.

"Could the Emergency Department Facilitate the Start of a Holistic Follow-Up Pathway for Patients Recovering from COVID-19?","Background: For many patients suffering from COVID-19, Emergency Departments (ED) facilitate the first contact with clinicians. There is a high rate of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep disturbance, which persist months after the acute phase. Aim(s): To investigate if COVID-19 patients discharged from ED have a higher prevalence of mental health symptoms than those admitted. In addition, this study will investigate if discharged ED patients who now require COVID-19 follow-up with the respiratory team had a higher prevalence of mental health symptoms than admitted patients requiring follow-up. Method(s): This was a retrospective cohort study (n= 472) with the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scoring systems to quantify current anxiety and depression symptoms via a telephone consultation. Result(s): The PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were significantly higher for discharged ED patients than the admitted patients. There was a higher proportion of females with a positive PHQ-2 or GAD-2 score. Of the patients requiring respiratory follow-up, discharged ED patients were more likely to have a positive PHQ-2 or GAD-2 score than those admitted. Conclusion(s): Clinicians should maintain a low threshold for referring patients with psychiatric complaints post-COVID alongside respiratory symptoms irrespective of admission. It is imperative that available psychological services, crisis lines and other avenues of support post-COVID-19 are signposted to patients before discharge to facilitate earlier intervention.

"Depression and anxiety consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal cohort study with university students","Introduction For young people, just as in the general population, COVID-19 caused many changes in their lives. The literature review has shown an increased risk for mental illness symptoms as a consequence of the pandemic. Objectives With this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in university studentsâ€™ anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods This study is part of a larger longitudinal research on university studentsâ€™ mental health with the Portuguese version of The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Portuguese version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) data with evaluations on January, May and October 2019 and June 2020, as well as socio-demographic information. Results 341 university students (257 females and 84 males) were included in this study, with a mean age of 19.91 (SD=1.58). In June 2020, the mean for perceived well-being loss was 60.47% (SD=26.56) and 59.54% (SD=28.95) for mental health loss. In the PHQ-9, the proportion of students with scores equal or above 15 ranged between 22.6% and 25.5% in 2019, however, in June 2020, the proportion was significantly higher (37.0%). The proportion of GAD-7 scores above the cut-off 10 ranged between 46.0% and 47.8% in 2019, and, in 2020, 64.5% of the students scored 10 or above. Compared with preceding trends, PHQ-9 scores were 3.11 (CI=2.40-3.83) higher than expected, and GAD-7 scores were 3.56 (CI=2.75-5.37) higher. Conclusions COVID-19 had a negative impact on depressive and anxiety symptoms in university students, in line with the literature and confirming the vulnerability of young people in such uncertain times.","ConceiÃ§Ã£o, V.; Rothes, I.; GusmÃ£o, R.; Barros, H.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression+and+anxiety+consequences+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+A+longitudinal+cohort+study+with+university+students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S257-S257, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40674,""

Objective: To explore the worst experiences associated with peritraumatic distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Adult residents (N = 1098), from the US (n = 741) and Italy (n = 357), completed an online survey including socio-demographic data, COVID-19-related experiences, the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory and an open question on their worst experiences during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic (Aprilâ€“May 2020). A thematic content analysis (TCA) was conducted on the answers to the open question and a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the themes that best predicted the clinical levels of peritraumatic distress. Results: The main TCA themes related to participantsâ€™ worst COVID-19 experiences were anxiety, threat, loss, anger, stress and constriction. Threat was the most prevalent theme and correlated with experiences such as being quarantined, being infected and a loved one receiving the diagnosis. US participantsâ€™ descriptions of their worst experiences related more to life-threat and loss, while Italians reported more threat to the world, stress, social isolation, and feeling trapped. In the CART analysis, the main predictor (79.9%) was perceiving negative effects from the COVID-19 crisis. Among them, a COVID-related threat to self-experience was the most robust predictor. In its absence, being deprived of resources or experiencing high levels of anxiety were other robust predictors. Conclusions: The study provided evidence of the utility of a mixed-method approach in conceptualizing experiences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of traumatic symptoms. Its findings may inform healthcare interventions and policies for tackling the new challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. HIGHLIGHTS Clinically significant levels of peritraumatic distress symptoms were prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinically significant levels of peritraumatic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic were related to experiences of life-threat, resource deprivation, and anxiety, cross-cutting the themes articulated by the thematic content analysis of anxiety, threat, loss, anger, stress and constriction. The US and Italian participantsâ€™ descriptions of their worst experiences differed in subtle but important ways, with Americans reporting more life-threat and losses compared to Italians reporting more threat to the world, stress, social isolation, and feelings of being trapped.","Cipolletta, Sabrina, Tomaino, Silvia Caterina Maria, Rivest-Beauregard, Marjolaine, Sapkota, Ram P.; Brunet, Alain, Winter, David","https://www.google.com/search?q=Narratives+of+the+worst+experiences+associated+with+peritraumatic+distress+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+a+mixed+method+study+in+the+USA+and+Italy+Relatos+de+las+peores+experiencias+asociadas+al+distres+peritraumÃ¡tico+durante+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19:+Un+estudio+de+mÃ©todo+mixto+en+Estados+Unidos+e+Italia+COVID-19+<U+75AB><U+60C5><U+671F><U+95F4><U+521B><U+4F24><U+540E><U+7CBE><U+795E><U+75DB><U+82E6><U+76F8><U+5173><U+6700><U+7CDF><U+7CD5><U+7ECF><U+5386><U+7684><U+53D9><U+8FF0>:<U+4E00><U+9879><U+7F8E><U+56FD><U+548C><U+610F><U+5927><U+5229><U+7684><U+6DF7><U+5408><U+65B9><U+6CD5><U+7814><U+7A76>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of psychotraumatology; 13(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40676,""
"How can resilience moderate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health?","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new form of trauma, which is impacting on the mental health of the general population. However, the effects of this new trauma are variable, being mediated by individual factors such as the levels of resilience and the coping strategies. Objectives The aims of the present study are: 1) describe the levels of resilience and the type of coping strategies adopted by the Italian general adult population during the first wave of the pandemic;2) evaluate the protective role of coping strategies and resilience on the levels of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms. Methods An online survey has been developed, which includes several validated self-reported questionnaires for the evaluation of participantsâ€™ mental health condition, coping strategies and levels of resilience. The main outcome measure is the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results The finale sample consists of 20,720 participants, more than half reported low levels of resilience, which were not associated with age or gender. The levels of resilience did not differ among the general population, patients with pre-existing mental disorders and those infected by COVID-19. People with low levels of resilience rarely used adaptive coping strategies. The levels of resilience did not have any influence on stress, depressive or anxiety symptoms. Conclusions The presence of low levels of resilience in the general population may be the missing link between the pandemic and increasing concerns on mental health problems. This could be important for the development of ad-hoc supportive and preventive psychosocial interventions.

"The mental health impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on hong kong youth: Preliminary results from the hong kong youth mental health epidemiological study (HKYES)","Introduction The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health crisis that originated in China. As an adjacent city to the origin of COVID-19, Hong Kong has been facing different public health challenges raised by the epidemic. Objectives This paper examined the prevalence of common physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, somatic symptoms, and health anxiety among the Hong Kong youth population. Methods HKYES is an on-going territory-wide epidemiological study collecting youth mental health data with randomly stratified sampling. Participants aged 15-24 years were to complete a physical symptom checklist, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Results A total of 594 participants have completed the survey since April 2020. The three most common physical symptoms were headache (n=106, 17.8%), fever (n=94, 15.8%) and fatigue (n=78, 13.1%). The mean scores of DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscales were 7.98 (SD 8.14), 5.81 (SD 6.32), and 8.83 (SD 7.93) respectively. Among all, 135 (22.8%) participants reported moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms, 133 (22.4%) reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms, and 71 (12%) reported moderate to severe levels of stress. There were 40 (6.7%) and 60 (10.1%) participants showing significant levels of insomnia and somatic symptoms, while around one-third of the participants reported a high level of health anxiety.

"Delirium and health-related quality of life in severe COVID-19 survivors","Introduction Severe COVID-19 survivors experience long-term neuropsychiatric morbidity, particularly those who developed delirium, with a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Objectives To identify the cases of delirium in severe COVID-19 patients and to describe its association with post-hospital discharge HRQoL. Methods In the context of the longitudinal MAPA project, we included adult patients (= 18 years old) admitted with COVID-19 to the Intensive Care Medicine Department (ICMD) of a Portuguese University Hospital (October 2020-April 2021). Exclusion criteria were: ICMD length of stay =24h, terminal illness, major auditory loss, or inability to communicate at the time of assessment. Delirium during ICMD stay was ascertained based on patientsâ€™ clinical records. HRQoL was evaluated using the 5-Level EQ-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), at a scheduled telephone follow-up appointment on average 1-2 months after hospital discharge. Results Overall, 124 patients were included with a median age of 62 (range: 24-86) years, being mostly male (65%). About 19% had delirium, 42% were deeply sedated and 43% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Most survivors reported problems on the EQ-5D-5L domains: usual activities (85%), mobility (73%) and anxiety/depression (65%). Patients with delirium reported more pain/discomfort (75%vs46%;p=0.011) and considerably anxiety/depression (83%vs60%;p=0.032). Conclusions These findings pointed that COVID-19 patients who experienced delirium reported worse HRQoL, regarding pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. This study highlights the importance of not only prevention but also early screening of delirium during hospital stay, as well as the crucial role of the timely interventions at discharge, in order to minimize delirium long-term impacts.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of health care workers in CYPRUS","Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a great impact on health care workers (HCWs) who are exposed to high levels of stress and trauma leading to negative mental health outcomes, including stress-related symptoms and depressive symptoms. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and post traumatic stress symptoms related to to the COVID 19 pandemic in Cyprus. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we report on mental health outcomes among HCWs in Cyprus. Data were collected between May 3rd and May 27th, 2020, using an online questionnaire that included demographics, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), assessing depressive symptoms, the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) measuring PTSD symptoms and the 10 item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measuring stress. Results 424 Health Care Workers (HCWs) participated in the study. 79 HCWs (18,6%) scored in PHQ-9 above the cut-off for depression while 62 HCWs (14,6%) scored high enough in IES-R indicating a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The prevalence of depression and PTSD symptoms were significantly higher among nurses compared to doctors and other HCWs. (20.7% versus 10.8%;adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.06 to 2.73]), after adjustment for age and sex.

"Student mental health during the first two years of the COVID- 19 pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic have had deleterious effects on mental health of students. Authors suggest that the psychological effects will persist long after COVID-19 has peaked, but we have no data to confirm this. Objectives Objective: The objective of this study is to compare clinical issues (concerns, anxiety and depression symptoms) and adjustment (coping strategies) in French university students during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 (during two periods of lockdown and two periods after lockdown) Methods Method: Data were collected anonymously at four timepoints: during Franceâ€™s first national lockdown (23 April- 8 May 2020;nT1 = 1294);during the period after lockdown (9-23 June 2020;nT2 = 321);1 year after the first lockdown, which was also a lockdown period (23 April- 8 May 2021;nT3 = 2357);and 1 year after the first unlockdown, which was also a unlockdown period (9-23 June 2021, nT4 = 1174). The following variables were measured: concerns, coping strategies, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results In 2021, students have significantly higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms than in 2020, and this is even more pronounced during the lockdown periods. For example, 44.1% had probable anxiety symptoms in the 2021 lockdown, compared to 33% in the 2020 lockdown. In the unlockdown periods, the rates are 21.7% in 2020 and 26.4% in 2021.

"Preexisting mild cognitive impairment as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection: A scoping review and case reports","Introduction SARS-Co-V2 neuroinvasive ability might be the basis for the onset of delirium and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Objectives We hypothesized that some infected patients with preexisting cognitive dysfunction may present delirium as unique manifestation of COVID-19 infection or as a prodrome of a new episode consistent with the psychiatric history. Methods We conducted a PubMed literature search to verify whether cognitive impairment might predispose to COVID-19. We included three patients with mild cognitive impairment and delirium at admission for SARS-Co-V2 suspected infection. Delirium was diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteriaâ€š Cognitive Assessment Method and Coma Glasgow Scale. Results Literature analysis evidenced patients presenting delirium or delirium-like symptoms as clinical manifestation of COVID-19, plus a cognitive impairmentâ€š from mild to severeâ€š which preexisted or was evidenced during the acute phase or after the infection. Most studies described delirium in patients with a past neurological/psychiatric history. Contrasting data emerged on the potential link between COVID-19 and delirium in patients with cognitive impairment and without a past neuropsychiatric history. Our patients had no history of other medical complications. Our first patient had no psychiatric historyâ€š the second reported only a depressive episodeâ€š and the third had story of bipolar disorder. Delirium resolved completely after 2 days in the first patient. The other patients required 4 and 14 days to resolve: delirium appeared as the prodrome of a new psychiatric episode in line with their past history. Conclusions Clinicians should acknowledge the possibility that COVID-19 infection may appear as delirium and acute psychiatric sequelae as unique manifestation.

"The impact of maternal SARS-COV-2 infection in early stages of newborn neurodevelopment: preliminary results in a multicenter Spanish study","Introduction The consequences for the COVID-19 pandemic in the newborns of affected mothers remains unknown. Previous clinical experiences with other infections during pregnancy lead to considered pregnant women and their offspring especially vulnerable for SARS-COV-2. That is, the underlying physiopathological changes caused by the infection (e.g. storm of cytokines, micro-coagulation in placenta or vertical transmission) could clearly compromise fetal neurodevelopment. Objectives To analyze the impact of maternal SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy in early neurodevelopment of infants gestated during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to those gestated immediately prior (2017-2021). Methods 212 pregnant women (14% infected) were followed throughout their pregnancy and postpartum, including newborn development. SARS-COV-2 infection was serologically confirmed during pregnancy. The Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale (NBAS) was administered at 6 weeks old by a trained neonatologist to evaluate neurological, social and behavioral aspects of newbornâ€™s functioning. Differences in NBAS scores between cases and controls were tested by ANOVAs. All the analysis were adjusted for maternal age, sociodemographic status, anxious-depressive symptomatology, infantâ€™s sex and gestational age at birth and NBAS, and for the period of gestation (previous or during COVID-19 pandemic). Results NBAS social interactive dimension was significantly decreased in those infants exposed to prenatal SARS-COV-2 (F=4.248, p=.043), particularly when the infection occurred before the week 20 of gestation. Gestation during COVID-19 pandemic did not alter NBAS subscales. Conclusions SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy seems to be associated with lower NBAS scores on social dimension in 6 weeks old exposed newborns.

"Covid 19, gender violence, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder","Introduction In Ecuador, the first case of covid19 was reported on February 29th of 2020, forcing people to remain in lockdown, which increased gender violence;post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Objectives Determine the cases during the lockdown caused by the covid-19 pandemic we found victims of some type of gender-based violence, depression, and PTSD. Methods An observational, cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out based on surveys conducted online, the study was conducted on January 29th of 2021, in the province of Guayas-Ecuador. Performed with â€œgoogle formsâ€ platform, data on affiliation, the situation of intimate partner violence and the Davidson trauma test (PTSD) and the Beck test (depression) were collected. Results A total of 411 samples were obtained, classified according to age, sex, number of children, education, occupation, intimate partner relationship, whether they had suffered gender violence and types of violence. 88 (21.41%) people reported having suffered some type of violence, of which 25 (28.42%) were men and 62 (70.45%) were women. The most common was psychological with 53 (60.23%) people. 82 respondents tested positive to Davidson test for PTSD, equivalent to 20% of the total sample. 51 people (12%) reported suffering from mild depression, 53 (13%) reported suffering from moderate depression and 38 people (9%) reported major depression with Beck test. Conclusions In this study we evidenced that although the interviewers claimed they had never suffered gender violence , it was observed that the results were incongruent, so it is important to highlight that talking about gender violence is still considered a stigma in our society.

Objectives This study aimed to: 1) investigate participantsâ€™ mental health, 2) assess experiences with outpatient services, and 3) assess respondentsâ€™ experiences with governmental measures in the Netherlands during the first and second wave of COVID-19. Methods Respondents (wave 1: n=100;wave 2: n=150) reported on mental health, experiences with outpatient care, government measures and information services in an online survey. Results Findings demonstrate happiness was rated an average of 6 out of 10, 70% of respondents scored below average on resilience, positive consequences for mental health (ordered world, reflection time) during both waves were similar, and prominent negative consequences included decreased social interactions and increased or new problems regarding mental health and daily functioning from wave 1-2. Lifestyle changed in 50% in both waves, although only slightly attributed to the pandemic. Substance use during both waves hardly changed. Mental healthcare continuation was highly appreciated in both waves (75-80% scored =7 on 10-point scale). (Video)calling was the most frequently mentioned positive care experience;missing face-to-face contact with care providers considered most negative.

The impact of the pandemic on the incidence of First Episode of Psychosis (FEP) is not clear. Objectives To describe the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of FEP patients diagnosed since the onset of the COVID19 pandemic and compare them with the equivalent period of the previous year. Methods We included all FEP patients attended at Parc de Salut Mar (Barcelona, Spain) from March 14, 2020 (when the state of emergency in Spain began) to December 31, 2020 with the same period of 2019. We assessed sociodemographic variables, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), cannabis and alcohol use, psychiatric diagnosis, and psychiatric symptom scales. We performed a univariate analysis between the groups using U-Mann Whitney for continuous variables and Chi-Square for qualitative variables. Results A total of 20 FEP patients were diagnosed in each period. No differences were found in sociodemographic variables, scales scores or DUP. During COVID19 period there was a smaller proportion of cannabis users (60% vs 90%;p=0.028) and a tendency of lower weekly consumption (14.44 vs 16.42;p=0.096). There were more cases of BPD (25% vs 5%;p=0.077) and less of affective psychosis (0% vs 25%;0.017).

"Portuguese version of the fear of COVID-19 scale â€“ psychometric study","Introduction More than in other conditions, fear is associated with infectious diseases, and is directly associated with its transmission rate, morbidity and mortality. High levels of fear can affect the individualâ€™s ability to think clearly, react proportionately and make rational decisions in the context of COVID-19. Recently, Mertens et al. (2020) developed the Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to measure this construct. Objectives To analyse the psychometric properties of the FCV-19S Portuguese version, namely construct validity, internal consistency and convergent validity. Methods A community sample of 234 adults (75.6% women;mean age= 29.53Â±12.51;range:16-71) completed an on-line survey with the Portuguese versions of the FCV-19S, the Covid-19 Perceived Risk Scale (CPRS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21).The total sample was randomly divided in two sub-samples: sample A (n=117) was used to perform an exploratory factor analysis/EFA;sample B (n=117) to make a confirmatory factor analysis/CFA. Results EFA resulted in one component. CFA revealed that the unifactorial model presented acceptable fit indexes (X2/df=3.291;CFI=.977;GFI=.932;TLI=.919;p[RMSEA=.01]=.091). Cronbach alpha was a=.855.

Methods 234 adults (75.6% women;mean age=29.53Â±12.51) completed an on-line survey with the Portuguese version of the Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and other questionnaires to evaluate clinical and sociodemographic characteristics (years of education, perceived physical and mental health and infection by Covid-19), Personality (NEO-FFI-20) and Repetitive negative thinking (PTQ-15). SPSS and Process Macro (Hays, 2020) were used. Results FCV-19 mean scores were significantly higher in women and significantly correlated with years of education (r=-.14) (p&lt;.05). History of previous/current Covid-19 infection did not significantly distinguish FCV-19 scores and they did not correlate with perceived health. FCV-19 correlated significantly with neuroticism and PTQ total and dimensional scores (r&gt;.20, p&lt;.01). Both Repetitive thinking and Cognitive interference were mediators of the relationship between neuroticism and fear of COVID, even after controlling for gender and education. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence on individual factors that might be associated to the emotional response to the Covid-19 pandemics, aiming to facilitate public health initiatives to ease peopleâ€™s fears in a near future.","CabaÃ§os, C.; Pereira, A.

"Reduced activity in a liaison psychiatry service during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic: Comparison with 2019 data and characterisation of the SARS-COV-2 positive cohort","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in how healthcare was accessed and delivered. It was suggested that COVID-19 will lead to an increased delirium burden in its acute phase, with variable effect on mental health in the longer term. Despite this, there are limited data on the direct effects of the pandemic on psychiatric care. Objectives 1) describe the mental health presentations of a diverse acute inpatient population, 2) compare findings with the same period in 2019, 3) characterise the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort of patients. Methods We present a descriptive summary of the referrals to a UK psychiatric liaison department during the exponential phase of the pandemic, and compare this to the same period in 2019. Results show a 40.3% reduction in the number of referrals in 2020, with an increase in the proportion of referrals for delirium and psychosis. One third (28%) of referred patients tested positive for COVID-19 during their admission, with 39.7% of these presenting with delirium as a consequence of their COVID-19 illness. Our data indicate decreased clinical activity for our service during the pandemicâ€™s peak. There was a marked increase in delirium, though in no other psychiatric presentations. Conclusions In preparation for further exponential rises in COVID-19 cases, we would expect seamless integration of liaison psychiatry teams in general hospital wards to optimise delirium management in patients with COVID-19. Further consideration should be given to adequate staffing of community and crisis mental health teams to safely manage the potentially increasing number of people reluctant to visit the emergency department.","Butler, M.; Delvi, A.; Mujic, F.; Broad, S.; Pauli, L.; Pollak, T.; Gibbs, S.; Lam, C.

"The impact of Covid-19 on the well-being of young people with conduct disorder and their families","Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly changed family dynamics and parents experience greater psychological distress. Conduct problems in young people have increased by 35%. However, it is not known how Covid-19 associated stresses have affected parenting practice, conduct problems, and comorbidities and what additional support is needed for families at risk. Objectives This study uses self-report measures and semi-structured interviews to examine and explore the impact of Covid-19 on the families of young people with conduct problems and comorbid mental health conditions. Methods This is a sequential mixed-methods study. Eligible families with children aged between 11-18 years have participated. One-hundred-and-eighty-two families have completed eight online questionnaires and 12 have participated in semi-structured follow-up interviews. Results Analyses indicate that parental harshness, warmth, educational background, and employment have a significant impact on Covid-19 exposure and worries, as well as significantly higher scores of conduct disorder symptoms. Interview codes reveal that young peoplesâ€™ behaviour became more severe during the pandemic, and this was associated with reduced in-person support services, reduced personal space at home, and parents taking on the additional role of educator. Conclusions The findings suggest that Covid-19 is a significant risk factor to young people with conduct problems and their families. For example, reduced parental warmth and increased parental harshness increased conduct problems for young people during the lockdown. This study highlights that policies and services should work to better support such families. Future online psychosocial interventions are needed to empower families and improve parenting practice at home during the lockdown period and in general.

"Perception of the COVID-19 pandemic by individuals who previously sought psychiatric assistance","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic leads to high levels of stress. Individuals who have previously sought psychiatric assistance are more sensitive. Objectives Analysis of the perception of the pandemic by people who have previously sought psychiatric care. Methods An internet-survey (20.03.2020 - 13.01.2021) (N=659;152 â€“ previously sought psychiatric assistance);included SCL-90-R;questions about the levels of anxiety, depression, and fear (assessed on 0-10 scale);question about opinion on COVID-19 pandemic (coded further on the basis of meaning);question about epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in respondentsâ€™ places of residence and their social circles. Results Individuals who had previously sought psychiatric assistance demonstrated higher levels of anxiety (5,533Â±2,489 versus 4,774Â±2,590), depression (4,945Â±2,926 versus 3,861Â±2,988), and fear (0,195Â±0,397 versus 0,278Â±0,448). They showed roughly equivalent reactions to both anticipated and real danger (z-score GSI of SCL-90-R 0,90 versus 0,90 for anticipated and real danger respectively), the same indicator of the control group (0,53 and 0,65). In statements about the pandemic, they are more often referred to the topic of â€œpositive effectsâ€ of pandemic (3,30% versus 0,99%), expressed â€œcuriosityâ€ (5,92% versus 2,37%). They were less drawn to conspiracy (9,87% versus 16,17%), and exploited more readily the topic â€œabout myselfâ€ (20,39% versus 13,21%), negative images of â€œthe presentâ€ (3,64% versus <U+0441> 1,58%) and â€œthe futureâ€ (15,79% versus 9, 47%), vocabulary of â€œangerâ€ (5,92% versus 2,17%).

"Stress during the COVID-19 pandemic - impact on neuroplasticity","Introduction The worldâ€™s population has been exposed to traumatic events and high levels of stress due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Stress is known currently as a universal experience, but the concept was first defined in 1936 by Hans Selye. It has been shown that stress is associated with impairments in neuroplasticity (e.g. neuronal atrophy and synaptic loss in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex) and has a crucial role in almost all mental disorders. Objectives In this paper we aim to highlight the recent theoretical and experimental advances in neuroscience regarding stress induced neuroplasticity. Methods We analyzed scientific literature written in English and published between 2019-2021. We used the electronic portal PubMed-NCBI. Results In the last few years, molecular and cellular studies on animal models of stress related and stress-induced psychopathologies revealed alterations in gene expression, micro ARNs expression, as well as in intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the stress induced adaptations. These findings have led to new theories regarding depression and anxiety in the molecular neurobiology field. It has been shown that stress reduces BDNF expression inducing neuronal atrophy in various brain areas. Contrastingly, other studies have demonstrated that chronic antidepressant treatment increases BDNF expression. Furthermore, a crucial role has been assigned to miRNAs in the development of chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior and neuroplasticity. Conclusions We hope that this paper will increase interest in the field of stress induced cellular and molecular changes. More research needs to be pursued in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of stress-induced mental disorders. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Bondar, A.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health during pregnancy: The CONCEPTION study â€“ Phase I","Introduction Mental health regional differences during pregnancy through the COVID-19 pandemic is understudied. Objectives We aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health during pregnancy. Methods A cohort study with a web-based recruitment strategy and electronic data collection was initiated in 06/2020. Although Canadian women, &gt;18 years were primarily targeted, pregnant women worldwide were eligible. The current analysis includes data on women enrolled 06/2020-11/2020. Self-reported data included mental health measures (Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7)), stress. We compared maternal mental health stratifying on country/continents of residence, and identified determinants of mental health using multivariable regression models. Results Of 2,109 pregnant women recruited, 1,932 were from Canada, 48 the United States (US), 73 Europe, 35 Africa, and 21 Asia/Oceania. Mean depressive symptom scores were lower in Canada (EPDS 8.2, SD 5.2) compared to the US (EPDS 10.5, SD 4.8) and Europe (EPDS 10.4, SD 6.5) (p&lt;0.05), regardless of being infected or not. Maternal anxiety, stress, decreased income and access to health care due to the pandemic were increasing maternal depression. The prevalence of severe anxiety was similar across country/continents. Maternal depression, stress, and earlier recruitment during the pandemic (June/July) were associated with increased maternal anxiety. Conclusions In this first international study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, CONCEPTION has shown significant country/continent-specific variations in depressive symptoms during pregnancy, whereas severe anxiety was similar regardless of place of residence.

"Manic episode following SARS-COV-2 Infection","Introduction In December 2019, infection with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in the city of Wuhan, China. Although generally recognized for its often fatal respiratory problems, other neuropsychiatric complications are receiving increasing attention. Objectives We will try through a clinical case to explain the psychiatric disorders in the context of this infection, and to highlight the two main explanatory theories of psychiatric disorders, in relation with the SARS-Cov-2 infection. Methods We report here a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 54-year-old female patient with no specific pathological history, including psychiatric, who presented a fever, anosmia, and asthenia in the absence of any respiratory signs. Her PCR came back positive and her chest CT scan was normal.The patient was treated with paracetamol with vitamin C,with good clinical improvement. She came 15 days later to the psychiatric emergency room with psychomotor excitement. The patient was motorically unstable, could not hold still, her mimicry was hypermobile, contact with her was familiar, she was logorrheic with flight of ideas,she verbalized multiple projects, her mood was euphoric and her sleep was disturbed. Her blood tests were unremarkable.

"Impact of the covid-19 pandemic on Moroccan health workers who were not on the frontline","Introduction Since March2019, successive waves of the COVID-19pandemic have challenged the mental health of frontline healthcare workers, who have been shown in numerous studies to be at increased risk for characterized psychiatric disorders. However, healthcare professionals who were not directly involved in the care of patients withCOVID-19 were often not investigated. In Morocco, the literature dealing with the psychological impact of the pandemic on backline health professionals is still scarce. Objectives The purpose of our survey is to assess the stress, anxiety, and depression of health workers who were not on the front lines of care forCOVID-19 patients. Methods It is a survey developed on googleforms and disseminated via social networks targeting groups of health professionals in Morocco, during June2020. We used the DASS21 scale(depression, anxiety and stress scale with21 items). The results were analyzed using the JAMOVI application. Results out of80 participants: 54%are men, 56%are aged between 31 and 40years old, 38%have been in practice for less than 5years of exercise, 66%are married, 41%are specialists 36%are residents and 21%are nurses, 44% work in psychiatric ward.

"Innovations in the provision of psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation assistance to the population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and their preliminary results","Introduction Numerous publications highlight the need to modify mental health services in the stressful environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. The psychiatric service of the city of Moscow undertook some reforms in this regard. Objectives The measures taken are aimed at reducing the risk of infection of mentally ill patients undergoing treatment in dispensaries and day hospitals, as well as at preventing the exacerbation of psychopathological disorders in patients under the prevailing conditions. Methods The frequency of visits to the dispensary by patients in stable condition has been reduced to 1 time per week. At the same time, the frequency of telephone consultations with patients and their relatives increased up to 3 times a week. Face-to-face psychotherapy sessions have been replaced by remote (online) sessions. During the study period, medical documents of 60 patients were studied. The number of hospitalizations of outpatients to the hospital was recorded due to the deterioration of the mental state, as well as in connection with the infection with COVID in the period from 04/15/2020 to 06/09/2020. Results There were no hospitalizations due to mental deterioration. According to this indicator, the situation in 2020 turned out to be better than last year for the same period.

"The prevalence of psychopathological symptoms in population during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant lifestyle changes for the worldâ€™s population. The infection poses a threat to mental health due to direct invasion of the central nervous system of SARS-CoV-2, as well as as a source of mental stress associated, in particular, with the deformation of the structure of interpersonal communications under quarantine conditions. Objectives The study was conducted to comparatively study the phenomenology and severity of psychopathological manifestations in quarantined and non-quarantined people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From April 18 to June 15, 2020, an online questionnaire â€œSymptom List 90â€ (SCL-90) was conducted among 837 adults in Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and other countries. 426 respondents were in strict home quarantine;302 observed social distancing, but could go to work;109 were not socially isolated. Results There was a significant difference in the overall severity index (GSI) between strictly quarantine and non-quarantine groups with GSI values of 0.51 (0.24;0.99) and 0.33 (0.16;0.75), respectively (p = 0.001). Indicators of anxiety, depression, somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety, hostility and psychoticism were also significantly higher in quarantined individuals than in non-quarantined individuals (p &lt;0.05). Conclusions The results of the analysis indicate that in a pandemic, the most susceptible to psychopathological disorders are those living in the most severe quarantine, while the contingent whose lifestyle changes little under these conditions shows the best indicators of mental health.

"The spectrum and severity of psychopathological symptoms in previously healthy individuals who have had severe COVID-19 pneumonia","Introduction The medical novelty of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive study of its impact on various areas of human health, including mental health. Objectives To study the spectrum and severity of psychopathological disorders in previously healthy patients of different age groups who have had moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods Immediately after stabilization of the physical condition, patients completed the Symptom Checklist-90-R, designed to assess 11 parameters: somatization (SOM), obsessive-compulsive (OS), interpersonal sensitivity (INT), depression (DEP), anxiety (ANX), hostility (HOS), phobic anxiety (PHOB), paranoid ideas (PAR), psychoticism (PSY). Patients with cognitive impairment were excluded. Results The study involved 148 patients aged from 26 to 84 years. In the general sample, psychopathological symptoms were detected mainly on the SOM, DEP, ANX, HOS scales.

"Older adults during the pandemic: Mental health symptoms are predicted by childhood trauma","Introduction It has been broadly anticipated that COVID-19 pandemic-related experiences may constitute traumatic stressors in vulnerable populations, and that older adultsâ€™ might be especially at risk of experiencing mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Objectives The present study aimed to examine older adultsâ€™ psychological distress: posttraumatic stress, Covid-related fears, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and the relationship between present distress, defensive functioning, and childhood trauma. We also explored potential differences between younger-older adults (between 65 and 74 years), and older-older adults (75 years and above). Methods Data was collected in a large-scale online survey during the early months of the pandemic, for the present study, we included participants above 65 years old (N = 1,225). Results showed that age, adverse childhood experiences, and overall defensive functioning were all significantly related to posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Specifically, younger age and more reported childhood adversity were related to higher distress, whereas higher defensive functioning was related to less distress. Covid-related fears were not associated with age. Our final model showed that defensive functioning mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and distress. Conclusions Our results support the relative resilience of older-older adults compared to younger-older adults, as well as the long-lasting impact of childhood adversity through defensive functioning later in life, specifically in times of heightened stress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies are warranted to identify further factors affecting defensive functioning as adults age, as well as processes that are associated with resilience in response to stressors in older adulthood.

"Relational factors predict telepsychotherapy acceptance in patients: The role of therapeutic relationship and attachment","Introduction During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving individual psychotherapy needed to transition to telepsychotherapy (TP). Since telemental health appears to be here to stay after the pandemic ends, it is crucial to understand factors that determine whether telemental health is a good fit for patients. Objectives The aim of the present study was to (1) explore patientsâ€™ perception of the therapeutic relationship and attitudes towards TP, and (2) identify predictors of patientsâ€™ TP acceptance. Methods We used a longitudinal design, where patients (N = 719) receiving individual TP during the pandemic participated in an online survey, in which they responded to demographic questions and completed measures of symptom severity, Covid-related distress, attachment style (avoidant/anxious), perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and TP acceptance. Results We found that (1) patients perceived the quality of the therapeutic relationship as reasonably good, and patientsâ€™ TP acceptance was moderately high. (2) patientsâ€™ TP acceptance was predicted by their attachment avoidance and their perception of the real relationship, whereas attachment anxiety, working alliance, as well as demographic variables, symptom severity, and Covid-related distress were unrelated to TP acceptance. The final model showed that perceived strength of the real relationship mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and TP acceptance. Conclusions Both general (attachment) and situational (therapeutic relationship) relational variables are important predictors of patientâ€™s acceptance of TP, and should be considered during decision making about suitability of TP to patients.

"The impact of COVID-19 on mental health charity fundraising: An account from the perspective of fundraisers","Introduction The dawn of COVID-19 brought new rules, restrictions, and lockdowns but this led to the unlikely fall of many sectors, including the charitable sector. There has been a significant decline in funding received by mental health charities, especially during the pandemic. This study looks at the subsequent impact on fundraisers and mental health promotion during COVID-19. Objectives The main aim was to uncover how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way that mental health charities fundraise, raise awareness, and promote mental health. This aimed to look at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fundraisers supporting mental health charities and their opinion on whether fundraising has either helped or hindered mental health promotion. Methods Accounts from fundraisers and local representatives for mental health charities during the COVID-19 pandemic were analysed. Common themes looked at the impact, adaptation, and reasons why fundraisers decided to help during a tough period for the charitable sector. Results Mental health charities expressed difficulty in sourcing funds to support their users, especially in a vulnerable time. Fundraisers tried innovative ways to promote mental health and raise money for charities. Conclusions Altruism and understanding how precious services such as mental health charities are for the population was the main driver for fundraisers. Mental health charities adapted by turning to online communication and reached out to fundraisers to continually highlight the importance of mental health to their users and fundraisers.

"Burnout syndrome in resuscitation anesthesiologists as a subjective answer to professional stress in the covid-19 period","Introduction In the COVID-19 pandemic situation the burden that has fallen on the shoulders of resuscitation anesthesiologists has become really great. These specialists experience emotional and psychical stress that has led to the high risk of formation of the emotional burnout syndrome in the pre-COVID period. Objectives A comparative analysis of the formation of a complete syndrome of emotional burnout in 2020-2021 in resuscitation anesthesiologists with varied years of professional activity. Methods Sixty-two resuscitation anesthesiologists volunteered to take part in the study: 47 males and 15 females. The main method of study was V. Boikoâ€™s method of â€œDiagnosis of level of emotional burnoutâ€. Results The results have shown that, during the said period, the number of doctors with complete syndrome of emotional burnout has significantly increased, that is, all three phases: stress, resistance and exhaustion had formed. The period of study has clearly shown two groups of male doctors: with period of work of 20 or more years, and with period of work of less than 5 years. The said symptoms cause a feeling of physical and psychological overburdens, stress at work and at home, conflicts with management personnel, colleagues and patients. Conclusions The atypical COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic has laid significant stress on the psychic and physical health of resuscitation anesthesiologists. The high level of psychological strain, accumulation of negative emotions, and the feeling of helplessness led to medical errors and delays in important tactical decisions.

"Perception of stress by medical staff during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in russia","Introduction Assessment of mental health in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic helps to prevent the delayed negative consequences of work under high risk. Objectives The study compares the perceived stress and coping ability in medical staff caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and in professionals, working with other patients. Methods Online survey involved 249 doctors and medical staff of a Moscow hospital aged 19 to 60 (80 men and 169 women). 135 people worked directly with COVID-19 patients and 114 specialists did not. The study was conducted with the Perceived Stress Scale (10-items) amidst the first wave of COVID-19 in Russia, in May 2020. Results No significant differences were found in the stress levels between the two groups of healthcare providers. On average, the sample revealed an increased level of stress (15.4 with standard values of 12-13). The general indicator of perceived stress (F = 13.471;p &lt;0.001), stress level (F = 12.333;p = 0.001) and stress resistance (F = 6.003;p = 0.015) in women is significantly higher than in men. In addition, women working with COVID-19 patients have a higher level of stress resistance than women working with other patients (F = 3.432;p = 0.045). Conclusions The perception of stress by healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic increases independently on whether or not they work with infected patients. Although stress is higher in women, they are better at coping, especially in extreme situations.

"Physical and psychological (in)stability in extreme situations: physics models for understanding health stability","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how quickly and drastically everyday life can change in extreme situations. Objectives To investigate how external factors can affect human health â€“ mentally and physically â€“ and what indicators herald the proximity to a critical upheaval. Methods Using theories from theoretical physics and psychology, researchers from Heidelberg University and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology will observe emotional reaction via an â€˜infinitesimal stimulusâ€™ (f ) to an image that gives the â€˜infinitesimal displacementâ€™ (d). While both the stimulus and the reaction are chosen to be small â€“ and hence keep a person well within their emotional stability â€“ the ratio (d/f ) provides us a quantitative measure of the individualâ€™s susceptibility i.e. reaction sensitivity. Over a six-month phase, we hope to correlate the individual susceptibility with the personâ€™s general emotional state and to define a threshold reaction to indicate a personâ€™s proximity to an emotional instability. Semi-structured interviews of extreme cases give us further insight into correlations between emotional states and susceptibility. Results If an increased susceptibility in an individual actually precedes a long-term change in mood, then regular susceptibility measurements can be used, for instance, to detect depression at an early stage. We are particularly curious to observe the extent to which models from physics can be applied to society and the individual. Conclusions The final output is to integrate practical implementation aspects into the medical curricula in a transdisciplinary manner. If possible, a formula for understanding health stability should be formulated that would be highly innovative for the medical field.

"A crisis within a public health crisis-US Public health workers' race-related stress, trauma, anxiety, depression, and burnout during the covid-19 pandemic: Predicting burnout","While the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the general U.S. public health workforce have been well described, the effects of the COVID-19 response on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) working in public health have not been adequately characterized. BIPOC public health professionals may have suffered, potentially, greater stress and more negative health impacts during the pandemic due to being part of communities experiencing severe COVID-19 health inequities and the potential for racism-related stress in the workplace. This study utilized a cross-sectional design to investigate the associations between risk factors/predictors and higher levels of burnout among BIPOC public health professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey data was collected using the Qualtrics survey platform and SPSS was used for data analysis. Survey items measured multiple domains including professional experience (i.e., years of experience, job functions, hours worked, volunteer work), mental and physical health status (i.e., co-morbidities, BMI, COVID-19diagnosis, insomnia, anxiety, depression, trauma, burnout), professional and personal stress (before and during the pandemic), and racism-related stress (i.e., discrimination, harassment, heightened vigilance, cultural taxation).Of the total respondents (n = 486), 80% experienced insomnia, 68.5% experienced depression, 81.7% experienced anxiety and 61.3% experienced trauma. BIPOC public health professionals suffered a moderately high overall level of burnout (mean = 2.578, SD = 0.486,min = 1, max = 3.9) and a high level of exhaustion (mean = 2.744, SD = 0.532, min = 1, max =4). Paired t-tests found respondents' physical and mental health status were each significantly worse during the pandemic (p &lt; .000). Respondents also had significantly worse professional and personal stress during the pandemic (p &lt; .000). Backward stepwise regression found higher burnout significantly predicted by: not having sought counseling;lower rating of mental health during COVID-19;higher past year mental distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, insomnia and trauma);higher past month perceived stress;and higher vigilance. These findings emerge as important in informing the public health field regarding the current and future needs of BIPOC public health professionals during the pandemic and beyond.

"Being a psychiatric resident during COVID times â€“ personal experiences of Hungarian trainees","Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic residents of the central region of Hungary also had to adapt to several challenges such as changes of hospitalsâ€™ specialty profiles and delegation of health care workers to COVID wards. Hungarian residents have their practical training in various hospitals, while their psychiatric academic training is organised in groups. Objectives Our aim is to share our personal experiences about how our work and training have changed during the pandemic and itâ€™s effect on our patients. Methods Participants of the study were the authors of the poster. Responses to open questions were structured based on the following topics: competencies in internal medicine, infectious diseases and psychiatry, our collaboration with other medical disciplines, psychiatric training and attitudes towards mental health patients. Results We worked min 2 weeks max 8 months at COVID wards and also treated COVID-19 infected psychiatric patients, thus gaining a greater experience in general medicine. In psychiatric work, acute care became prominent, communication in PPE and restricted contact with patientsâ€™ relatives were particularly difficult. Our relationship with other specialists has improved, consultation became easier. Increased use and misuse of psychiatric consultation requests led to further pressure. Restrictions, stigmatisation and discrimination increased against psychiatric patients, including difficult access to care. Psychiatric training in the hospitals became limited, however seminars organized by the university continued online with our active participation.

"Measurement of COVID-19 related mental health problems","Introduction The spread of the corona virus (COVID-19) has an enormous psychosocial impact on humanity across the globe, resulting in an increase in mental health issues. There are no specific diagnostic instruments that could identify COVID-19 related mental health problems. In recent months, new scales have been developed to identify COVID-19 related problems. Objectives Our objective was to investigate the clinical utility of these new assessment instruments. Methods We performed a literature search, using Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane library databases, to search for new scales identifying COVID-19 related mental health problems. Results During the first half of the year 2020, we found five published new self-report measurement instruments: Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), the COVID Stress Scales (CSS), the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), and the Questionnaire on Perception of Threat from COVID-19. These instruments have been validated in a group of middle-aged ambulatory patients. Conclusions These new instruments might be useful in non-clinical settings. Although the psychometric reports are promising, the instruments have been validated in a less vulnerable group of patients.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the quality of life of older adults: a cross-sectional study in Athens, Greece","Introduction The COVID-19 has affected both physical and mental health of the elderly. Objectives The purpose of the present study was to estimate the impact of the second lockdown in Greece, on both quality of life and mental health in older people. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among older adults who visited a primary care physician, from 1st of March to April 30th. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to collect basic sociodemographic data and implementation of hygiene precaution measures. The 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to measure well-being, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) instrument was used to assess the anxiety levels and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) depressive symptoms of the responders, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v.24.0 Results 222 elderly took part in the study. 62.6% were female. According to the WHO-5, 37.4% present poor quality of life. GDS-15 reveals that 70.7% of the participants screened positive for moderate depression and 1.8% with severe symptoms. GAD-7 results estimated 32.9% of the participants to suffer from serious anxiety disorder and 37.4% from moderate. GAD-7 and GDS-15 were strongly associated (p &lt;0.05) with female gender, low educational level and with comorbidities (coronary disease, diabetes mellitus and skeletomuscular diseases). Health precaution measures were negative correlated with mental health of the elderly. However, in participants with frequent contact with family and friends, lower anxiety levels were detected.

"Snapshot of a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric ER during Pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted numerous fundamental systems ranging from businesses to education system. The long-term consequences of the Pandemic, namely virtual learning and prolonged social isolation are coming to fruition in Child/Adolescent-Psychiatric Emergency-Rooms (CAP-ER). Discontinuity of in-person attendance of schools has poorly impacted the mental health of children and adolescents (C&A) of low-socioeconomic areas, who often rely on schools for meals, physical activity, and mental-health support. An increase in agitation, suicidal ideation, and a declining school performance has been observed in such situations. Objectives The primary objective of this study is to explore the increase in these symptoms as the presenting complaint in the psychiatric ER. Methods Between April to June 2021 a cross-sectional quality improvement (QI) study was done on children presenting to CAP-ER BronxCare-Hospital NY with psychiatric complaints. Concomitant substance use disorder was determined using CRAFT questionnaire. Results Our data comprised 209 patients (84 M/125 F) with 79 children and 130 adolescents. Ethnicity: 116 Hispanics (56%), 84 African Americans (40%), and 9 others. The most common presenting complaints were aggression (111, 53%), suicidal ideation/suicide attempt (50, 24%), acute exacerbation of chronic illness (7, 3.3%), accidental overdosage (5, 2.3%) and others (36, 17.4). Marijuana was the most used substance (34 patients).

"â€œI rather talk on the phoneâ€: Factors affecting compliance with outpatient visits during COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic presented a global public-health crisis that demanded healthcare to adapt at an unprecedented pace. While challenging, it also created opportunities for the advancement of novel electronic-treatment-modalities. Telepsychiatry has emerged as an effective method to ensure continuity of care and ensure social distancing.1 Studies indicate that mental-health patients have higher rates of noncompliance to follow-up, 1 thus finding means to increase compliance is critical. Objectives The objectives of this study are to determine the impact of telepsychiatry on compliance to follow-up and to identify numbers of psychiatric/medical emergency-room visits, most common contributing factors for admission, and compliance in terms of diagnosis. Methods This IRB approved study is a retrospective chart-review, that aims to study children/adolescents (5-18 years) who presented to the Child&Adolescent-Psychiatry Outpatient-clinic from July-December 2020 and engaged in telepsychiatry, compared to a group of patients presented in July-December 2019-Pre-Covid19-Pandemic. A review of clinical characteristics including diagnosis, demographic information, medication, and treatment compliance will be compared as well as admissions to inpatient-psychiatry/emergency-room visits. Results Our total sample (N=252) included patients from 2019-Pre-COVID19 (N=111) and 2020 Telehealth during COVID19-Pandemic (N=141). Our data analysis using SPSF and T-test has shown that Telehealth has significantly increased follow-up compliance (Two-tailed P-value=0.04);2019-Pre-COVID outreach mean=0.06, 2020-Telehealth-during COVID outreach mean=0.02);significantly decreased ER/CPEP visits (P-value=0.02), and decreased In-patient-unit admissions (P-value=0.02). Conclusions According to the presented study, the incorporation of telepsychiatry has increased the compliance to psychiatric-care in outpatient and decreased the emergency-room visits and inpatient admission. Sufficient resources and steps need to be taken to further strengthen telehealth services.

"Dealing with the Pandemic and After for Children and Adolescents, and their Families","France has been severely impacted by the pandemic. The first wave imposed a major lockdown, never seen before. The second and third wave lockdown responses were somewhat less dramatic. People were allowed to travel to work. Nursery and elementary schools were left open while high schools had part-time attendance. Spring 2021, still presented with a terrible death toll of 300/day, for a 67million population country. For many months the spotlights were focused on the high levels of mortality and morbidity of the elderly. This somehow obliterated the younger generationâ€™s mental health issues. It now appears that children and adolescents have had to pay a steep price to Covid 19. In France, during the first lockdown, child and adolescent morbidity and mortality due to abuse heightened considerably compared to 2019 during the same period. And during the second and mostly the third lockdown, pediatric emergency wards have been underwater with youth mental health issues ranging form suicidal ideation to acute dissociation. Different hypotheses have emerged on how the pandemic has so dramatically impacted the mental health of children and adolescents, specifically the most vulnerable ones. The consequences this might have for child development and mental health during the years to come will be debated.

"Insomnia as a concerned mental health issue during COVID-19 pandemic: A google trend analysis","Introduction Insomnia is one of the most common major health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been limited evidence that showed the correlation between insomnia and COVID-19 using Google trend. Objectives To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on interest in insomnia, including national mental health by a Google trend analysis that implicitly represents the state of distress and concern for this pandemic. Methods We examined the Google trend search query data from these sleep-related keywords: insomnia, restless leg, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from 1 Jan 2020 to 30 May 2020 and explored the correlation between the internet search volumes for insomnia and the cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases. In addition, we investigated the internet search pattern over time, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic between January and May 2020, the Relative Search Volumes (RSV) curves showed that the cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases was significantly correlated with the rising search for these keywords linking to sleep-related conditions as follows: â€˜insomniaâ€™ (r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001), and â€˜restless legâ€™ (r = 0.19, p = 0.009). However, it was not correlated with the keyword â€˜OSAâ€™ (r = -0.14, p = 0.07). Conclusions These findings emphasize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insomnia and the crucial need for public mental health interventions to be offered and accessible.

"Mental health service requirements after hospitalization due to COVID-19: a 1- year follow-up study","Introduction Long-term COVID-19 effects has been recently described as persistent and prolonged symptoms after an acute and severe SARS-COV-2 (1). An important concern is that the sequelae of severe COVID-19 may suppose a substantial outpatient 's burden for the specialized services in reopening pandemic phase (2). Objectives To describe the frequency of mental health service use in COVID-19 hospitalized patients after discharge and to estimate the costs associated to the post- discharge consultations. Methods We used a 1-year follow-up cohort of 1455 COVID-19 inpatients hospitalized in La Paz University Hospital of Madrid, Spain between March 16th and April 15th, 2020. Data were retrieved from Psychiatry Service (PS) electronic health records and we described the frequency of mental health reason for consultation. We used information published by the Madrid health Office to estimate the cost of initial and following appointments. Results Our sample consisted of 1,455 patients admitted with a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 16th and April 15th, 2020, and then discharged. Roughly half of them were men (776, 53%), 238 (16%) had a prior history of mental health problems, and 44 (3%) died. 193 participants (13%) visited the mental health department after being discharged. The total cost was estimated in 103,581 USD, of which two-thirds corresponded to patients with prior history of mental health problems.

"Child psychiatric emergency visits during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Paediatric and adult psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits decreased during the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Long-term consequences of the pandemic will include increases in mental healthcare needs especially among especially vulnerable groups such as children and adolescents. Objectives This study examined changes in the number of overall and diagnosis-specific mental health ED visits among patients aged &lt;18 years following onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Madrid, Spain. Methods We used electronic health records to extract the monthly numbers of total and diagnosis-specific mental health ED visits among patients aged &lt;18 years, between October 2018 and April 2021, to La Paz University Hospital. We conducted interrupted time-series analyses and compared trends before and after the day of the first ED COVID-19 case (1st March 2020). Results In March 2020, there was a marked initial decrease of -12.8 (95%CI -21.9, -7.9) less monthly mental health ED visits. After April 2020, there was a subsequent increasing trend of 3.4 (95%CI 2.6, 4.2) additional monthly mental health ED visits. Conclusions After onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in paediatric psychiatric ED visits, especially due to suicide-related reasons.

"Suicide: The pandemic inside the pandemic","Introduction Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11th and efforts have been made to minimize the impact that this new disease can produce. The mental health effects of this pandemic can be severe considering that each year close to 800.000 people die by suicide. This pandemic could increase those numbers, although this is not inevitable. Objectives This work reviewed the current available data on possible causes for a suicide rate increase and to try to understand if suicide is already increasing worldwide. Methods Non-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the past 6 months;by searching Pubmed and Medscape databases using the combination of MeSH descriptors. The following MeSH terms were used: Covid-19;suicide;SARS-Cov2;pandemic. Results Multiple factors can account for an increase in suicide rates such as isolation with a sense of decreased belongingness and increased burdensomeness. A synergy with known suicide precipitants can also occur such as domestic violence, intra-familiar conflicts, alcohol consumption and access to means. Media communication can represent a danger with constant reports about the crisis. And lastly the loss of employment and financial stressors can produce an important impact. Conclusions In conclusion, Covid-19 will produce an important impact in many spheres of society, one of which will be mental health. If at the start of this crisis a widespread sense of solidarity was present with the maintenance of precipitant factors for suicide we expect to see an increase in suicide rates.","AndrÃ©, R.; Sereijo, C.; Abreu, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Suicide:+The+pandemic+inside+the+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S271-S271, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40721,""
"Symptoms of anxiety/depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown in the community: longitudinal data from the TEMPO cohort in France","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and associated preventive measures have an impact on the personsâ€™ mental health, including increasing risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression in particular. Individual experiencing mental health difficulties in the past could be especially vulnerable during lockdown, however, few studies have tested this empirically considering preexisting mental health difficulties using longitudinal data. Objectives The objective of this study is to examine the longitudinal association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a community sample. Methods Seven waves of data collection were implemented from March-May 2020. Generalized estimation equations models were used to estimate the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown among 662 mid-aged individuals from the French TEMPO cohort. Results We found an elevated odds ratio of symptoms of anxiety/depression (OR=6.73 95% [CI=4.45â€“10.17]) among individuals experiencing such symptoms prior lockdown. Furthermore, the odds of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown was elevated among women (OR=2.07 [95% CI=1.32â€“3.25]), subjects with low household income (OR=2.28 [1.29â€“4.01]) and persons who reported loneliness (OR=3.94 [2.47â€“6.28]). Conclusions This study demonstrates a strong relationship between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and anxiety/ depression during the COVID-19 outbreak among mid-aged French adults. The findings underline the role of preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression as a vulnerability factor of anxiety/depression during lockdown. Furthermore, the study shows that loneliness is independently associated with symptoms of anxious/depression, when controlling for prior anxiety/depression symptoms.

"Influence of COVID-19 in the development of delusional ideas disorder A case report","Introduction Hypochondria is characterized by the presence, for 6 months or more, of a generalized and non-delusional concern with fear of having (or the idea that one has) a serious illness, based on the wrong interpretation of the symptoms. In somatic-type delusional disorder, the delusional idea is fixed, indisputable, and occurs intensely because the patient is fully convinced of the physical nature of the disorder. Objectives To describe a clinical case and make a differential diagnosis of hypochondriac disorder vs somatic-type delusional disorder. Methods Case report: 61-year-old woman, after suffering from COVID-19, develops a hypochondriacal disorder vs. somatic delusional disorder, presenting anxiety-depressive symptoms and digestive somatic complaints, with a loss of 15 kg of weight. She made frequent visits to doctors and multiple complementary tests discarding organicity. She required involuntary hospital admission for 48 days, and pharmacological treatment with Venlafaxine 150 mg, Olanzapine 5mg, Mirtazapine 30mg and Alprazolam 1mg. The patient presented slow evolution during admission, with ups and downs and stagnation, meriting enteral nutrition due to refusal to ingest, given abdominal kinesthetic hallucinations and digestive evaluation (EDS) with a result of antral gastritis and negative H. pylori. In subsequent follow-ups after partial remission of symptoms, obsessive personality traits are glimpsed, although with better personal functioning. Results The diagnosis at discharge was inconclusive, however the data points to a somatic-type delusional disorder.

"Russian medical students in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: emotional reactions and baseline beliefs","Introduction During the pandemic of new coronavirus infection, some medical students were actively recruited to work with infected patients, which could provoke depression, anxiety, and stress. The concept of baseline beliefs predicts characteristics of individualsâ€™ experience of trauma. Objectives The study aimed to determine depression, anxiety, and stress levels in medical students and examine their baseline beliefs, as well as the relationship between baseline beliefs and emotional reactions. Methods Data were collected in the spring and summer of 2020 using a Google form that we developed. Thirty-seven medical students participated in the study. The WAS-37 questionnaire was used to examine baseline beliefs and the DASS-21 to measure depression, anxiety, and stress. Both questionnaires were adapted for use in Russia. Results We found that 78 % of the respondents had no depression, 86 % had no manifestations of anxiety, and 83 % felt stress-free. The mean values on the â€œBenevolence in the Worldâ€ scale (M = 32.3Â±8.0) were within the average normative values, those on the â€œJusticeâ€ scale (M = 19.8Â±5.0) were below them, and those on the â€œSelf-Imageâ€ scale (M = 29.6Â±5.9), â€œLuckâ€ (M = 32.5Â±6.9) and â€œControlling Beliefsâ€ (M = 27.3Â±4.1) were above the average normative values.

"Practicing Psychiatry in the Transitional Period: Lessons Learnt and Issues of the Steps Towards the New Normal","The arrival of Covid-19 had huge impact on all aspects of life and psychiatry was no exception. Significant changes to mental health services were introduced to reduce the risk of infection among the inpatient population, patients in the community and in outpatients consultations. Use of virtual consultations in the community and stringent infection control in inpatient setting are examples of many. Those changes were associated with significant differences in patientsâ€™ presentation and access to services. Multiple studies reported increased proportion of psychotic patients being admitted to inpatient care. However, there were no reports on increased suicide contrary to the expectation. This is despite increased reports of mental distress, depression, and anxiety in the wider population. These reports are consistent with our knowledge of mental health problems reported in times of wars and disasters. Hence, some of the learning from experience proved relevant when facing this pandemic. Unfortunately, Covid-19 continues to represent a challenge and relaxing of the restrictions introduced were short-lived with every variant reported. In addition, some of the changes adopted by mental health services proved to be innovative and more efficient way of delivering care in psychiatry.

"Combining international survey datasets to identify indicators of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: A machine learning approach to improve generalization","Introduction The magnitude and exceptional opportunity to research the psychological distress of shelter in place resulted in a publication frenzy on a smorgasbord of research studies of variable scientific robustness. Confinement, fear of contagion, social isolation, financial hardship, etc. equated to stratospheric stress levels. The decline in protective factors as a function of quarantine anecdotally reflected historic rates of anxiety and depression. Objectives In this study, we combined 12 variegate datasets and developed an algorithm to build a model to identify key predictors of pandemic-related stress with high accuracy and generalizability. Methods This study reports on existing published data. We first describe the International (Adamson et al., 2020) and then the Italian dataset (Flesia et al., 2020). The time-frame (first wave of lockdown), method (survey), measurement tool (Perceived Stress Scale), and outcome measures were extremely similar to enable consolidation of datasets (see Figure1). The Flesia et al., (2020) data set was integrated into the Adamson et al., (2020) dataset as the first step towards data validation construction of the ML predictive model. Results We aim to demonstrate the strength of combining cross-cultural datasets, and the applicability of ML algorithms to facilitate the process and generate a predictive model that identifies and validates key predictors of pandemic-related stress and accommodates for interaction with demographic, cultural, and other mitigating factors while concurrently having high generalizability. Conclusions We believe our model provides clinicians, researchers, and decision-makers with evidence to investigate the moderators and mediators of stress, and introduce novel interventions to mitigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Assessment of Relapse in Patients with Schizophrenia during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction People with schizophrenia could be more substantially influenced by the emotional stress brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in relapses or worsening of an already existing mental health condition because of the high susceptibility to stress. Objectives This study aimed to assess the presence of relapse and its risk factors among patients with schizophrenia during the era of COVID 19 pandemic. Methods This study included 90 adults who met DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia and were diagnosed by (SCID-I) Arabic version and who are following up at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, Zagazig University Hospital, Egypt, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) measuring severity of symptoms, Compliance Rating Scale (CRS) and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). scales were conducted on those patients before COVID-19 pandemic from January to April 2019 and repeated on September to November 2020 during COVID 19 pandemic to compare clinical parameters between those two periods as to detect any deterioration in their clinical state. Results The mean score of compliance rating scale (CRS) was decreased after COVID-19 pandemic compared to before COVID 19 (P&lt;0.001).The mean score of PANSS scale positive subscale (P) had increased after COVID-19 pandemic compared to before COVID 19 (P&lt;0.001). Conclusions There was a deterioration of the clinical state of schizophrenic patients during COVID-19 pandemic especially the positive symptoms and following up the news about COVID-19 regularly, decreased level of family support, lower level of compliance with treatment, and having a family member with COVID-19 infection or death were the risk factors for relapse.

"An online investigation into factors related to Black maternal mortality using retrospective recall of a prior birth hospitalization with a risk of death- predicting medical mistrust","The problem that this study addressed was the high rate of maternal mortality for Black women in the United States, which has been rising, including before the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to identify significant predictors of medical mistrust. The study recruited a convenience sample via an online social media campaign. The resultant sample was 100% Black and female (N=192) with a mean age of 33.23 (SD= 4.980, min=24, max=61), while 94.8% were born in the United States (n=182). Using background stepwise regression, the following were found to be significant predictors of a higher level of medical mistrust: older age (B = .033, p = .001);higher levels of education (B = 0.205, p = .000);lower annual household income (B = -.055, p = .026);higher level of perceived racism, discrimination, and inequity in treatment from medical staff (B = 0.137, p = .046);lower levels of cultural sensitivity/ competence/ humility ratings for medical staff (B = -.155, p = .002);higher past year mental distress (i.e., Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia and Trauma) (B = .369, p = .000);and lower levels of social support post-partum (B = -0.162, p = .004)-with 46.5% of the variance predicted by the model (R2 = 0.698, Adjusted R2 = 0.465).The study findings highlight a crisis of Black maternal mortality in the United States, as well as a crisis in healthcare service delivery to Black women, as uncovered via this study. The data betrays a dimension of the crisis in healthcare service delivery to Black women who report experiencing discrimination for being Black at 75.5%, for their appearance (skin tone, hair, etc.) at 62.0%, and for being overweight or obese at 28.6%. Implications of the findings are discussed, while recommendations for future research are offered. In terms of those implications, perhaps most importantly, this data effectively identifies the year after a high-risk birth hospitalization as an essential time for ensuring Black women enter counseling with licensed and certified mental health professionals.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sports Medicine Patient Care","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated new practices in sports medicine patient care. Telehealth has been validated as a reliable tool for consultations and physical examinations and increases access to care in a cost-efficient manner. Social distancing and avoiding team members who have tested positive are the most effective ways to reduce spread. For screening, daily self-reported symptom checklists and fever monitoring help identify potentially infected athletes who should be instructed to isolate and seek care. Polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) testing for the virus via nasopharyngeal swab is not recommended for screening and should be reserved for symptomatic individuals with fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Face masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) may be beneficial in high-risk settings, but there is little evidence to support use in athletic populations. Median return to play after COVID-19 in elite athletes has been reported as 18 days (range, 12 to 30), with 27% not fully available at 28 days. Chest pain at diagnosis was the only symptom associated with time loss before 28 days. Finally, canceled competitions or time loss results in grief, stress, and frustration for athletes, as well as loss of a social support network and routine training regimens. Mental health support services may be indicated.","Peebles, Aman, Kraeutler, Mulcahey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2022.11.003","20221108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40734,""
"The trajectory of mental health problems for UK emerging adults during COVID-19","Initial COVID-19 restrictions were associated with declining mental health, particularly in UK emerging adults. Prior research has yet to examine changes in mental health in this demographic over the entire course of the three UK national lockdowns. Drawing upon the Understanding Society COVID-19 Survey, this study examined the trajectory of mental health problems for emerging adults (18-29-year-olds) from April 2020-September 2021. Mental health problems were assessed at nine time-points using the General Health Questionnaire. The analytic sample included 1018 participants (304 males, 714 females). Growth curve modelling was used to examine the trajectory of mental health problems and the associated sociodemographic and health covariates. Females and those with fewer household members, lower income, no private garden, and pre-existing mental or physical health diagnoses reported more mental health problems. Gender differences were evident in the rate of change. Females' mental health problems declined from the first lockdown until just after the relaxation of initial restrictive measures (September 2020), increased until April 2021 (constituting lockdowns two and three), and then slightly decreased until September 2021 during the phased exit from restrictions. Males' mental health problems followed a similar trajectory, with a greater rate of increase in mental health problems from July 2020-April 2021, and a greater rate of decline from April-September 2021. Females reported more mental health problems throughout the three national lockdowns than males. These findings can inform public health policies targeted toward young adult populations and highlight sub-populations at greater risk of worsening mental health.","Thorpe, Gutman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.10.068","20221108","COVID-19; Gender; Longitudinal; Mental health; Socio-demographic; Young adults; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40735,""
"Exploring public opinion about telehealth during COVID-19 by social media analytics","While COVID-19 catalyzed the acceptance and use of telehealth, our understanding of how it is perceived by multi-stakeholders such as patients, clinicians, and health authorities is limited. Drawing on social media analytics, this research examines social media discourses and users' opinions about telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. It applies natural language processing and deep learning to explore word of mouth on telehealth with a contextualized focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and emotion analysis (fearful, happy, sad, surprised, and angry emotions). The topic modeling analysis led to the identification of 18 topics, representing 6 themes of digital health service delivery, pandemic response, communication and promotion, government action, health service domains (e.g. mental health, cancer, aged care), as well as pharma and drug. The sentiment analysis revealed that while most opinions expressed in tweets were positive, the public expressed mostly negative opinions about certain aspects of COVID-19 such as lockdowns and cyberattacks. Emotion analysis of tweets showed a dominant pattern of fearful and sad emotions in particular topics. The results of this study that inductively emerged from our social media analysis can aid public health authorities and health professionals to address the concerns of telehealth users and improve their experiences.","Pool, Namvar, Akhlaghpour, Fatehi","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X221122112","20221108","COVID-19; Telehealth; machine learning; social media analytics; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40736,""
"Engagement, Use and Impact of Digital Mental Health Resources for Diverse Populations in COVID-19: Community-Partnered Evaluation","The COVID-19 pandemic increased disparities for communities burdened by structural barriers, such as shortage of affordable housing, with mental health consequences. These impacts are noted across diverse groups; but limited data are available on digital resources as a public health prevention strategy for mental health in COVID-19. To evaluate engagement in and impact of free digital resources on the Together for Wellness/Juntos por Nuestro Bienestar (T4W/Juntos) website, with content in six categories developed with partner input to support well-being during COVID-19 in California. A pilot evaluation of T4W/Juntos, with partner agencies inviting providers, clients and partners to visit the website and complete surveys at baseline (9/20/21-4/4/22) and 4-6 week follow-up (10/22/21-5/17/22). Website use was assessed by mean of three engagement items (ease of use, satisfaction, relevance), comfort in use, and use of six resource categories. Outcomes at follow up were depression and anxiety (PHQ2&gt;=3; GAD2&gt;=3 (primary) and post minus pre differences in PHQ2 and GAD2 scores and use of behavioral health hotlines and services (outpatient, inpatient, rehabilitation, hotlines) the month before follow-up (secondary). Of 366 eligible, 315 (86.1%) completed baseline, of which 193 (61.3%) completed follow-up. Of baseline, 72.6% were female, 21.3% LGBTQ+, 44.0% Hispanic, 17.8% African American, 26.9% non-Hispanic white, 11.4% other ethnicity; 32.7% had moderate anxiety or depression (GAD2/PHQ2&gt;=3). Predictors of baseline website engagement included Hispanic versus other race/ethnicity (Beta (SE) = 0.27 (0.10-.44), P=.002) and COVID behavior changes (Beta (SE) =0.09 (.05-.13), P &lt;.001). For comfort using website, predictors were preferring English for website (OR (CI)=5.57 (2.22-13.96), P &lt;.001); COVID behavior changes (OR (CI)=1.37 (1.12-1.66), P =.002); those having overnight behavioral health treatment in the prior 6 months had less comfort using website (OR (CI)=0.15 (0.03-0.69), P =.015). Predictors of follow-up depression (PHQ2&gt;=3) were baseline depression (OR=6.24 (2.77, 14.09), P &lt;.001); engagement in T4W/Juntos was associated with lower likelihood of depression (OR=.54 (.34,.86), P =.01). Website use during the month before follow-up was associated with post minus pre reduction in PHQ2 score (Beta (CI) = -.62 (-1.04, -0.20), P =.004). For GAD2&gt;=3 at follow-up, the main predictor was baseline GAD2 (OR (CI) = 13.65 (6.06, 30.72), P &lt;.001). Greater baseline website engagement predicted reduced hotline use (OR (CI)=.36 (.18,.71), P =.004). For use of behavioral health services prior to follow-up, the main predictor was services use prior to baseline, P &lt;.001. Ethnicity/language and COVID behavior changes were associated with website engagement; engagement and actual use predicted reduced follow-up depression and behavioral hotline use. Findings are based on a sample of participants recommended by community agencies with moderate follow-up rates, but significance of findings was similar in sensitivity analyses weighting for nonresponse.

"Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial","Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a ""Personalized Advantage Index"" (PAI) reflecting an individual's expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. A significant group Ãƒâ€” PAI interaction emerged (t<sub>658</sub>=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

"Supporting Parents' Services Access During the COVID-19 Pandemic Through the Infant-Toddler Court Team Program","Infant-Toddler Court Teams (ITCTs) are a collaborative practice designed to improve timely identification and receipt of needed services for families of infants and toddlers involved in the child welfare system and their families. The goal of the study was to explore the impact of the first year of COVID compared to the previous year, in the context of ITCT support, on: (1) parents' access to services; (2) parents' services receipt and access within 30 days and within 14 days from referral; and (3) predictors of services access and receipt. Overall, 897 instances of services needs were analyzed, 411 pre-COVID and 486 during COVID. Logistic regression models were used to test for differences pre- and during COVID, controlling for covariates. A reduction in service access was found across all services during COVID (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2, CI: 0.1-0.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). Nevertheless, if a service was still available, parents were able to maintain similar levels of receipt within 30 days and within 14 days as before COVID. Moreover, a higher percentage of parents in need received mental health services in 30 or fewer days and substance use disorder services in both 14 and 30 or fewer days during COVID compared to pre-COVID. This success is notable given the significant disruption to the availability of services and barriers to accessing services caused by the pandemic. ITCTs provided a robust platform for supporting the health and well-being of families with very young children in the face of a severely reduced service landscape due to COVID-19.","Casanueva, Kluckman, Harris, Brown, Fraser","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-022-03527-x","20221108","COVID-19 Pandemic; Child Maltreatment; Child Protective Services; Infant Toddlers Court Teams; Services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40739,""
"Lessons learned from the impact of Covid-19 on the work of disability support organisations that support employers of social care personal assistants in England","Social care Personal Assistants (PAs) are directly employed by individuals to assist with activities of daily living such as help or support with personal care, shopping, household tasks and community participation. This option is encouraged by UK public funding. In England, disabled people's support organisations initially offered assistance with such arrangements, although numbers doing this have declined. The Covid-19 pandemic provided the opportunity to ask those remaining organisations providing support for PA employers about their activities during this time and the questions being posed to them by PA employers. This paper reports data from 15 interviews undertaken March-July 2021 with disability support organisation representatives. We identified one overarching theme 'Working to prevent and challenge marginalisation of PA employers', with three related subthemes: (1) Advocating for the voice of a forgotten group; (2) Needing to be proactive and (3) Adapting to new tasks and ways of working. Participant accounts focused on representing the needs of disabled people to the authorities and providing concise, timely and accurate information to PA employers, particularly around the use of public funds during Covid-19. Remote working amplified the digital-divide, resulting in these organisations working hard to ensure PA employers received important information about their support options. Befriending services and Covid-hubs were established by some organisations to reduce isolation and risks of poor mental health amongst PA employers. Many of the challenges facing PA employers existed pre-pandemic but were perceived to have been heightened during it, reflecting the value of and need for the work of these local support organisations. Our findings suggest areas where effective contingency planning drawn from closer collaboration between disability support organisations and central and local government might usefully be focussed. The potential for specific services or organisations to be commissioned to provide such support is discussed.","Leverton, Samsi, Woolham, Manthorpe","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14098","20221108","Covid-19; direct payments; personal assistants; social care; social care workforce; support services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40740,""
"Molecular dynamics simulations of the spike trimeric ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant: structural relationships with infectivity, evasion to immune system and transmissibility","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron is currently the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the trimeric spike<sup>WT</sup> and Spike<sup>BA.1</sup> for 300Ã¢â‚¬â€°ns. Our results show that Spike<sup>BA.1</sup> has more conformational flexibility than Spike<sup>WT</sup>. Our principal component analysis (PCA) allowed us to observe a broader spectrum of different conformations for Spike<sup>BA.1</sup>, mainly at N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such increased flexibility could contribute to decreased neutralizing antibody recognition of this variant. Our molecular dynamics data show that the RBD<sup>BA.1</sup> easily visits an up-conformational state and the prevalent D614G mutation is pivotal to explain molecular dynamics results for this variant because to lost hydrogen bonding interactions between the residue pairs K854<sup>SC</sup>/D614<sup>SC</sup>, Y837<sup>MC</sup>/D614<sup>MC</sup>, K835<sup>SC</sup>/D614<sup>SC</sup>, T859<sup>SC</sup>/D614<sup>SC</sup>. In addition, Spike<sup>BA.1</sup> residues near the furin cleavage site are more flexible than in Spike<sup>WT</sup>, probably due to P681H and D614G substitutions. Finally, dynamical cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) analysis reveals that D614G and P681H may allosterically affect the cleavage site S1/S2. Conversely, S2' site may be influenced by residues located between NTD and RBD of a neighboring protomer of the Spike<sup>WT</sup>. Such communication may be lost in Spike<sup>BA.1</sup>, explaining the changes of the cell tropism in the viral infection.

"Maternal-prenatal stress and depression predict infant temperament during the COVID-19 pandemic","Researchers have begun to examine the psychological toll of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Data are now emerging indicating that there may be long-term adverse effects of the pandemic on new mothers and on children born during this period. In a longitudinal study of maternal mental health and child emotional development during the pandemic, we conducted online assessments of a cohort of women at two time points: when they were pregnant at the beginning of the surge of the pandemic in the United States (baseline, <i>N</i> = 725), and approximately 1 year postpartum (follow-up, <i>N</i> = 296), examining prenatal and postnatal maternal mental health, prenatal pandemic-related stress, and infant temperament. Pandemic-related stress at baseline was associated with concurrent depressive symptoms and infant negative affect at follow-up. Baseline maternal depressive symptoms were associated with follow-up depressive symptoms, which in turn were also associated with infant negative affect. Pandemic-related stress during pregnancy may have enduring effects on infant temperament. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the emotional development of children who were <i>in utero</i> during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Buthmann, Miller, Gotlib","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579422001055","20221108","COVID-19; depression; infant temperament; prenatal mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40742,""
"Older Adults and Social Isolation and Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Integrated Review of Patterns, Effects, and Interventions","A scoping review was conducted to identify patterns, effects, and interventions to address social isolation and loneliness among community-dwelling older adult populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also integrated (1) data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) and (2) a scan of Canadian grey literature on pandemic interventions. CLSA data showed estimated relative increases in loneliness ranging between 33 and 67 per cent depending on age/gender group. International studies also reported increases in levels of loneliness, as well as strong associations between loneliness and depression during the pandemic. Literature has primarily emphasized the use of technology-based interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness. Application of socio-ecological and resilience frameworks suggests that researchers should focus on exploring the wider array of potential pandemic age-friendly interventions (e.g., outdoor activities, intergenerational programs, and other outreach approaches) and strength-based approaches (e.g., building community and system-level capacity) that may be useful for reducing social isolation and loneliness.","Kadowaki, Wister","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0714980822000459","20221108","CLSA; COVID-19; aging; isolement social; loneliness; social isolation; solitude; vieillissement; Ãƒâ€°LCV","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40743,""
"The double-edged sword effects of differential leadership on deviant behavior","Since the beginning of 2020, coronavirus disease has broken out globally, large-scale work and production have stopped, causing employees to experience emotional exhaustion, and home offices have greatly exacerbated employees' deviant behavior. Leadership practices can actively influence employees' workplace behaviors and can prevent employees' passiveness and drain on their mental health. Based on the perspective of attribution theory, this article explores the influence of differential leadership on emotional exhaustion and deviant behavior in internal/external control employees. This survey's subjects were employees working in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai. Using the Questionnaire Star, the online platform of the Marketing Research Office of Peking University, and ""snowball"" methods, 357 questionnaires were collected. This study found that care and communication have no significant effect on deviance. Promotion &amp; rewards significantly reduced interpersonal deviance but had no significant effect on organizational deviance. Tolerance &amp; trust significantly improved interpersonal deviance but had no significant effect on organizational deviance. Employees with a high locus of control (internal control) could more easily control their emotions and reduce interpersonal deviance than employees with a low locus of control (external control) but this had no moderating effect on organizational deviance. The research shows that leaders should regularly care for and encourage each employee within their department, guide employees to recognize the organizational environment, establish an ""insider"" team, improve work efficiency, and incentivize ""outsider"" efforts. Subsequent studies can observe and capture employees' emotions and subconscious behaviors through interviews and experiments to ensure the accuracy of the data.

"A Rare Case of MRSA Pericarditis with Expanding, Purulent Pericardial Effusion Leading to Uremic Kidney Failure from a Right, Necrotic Toe","Purulent pericarditis is an extremely rare entity with only a few reported cases so far. This condition deserves prompt diagnosis because of its significant mortality rate if left untreated. A 76-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right circumflex artery (RCA), ischemic cardiomyopathy with moderately reduced ejection fraction (EF 45-50%), peripheral artery disease (PAD), COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by fibrotic lung disease (on 3 liters of home oxygen), type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III presented with complaints of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. On hospital day 1, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with physical exam remarkable for bibasilar crackles and dry gangrene of his right first toe. He developed progressive altered mental status, hypotension, oliguric renal failure, and respiratory distress on hospital day 6. On exam at this time, he had an elevated jugular venous distension (JVD) of 12-14Ã¢â‚¬â€°cm water, pericardial friction rub with decreased heart sounds, and orthopnea; all were consistent with cardiac tamponade clinically. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed new ST elevations in leads I, II, and aVL with ST depression in aVR and V1 with only mild elevation in troponin I to 0.07Ã¢â‚¬â€°ng/mL. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done on hospital day 7 and showed a moderate sized pericardial effusion with inferior vena cava (IVC) enlargement but no atrial collapse, ventricular collapse, IVC collapse, or respiratory variation in the mitral and tricuspid inflow velocities. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) on hospital day 6, and he was started on intravenous (IV) vancomycin. The differential diagnosis for his enlarging pericardial effusion included purulent pericarditis, uremic pericarditis, or hemorrhagic effusion. He had urgent diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiocentesis with removal of 350 milliliters of fluid. The pericardial fluid was cloudy, tan-brown with a gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in clusters and cultures growing MRSA, which confirmed the diagnosis of purulent pericarditis secondary to MRSA infection. After the pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure, respiratory distress, and renal failure improved. The source of the bacteremia was from osteomyelitis of his gangrenous, right toe with bone biopsy growing both MRSA and <i>Streptococcus anginosus</i>. He underwent toe amputation for definitive source control. He was discharged on hospital day 24 with a plan to complete 6 weeks of IV vancomycin.","Brilliant, Edwards, Yadav, Lovell, Mathews","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7041740","20221108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40745,""
"Analyzing protective factors for adolescents' mental health during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A longitudinal study","This study examined the protective role of self-esteem and perceived emotional intelligence on mental health problems in Spanish adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (<i>N</i> = 139; <i>M</i>age = 13.83 years, <i>SD</i> = 0.96; 63.8% female) completed measures before the outbreak of COVID-19 (T1) and during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain (T2). Participants self-reported emotional intelligence, self-esteem, mental health problems and suicidal behavior. Adolescent mental health problems were equally affected by COVID-19 pandemic according to gender, age and lockdown conditions. Adolescents with low levels of emotional intelligence and self-esteem at T1 showed a significant decrease in self-reported anxiety, depression, stress and suicidal behavior at T2. However, adolescents with average or high levels of emotional intelligence and self-esteem at T1 showed no significant changes in mental health problems at T2. Self-esteem at T1 meditated the relationships between emotional intelligence at T1 (clarity and repair) and emotional symptoms at T2 (depression, anxiety and stress). Furthermore, the relationship between self-esteem and anxiety symptoms was moderated by the number of people living together during COVID-19 lockdown. Our findings highlight the protective role of pre-pandemic development of self-esteem and emotional intelligence in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on adolescent mental health during the pandemic.

"'She didn't know how to go back': School attendance problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-A multiple stakeholder qualitative study with parents and professionals","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in school closures worldwide and unexcused absences have increased since schools reopened. Drawing on multiple stakeholders' perspectives, we aimed to (i) develop a detailed understanding of how school attendance problems (SAPs) have manifested for primary school-aged children in the context of COVID-19; and (ii) identify promising community-based intervention strategies. We used a qualitative design with two sequential phases of data collection. Phase 1 involved insight generation using qualitative surveys with parents and professionals working in primary education settings. These results were used to guide in-depth stakeholder interviews in Phase 2. Phase 1 included 29 parents of primary-school children experiencing SAPs and 19 professionals. Phase 2 included 10 parents and 12 professionals. Parents were recruited through social media; professionals were identified through schools and associated networks in Southern England. Attendance was particularly challenging for children with special educational needs and pre-existing anxiety problems. Compounding factors included COVID-related anxiety, difficulties adapting to new school routines, poor home-school communication and collaboration, and concerns about academic catch-up. Effective support was characterized by schools and families working closely together. Recommendations for practice improvements centred on early intervention, re-building parent-school relationships, peer support for parents, and improving special educational provision. New interventions for SAPs must be sensitive to the ongoing COVID-19 context. Help should be easily accessible in the community and address modifiable risk and protective factors for individual children, in family systems, and at the home-school interface.","McDonald, Lester, Michelson","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12562","20221108","COVID-19; mental health; parents; qualitative; school attendance problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40747,""
"Variation in Initial and Continued use of Primary, Mental Health, and Specialty Video Care among Veterans","To identify which Veteran populations are routinely accessing video-based care. National, secondary administrative data from electronic health records at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), 2019-2021 STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort analysis identified patient characteristics associated with the odds of using any video care; and then, among those with a previous video visit, the annual rate of video care utilization. Video care use was reported overall and stratified into care type (e.g., primary, mental health, and specialty video care) between March 10, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Veterans active in VA health care (&gt;1 outpatient visit between March 11, 2019 and March 10, 2020) were included in this study. Among 5,389,129 Veterans in this evaluation, approximately 27.4% of Veterans had at least one video visit. We found differences in video care utilization by type of video care: 14.7% of Veterans had at least one primary care video visit, 10.6% a mental health video visit, and 5.9% a specialty care video visit. Veterans with a history of housing instability had a higher overall rate of video care driven by their higher usage of video for mental health care compared with Veterans in stable housing. American Indian/Alaska Native Veterans had reduced odds of video visits, yet similar rates of video care when compared to White Veterans. Low-income Veterans had lower odds of using primary video care yet slightly elevated rates of primary video care among those with at least one video visit when compared to Veterans enrolled at VA without special considerations. Variation in video care utilization patterns by type of care identified Veteran populations that might require greater resources and support to initiate and sustain video care use.

"Disruptions to US local public health's role in population-based substance use prevention and response during COVID-19","COVID-19 dramatically limited the scale and scope of local health department (LHD) work, redirecting resources to the response. However, the need for essential public health services-including substance use prevention-was not reduced. We examined six quantitative data sources, collected between 2016 and 2021, to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LHD substance use-related services. Before the pandemic, the proportion of LHDs providing some level of substance use prevention services was increasing, and many were expanding their level of provision. During the pandemic, 65% of LHDs reduced their level of substance use-related service provision, but the proportion of LHDs providing some level of services remained steady from prior to COVID-19. We discuss policy recommendations to mitigate the risk of service disruptions during future public health emergencies, including direct and flexible funding for LHDs and federal directives declaring substance use prevention services as essential.","Hall, Higgins, Beach, Diriba, Sladky, McCall","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-022-00499-7","20221109","COVID-19; Local public health; Overdose prevention; Humans; Local Government; Public Health; COVID-19; Pandemics; Substance-Related Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40749,""
"Daily affect intensity and variability of adolescents and their parents before and during a COVID-19 lockdown","The corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic may have a prolonged impact on people's lives, with multiple waves of infections and lockdowns, but how a lockdown may alter emotional functioning is still hardly understood. In this 100-daily diaries study, we examined how to affect intensity and variability of adolescents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159, M<sub>age</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.3, 61.6% female) and parents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159, M<sub>age</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45.3, 79.9% female) changed after the onset and during (&gt;50 days) the second COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands, using preregistered piecewise growth models. We found only an unexpected increase in parents' positive affect intensity after the lockdown onset, but no immediate changes in negative affect intensity or variability. However, both adolescents and parents reported gradual increases in negative affect intensity and variability as the lockdown prolonged. Lockdown effects did not differ between adolescents and parents. However, within groups, individuals differed. The individual differences in the effects were partly explained by life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and self-reported lockdown impact. Overall, these findings suggests that a lockdown triggers changes in daily affective well-being especially as the lockdown prolongs. Individual differences in the effects indicate heterogeneity in the impact of the lockdown on daily affect that was partly explained by baseline life satisfaction and depressive symptoms. However, more knowledge on the causes of this heterogeneity is needed to be able to increase resilience to lockdown effects in the population.","de Vries, BÃƒÂ¼low, Pelt, Boele, Bartels, Keijsers","https://doi.org/10.1002/jad.12117","20221107","COVID-19; affect; daily diary; lockdown; piecewise growth models; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40750,""
"When Staying Home Is Not Safe: An Investigation of the Role of Attachment Style on Stress and Intimate Partner Violence in the Time of COVID-19","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health concern, with increasing rates of IPV being seen around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research has linked the perpetration of IPV and other forms of sexual violence to aspects of romantic attachment psychology, with insecure anxious/preoccupied attachment most often linked to higher rates of IPV. Stressful events typically activate the attachment system and may either aggravate or disrupt its regulatory functioning. In the present study, we investigated whether COVID-related PTSD and depressive symptoms were associated with increased IPV perpetration and whether this relationship was moderated by levels of attachment security. Our findings indicated that higher COVID-related PTSD was significantly associated with increased IPV perpetration in securely attached individuals, whereas depressive symptoms was significantly associated with decreased IPV perpetration in securely attached individuals. IPV perpetration by insecure individuals was consistently high regardless of COVID-related PTSD or depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that COVID-related PTSD may erode adaptive attachment functioning, particularly among the previously secure, which can have important consequences for secure individuals and their intimate partners. The present findings may explain some of the recent increase in IPV cases worldwide and serve to raise awareness and motivate clinical interventions to more efficiently help both victims and perpetrators of IPV stay safe while staying home.","Gottlieb, Schmitt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-022-02457-7","20221107","Attachment; COVID; Depression; Intimate partner violence; PTSD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40751,""

Explanatory variables: gender, age, occupational class and type of contract. Prevalence of poor mental health was estimated for each year by means of logistic regression models with robust clustered SEs, stratifying by the explanatory variables. Additionally, prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated by means of robust Poisson regression models to assess differences between the explanatory variables' categories. All analyses were weighted to address unrepresentativeness. Poor mental health significantly increased in 2021 (55.92%), compared with the previous years of study (15%-17.72%). Additionally, pattern changes were identified on inequality axes in 2021, with better mental health status among older workers (oldest group PR: 0.76; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.8) and permanent workers (PR: 0.9; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.94). This study shows a steep worsening of mental health among the salaried population in 2021 compared with previous periods.

"Recognising risk, influencing reality and mental healthcare in a regional emergency department","Mental health presentations to EDs continue to rise with associated challenges increasingly understood and well documented. Despite growing evidence of current and ongoing systemic issues contributing to this increase, there continues to be a lack of administrative engagement to address ED attendance, with avoidance and diversion strategies initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic no longer prioritised, despite growing need. Clear and well-documented reports of ED overcrowding and bed boarding is evidence that things need to change. Moreover, if innovative action is not taken, the risk and reality is that long waits, poor outcomes and exposure to unsafe conditions will continue.

"Ethnic differences and inequities in paediatric healthcare utilisation in the UK: a scoping review","Despite the increased policy attention on ethnic health inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic, research on ethnicity and healthcare utilisation in children has largely been overlooked. This scoping review aimed to describe and appraise the quantitative evidence on ethnic differences (unequal) and inequities (unequal, unfair and disproportionate to healthcare needs) in paediatric healthcare utilisation in the UK 2001-2021. We searched Embase, Medline and grey literature sources and mapped the number of studies that found differences and inequities by ethnic group and healthcare utilisation outcome. We summarised the distribution of studies across various methodological parameters. The majority of the 61 included studies (n=54, 89%) identified ethnic differences or inequities in paediatric healthcare utilisation, though inequities were examined in fewer than half of studies (n=27, 44%). These studies mostly focused on primary and preventive care, and depending on whether ethnicity data were aggregated or disaggregated, findings were sometimes conflicting. Emergency and outpatient care were understudied, as were health conditions besides mental health and infectious disease. Studies used a range of ethnicity classification systems and lacked the use of theoretical frameworks. Children's ethnicity was often the explanatory factor of interest while parent/caregiver ethnicity was largely overlooked. While the current evidence base can assist policy makers to identify inequities in paediatric healthcare utilisation among certain ethnic groups, we outline recommendations to improve the validity, generalisability and comparability of research to better understand and thereby act on ethnic inequities in paediatric healthcare.","Zhang, Quigley, Bankhead, Bentley, Otasowie, Carson","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-324577","20221107","child health; health services research; healthcare disparities; paediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40754,""
"Interventions to support the mental health and well-being of front-line healthcare workers in hospitals during pandemics: an evidence review and synthesis","Pandemics negatively impact healthcare workers' (HCW's) mental health and well-being causing additional feelings of anxiety, depression, moral distress and post-traumatic stress. A comprehensive review and evidence synthesis of HCW's mental health and well-being interventions through pandemics reporting mental health outcomes was conducted addressing two questions: (1) What mental health support interventions have been reported in recent pandemics, and have they been effective in improving the mental health and well-being of HCWs? (2) Have any mobile apps been designed and implemented to support HCWs' mental health and well-being during pandemics? A narrative evidence synthesis was conducted using Cochrane criteria for synthesising and presenting findings when systematic review and pooling data for statistical analysis are not suitable due to the heterogeneity of the studies. Evidence summary resources, bibliographic databases, grey literature sources, clinical trial registries and protocol registries were searched. Subject heading terms and keywords covering three key concepts were searched: SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (or similar infectious diseases) epidemics, health workforce and mental health support interventions. Searches were limited to English-language items published from 1 January 2000 to 14 June 2022. No publication-type limit was used. Two authors determined eligibility and extracted data from identified manuscripts. Data was synthesised into tables and refined by coauthors. 2694 studies were identified and 27 papers were included. Interventions were directed at individuals and/or organisations and most were COVID-19 focused. Interventions had some positive impacts on HCW's mental health and well-being, but variable study quality, low sample sizes and lack of control conditions were limitations.

"Understanding the mental health impact and needs of public healthcare professionals during COVID-19 in Pakistan : a qualitative study","A dearth of qualitative studies constrains in-depth understanding of health service providers' perspectives and experiences regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health. This study explored the mental health impact and needs of of public sector healthcare workers during COVID-19 who working in secondary-level and tertiary-level healthcare settings of Pakistan. An exploratory qualitative study. Twenty-five secondary-level and eight tertiary-level public hospitals of Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 health service providers and 40 administrative personnel. Study data were analysed on NVivo V.11 using the conventional content analysis technique. The study identified three overarching themes: (1) mental health impact of COVID-19 on health service providers that included the fear of acquiring the infection and transmitting it to their family members, fear of social isolation and stigma, anxiety related to the uncertainty of COVID-19, nervousness due to media exaggeration and stress associated with excessive workload; (2) mental health needs of health service providers involved in the COVID-19 crisis and available support from the healthcare system, including the expression of the need for counselling services and safe working conditions, the need for paid rest periods, and the need for appreciation and motivation to work in the pandemic; and (3) suggestions to address mental health needs of healthcare workers, including provision of specialised mental healthcare/services, formal training of health managers on managing mental health needs of health facility staff, and assessment and addressing of these needs of the health workforce. The study emphasises the need to strengthen health system preparedness for recognising and addressing the needs of healthcare professionals. At the system level, there is a need for a specialised unit to provide mental health services and better communication strategies. At the staff level, continuous motivation and appreciation should be given to healthcare professionals either through monetary incentives or formal acknowledgement of their performance.","Hameed, Feroz, Avan, Khan, Fatmi, Afzal, Jafri, Wassan, Siddiqi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061482","20221109","COVID-19; MENTAL HEALTH; PSYCHIATRY; Humans; COVID-19; Mental Health; Pakistan; Health Personnel; Qualitative Research; Delivery of Health Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40756,""
"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown stringency on loneliness in five European countries","The coronavirus pandemic has forced governments to implement a variety of different dynamic lockdown-stringency strategies in the last two years. Extensive lockdown periods could have potential unintended consequences on mental health, at least for at-risk groups. We present novel evidence on the heterogeneous direct and indirect effects of lockdown-stringency measures on individuals' perception of social isolation (i.e. loneliness) using panel data from five European countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Sweden), which tracks changes in both in-person and remote social interactions between May 2020 and March 2021. We combine data from the COME-HERE panel survey (University of Luxembourg) and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). We implement a dynamic mixture model in order to estimate the loneliness sub-population classes based on the severity of loneliness, as well as the evolution of social interactions. While loneliness is remarkably persistent over time, we find substantial heterogeneity across individuals, identifying four latent groups by loneliness severity. Group membership probability varies with age, gender, education and cohabitation status. Moreover, we note significant differences in the impact of social interactions on loneliness by degree of severity. Older people are less likely to feel lonely, but were more affected by lockdown measures, partly due to a reduction in face-to-face interactions. On the contrary, the younger, especially those living alone, report high levels of loneliness that are largely unaffected by changes in the pandemic after lockdown measures were initially implemented. Understanding the heterogeneity in loneliness is key for the identification of at-risk populations that can be severely affected by extended lockdown measures. As part of public-health crisis-response systems, it is critical to develop support measures for older individuals living alone, as well as promoting continuous remote communication for individuals more likely to experience high levels of loneliness.","Caro, Clark, D'Ambrosio, VÃƒÂ¶gele","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115492","20221107","Coronavirus; Europe; Isolation; Lockdown; Loneliness; Social interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40757,""
"Pandemic And Recession Effects On Mortality In The US During The First Year Of COVID-19","There were almost 700,000 excess deaths in the US from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, resulting from two often counterbalancing mechanisms: those predicted by changes in unemployment rates occurring during this period, referred to here as the ""recession effect,"" and those predicted by the ""pandemic effect,"" which reflects direct consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19, accompanying impacts on health and medical care, and other changes in mortality not caused by greater joblessness. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this study decomposed total mortality in this period into pandemic and recession effects, with additional estimates by sex, race and ethnicity, age, and fourteen causes. Although the pandemic effect increased many types of mortality, the recession effect reduced most types of mortality. Without the recession effect, there would have been nearly 40,000 more deaths than actually occurred. However, there were disparate impacts, particularly for external causes. Vehicular and alcohol-related fatalities and homicides rose because of strong pandemic effects. In contrast, the recession effect accounted for a greater share of the rise in drug mortality. Offsetting pandemic and recession effects resulted in a decrease in the number of suicides. Understanding these diverse impacts provides useful lessons for policy efforts to mitigate the current and future health pandemics.","Ruhm","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00364","20221109","Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Cause of Death; Suicide; Mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40758,""
"State Eviction Moratoriums During The COVID-19 Pandemic Were Associated With Improved Mental Health Among People Who Rent","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many US states implemented eviction moratoriums in 2020. Evidence from eviction filings from that year shows short-term declines in eviction filings. This study examined the short-term effects of these state eviction moratoriums in 2020 on the mental health status of renters. It employed nationally representative data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and a triple-difference design that compared renters with homeowners while leveraging state differences in moratoriums over time. During 2020 forty-three states and Washington, D.C., implemented eviction moratoriums of varying scope and enforcement. Some moratoriums targeted the whole eviction process, including early stages, whereas others focused on the later stages of eviction. We found that state moratoriums were associated with an improvement in mental health, including fewer days not in good mental health in the past thirty days and a lower likelihood of frequent mental distress (fourteen or more days not in good mental health in the past thirty days). Overall, there is some evidence from this study pointing to potential short-term benefits from state eviction moratoriums in 2020 to the mental health and well-being of renters, which would be important to consider when formulating policies that affect residential stability.","Ali, Wehby","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00750","20221109","Humans; Mental Health; Housing; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40759,""
"Easing Cash Assistance Rules During COVID-19 Was Associated With Reduced Days Of Poor Physical And Mental Health","Unemployment rates soared at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, increasing financial stress that can affect physical and mental health. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is the primary cash assistance program for low-income families in the US, with benefits conditional on work activities and subject to suspension. However, many states loosened requirements during the pandemic. Using TANF policy data and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from the period JanuaryÃ‚Â 2017-DecemberÃ‚Â 2020 with a triple-difference design, we found a general protective effect of supportive changes to TANF on poor physical and mental health days and binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic for likely TANF participants. For example, providing emergency cash benefits to those not already participating in TANF, waiving work requirements, waiving or pausing sanctions, and automatically recertifying benefits were associated with reductions in the number of mentally unhealthy days. This study provides support for increasing generosity and easing administrative burdens in safety-net programs to buffer against negative impacts of public health and economic crises.","Dore, Livingston Iii, Shafer","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00740","20221109","Humans; United States; Social Welfare; COVID-19; Mental Health; Pandemics; Unemployment; Public Assistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40760,""
"Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Pandemic-Era Unemployment Insurance Access: Implications For Health And Well-Being","Research demonstrates that receiving unemployment insurance decreases mental health problems. But researchers have also found racial and ethnic disparities in unemployment insurance receipt resulting from differences in work history and location. We examined a population disproportionately affected by job loss and unemployment insurance exclusions, using a survey of service workers from a single city who were parents of young children and who overwhelmingly had eligible work histories. During the COVID-19 pandemic, workers not identifying as White non-Hispanic in our sample were more likely to get laid off than White workers. Among those who were laid off, these workers and White workers experienced similar increases in material and mental health difficulties and similar gains when they received unemployment insurance. However, these workers were less likely than White workers to receive unemployment insurance at all. These results indicate that unemployment insurance has unrealized potential to reduce material and health disparities. Policies should be implemented to make this coverage more effective and equitable through increased access.","Ananat, Daniels, Fitz-Henley Ii, Gassman-Pines","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00741","20221109","Child; Humans; United States; Child, Preschool; Pandemics; Healthcare Disparities; Unemployment; COVID-19; Insurance, Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40761,""
"Effects of the Perceived Risk of Contracting COVID-19 on Nursing Students' Well-Being","Although mental health symptoms increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, little is known about the associations between nursing students' perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and their academic and psychological well-being. This study examined associations between perceived COVID-19 risk, likelihood of completing nursing education, and mental health factors of nursing students. A total of 979 nursing students completed self-report measures of perceived COVID-19 risk, anticipated academic completion, anxiety and depressive symptoms, stress, coping self-efficacy, hope, and social support. Students with higher perceived COVID-19 risk reported increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased likelihood of graduating, coping self-efficacy, and levels of social support. Findings indicate the need for increased mental health support for nursing students for successful completion of their programs.

"Use of a Rapid Qualitative Method to Inform the Development of a Text Messaging Intervention for People With Serious Mental Illness Who Smoke: Formative Research Study","People with serious mental illness are disproportionately affected by smoking and face barriers to accessing smoking cessation treatments in mental health treatment settings. Text-based interventions are cost-effective and represent a widely accessible approach to providing smoking cessation support. We aimed to identify key factors for adapting text-based cessation interventions for people with serious mental illness who smoke. We recruited 24 adults from mental health programs who had a serious mental illness and currently smoked cigarettes or had quit smoking within the past 5 years. We then conducted virtual qualitative interviews between November 2020 and August 2021. Data were analyzed using the rapid thematic analytic approach. We identified the following 3 major themes: (1) interplay between smoking and having a serious mental illness, (2) social contextual factors of smoking in adults with serious mental illness, and (3) smoking and quitting behaviors similar to the general population. Participants reported barriers and facilitators to quitting across the 3 themes. Within the ""interplay between smoking and having a serious mental illness"" theme, barriers included smoking to manage stress and mental health symptoms, and facilitators to quitting included the awareness of the harm of smoking on mental health and patient-provider discussions on smoking and mental health. In the ""social contextual factors of smoking in adults with serious mental illness"" theme, barriers included high social acceptability of smoking among peers. Positive support and the combined social stigma of smoking and having a mental health condition outside of peer groups motivated individuals to quit. Some participants indicated that low exposure to other smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic helped them to engage in cessation efforts. In the ""smoking and quitting behaviors similar to the general population"" theme, barriers included smoking after eating, having coffee, drinking alcohol, and experiencing negative social support, and facilitators included health concerns, improvement in the general quality of life, and use of evidence-based tobacco treatments when available. People with serious mental illness often smoke to cope with intense emotional states, manage mental health symptoms, or maintain social bonds. Text message content emphasizing equally effective and less harmful ways for stress reduction and mental health symptom management may improve quit rates in individuals with serious mental illness.","Nagawa, Lane, McKay, Kamberi, Shenette, Kelly, Davis, Sadasivam","https://doi.org/10.2196/40907","20221108","COVID-19; intervention; mental disorder; mental health; pandemic; psychiatric disorder; serious mental illness; smoking; smoking cessation; symptom; text messaging; tobacco use; virtual","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40763,""
"Association of the COVID-19 Pandemic With Adolescent and Young Adult Eating Disorder Care Volume","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected youth mental health. Increases in site-specific eating disorder (ED) care have been documented; however, multisite studies demonstrating national trends are lacking. To compare the number of adolescent/young adult patients seeking inpatient and outpatient ED care before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an observational case series design, changes in volume in inpatient and outpatient ED-related care across 15 member sites (14 geographically diverse hospital-based adolescent medicine programs and 1 nonhospital-based ED program) of the US National Eating Disorder Quality Improvement Collaborative was examined. Sites reported monthly volumes of patients seeking inpatient and outpatient ED care between January 2018 and December 2021. Patient volumes pre- and postpandemic onset were compared separately for inpatient and outpatient settings. Demographic data such as race and ethnicity were not collected because this study used monthly summary data. Onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly number of patients seeking inpatient/outpatient ED-related care. Aggregate total inpatient ED admissions were 81 in January 2018 and 109 in February 2020. Aggregate total new outpatient assessments were 195 in January 2018 and 254 in February 2020. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative number of pooled inpatient ED admissions were increasing over time by 0.7% per month (95% CI, 0.2%-1.3%). After onset of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in admissions over time of 7.2% per month (95% CI, 4.8%-9.7%) through April 2021, then a decrease of 3.6% per month (95% CI, -6.0% to -1.1%) through December 2021. Prepandemic, pooled data showed relative outpatient ED assessment volume was stable over time, with an immediate 39.7% decline (95% CI, -50.4% to -26.7%) in April 2020. Subsequently, new assessments increased by 8.1% (95% CI, 5.3%-11.1%) per month through April 2021, then decreased by 1.5% per month (95% CI, -3.6% to 0.7%) through December 2021. The nonhospital-based ED program did not demonstrate a significant increase in the absolute number of admissions after onset of the pandemic but did see a significant increase of 8.2 (95% CI, 6.2-10.2) additional inquiries for care per month in the first year after onset of the pandemic. In this study, there was a significant COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in both inpatient and outpatient volume of patients with EDs across sites, particularly in the first year of the pandemic. Given inadequate ED care availability prior to the pandemic, the increased postpandemic demand will likely outstrip available resources. Results highlight the need to address ED workforce and program capacity issues as well as improve ED prevention strategies.","Hartman-Munick, Lin, Milliren, Braverman, Brigham, Fisher, Golden, Jary, Lemly, Matthews, Ornstein, Roche, Rome, Rosen, Sharma, Shook, Taylor, Thew, Vo, Voss, Woods, Forman, Richmond","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2022.4346","20221107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40764,""

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, and they have a certain correlation in some aspects. Particularly, the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulation state play an important role in the underlying mechanism linking COVID-19 to DKD. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor is considered a potential therapy for COVID-19 and has similarly shown organ protection in DKD. In addition, neuropilin-1 as an alternative pathway for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 also contributes to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 entering the host cells, and its decreased expression can affect podocyte migration and adhesion. Here, we review the pathogenesis and current evidence of the interaction of DKD and COVID-19, as well as focus on elevated blood glucose following vaccination and its possible mechanism.

"The effects of medicaid expansion on job loss induced mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US","The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented level of job losses in the U.S., where job loss is also associated with the loss of health insurance. This paper uses data from the 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and difference-in-difference (DD) regressions to estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on anxiety and depression associated with job loss. Estimates show that the respondents who live in expansion states are 96.6% <i>more</i> likely to have Medicaid coverage, and 14.2% <i>less</i> likely to have moderate to severe mental distress following their job loss compared to those living in non-expansion states. The corresponding numbers associated with a family member's job loss are 36.3% and 7.6%, respectively. Next, we explore the mechanisms which suggest that the economic security provided by Medicaid is as important (if not more) as the access to or utilization of healthcare.

Participants were 247 Hong Kong university students (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.96, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.38; femaleÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°86%) who completed survey measures of mindfulness, positive and negative affect, and positive coping strategies at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Data were analysed using a cross-lagged panel design, controlling for participants' age. The proposed reciprocal model exhibited an excellent fit with the data. There was a reciprocal association between trait mindfulness and positive affect over time. However, no significant reciprocal effect was found among mindfulness, negative affect, and positive coping strategies. Theoretically, the current findings extended the two theories to a non-Western population during a critical time and suggested a long-term reciprocal association between positive affect and mindfulness. Our study provided important insight into university students' positive well-being during COVID-19 and demonstrated the wellness-fostering effect of mindfulness.","Lee, Sun, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-022-02014-2","20221108","Broaden-and-build theory; Coping strategies; Emotional well-being; Mental health; Positive psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40770,""
"The Role of Self-Compassion on Psychological Well-Being and Life Satisfaction of Vietnamese Undergraduate Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Hope as a Mediator","The simultaneous occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to adulthood have posed particular obstacles to university students' mental health. However, it remains unclear whether hope promotes mental health in the relationship between self-compassion, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction. Therefore, this study investigated the role of hope as a mediator in the relationship between self-compassion, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction among Vietnamese undergraduate students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants consisted of 484 students (aged 18-24) from several universities in Vietnam. To measure the four variables in the research model, we opted for the Self-Compassion Scale, the State Hope Scale, the World Health Organization 5-item Well-Being Index, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. The results showed that (1) self-compassion was significantly positively correlated with psychological well-being, (2) self-compassion was not correlated with life satisfaction, (3) hope was a mediator of the relationship between self-compassion and psychological well-being, and (4) hope was a mediator of the relationship between self-compassion and life satisfaction. These findings suggest interventions on self-compassion to enhance hope and subsequently increase students' mental health, which offers colleges, psychologists, and psychiatrists a guideline to cope with harmful psychological implications during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tran, Khoury, Chau, Van Pham, Dang, Ngo, Ngo, Truong, Le Dao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-022-00487-7","20221108","COVID-19; Hope; Life satisfaction; Psychological well-being; Self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40771,""
"Iranian older adults women: The Impact of COVID-19 and Coping Strategies","In the field of epidemics, some vulnerable groups, such as older adults, are at greater risk. Many psychological, social, economic and physical hazards have threatened older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some threats can be managed with medical system interventions. However, social and psychological challenges cannot be controlled quickly. People will have a better quality of life if they can take appropriate action in critical situations. There is a strong theoretical and empirical background that a sense of control and self-efficacy can promote psychological well-being. The main questions of this study included the following: What were the main problems experienced by older Iranian women during the outbreak of COVID-19? What coping methods did they use to control the situation? What were their views on the future? This research was conducted in Kerman city, the capital of Kerman Province. A phenomenological method was used. We interviewed 15 women over 65Ã‚Â years old. We extracted five main themes from the interviews. These themes were health issues, persistent anxiety, economic and social pressures, identifying unique solutions to the current situation, and optimism versus pessimism: what is the future? From the participants' point of view, psychological, social and physical problems have disturbed them during the pandemic, especially at the beginning. However, they controlled their problems by using selective coping strategies. In Iran, planners can use the potential of the two institutions of family and religion to reduce the problems of older adults.","Garousi, Amirkafi, Mohammadi, Garrusi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-022-01551-1","20221108","COVID-19; Coping strategies; Iran; Older adults; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40772,""

"Mental health status of doctors and nurses in a Nigerian tertiary hospital: A COVID-19 experience","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) working to save lives during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are under tremendous physical and psychological pressure, therefore facing the risk of developing challenges with mental health. This study aimed primarily to determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress among HCPs in a tertiary hospital in Lagos State during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted between June and July 2021 among 1452 doctors and nurses in LASUTH, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria, selected by the multistage sampling method. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Perceived Stress Scale, respectively. The majority of respondents were female (72.5%), with two-thirds being nurses. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 9.8%, 5.0% and 62.4%, respectively. Nurses showed a higher prevalence of these mental health conditions as compared with doctors. Younger HCPs, nurses, those that lost a colleague to COVID-19, and those whose family members were infected with COVID-19 were more likely to be depressed. Nurses and those afraid of being infected were more likely to experience anxiety. Younger HCPs, nurses, history of anxiety and/or depression and previous COVID-19 infection were identified as factors associated with stress. Stress was the most prevalent mental health condition with nurses being the most affected of the HCPs and at a greater risk of developing challenges with mental health. Psychosocial interventions and stress management techniques are recommended to minimise the risks. This study adds to the few studies on the mental health of HCPs during COVID-19 and calls for in-depth surveys to understand psychosocial challenges among HCPs in Nigeria.","Olude, Odeyemi, Kanma-Okafor, Badru, Bashir, Olusegun, Atilola","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v28i0.1904","20221108","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare professional; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40774,""
"Insomnia and Related Factors During the Delta Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Kingdom of Bahrain: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study aims to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and related risk factors during the Delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Bahrain. An analytical cross-sectional study included 646 individuals from the general population aged 18 years and over, living in the Kingdom of Bahrain during the Delta wave of the pandemic. Data were collected by an anonymous online questionnaire using the snowball-sampling technique between June and August 2021. We used the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) to measure the level of insomnia and anxiety, respectively. A total of 646 individuals participated in the study. Most of the participants were females (86%). The mean age was 38.7 Ã‚Â± 12.7 years (age range 18-89) and around half of the participants were 35 years or older. Clinical insomnia was reported by 20% [95% CI, 16.9-20.0] of the participants, and 50.1% [95% CI, 46.2-50.1] had subclinical insomnia according to ISI. The proportion of insomnia was significantly higher among females, healthcare workers, participants with lower educational levels, a lower or decreased monthly income during the pandemic, or participants who reported anxiety symptoms (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Scales of anxiety and insomnia revealed a high correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.347, <i>P</i>&lt; 0.01). The logistic regression model confirmed that factors independently associated with insomnia are female gender (OR=1.94, 95% CI, 1.00-3.76, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.050) as well as presence of anxiety (GAD-7 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5) [OR=12.98, 95% CI, 5.61-30.00, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001]. The burden of insomnia was significant among the general population in the Kingdom of Bahrain during the Delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic despite the low severity of this variant.

"Adolescent Mental Health Priorities During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Increasing evidence has shown that the Covid-19 outbreak has impacted adolescents' mental health. Utilising a mixed-method design, the current study examined a total of 518 adolescent perspectives (60% female), in Scotland, on what <i>has</i> and <i>could</i> help their mental health in the context of Covid-19. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed three themes in relation to what <i>has</i> helped adolescents' mental health since the Covid-19 outbreak. These related to findings about the value of: (1) engaging in recreational activities, (2) engaging with friends, and (3) the disruption to schooling. The remaining four themes related to what could have helped adolescents mental health and wellbeing since the Covid-19 outbreak. These focussed on (1) better support: in relation to mental health; school work; and communication, (2) contact with friends, and (3) more opportunities for recreational activities. Males were more likely to report recreational activities <i>had</i> helped and less likely to report better support <i>could</i> have helped. Adolescents who reached clinical threshold for depression and anxiety and those with elevated PTSD-like symptoms about Covid-19 were more likely to state more support <i>could</i> have helped, and adolescents who reached clinical threshold for depression were <i>less</i> likely to report that friends could have helped their mental health.

"Trajectories and predictors of vicarious traumatization in Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","This longitudinal study aimed to identify the trajectories and the predictors among sociodemographic and psychosocial variables at baseline of vicarious traumatization (VT) in Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 544 Chinese college students enrolled in a public University in central China, majored in Clinical Medicine, Nursing, Musicology, Physics, etc., participated in this longitudinal study lasting 19 months. Three-wave (wave 1: February 2020; wave 2: November 2020; wave 3: September 2021) of data were collected. Resourcefulness Scale and the 10-item Kessler scale (K10) were only assessed in the first-wave survey, and the Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was repeatedly measured in all three-wave surveys. A link to an online survey created by Questionnaire Star (https://www.wjx.cn/) was sent to the students to collect data. The Growth mixture modeling (GMM) and multiple logistic regression were used to identify the trajectories of VT and predictors for the distinct trajectories. The incidence of VT at each wave varied from 9.9% at wave 1, 4.0% at wave 2, to 2.6% at wave 3. Three trajectories of VT were the medium-level escalating group (3.0%), medium-level maintaining group (32.3%), and the low-level descending group (64.7%). Seniors (OR = 1.575, 95% CI: 1.059-2.341; OR = 1.161, 95% CI: 1.043-1.293) and those with poor mental health status (OR = 1.101, 95% CI: 1.030-1.177; OR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.060-1.106) at baseline were more likely to be classified into the medium-level escalating group and medium-level maintaining group, respectively. Additionally, females (OR = 3.601, 95% CI: 1.311-9.887) were more likely to be included in the medium-level escalating group.

"Psychological distress and digital health service use during COVID-19: A national Australian cross-sectional survey","Previous research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to the lives and mental health of Australians. In response, health services adapted rapidly to digital modes of treatment, prevention and care. Although a large amount of research emerged in the first year of the pandemic, the longer-term mental health impacts, contributing factors, and population-level utilization of digital health services are unknown. A population-based online survey of 5,100 Australians adults was conducted in October 2021. Psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale. Additional survey questions included use and satisfaction with digital health services. Where available, data were compared with our previous survey conducted in 2018, permitting an examination of pre- and post-pandemic digital health service utilization. In 2021, almost a quarter (<i>n</i> = 1203, 23.6%) of respondents reported serious levels of psychological distress; participants with pre-existing health related conditions, of younger age, lower educational attainment, those who lost their job or were paid fewer hours, or living in states with lockdown policies in place were at highest risk of serious psychological distress. Almost half of all respondents (<i>n</i> = 2177, 42.7%) reported using digital health technologies in 2021, in contrast to just 10.0% in 2018. In 2021, respondents with serious psychological distress were significantly more likely to consult with a healthcare professional via telephone/videoconferencing (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), access healthcare via a telephone advice line (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), or via an email or webchat advice service (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) than those with no serious psychological distress. Those with and without psychological distress were highly satisfied with the care they received via digital health technologies in 2021. Rates of serious psychological distress during the second year of the pandemic remained high, providing further evidence for the serious impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general population. Those with psychological distress accessed digital mental health services and were satisfied with the care they received. The results highlight the continued need for mental health support and digital health services, particularly for people living with chronic conditions, younger adults and people most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the short term and beyond.","Ellis, Dammery, Wells, Ansell, Smith, Tran, Braithwaite, Zurynski","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1028384","20221108","COVID-19 pandemic; digital health; mental health; psychological distress; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40780,""

"Evaluation of burnout among stay-behind healthcare workers during the current Omicron wave of COVID-19 in Taizhou, China","Since February 2022, a new Omicron wave of COVID-19 emerged in Shanghai, China. Many healthcare workers came to Shanghai from hospitals of other parts of China as aid workers. Hospitals in areas with mild COVID-19 outbreaks will inevitably be understaffed, it is likely to cause job burnout of stay-behind healthcare workers. Stay-behind healthcare workers were those who had not been dispatched to support COVID-19 prevention and control in other regions. This study was designed to evaluate the burnout among stay-behind healthcare workers in the current COVID-19 Omicron wave in Taizhou, China. A population-based, anonymous, cross-sectional online survey was designed in the Wen-Juan Xing platform. The survey was sent to all stay-behind healthcare workers of the hospital (<i>n</i> = 1739) from April 29 to May 3, 2022. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) was used for the burnout survey. For univariate analysis, the Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test and one way ANOVA were used to assess differences in categorical variables and continuous variables, respectively. The effect of independent associated risk factors on each type of burnout was examined using the multinomial logistic regression model. A total of 434 participants completed the survey invitation effectively. A total of 71.2% of stay-behind healthcare workers experienced burnout during COVID-19, including 54.8% experiencing mild to moderate burnout and 16.4% experiencing severe burnout. Night shift, depression, social support, positive coping and number of children appeared to be significantly related to mild to moderate burnout. Night shift, depression, social support, positive coping, number of children, professional title, and anxiety appeared to be significantly related to severe burnout. Job burnout among stay-behind healthcare workers was an important problem during the current Omicron wave of COVID-19.

"Knowledge, attitude, and practice related to COVID-19: A comparison between patients with mental illness and the general population in Qatar","In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health pandemic. The rapid spread and high fatalities associated with COVID-19 have increased interest in assessing Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) toward this illness among the general population in comparison to specific subgroups. Most publications to date have explored KAP among the general public, healthcare providers, and people with chronic conditions, but not amongst those with mental illness. Yet, research has shown patients with mental illness are at higher risk of poor outcomes related to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The objective of this study is to compare KAP toward COVID-19 between people with mental illness and the general public. This is a cross-sectional study, done over 3<sup>Ã‚Â°</sup>months in 2020, to compare KAP during the COVID-19 pandemic in three groups: outpatients from outpatient Psychiatry clinics (<i>N</i> = 165), inpatients admitted to a Psychiatry ward (<i>N</i> = 100), and the general public (<i>N</i> = 345). KAP parameters were assessed through online surveys. The proportion of subjects in the public group (84.8%) giving the correct responses to most Knowledge questions was significantly higher than those in the inpatient and outpatient groups. Compared to the public and inpatient groups, subjects in the outpatient group (92.7%) were significantly more optimistic and confident that COVID-19 would be brought under control. A higher proportion of subjects from the general public (82.9%) indicated that they attended crowded places and were more compliant in wearing masks. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that poorer COVID-19 knowledge was associated with being single and having a young age (18-29), with both inpatients and outpatients and with primary-or secondary-level education. Patient populations, both inpatients and outpatients, had inadequate Knowledge, more positive attitudes and confidence regarding the outcome of COVID-19, and less safe practices than the public. This highlights the need for targeted approaches around COVID-19 and pandemics in general in this vulnerable population.","Ghuloum, Makki, Eltorki, Abdallah, Alanzy, Khoodoruth, Ali, Al-Amin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1013096","20221108","COVID-19; KAP; mental health; patients; public","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40783,""
"Symptoms of mental illness among university student-athletes during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown disrupted the university sports season and had negative consequences on the academic and personal life of university student-athletes, resulting in several psychological challenges. The goal of this study is to document the symptoms of mental illness among university student-athletes during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Canada. It aims to (a) assess the prevalence of mental illness symptoms (anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and dangerous drinking) among university student-athletes and (b) identify which sociodemographic and sports characteristics, pandemic impacts, and levels of perceived stress most influence these symptoms. A total of 424 university student-athletes completed an online survey, which included questions on mental illness and the impact of the pandemic lockdown. The results revealed a notable prevalence of the symptoms of mental illness; depressive symptoms are reported by 37.9% of the participants, anxiety symptoms by 24.9%, dangerous drinking symptoms by 10.1%, and disordered eating by 8.6%. In addition, being female [OR = 0.56, 95% CI (0.33, 0.95)] or a member of a visible minority group [OR = 2.63, 95% CI (1.02, 6.78)] are significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. Low academic motivation has a significant negative influence on the presence of depressive [OR = 3.37, 95% CI (1.82, 6.25)] and anxiety symptoms [OR = 2.75, 95% CI (1.35, 5.62)].

"COVID-19 and Perinatal Stress Experience - a Study Conducted as Part of the COVGEN Initiative","<b>Introduction</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and anxiety in the population increased due to concerns about people's own health and that of their relatives, as well as changes in everyday life due to measures taken to reduce the infection rate. Pregnant women are particularly stressed. The present study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the stress experience and mental health of pregnant women and mothers of newborns and how care could be optimized. <b>Methods</b> As part of the international COVGEN initiative ( https://www.covgen.org ) to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the peripartum period, pregnant and postpartum women were asked about their experience with stress using the COPE-IS (Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences - Impact Survey) questionnaire developed for this purpose and translated from the English. In addition, demographic data, pre-existing diseases, pregnancy complications and the care situation were recorded. The questionnaire was either administered as hardcopy to inpatients at the Department of Women's Health, University Hospital TÃƒÂ¼bingen, Germany, or online. All pregnant women and mothers who were pregnant or had given birth after the official start of the COVID-19 pandemic (11 March 2020) were eligible to participate. <b>Results</b> Complete data sets of nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 156 pregnant women and nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 221 postpartum women were available for evaluation. The general stress level assessed with the COPE-IS was significantly increased by the COVID-19 pandemic in both, pregnant and postpartum women, with pre-existing conditions such as respiratory diseases and pregnancy-related diseases like gestational diabetes adding to the stress. The subjectively perceived quality of care/support during pregnancy also influenced the stress level. <b>Conclusions</b> Fears of a COVID-19 infection and changes in preventive and aftercare services were a burden for the women surveyed. Intensified care during pregnancy and puerperium could help to stabilize the mental situation and reduce stress.","Kentschke, Bauer, Moser, Schleger, Hahn, Pauluschke-FrÃƒÂ¶hlich, Jakubowski, Abele, Preissl, Hartkopf","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1909-0451","20221108","COVID-19 pandemic; corona; postpartum; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40785,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Campus-Based Support Programs Serving Students with Foster Care Experience: Focus Groups with Administrators and Students","The onset of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced higher education institutions to abruptly transition to remote services and online learning. Students with a foster care background are a subgroup of students who have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, as were the campus-based programs (CSPs) designed to support them. The purpose of this study was to learn about the impact of the pandemic on CSPs and CSP participants. Focus groups were conducted with CSP administrators and separately with CSP students from two- and four-year colleges in California. The first theme that emerged from the data focused on challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, with six subthemes zeroing in on breaks in social connections, academic disruptions, technology woes, gaps in basic needs, employment challenges, and the toll on mental health. The second theme described participants' responses, including their creative and collaborative actions. Administrators quickly adapted service delivery, formed partnerships with new units and organizations to ensure students' needs were met, and found creative ways to stay connected with students during a time of pervasive isolation. Students talked about their own efforts to access resources, connect with peers, and use of strategies to manage challenges such as burnout and depression. A second subtheme highlighted the ways participants displayed resilience, such as creating boundaries to manage their own self-care and leaning on each other for support. The findings from this study increase our understanding of the experiences students faced during the pandemic and shed light on implications moving forward to support students with foster care histories in higher education.","Lopez, Geiger, Okpych, Gamez, Larregui","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106696","20221108","COVID-19; Campus-based support programs; College; Foster care; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40786,""
"Adjunctive Pimavanserin in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: Combined Results from Two Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies","In a phase 2 study, pimavanserin demonstrated efficacy as adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Subsequently, two phase 3 studies (NCT03968159 in the US; NCT03999918 in Europe) were initiated to examine the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin in subjects with MDD and inadequate response to antidepressant treatment. Studies were combined with a prespecified statistical analysis plan owing to recruitment challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The randomized, double-blind studies enrolled 298 patients with MDD and inadequate response to current antidepressants. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to pimavanserin or placebo added to current antidepressant for 6 weeks. Primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 5 in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item version (HAM-D-17). There was no effect of pimavanserin in change from baseline to week 5 in the HAM-D-17 (pimavanserin [n = 138]: least-squares mean [LSM] [standard error {SE}], -9.0 [0.58]; placebo [n = 135]: -8.1 [0.58]; mixed-effects model for repeated measures LSM [SE] difference, -0.9 [0.82], <i>P</i> = 0.2956).

"Mental health and chest CT scores mediate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination status and seroconversion time: A cross-sectional observational study in B16172 (Delta) infection patients","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years, has become one of the largest public health issues. Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the most important interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective is to investigate the relationship between vaccination status and time to seroconversion. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study during the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 outbreak in Jiangsu, China. Participants who infected with the B.1.617.2 variant were enrolled. Cognitive performance, quality of life, emotional state, chest computed tomography (CT) score and seroconversion time were evaluated for each participant. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA, univariate and multivariate regression analyses, Pearson correlation, and mediation analysis. A total of 91 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 37.3, 25.3, and 37.3% were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively. Quality of life was impaired in 30.7% of patients, especially for mental component summary (MCS) score. Vaccination status, subjective cognitive decline, and depression were risk factors for quality-of-life impairment. The chest CT score mediated the relationship of vaccination status with the MCS score, and the MCS score mediated the relationship of the chest CT score with time to seroconversion. Full immunization course with an inactivated vaccine effectively lowered the chest CT score and improved quality of life in hospitalized patients. Vaccination status could influence time to seroconversion by affecting CT score and MCS score indirectly. Our study emphasizes the importance of continuous efforts in encouraging a full vaccination course.","Zhang, Chen, Dai, Lu, Li, Yi, Fu, Li, Liu, Liufu, Long, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.974848","20221108","B.1.617.2 Delta variant; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; seroconversion time; vaccination; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; COVID-19 Vaccines; Seroconversion; COVID-19; Mental Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality of Life; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40788,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and GAD: The role of risk perception and vaccination status","As Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread around the world, COVID-19 vaccines are the most effective weapons against the global pandemic. Yet vaccine hesitancy remains a serious problem and can pose certain hazards to individuals' mental health, such as rising anxiety. Therefore, based on Self-Discrepancy Theory, this paper aims to explore the role of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy on individual generalized anxiety disorder and its influence mechanisms through two studies. Study one involved 654 Chinese participants using the Vaccine Hesitancy Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. In Study two, the Vaccine Hesitation Questionnaire, GAD-7 scale, Perceived Risk of COVID-19 pandemic scale, and Vaccination Status Questionnaire were used and data from 3,282 Chinese residents was collected. Vaccine hesitancy directly increases generalized anxiety disorder; risk perception plays a partial mediating role between vaccine hesitancy and generalized anxiety disorder; vaccination status moderated vaccine hesitancy's effect on risk perception and generalized anxiety disorder. Vaccine hesitancy predicts generalized anxiety disorder through risk perception, but the mediating role of risk perception is moderated by vaccination status, which means that for the vaccinated group when their vaccine hesitancy is reduced, it will be easier to reduce the risk perception and thus the generalized anxiety disorder.","Wang, Zhong, Fu, He, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.994330","20221108","COVID-19; generalized anxiety disorder; risk perception; vaccination status; vaccine hesitancy; Humans; COVID-19 Vaccines; Vaccination Hesitancy; Pandemics; COVID-19; Vaccination; Vaccines; Anxiety Disorders; Perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40789,""
"A qualitative study of nursing practitioners' experiences with COVID-19 patients dying alone in Greece","In Greece, there is still limited research on death in isolation due to COVID-19. This deserves attention because of the recent financial crisis, which profoundly impacted public health, and the high relevance of the Hippocratic tradition to the moral values of clinical practice. A prospective qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 15 frontline nursing practitioners working in a COVID-19 ward or intensive care unit (ICU) was conducted from July 2021 to December 2021. The inability of family members to say a final goodbye before, during, or after death by performing proper mourning rituals is extremely inhuman and profoundly impacts the mental health status of patients, family members, and nursing practitioners. Patients and their family members strongly desire to see each other. Epidemiology, liability, and proper nursing performance emerged as reasons for the enforced strict visitation restrictions. Participants emphasized that visitations should be allowed on an individual basis and highlighted the need for the effective use of remote communication technology, which, however, does not substitute for in-person contact. Importantly, physicians allowed ""clandestine"" visits on an individual basis. Nursing practitioners had a strong empathic attitude toward both patients and their families, and a strong willingness to provide holistic care and pay respect to dead bodies. However, they also experienced moral distress. Witnessing heartbreaking scenes with patients and/or their families causes nursing practitioners to experience intense psychological distress, which affects their family life rather than nursing performance. Ultimately, there was a shift from a patient-centered care model to a population-centered care model. Furthermore, we identified a range of policy- and culture-related factors that exaggerate the negative consequences of dying alone of COVID-19. These results reinforce the existing literature on several fronts. However, we identified some nuances related to political decisions and, most importantly, convictions that are deeply rooted in Greek culture. These findings are of great importance in planning tailored interventions to mitigate the problem of interest and have implications for other similar national contexts.","Voultsos, Tsompanian, Deligianni, Tsamadou, Tsaroucha","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.981780","20221108","COVID-19 pandemic; death in isolation; dying alone; hospitalized COVID-19 patients; nursing practitioners/professionals; Humans; COVID-19; Greece; Prospective Studies; Qualitative Research; Family","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40790,""
"Association of everyday discrimination with health outcomes among Asian and non-Asian US older adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Increases in anti-Asian COVID-19 related discriminatory behaviors have been observed, many of which targeted older adults. Studies demonstrate that racial discrimination is associated with worse health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. No previous studies have examined the impact of day-to-day experiences of discrimination before and during COVID-19 on both Asian and non-Asian older adults within the same sample. We examined whether everyday discrimination was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, decreased levels of functioning, and increased sleep difficulties among Asian and non-Asian US older adults before and during the pandemic. Data came from the Positive Minds-Strong Bodies randomized clinical trial, an evidence-based mental health and disability prevention intervention for racially and ethnically diverse older adults with elevated depression or anxiety symptoms and minor to moderate disability. We conducted secondary data analyses in a cohort of 165 older adults (56 Asian and 109 non-Asian) assessed before COVID-19 (May 2015-May 2018) and during COVID-19 (March 2021-July 2022). Regression models examined whether everyday discrimination impacted health outcomes differently before and during COVID-19, and whether this effect was stronger among Asian compared to non-Asian older adults. Non-Asian older adults reported the same levels of everyday discrimination before and during COVID-19. Consistent with literature suggesting that social distancing has inadvertently kept US Asian populations from experiencing discrimination, Asian older adults reported marginally lower levels of everyday discrimination during the pandemic compared with pre-pandemic. We found that everyday discrimination was not associated with health outcomes before COVID-19. In contrast, during the pandemic, everyday discrimination was associated with worse anxiety and depression symptoms and worse levels of functioning, although only the impact on depression was significantly stronger compared with before the pandemic. This negative impact of everyday discrimination on health outcomes during the pandemic appeared to affect both Asian and non-Asian older adults similarly. Social support and social cohesion buffered against the negative effect of everyday discrimination on depression and level of functioning during the pandemic. Results suggest that public health interventions aimed at reducing everyday discrimination and emphasizing social support and cohesion can potentially improve health outcomes for all US older adult populations. www.ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier: NCT02317432.","Zhang, Cruz-Gonzalez, Lin, Ouyang, Zhao, AlegrÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.953155","20221108","Asian and non-Asian older adults; COVID-19; depression and anxiety symptoms; everyday discrimination; level of functioning; sleep quality; Humans; Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Depression; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Outcome Assessment, Health Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40791,""
"Health-related quality of life in persons post-COVID-19 infection in comparison to normative controls and chronic pain patients","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted a tremendous pressure on the healthcare system, people's social life, mental health and financial status with profound implications for the general population. The exact impact of the pandemic on the overall physical, mental and social wellbeing of COVID-19 infection survivors on the long term has not yet been explored in a thorough way. Based on the reporting of persistent pain, fatigue and dyspnea symptoms by these survivors, it is our hypothesis that their quality of life will be extremely impacted, as is observed in patients with chronic pain. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to perform an in-depth evaluation of the quality of life of post-COVID-19 infected persons. The second aim was to compare the quality of life of these persons with a normative population and with patients with chronic pain. Health-related quality of life, as a measure for a person's overall physical, mental, and social wellbeing, was measured with the 3-level EQ5D in 547 post-COVID-19 infected persons. These data were compared to reference data from normal population records for Belgium and to data from patients with chronic pain after spinal surgery with two-way analyses of variance. In total, 89.58% of the post-COVID-19 infected persons reported pain/discomfort and 82.45% indicated limitations when performing usual activities, when evaluated 287 days (SD: 150) after the infection. Self-care was preserved in most post-COVID-19 persons, whereby only 13.16% indicated problems. The mean EQ5D-3L index score was 0.57 (SD: 0.23) and EQ5D VAS mean score was 56.6 (SD: 18.2). The mean index score for the normative population was significantly higher than for COVID-19 infected persons [mean difference of 0.31 (95% from 0.29 to 0.33), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01] while the mean score of chronic pain patients was significantly lower than the score of COVID-19 infected persons [mean difference of -0.31 (95% from -0.29 to -0.33), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01]. Compared to age-and sex adjusted reference data, health-related quality of life of persons with long COVID is severely impacted.

"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health, daily and occupational activities of pediatric otolaryngologists in Latin America","Otolaryngologists have a higher risk of physical/psychological problems due to their frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2. There is no information about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of these specialists in low/middle-income countries from Latin America.

"""What support?"": A qualitative study on social support for Asian American victims of racism during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-Asian racism has surged, yet little is known about Asian Americans' experiences of social support. Therefore, we designed a qualitative, intrinsic, revelatory case study to examine the nature and quality of social support for Asian Americans during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Our sample consisted of 193 Asian Americans (from over 32 U.S. states) disclosing their experiences of inadequate social support. They described their support network as (1) Being unable to relate, (2) Encouraging their silence, (3) Minimizing anti-Asian racism, (4) Denying anti-Asian racism, and (5) Victim-blaming. Regarding our participants' recommendations for increasing social support for Asian Americans, a total of seven recommendations emerged: (1) Legitimize anti-Asian racism, (2) Teach Asian American history, (3) Destigmatize mental health resources to make them accessible for Asian American families (4) Promote bystander intervention trainings, (5) Build solidarity with and beyond Asian Americans to dismantle racism, (6) Increase media attention on anti-Asian racism, and (7) Elect political leaders who will advocate for Asian Americans. Altogether, our findings underscore the need for systemic forms of advocacy to combat anti-Asian racism, and shed light on the injurious nature of social support for Asian American victims of racism.","Wang, Santos","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.961215","20221108","Asian American; COVID-19; anti-Asian racism; qualitative research; social support; Humans; Asian Americans; Racism; Pandemics; COVID-19; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40794,""
"Disaggregating the data: Diversity of COVID-19 stressors, discrimination, and mental health among Asian American communities","Much of the public discourse as well as research regarding the negative impact of COVID-19-related anti-Asian discrimination has been conducted at the broad racial group level, yet data aggregation masks critical points of diversity among Asian Americans. We conducted an online survey of 620 Asian American adults in December 2020 and examined whether there were any demographic differences-including by ethnic subgroup and Chinese street race (being Chinese or being mistaken as Chinese)-in their experiences of COVID-19-related stress, direct and vicarious discrimination, and psychological outcomes. Our analyses found that younger age was correlated with higher reports of pandemic stress, discrimination, distress, and worry. Female and U.S.-born participants reported higher levels of pandemic stress and vicarious discrimination, but there were no gender or nativity differences in levels of direct discrimination. Being uninsured was also related to higher levels of pandemic stress, discrimination, and distress. East Asian Americans reported significantly lower frequencies of direct anti-Asian discrimination than did South Asian or Southeast Asian Americans, but the ethnic subgroups did not differ in their reports of vicarious discrimination. Of note, Chinese street race was not associated with either direct or vicarious discrimination. Separate hierarchical regression analyses for East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian participants revealed that, regardless of ethnicity, racial discrimination significantly contributed to psychological distress and worry beyond the effects of pandemic stress. However, the three groups varied in the demographic indicators and COVID-19 stressors that were associated with psychological outcomes. Pandemic stress was more strongly associated with negative outcomes among South Asian Americans than East Asian and Southeast Asian Americans, and neither direct nor vicarious discrimination were associated with mental health among South Asian Americans. Direct discrimination, compared to vicarious discrimination, was a particularly robust predictor of both distress and worry among East Asian Americans. For Southeast Asian Americans, direct discrimination significantly predicted higher levels of distress, whereas vicarious discrimination predicted higher levels of worry. Vicarious discrimination was not significantly related to distress across ethnic subgroups. Results suggest that practitioners and policy makers would benefit from attending to these within-group differences in Asian Americans' experiences during the pandemic.","Okazaki, Lee, Prasai, Chang, Yoo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.956076","20221108","Asian Americans; COVID-19 discrimination; data disaggregation; distress; mental health; worry; Adult; Female; Humans; Asian Americans; Mental Health; COVID-19; Racism; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40795,""
"The paradigm and future value of the metaverse for the intervention of cognitive decline","Cognitive decline is a gradual neurodegenerative process that is affected by genetic and environmental factors. The doctor-patient relationship in the healthcare for cognitive decline is in a ""shallow"" medical world. With the development of data science, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital twin, the introduction of the concept of the metaverse in medicine has brought alternative and complementary strategies in the intervention of cognitive decline. This article technically analyzes the application scenarios and paradigms of the metaverse in medicine in the field of mental health, such as hospital management, diagnosis, prediction, prevention, rehabilitation, progression delay, assisting life, companionship, and supervision. The metaverse in medicine has made primary progress in education, immersive consultation, dental disease, and Parkinson's disease, bringing revolutionary prospects for non-pharmacological complementary treatment of cognitive decline and other mental problems. In particular, with the demand for non-face-to-face communication generated by the global COVID-19 epidemic, the needs for uncontactable healthcare service for the elderly have increased. The paradigm of self-monitoring, self-healing, and healthcare experienced by the elderly through the metaverse in medicine, especially from meta-platform, meta-community, and meta-hospital, will be generated, which will reconstruct the service modes for the elderly people. The future map of the metaverse in medicine is huge, which depends on the co-construction of community partners.","Zhou, Gao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1016680","20221108","Alzheimer's disease; cognitive decline; digital twin; mental health; metaverse in medicine; virtual reality; Humans; Aged; Physician-Patient Relations; Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Cognitive Dysfunction; Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40796,""
"Suicide spectrum among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","There are concerns that suicidal behaviors are arising among adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic could have worsened the picture, however, studies on this topic reported contrasting results. This work aimed to summarise findings from the worldwide emerging literature on the rates of suicidality among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed, searching five electronic databases for studies published from January 1, 2020 until July 27, 2022. Studies reporting rates for each of the three considered outcomes (suicide, suicidal behaviors, and suicidal ideation) among young people under 19 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, and the intra-study risk of bias was assessed. When pre-COVID-19 data were available, incidence rate ratio (IRR) and prevalence ratio (PR) estimates were calculated between the two periods. All the analyses were performed according to the setting explored: general population, emergency department (ED), and psychiatric services. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022308014). Forty-seven observational studies were selected for more than 65 million subjects. The results of the meta-analysis showed a pooled annual incidence rate of suicides of 4.9 cases/100,000 during 2020, accounting for a non-statistically significant increase of 10% compared to 2019 (IRR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.94-1.29). The suicidal behaviors pooled prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic was higher in the psychiatric setting (25%; 95% CI: 17-36%) than in the general population (3%; 1-13%) and ED (1%; 0-9%). The pooled rate of suicidal ideation was 17% in the general population (11-25%), 36% in psychiatric setting (20-56%) and 2% in ED (0-12%). The heterogeneity level was over 97% for both outcomes in all settings considered. The comparison between before and during COVID-19 periods highlighted a non-statistically significant upward trend in suicidal behaviors among the general population and in ED setting. The only significant increase was found for suicidal ideation in psychiatric setting among studies conducted in 2021 (PR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04-1.27), not observed exploring 2020 alone. During the pandemic, suicide spectrum issues seemed to follow the known pattern described in previous studies, with higher rates of suicidal ideation than of suicidal behaviors and suicide events. Governments and other stakeholders should be mindful that youth may have unique risks at the outset of large disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic and proactive steps are necessary to address the needs of youth to mitigate those risks. The present study was funded by the University of Torino (CHAL_RILO_21_01).","Bersia, Koumantakis, Berchialla, Charrier, Ricotti, Grimaldi, Dalmasso, Comoretto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101705","20221108","COVID-19; Child and adolescent; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40797,""
"Technology-Enhanced Learning and Well-being: a Contribution to the Validation of a Measure to Assess University Students' Technostress in the Italian Context","COVID-19 has forced many universities to adopt widely technology-enhanced learning (TEL), highlighting the role of technostress as a risk factor for detrimental outcomes that may be prevented through the assessment with reliable tools. Thus, the present study aimed to test the psychometric characteristics of the Italian validation of the technostress scale by Wang, Tan, and Li. A self-report online questionnaire was completed by 915 participants (aged 18-33Ã‚Â years) attending an online university course during the health emergency. A subsample of 301 subjects (<i>M</i> <sub>Age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.91, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.93) filled out the same questionnaire after a 3-month time interval to evaluate the test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the one-factor structure of the scale, which was confirmed across academic courses considered (first-year and senior students). Moreover, the findings showed significant associations with the Italian Technostress Creators Scale and the Italian Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, as well as a satisfactory test-retest coefficient value supporting its validity and reliability. In light of the above, the study provides a useful instrument to evaluate technostress related to TEL and indications to implement preventive interventions for this type of stress by improving students' experience with learning technologies.","Schettino, Marino, Capone","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00940-9","20221108","Scale validation; Students; Technology-enhanced learning; Technostress; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40798,""
"Supporting Struggling Trainees with Performance Issues: Lessons from a UK Model","Approximately 6-9% of trainees will have performance issues of variable degrees with 3-5% of trainees struggling to complete their training and requiring additional targeted time or an extension of training. Some even leave the profession. The environment is complex, often chaotic and overstretched, and, now, made more difficult due to the impact of COVID-19 on medical training. Addressing learning and implementing new behaviours is a challenge and important, as there are still 'never events', and medical errors sadly can include wilful neglect and assault. Such traumatic experiences can be a huge drain of resources for faculty, who often feel underprepared to deal with such occurrences. Failure to address them can lead to bitterness and loss of the medical workforce, rarely suicide, huge remedial costs, and legal challenges to educational institutions and employers. The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of why trainees struggle and/or fail and to be able to analyse the causes of poor performance; to know how to pick up these issues early and raise them; and to ultimately deal effectively with performance problems to get a good outcome for the trainees, patients, and institutions.","Sandhu, Gill, Otoom, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-022-03607-w","20221108","Burnout; COVID-19 pandemic; Patient safety; Poor performance; Struggling trainees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40799,""
"EEG diagnosis of depression based on multi-channel data fusion and clipping augmentation and convolutional neural network","Depression is an undetectable mental disease. Most of the patients with depressive symptoms do not know that they are suffering from depression. Since the novel Coronavirus pandemic 2019, the number of patients with depression has increased rapidly. There are two kinds of traditional depression diagnosis. One is that professional psychiatrists make diagnosis results for patients, but it is not conducive to large-scale depression detection. Another is to use electroencephalography (EEG) to record neuronal activity. Then, the features of the EEG are extracted using manual or traditional machine learning methods to diagnose the state and type of depression. Although this method achieves good results, it does not fully utilize the multi-channel information of EEG. Aiming at this problem, an EEG diagnosis method for depression based on multi-channel data fusion cropping enhancement and convolutional neural network is proposed. First, the multi-channel EEG data are transformed into 2D images after multi-channel fusion (MCF) and multi-scale clipping (MSC) augmentation. Second, it is trained by a multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCNN). Finally, the trained model is loaded into the detection device to classify the input EEG signals. The experimental results show that the combination of MCF and MSC can make full use of the information contained in the single sensor records, and significantly improve the classification accuracy and clustering effect of depression diagnosis. The method has the advantages of low complexity and good robustness in signal processing and feature extraction, which is beneficial to the wide application of detection systems.","Wang, Kang, Huo, Feng, Zhang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.1029298","20221108","CNN; EEG; depression; diagnosis; multi-channel fusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40800,""
"Influence of COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychological Status: An Elaborate Review","The 21<sup>st</sup>Ã‚Â century has seen a spike in virus outbreaks. The Coronavirus infection in 2019, originating from Wuhan Province,Ã‚Â China, spread across the world and was declared aÃ‚Â pandemic. It led to the impositionÃ‚Â of lockdowns in different parts of the world, as lockdowns wereÃ‚Â an effective and essential way to break down the cycle ofÃ‚Â infection.Ã‚Â Physical distancingÃ‚Â was the most significantÃ‚Â measureÃ‚Â to break theÃ‚Â infectionÃ‚Â cycle.Ã‚Â The Coronavirus infection outbreakÃ‚Â has seen a concurrent spike in mental health risks worldwide. Mental healthÃ‚Â is considered to be one of the important components of overallÃ‚Â healthÃ‚Â issues. A good mental health state is whenÃ‚Â people are stable with the environment and should not be effortlessly upset. They should know their requirements, difficulties, and goals properly; if they face problems, a trial should be done to solve them logically to cope with stress and anxiety. COVID-19 has set off a wide variation of mental issues, for example, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. Most of the studies have reported negative impacts, including anger, stress indications, and confusion. Healthcare providers who have worked around the look after patientsÃ‚Â had also found a need for emphasis on mental health. Mental health awareness among the general population has gained importance since the high spike rise of mental health issues.

"Mental Health and Substance Use in NCAA Athletes in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown","Background Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had pervasive effects on the lives of individuals, its influence on the mental health ofÃ‚Â collegiate athletes remains unknown. This study aimed to assess changes in mental health and substance use in National Collegiate Athlete Association (NCAA) Division I athletes in Southern California during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology An online survey was created using the Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah). NCAA Division I athletes in Southern California completed preseason surveys querying indices of mental health, substance use, and injury in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2019 to March 2020) and during the pandemic (March 2020 to March 2021). The athletes filled out the survey from June 2021 to September 2021. Participants were asked how likely they were to agree with the following statements: I have felt physically prepared for athletic competitions, I have been satisfied with my mental health, and I have had adequate sleep. Participants were also asked to compare their substance use between the two time periods. Sociodemographic information regarding participants' age, gender, sports team, as well as year in sport and school was also collected. Group comparison analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test. Correlations between mental health measures and other variables were examined using Spearman's correlation coefficients. Results A total of 189 athletes completed the survey (out of the 259 surveys that were started). Females were significantly less likely to feel satisfied with mental health (p &lt; 0.01) and physically prepared for sport (p &lt; 0.01). Across all respondents, satisfaction with mental health was positively correlated with adequate sleep (p &lt; 0.01) and physical preparedness for sport (p &lt; 0.01) and negatively correlated with injury (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant correlation between mental health status and history of COVID-19 infection (p = 0.84). The vast majority of athletes reported no significant change in substance use pre- to post-pandemic, with no differences according to sex. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic had a differential impact on the mental health of female versus male NCAA athletes. Mental health was correlated with sleep, physical preparedness, and being injury-free but not with a history of COVID-19 infection. Despite reports indicating increased substance use in the general population, athletes in this group reported no change in licit and illicit substance use.","McLellan, Heffernan, Xu, Billimek, Kim","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29836","20221108","covid-19; covid-19 pandemic; mental health; ncaa athlete; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40802,""
"How does COVID-19 pandemic affect entrepreneur anxiety? The role of threat perception and performance pressure","The entrepreneurial firms may be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the entrepreneurs of entrepreneurial firms are also threatened by the revenues decline and business failure, which vehemently affect their well-being. The mental health of the entrepreneur decides whether the entrepreneurial firms can make the right decision, which is related to the healthy development of the entrepreneurial firms. Based on the event system theory and the cognitive appraisal theory, this paper aims to explore the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the entrepreneur anxiety, and the threat perception and performance pressure are introduced to investigate the mediating mechanism and boundary of this effect. Using the simple random sampling to obtain questionnaire survey data, 168 entrepreneurs of entrepreneurial firms have participated in the empirical study, and the research results are as follows. First, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly positively affects entrepreneur anxiety. Second, the entrepreneur threat perception plays a mediating role between the COVID-19 pandemic and the entrepreneur anxiety, which means the COVID-19 pandemic can enhance the external threat perception of entrepreneurs, and then affect the entrepreneur anxiety. Third, the positive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the entrepreneur anxiety is strengthened by the entrepreneur performance pressure, while the positive effect of entrepreneur threat perception on entrepreneur anxiety is weakened by the entrepreneur performance pressure. The above findings are helpful to explore the mechanism of the COVID-19 pandemic and other critical crisis events on entrepreneurs' mental health from the new perspective of cognitive appraisal theory and event system theory, filling the research gaps between the COVID-19 pandemic and entrepreneur anxiety. Besides, this study broadens the applied range of the cognitive appraisal theory and the event system theory in the fields of crisis situations and entrepreneur research, and enriches the research outputs. Furthermore, this study will help provide a new theoretical analysis insight for the related research on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects entrepreneurs' psychology, and further deepen researchers to understand the mechanism of entrepreneur anxiety under the COVID-19 pandemic, providing theoretical inspirations for reducing entrepreneur anxiety. What's more, this study finds that individual pressure can affect their cognitive appraisal, which means that future research should take the pressure influential mechanism into consideration in the process of exploring ""external stimulus--cognitive appraisal--emotional response,"" further expanding the theoretical model of cognitive appraisal proposed from the perspective of pressure.","Li, Chen, Liu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1044011","20221108","COVID-19 pandemic; entrepreneur anxiety; entrepreneur performance pressure; entrepreneur threat perception; entrepreneurial firms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40803,""
"Physical activity and subjective well-being of older adults during COVID-19 prevention and control normalization: Mediating role of outdoor exercise environment and regulating role of exercise form","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the physical and mental health of older adults has been threatened. Promoting physical and mental health through physical activity has therefore become a strategy for healthy aging. In order to better understand the impact of the participation of older adults in physical activity, this paper selects different types of physical activity, and examines the relationship between them and subjective well-being through the analysis of the mediation effect of outdoor exercise environment and the regulating effect of exercise form. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China. The main data come from 903 older adults in five urban areas in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. The surveys were carried out using the Physical Activity Rating Scale, Newfoundland Subjective Well-Being Scale, Exercise Environment Scale, and Exercise Form Scale. SPSS was used for statistical analysis, linear regression analysis was adopted for processing data, and AMOS was used to establish a mediation model. The mediating variable is the outdoor exercise environment, and the moderating variable is exercise form; gender, age, education level, and monthly income were used as control variables. The study results showed that different physical activities (tai chi; health qigong; walking and jogging) were significantly, positively correlated with the subjective well-being of older adults (tai chi: <i>R</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.351, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01; health qigong: <i>R</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.340, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01; walking and jogging: <i>R</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.245, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01); among the activities, tai chi had the strongest effect on the subjective well-being of older adults (<i>R</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.351, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Outdoor exercise environment played a mediating role between different physical activity types and subjective well-being of older adults [tai chi: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.030, 95% CI (0.005, 0.031); health qigong: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018, 95% CI (0.000, 0.021); walking and jogging: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.034, 95% CI (0.008, 0.035)]. Exercise form moderated the subjective well-being of older adults in different physical activities (tai chi: 0.006, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05; health qigong: 0.006, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05; walking and jogging: 0.009, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The results of this study demonstrate that the outdoor exercise environment plays a mediating role between different physical activities and the subjective well-being of older adults, and the form of exercise can also moderate the impact of different physical activities on the subjective well-being of older adults. This study has enlightening significance for psychological intervention with older adults facing stress, anxiety and depression.","Yang, Tang, Jennings, Zhao, Zhu, Ma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1014967","20221108","COVID-19 pandemic; exercise form; older adults; outdoor exercise environment; physical activity; subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40804,""
"What drives people's protective behaviors during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China","This study systematically examined people's protective behaviors against COVID-19 in China, and particular attention was given to people's perceived threat and information-processing strategies. This study constructed a conceptual model and used structural equation modeling to explore this issue, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data involving 4,605 participants during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The results showed that people's initial information acquisition played an essential role in their behavioral responses; acquiring more initial information about COVID-19 would make them perceive a higher threat and present a higher demand for information, then making them more likely to seek and process information, and subsequently motivating their protective behaviors. In addition to increasing people's information needs, the perceived threat could also strengthen the analytical assessment and affect protective behavior positively but failed to predict the experiential assessment. Driven by information need, information seeking significantly influenced protective behavior; it also facilitated analytical assessment and decreased experiential assessment, thus predicting people's protective behaviors. Protective behaviors were spurred by analytical assessment but negatively influenced by the experiential assessment.","Pang, Zhao, Xue","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.781279","20221108","COVID-19; information seeking; information-processing strategy; perceived threat; protective behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40805,""
"Mental and physical health correlates of the psychological impact of the first wave of COVID-19 among general population of Pakistan","The primary aim was to assess the role of mental and physical health of COVID-19 and its psychological impact in the general population of Pakistan during the first wave of COVID-19. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant predictive association among socio-demographic variables, psychological impact and mental health status resulting from COVID-19, and poor self-reported physical health would be significantly associated with adverse psychological impact and poor mental health status because of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey research design was used in which 1,361 respondents were sampled online during lockdown imposed in the country. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) was used to assess participants' mental health status. 18% of the respondents reported moderate to severe event-specific distress, 22.6% reported moderate to severely extreme depression, 29% reported moderate to extreme anxiety, and 12.1% reported moderate to extreme stress. Female gender, having graduate-level education, currently studying, and self-reported physical symptoms (persistent fever, chills, headache, cough, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat) were significantly associated with higher levels of psychological impact exhibited through higher scores on the IES-R and poorer mental health status exhibited through higher scores on the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Subscales).","Ali, Lewis, Hasan, Iftikhar, Fayyaz, Anjum","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942108","20221108","anxiety; depression; first wave of COVID-19; mental health; physical health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40806,""
"Examining the protective influence of posttraumatic growth on interpersonal suicide risk factors in a 6-week longitudinal study","Research has found an inverse relationship between posttraumatic growth (PTG) and suicidal ideation in military and community samples that holds when controlling for other suicide risk factors. However, further research is needed into the underlying mechanisms to clarify how PTG protects against the formation of suicidal ideation. The current two-wave longitudinal study examined whether perceiving PTG from recent adverse circumstances while in a national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic attenuated the positive relationship of two interpersonal suicide risk factors - perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belonginess (TB)-over 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. Participants (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°170) were recruited online from Prolific from income-deprived areas in the United Kingdom (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37.65; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.50; 53.5% female). <i>Post-hoc</i> power analyses indicated we had insufficient power to examine the hypothesised mediation for TB. We examined whether PTG mediated the relationship between PB at wave 1 and wave 2 while controlling for depression and anxiety in a sample of individuals at-risk for suicidal ideation.

"Anxiety levels among Palestinian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The widespread of COVID-19 causes serious distress on the mental health of the students during the lockdown period. The present study aimed to identify anxiety levels among students during the COVID-19 crisis. A cross-sectional web-based survey was carried out among university students aged 18-47Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. Among the 1252 participants, the mean age was 28.82 (Ã‚Â±7.28) years and 72.6% were female. Based on the results, 22.0% of the participants had no symptoms of anxiety, 25.2% had mild anxiety, 29.6% moderate anxiety, and 23.2% severe anxiety. Moreover, being a female (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.480, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.257-0.704), younger age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.359, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.132-0.586), undergraduate level (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.493, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.288-0.698), and stability of monthly income (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.516, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.308-0.723) were found to be a protective factor against anxiety suffered by the participants.

A retrospective audit of the COVID-19 vaccination status of inpatients at the Mental Health Unit (MHU) at a tertiary hospital in WA was conducted and compared with the state average. Additionally, the medical records were interrogated to determine whether eligible inpatients were offered and received COVID-19 vaccination via the inpatient vaccination program. Vaccination rates for the MHU population were substantially lower than those for the WA population, particularly earlier in 2022. During January, just 49.0% of admitted patients had received two doses of the vaccine, compared to 92.8% of WA. Over the three months, 67 (47.2%) of all admissions were eligible for vaccination during their admission and 19 of the eligible patients (28.4%) were successfully vaccinated. This audit has demonstrated a slow uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations in the SMI population, despite the wide availability for 12 months prior to this period. This indicates a significant potential for targeted, assertive programs to improve vaccination rates in this population group.","Hooper, Hooper, Nguyen, Fukutomi","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562221136756","20221107","COVID-19; mental health; psychiatry; severe mental illness; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40809,""
"Comparison of Mental Health Visits at a Military Treatment Facility Emergency Department Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Pandemic","There is a paucity of quantitative research regarding the effect of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States, and specifically mental health-related ED visits. The small existing body of research describes an overall decline in ED visits worldwide; however, there are anecdotal reports that psychiatric complaints to the ED have increased during the pandemic. The primary objective of this study was to describe the volume of mental health ED visits at a single ED during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years. This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of adult patients evaluated in the ED at an academic military medical facility from March to December of 2017-2020 for mental health. The electronic medical record was queried for mental health International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnosis codes. Demographic data including age, gender, disposition, diagnosis, and beneficiary status were collected, and Pearson Chi-Square was used to assess for statistical significance between years. There was a total of 1,486 mental health ED visits from March to December 2020, compared to an average of 1,668 visits from March to December 2017-2019. Statistically significant (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) differences, between 2020 and the prior 3 years combined, were identified in the categories of age, disposition, beneficiary status, and diagnosis. In 2020, there was a lower proportion of visits for patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 (1.2%) than in 2017-2019 (2.5%). Active-duty patients comprised a higher proportion of mental health visits in 2020 (82.4%) versus 2017-2019 (77%). Proportionately fewer patients were admitted in 2020 (25.2%) versus 2017-2019 (29.2%). Adjustment disorders made up 19.0% of visits in 2020 versus 23.2% in 2017-2019, and suicidal ideation and intentional self-inflicted injury comprised 43.3% in 2020 compared with 40.4% in 2017-2019. There was a significant decline in ED visits for patients over the age of 60 but a significant increase in visits for active-duty patients. Fewer patients were admitted compared to previous years. There was a significant increase in patients diagnosed with suicidal ideation and intentional self-inflicted injury in 2020 compared to previous years. Alarmingly, this study shows increased rates of self-harm and suicidal ideation. Further study is needed to determine why these effects were seen and if there is a higher risk for suicide attempt or completion in these populations. These results indicate that military leadership and the military health system is failing to adequately support and protect service members and their families during these uniquely stressful times. High-level attention to this issue by military leadership is required; the readiness and safety of the nation's fighting force is at stake.","Wojahn, Reilly, Morrison, Lemieux, Grimaldo","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac328","20221106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40810,""
"Perceived and Experienced Anti-Chinese Discrimination and Its Associated Psychological Impacts Among Chinese Canadians During the Wave 2 of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current study examined the sociodemographic factors associated with perceived and experienced anti-Chinese discrimination and discrimination as a predictor of psychological distress and loneliness among Chinese Canadians. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in early 2021 with a sample of 899 Chinese Canadians (i.e., immigrants, citizens, visitors, and international students) during the Wave 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, anti-Chinese discrimination was generally associated with younger age and poor financial or health status. Christianity/Catholicism believers were less likely to report perceived discrimination, whereas being married/partnered and living with family reduced the incidences of experienced discrimination. Most importantly, hierarchical linear regression models showed that both perceived and experienced discrimination predicted higher psychological distress (<b><i>ÃŽÂ²</i></b>s =Ã‚Â 4.90-7.57, <i>p</i>s Ã¢â€°Â¤ .001) and loneliness (<b><i>ÃŽÂ²</i></b>s =Ã‚Â .89-1.73, <i>p</i>s Ã¢â€°Â¤ .003), before and after controlling for all related sociodemographic covariates. Additionally, older age, higher education, better financial or health status could all buffer psychological distress, whereas living with family or in a house and better financial or health status could mitigate feeling of loneliness. The results suggested that discrimination has a robust detrimental impact on mental health conditions among Chinese Canadians.","Yang, Kandasamy, Na, Zhang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2142947","20221106","COVID-19 pandemic; Chinese Canadians; Perceived discrimination; experienced discrimination; immigrants; loneliness; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40811,""
"Patient-Reported Outcomes for Fully Vaccinated COVID-19 Patients Over 6Ã‚Â Weeks: The Experiences of Clinical Breakthrough Cases","While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have high rates of efficacy, fully vaccinated individuals can become infected with COVID-19. Among this population, symptoms tend to be less severe and shorter lasting. Less is known about how vaccinated individuals who contract COVID-19 experience the disease through patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and how this changes over time. The aim of this study was to describe the physical, mental, and social health PROs for fully vaccinated individuals who contracted COVID-19 over a 6-week period. Prospective design using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short-form (PROMIS-10) collected through a mobile application-based platform. 1114 fully vaccinated patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at a large US health system and engaged with the study on or after 1 March 2021 and reported onset of illness prior to 1 November 2021. Global physical and mental health PROMIS-10 T-scores for the 6-week period, component PROMIS-10 questions for the 6-week period, and component PROMIS-10 questions restricted to a subset of participants for the first month to measure individual recovery were analyzed. Mean global physical and mental health T-scores increased over time and remained within one standard deviation of the population mean. At baseline, at least 40% of participants reported good health for all component questions except Fatigue (25%), and the proportion reporting good health increased over time for all questions, with the largest improvements in Fatigue (25.5 to 67.5%), Pain (59.1 to 82.8%), and Emotional Problems (42.3 to 62.5%). Over the first month, the greatest positive changes in individual recovery were observed for Fatigue (65.0%), Pain (53.0%), and Emotional Problems (41.1%); at least 30% of respondents reported no change in at least one category, and the greatest decreases were for Usual Social Activities (23.9%), Social Satisfaction (23.2%), and Mental Health (21.8%). This study provides an important step towards better understanding the impact of 'breakthrough' COVID-19 infections on clinically engaged, fully vaccinated patients' physical and mental health to improve support for their treatment and recovery.","Vartanian, Fish, Gronowski, Kenton, Robicsek","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40271-022-00605-8","20221106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40812,""
"Revisiting the multidimensional interaction model of stress, anxiety and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study","Although the Multidimensional Interaction Model of Stress, Anxiety and Coping (MIMSAC) has been known for years, there is a lack of research examining this theory longitudinally in stressful events. This study aims to revisit the MIMSAC among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective cohort study with the longitudinal design was performed during the first (W1, March 30-April 29, 2020) and second wave (W2, November 3-December 3, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 216 university students with a mean age of 22 years (ranging from 20 to 36, MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.13, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.04) participated in the study. An online survey included Perceived Stress Scale, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Due to the MIMSAC, all variables changed substantially across W1 and W2, adapting to an unpredictable environment. Women scored higher than men in stress, anxiety, emotion- and avoidance-oriented coping styles. We found the indirect effect of emotion-oriented coping on the stress-anxiety relationship and task-oriented coping on the anxiety-stress interaction. Avoidance was not found as a mediator in the stress-anxiety interaction. Emotion-oriented coping adversely affected mental health, increasing anxiety in response to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Task-oriented coping efficiently decreased stress in reaction to high anxiety, but only in men. Avoidance seems to be an ineffective coping style during the COVID-19 pandemic. Campus intervention programs should focus on reducing negative emotions and increasing the frequency of task-oriented coping strategies among university students.","Rogowska, Ochnik, KuÃ…â€ºnierz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00950-1","20221108","Anxiety; Coping inventory for stressful situations (CISS); Coping strategies; Coping styles; Health psychology; Perceived stress; Poland; The multidimensional interaction model of stress, anxiety and coping; Male; Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Stress, Psychological; Longitudinal Studies; COVID-19; Prospective Studies; Pandemics; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40813,""
"Family lifestyle is related to low-income preschoolers' emotional well-being during COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has profoundly impacted children's behavioral and psychosocial development, especially young children from low-income families. This study examined how caregivers' and preschoolers' lifestyle behaviors (sleep, screen time, physical activity, eating behavior) were related to preschoolers' emotional well-being (sadness, fear, anger, and positive affect). Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited low-income caregivers from Head Start organizations and the Qualtrics panel. Participants provided consent and completed an online survey. A total of 408 caregivers (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31) participated: 17% Hispanic, 21% Black, 49% separated/single, 44% unemployed, and 39% with Ã¢â€°Â¤high school education. After adjusting for demographics and preschoolers' lifestyle behaviors, caregivers' sleep disturbance was positively correlated with preschoolers' anger, fear, and sadness, while negatively related to positive affect. Similarly, caregivers' sleep time was positively correlated with preschoolers' sadness and negatively related to positive affect. Preschoolers' sleep time was negatively related to fear and positively related to positive affect. Likewise, preschoolers' physical activity was negatively correlated with fear, sadness, and positively correlated with positive affect. Additionally, preschoolers' fruit/vegetable intake was negatively associated with anger, fear, sadness, and positively associated with positive affect. The identified behavior-emotion connection provides a foundation for developing family-based lifestyle interventions in promoting mental health among preschoolers.","Ling, Kao, Robbins, Wahman","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcap.12399","20221106","emotion; family; lifestyle behavior; low-income; preschooler","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40814,""
"The association of mindfulness with professional quality of life and negative emotional states among critical care nurses during COVID-19 pandemic","The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed severe psychological pressure on nurses. Mindfulness has been shown to be effective in improving professional quality of life (ProQOL) and reducing psychological distress in a wide range of populations and contexts. However, its role in supporting critical care nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19 has yet to be established. This study explores the relationship of mindfulness with negative emotional states and ProQOL among nurses working in critical care units during COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design was used. A sample of 156 critical care nurses completed self-reported measures of mindfulness, ProQOL, and negative emotional states. Multiple regressions were used to address the study purpose. Overall, the participants had severe anxiety, moderate depression, moderate stress, moderate burnout, moderate secondary traumatic stress, and moderate compassion satisfaction. Mindfulness was significantly and negatively associated with stress (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.230, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004), depression (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.190, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.018), burnout (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.218, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007), and secondary traumatic stress (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.168, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.037). Mindfulness explained 3% of the variance in depression (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.19, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.018), 3.9% of variance in stress, (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.201, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.012), 4.2% of variance in BO (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.206, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009), and 2.2% of the variance in secondary traumatic stress (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.168, tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.104, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.037), controlling for demographics. The current study provides preliminary evidence that mindfulness can be helpful in reducing critical care nurses' psychological distress and promoting their ProQOL, and is worthy of further investigation in this population.","Abu-Horirrah, Rayan, Eshah, ALBashtawy, Masa'deh","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12828","20221106","anxiety; burnout (BO); compassion fatigue; compassion satisfaction; critical care unit; depression; mindfulness; nurse; professional quality of life (ProQOL); stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40815,""
"Prevalence and determinants of Italian physicians' burnout in the ""post-COVID-19"" era","Several studies investigated prevalence and determinants of physicians' burnout during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but only a few during the chronic phase of the pandemic. This study thus aimed to examine this topic referring to the ""post-COVID-19 era"", defined as a chronic and likely-to-be endemic status quo. A cross-sectional, online survey (November 2021-January 2022) was addressed to physicians in Lombardia (Northern Italy). Besides socio-demographic and COVID-19-related data, measures of personal, work- and patient-related burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; CBI), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), and self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale) were collected. Linear/generalized linear models were run to test associations/predictions of interest. Among the 958 respondents, burnout symptoms were clinically significant in 18.5% of them. Predictive models showed that female sex (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.73, 95% CI 0.42-1.27), younger age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94, 95% CI 0.59-1.48), shorter job tenure (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01, 95% CI 0.62-1.65), trainee status (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.41, 95% CI 1.16-7.10), higher PHQ-8 (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.260, 95% CI 1.16-1.37), and GAD-7 scores (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.30) increased the risk to suffer from clinical burnout. COVID-19-related variables were mostly not related/associated to burnout levels. In Italy, physicians' burnout is moderately prevalent also in the chronic phase of the pandemic, with its determinants being more intrinsic than environmental. The development of effective interventions is needed to help physicians cope with the new challenges of their job.","Fiabane, Margheritti, Aiello, Magnone, Miglioretti, Gabanelli, Giorgi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-022-01929-6","20221106","Burnout; COVID-19; Pandemic; Physicians; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40816,""
"[Feasibility study: The medical imaging as a tool for therapeutic education in radiotherapy]","Assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) exploring the use of medical imaging as a therapeutic education (TPE) intervention in external radiation therapy. Experimental feasibility trial of ""RCT"" type carried out in a single-center, between November 2019 and March 2020, following adult patients treated by thoracic radiotherapy. In addition to the information usually given, the experimental group benefited from an intervention consisting in the visualization of their own medical images using the open-source software ""Stone of Orthanc"".

"The United Kingdom's first unsanctioned overdose prevention site; A proof-of-concept evaluation","Background The United Kingdom (UK) is currently experiencing a public health crisis of drug-related deaths. The government has rejected recommendations to open overdose prevention services, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. To report on the operation and use of an unsanctioned overdose prevention service which operated in Glasgow city centre from September 2020 to May 2021. Methods Description of the service, with analysis of data collected on its use. Results The service operated for nine months without permission or funding from official sources. We report on the 894 injections supervised and recorded, and nine successful interventions with overdose events (seven opioid/two cocaine). Powder cocaine injection predominated either alone (60.6%) or with heroin (22.1%). Injection was mostly in the groin (68.0%) or arm (16.8%). More injections were recorded by males (70.1%). Around 65% of injection events featured an individual who was on a buprenorphine/methadone prescription. Conclusion It is feasible for an overdose prevention service to operate successfully in the UK without being shut down by the police or with negative consequences for the community. Future sites in the UK must tailor to the substances used by their potential clients, international trends (e.g. for fentanyl use) did not apply here. There is an urgent need and demand for these services in the UK to reduce harm, prevent and intervene during overdose, and provide vital psychosocial support for health and wellbeing in a highly marginalised population.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103670","20220601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","",40819,""
