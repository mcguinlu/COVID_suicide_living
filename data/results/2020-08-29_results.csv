"Responding to the Covid-19 pandemic at a university counseling center: administrative actions, client retention, and psychotherapy outcome","In this article, we examine how Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at a large private university in the western United States addressed the abrupt suspension of in-person mental health services and switch to telebehavioral health due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We used descriptive data, binary logistic regression, and hierarchical linear modeling to investigate changes in number of sessions and clients, use of online mental health platforms, and changes in clientsâ€™ psychological functioning. Overall, we found that CAPS had a decrease in scheduled appointments (including intake) and no change in attendance rates. We estimate that premature termination impacted about 32â€“34% of individual therapy clients and 29â€“37% of group clients. The number of new users for our online therapeutic platforms did not appear to be affected. Clients in 2020 were not significantly more distressed than clients in the previous 3 years and we found no significant differences in outcome between 2020 and previous years, indicating that levels of distress and treatment trajectories remained similar across years. Future research should focus on longer-term client outcomes as well as increasing accessibility to therapy in pandemic conditions.","Erekson, David M.; Bailey, Russell J.; Cattani, Kara; Fox, Sheilagh T.; Goates-Jones, Melissa K.","https://doi.org/10.1080/09515070.2020.1807914","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Couns.

"Spatio-temporal analysis of meteorological factors in abating the spread of COVID-19 in Africa","In Asia, Europe and South America, the role of atmospheric condition in aiding or abating the growth curve of COVID-19 has been analysed. However, no study to date has examined such climatic extensions for the growth or otherwise of the novel coronavirus in Africa. Africa, with a mostly relatively warmer temperature differs from other regions of the world and in addition, has recorded far fewer cases compared to Asian, Europeans and the Americans (North and South). It then becomes imperative to examine the influence of meteorological indices in the growth or otherwise of coronavirus diseases in Africa to establish whether findings on the climatic conditions-COVID-19 growth are regionally specific. In this study, we examined the influence of meteorological factors for aiding or abating the spread of the aerosolised pathogen of COVID-19 in Africa. We rely on the generalised additive model (GAM) and found wind speed to positively relate to COVID-19 growth while mean temperature and relative humidity to inversely relates to COVID-19 growth curve in Africa. We accounted for potential cofounders in the core GAM model and discuss policy implications.Climatology; Environmental analysis; Environmental economics; Environmental health; Environmental impact assessment; Mean temperature; Average wind speed; Relative humidity; COVID-19; Climatic conditions; Africa.","Adekunle, Ibrahim Ayoade; Tella, Sheriffdeen Adewale; Oyesiku, Kayode O.; Oseni, Isiaq Olasunkanmi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04749","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Heliyon;8(6)20200801.; Publication details: Heliyon;8(6)20200801.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4198,""
"OCD, health anxiety and COVID-19: A new frontier","People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are likely to be more susceptible to the mental health impact of COVID-19. This paper shares the perspectives of expert clinicians working with OCD considering how to identify OCD in the context of COVID-19, changes in the presentation and importantly what to consider when undertaking Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for OCD in the current climate. The expert consensus is although the presentation of OCD and treatment may have become more difficult, CBT should still continue remotely unless there are specific reasons for it not to e.g. increase in risk, no access to computer or exposure tasks or behavioural experiments cannot be undertaken. The authors highlight some of the considerations to take in CBT in light of our current understanding of COVID-19, including therapists and clients taking calculated risks when developing behavioural experiments and exposure tasks, considering viral loading and vulnerability factors. Special considerations for young people and perinatal women are discussed as well as foreseeing what life may be like for those with OCD after the pandemic is over.","Jassi, Amita; Shahriyarmolki, Khodayar; Taylor, Tracey; Peile, Lauren; Challacombe, Fiona; Clark, Bruce; Veale, David","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1754470X20000318","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Cogn.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan, China","Fangcang shelter hospitals were established in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a countermeasure to stop the spread of the disease. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on mental health problems among patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and major influencing factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals. From February 23, 2020, to February 26, 2020, we obtained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information of COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital (Wuhan, China) and assessed their mental health status and sleep quality. Data were obtained with an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a set of items on demographic characteristics, a set of items on clinical characteristics, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Three hundred seven COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 18.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Poor sleep quality and having Ã¢â€°Â¥ two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms. Female sex, having a family member with confirmed COVID-19, and having Ã¢â€°Â¥ two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to be common among COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital, with some patients being at high risk.","Dai, Wang, Jiang, Li, Wang, Wu, Jia, Liu, An, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238416","20200828","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4202,""
"Perinatal distress during COVID-19: a thematic analysis of an online parenting forum","The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual, population and system level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children and other family members. In addition, they are a vulnerable group, at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high risk external environment. Examination of the public discourse of a perinatal cohort to understand unmet health information and support needs and impacts on mothering identity and social dynamics, in the context of COVID-19. A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to post-birth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from Jan 27 to May 12 2020 inclusive. Key search terms included: 'COVID', 'corona' and 'pandemic'. A three-phase analysis was conducted including: thematic analysis, sentiment analysis and word frequency calculations. The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. These were: 1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; 2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; 3) altered family and support relationships; 4) guilt tampered happiness; and, 5) family future postponed. Sentiment analysis revealed content was predominantly negative (very negative: 537 and moderately negative: 443 compared to very positive: 236 and moderately positive: 340). Negative words were frequently used with associated derivatives including 'worried' (19.9%); 'risk' (17.2%); 'anxiety' (11.8%); 'concerns' (8.8%) and 'stress' (8.3%). Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely and reassuring. Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort.","Chivers, Garad, Boyle, Skouteris, Teede, Harrison","https://doi.org/10.2196/22002","20200828","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4203,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients included in a bariatric surgery program","The COVID-19 pandemic has radically impacted the world lifestyle. Epidemics are well-known to cause mental distress, and patients with a current or past history of obesity are at increased risk for the common presence of psychological comorbidities. This study investigates the psychological impact of the current pandemic in patients participating in a bariatric surgery program. Patients were consecutively enrolled during the Italian lockdown among those waiting for bariatric surgery or attending a post-bariatric follow-up, and were asked to complete through an online platform the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and a self-assessment questionnaire of 22 items evaluating the resilience, change in eating behavior and emotional responses referring to the ongoing pandemic. 59% of the 434 enrolled subjects reported of being worried about the pandemic, and 63% specifically reported of being worried about their or their relatives' health. 37% and 56% felt lonelier and more bored, respectively. 66% was hungrier with increased frequency of snacking (55%) and 39% reported more impulse to eat. Noteworthy, 49% felt unable to follow a recommended diet. No difference in terms of psychological profile was recorded among pre and post-bariatric subjects. Logistic regression analysis on post-bariatric patients showed a relationship between snacking, hunger, eating impulsivity, and anxiety, stress, and/or depression symptoms. The pandemic led to increased psychological distress in patients with a current or past history of obesity, reducing quality of life and affecting dietary compliance. Targeted psychological support is warranted in times of increased stress for fragile subjects such as pre- and post-bariatric patients.

"Discriminating Metabolic Health Status in a Cohort of Nursing Students: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study","Obesity is currently a worldwide health crisis. Nurses are integral members of the primary health care team and have an important role in managing obesity and administering physical activity (PA) for patients. However, research shows that nurses tend to be overweight or obese, have poor metabolic health, and do not meet PA recommendations. This is problematic because PA is linked to both physiological and psychological well-being and may also influence how nurses counsel their patients. Nursing students are the next generation of nurses; however, there is limited research examining PA (among other lifestyle factors) and metabolic health in nursing students. The goal of this research is to examine multiple lifestyle factors (including PA, nutrition, sleep, and stress) and determine whether these factors are associated with metabolic health in full-time undergraduate nursing students. An estimated 320 nursing students (18 years of age and older) will be assessed for their metabolic health. Metabolic status will be determined by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage [skinfold measures (FitSystems Inc)], resting blood pressure [automated oscillatory (Omron Healthcare Inc)], and fasting blood glucose (glucometer). Lifestyle factors will also be measured, including PA and sleep [the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day accelerometry (wGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC)], nutrition [3-day diet log (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems)], and stress [the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, heart rate variability assessments, and salivary cortisol (ELISA, Eagle Biosciences)]. The association between metabolic status and PA, sleep quantity and quality, nutrition, and stress will be examined by linear regression analyses. Differences by year of study in metabolic health status, PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress will be examined by 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To determine the ability of PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress to discriminate prevalent overweight and obesity or poor metabolic status, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed. Statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC). Based on pilot data, we believe senior nursing students will have worse metabolic health (ie, higher BMI and WHR, increased body fat percentage, higher blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose) compared to first-year students. We hypothesize that poor PA participation, poor sleep quantity and quality, increased food intake, poor nutrition, and increased stress will be associated with worse metabolic health in full-time nursing students. The study received funding in February 2020. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, work on this study has been delayed. We are currently completing our application for institutional research ethics approval. Data collection is projected to begin in January 2021, with data collection and analyses expected to be completed by May 2022. This study will be the first published research to examine the relationship between lifestyle choices and metabolic status in nursing students attending a Canadian institution. More importantly, the results of this study will support the development of an informed intervention that will target the identified lifestyle factors, improving the physiological and mental health and well-being of nursing students.

To examine the ethical challenges encountered by nurses caring for patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and to provide nurses with suggestions and support regarding promotion of their mental health. A qualitative study was carried out using a qualitative content analysis. The participants were 18 nurses who agreed to attend an interview and describe their own experiences of providing care to COVID-19 patients in China. They were purposively sampled, and structured, in-depth interviews were performed. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed from February to March 2020. The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Shandong University, China. The findings revealed three main themes and 10 categories. The themes were the following: (1) ethical challenges (people with COVID-19, inequality, professional ethics, and job competency); (2) coping styles (active control and planning, seeking support as well as catharsis, and staying focused); and (3) impacts on career (specialized nursing skills, scientific research ability, and management skills). Nurses faced ethical challenges on multiple fronts in caring for COVID-19 patients.

"Extending understanding of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness and isolation in later life : AÃ‚Â literature review","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents serious challenges across the world. Among these challenges are the possible negative implications for the mental health and well-being of older persons that ongoing social distancing measures may cause. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, aÃ‚Â growing body of literature explored the associations between grandchild caregiving, loneliness and social isolation. We summarize the existing literature on this topic. An association between the provision of grandchild care and reduced feelings of loneliness was found in cross-sectional studies; however, aÃ‚Â longitudinal study identified possible gender differences in the impact of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness, with the commencement of grandchild care linked to grandfathers feeling lonelier. At the conclusion of the summary, we highlight the need for further research in this field.

"Exposure to health misinformation about COVID-19 and increased tobacco and alcohol use: a population-based survey in Hong Kong","Health information about COVID-19 has been circulating in social networking sites, including unproven claims that smoking and alcohol drinking could protect against COVID-19. We examined if exposure to such claims was associated with changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption. We conducted a population-based, landline and mobile phone survey of 1501 randomly sampled adults aged 18 years or older (47.5% male) in Hong Kong in April 2020. Respondents reported if they had ever seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from popular social networking platforms. Current tobacco and alcohol users reported if they had increased or reduced their consumption since the outbreak. Prevalence data were weighted by sex, age and education of the general adult population. 19.0% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.4%) of all respondents reported having seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from social networking sites. Multinomial logistic regression showed that exposure to the claims was significantly associated with increased tobacco use (OR 2.37, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.08 to 5.20) in current tobacco users (N=280) and increased alcohol use (OR 4.16, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.00 to 8.67) in current drinkers (N=722), adjusting for sex, age, education level, alcohol/tobacco use status, home isolation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and survey method. Our results first showed that exposure to health misinformation that smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19 was associated with self-reported increases in tobacco and alcohol consumption in Chinese during the pandemic.","Luk, Zhao, Weng, Wong, Wu, Ho, Lam, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-055960","20200828","advertising and promotion; media; prevention; surveillance and monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4209,""
"Psychological distress and sleep problems when people are under interpersonal isolation during an epidemic: A nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study","During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people are under the dual pressure of interpersonal isolation and concerns about infection. An evaluation of people's psychological status and risk factors is needed to conduct target interventions. This was a nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study using quota and snowball sampling methods during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Participants' characteristics and experiences were obtained by an online questionnaire and telephone review. Psychological distress and sleep problems were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Insomnia Severity Index. A total of 23,500 participants were recruited, and 19,372 valid questionnaires were received from 11 centers. Overall, 11.0-13.3% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms, and 1.9-2.7% had severe symptoms. The prevalence of psychological and sleep problems has increased. Working as frontline medical staff (Odds Ratio ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.406), living in Hubei Province (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.237), close contacts with COVID-19 (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.808), and age 35-49Ã‚Â years (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.310) were risk factors for anxiety symptoms; no outside activity for 2Ã‚Â weeks (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.167) and age 35-49Ã‚Â years (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.198) were risk factors for depression symptoms; and living in Hubei Province (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.376), no outside activity for 2Ã‚Â weeks (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.927), and age 35-49Ã‚Â years (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.262) were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Only 1.9% of participants received counseling during the epidemic. Psychological and sleep problems increased during interpersonal isolation due to COVID-19. Current psychological interventions are far from sufficient.","Wang, Zhang, Ding, Meng, Hu, Liu, Zeng, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.78","20200828","COVID-19; China; cross-sectional study; psychological distress; sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4210,""
"Coping style, social support and psychological distress in the general Chinese population in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic","The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological status of the general population in mainland China during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to explore the factors influencing psychological distress, in order to provide the basis for further psychological intervention programs. We administered three questionnaires on-line to a convenience sample of the general population from different regions of mainland China from February 1 to February 4, 2020. We used the Mandarin versions of the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). We also collected demographic data and other information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing psychological distress. Of 1607 respondents, 1588 returned valid questionnaires and were included in the analysis. Nearly one quarter (22.8%) had high levels of psychological distress (K6 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°13). Individuals with higher psychological distress were more likely to be unmarried, spend more than 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°h per day searching for information about COVID-19, more frequently adopt a passive coping style, and report less social support than those with lower psychological distress. The COVID-19 outbreak in China has a great impact on the mental health status of the general population. Active coping strategies and increased social support are significantly correlated with decreased psychological distress, and may serve as the basis for psychological interventions.","Yu, Li, Li, Xiang, Yuan, Liu, Li, Xiong","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02826-3","20200828","COVID-19; Coping style; Cross-sectional; Psychological distress; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4211,""

"The psychological distress in students during the COVID-19 crisis: An 8-wave longitudinal study","The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in psychological distress during initial stage of the coronavirus pandemic in Croatia. The sample consisted of 363 students with an average age of 23.42 years. The results show that students in Croatia reported average levels of depression, anxiety and stress, with no differences in the degree of psychological distress between the pre-pandemic period and the pandemic period. Of the respondents, 19.48%, 28.8% and 22.08% respectively reported moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress, which remained largely stable during the survey period. All significant differences during the 8-week period show that depression, anxiety and stress generally decrease over time.","Anita Vulic-Prtoric et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611F-19C-F12","20200829","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; anxiety; stress; longitudinal study; students; covid -19 pandemic; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-29","",4213,""
