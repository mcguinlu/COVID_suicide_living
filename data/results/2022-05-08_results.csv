"Factors associated with 60-day adherence to ""safer supply"" opioids prescribed under British Columbia's interim clinical guidance for health care providers to support people who use drugs during COVID-19 and the ongoing overdose emergency","In March 2020, British Columbia issued Risk Mitigation Guidance (RMG) to support prescribing of pharmaceutical alternatives to illicit drugs, in order to reduce risk for COVID-19, overdose, and withdrawal among people who use drugs. This study evaluated factors associated with 60-day adherence to novel opioid alternatives prescribed at an inner-city health centre in Victoria, Canada. A chart review was conducted to collect data on sociodemographic information, medical histories, and follow-up services among all clients prescribed novel opioid alternatives from March 2020-August 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 286). Bivariable and multivariable regression were used to identify independent and adjusted factors associated with 60-day adherence. Overall, 77% of 286 clients were still receiving opioids after 60 days of follow-up. Medications included hydromorphone (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 274), sustained-release oral morphine (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2), and oxycodone (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9). The adjusted odds of 60-day adherence to novel opioid alternatives were significantly higher for those receiving a mental health medication (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.49, 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.26, 11.00), a higher maximum daily dosage of RMG prescriptions (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.03 per mg increase, 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.01, 1.04), and those with continuous receipt of OAT (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.25, 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.67, 15.90). Higher dosages and co-prescription of mental health medications and OAT may help support better adherence to this form of prescriber-based ""safer supply"". Further work is needed to identify optimal prescribing practices and the longer term impacts of differing implementation scenarios.","Selfridge, Card, Kandler, Flanagan, Lerhe, Heaslip, Nguyen, Moher, Pauly, Urbanoski, Fraser","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103709","20220507","COVID-19; Opioid agonist therapy; People who use drugs; Risk mitigation; Safe supply","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-08","",31084,""
"Fear trumps the common good: Psychological antecedents of vaccination attitudes and behaviour","The study investigated antecedents of attitudes towards vaccines against COVID-19 and vaccination behaviour, and sought to identify areas where interventions aimed at increasing vaccination rates would be most effective. A sample of 500 Slovaks (250 women) responded to questions concerning their socio-demographic and personality characteristics, collectivism and individualism, consciousness of future consequences, and emotional responses to both vaccination and the pandemic. The study indicates that helplessness related to the vaccine efficacy evaluation and fear of its potential risks are the strongest antecedents of vaccination behaviour and anti-vaccination attitudes. Jointly with the fear of the COVID-19, they explained over 26% and 33% of variance in behaviour and attitudes, respectively. The results indicate that the efficiency of appeals to solidarity may be limited when fear and helplessness are widespread as they seem to strongly outweigh individuals' outward motivations to get vaccinated.","Adamus, Ã„Å’avojovÃƒÂ¡, MikuÃ…Â¡kovÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103606","20220507","COVID-19; Fear; Helplessness; Threat perception; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-08","",31085,""
"COVID's Impact on Non-communicable Diseases: What We Do Not Know May Hurt Us","In this review, we outline the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-communicable diseases around the world. The mechanisms of COVID-19's impact on non-communicable diseases are both direct and indirect. The direct mechanisms include direct vascular and myocardial injury as well as pancreatic injury increasing incidence of new-onset diabetes. Indirect effects of the pandemic on non-communicable disease include delayed presentation for acute illness including STEMI and the impact of social distancing and quarantine policies on socialization, mental health, physical activity, and the downstream health impacts of inactivity and deconditioning. International focus has been on disease variants, infection control and management, healthcare system, and resource utilization and infection incidence. However, the impact of this pandemic on non-communicable diseases has been largely overlooked but will manifest itself in the coming years to decades.","Gordon Patti, Kohli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-022-01704-6","20220507","COVID-19; Cardiac; Coronavirus; Non-communicable; Pandemic; Sars-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-08","",31086,""
"The Grow It! app-longitudinal changes in adolescent well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: a proof-of-concept study","Adolescent mental health and well-being have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this preregistered longitudinal study, we evaluated whether adolescents' well-being improved after playing the multiplayer serious game app Grow It! During the first lockdown (May-June 2020), 1282 Dutch adolescents played the Grow It! app (ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.67, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.07, 68% girls). During the second lockdown (December-May 2020 onwards), an independent cohort of 1871 adolescents participated (ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.66, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.70, 81% girls). Adolescents answered online questionnaires regarding affective and cognitive well-being, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and impact of COVID-19 at baseline. Three to six weeks later, the baseline questionnaire was repeated and user experience questions were asked (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°462 and NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°733 for the first and second cohort). In both cohorts, affective and cognitive well-being increased after playing the Grow It! app (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 6.806, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 6.77, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 6.12, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 5.93, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; Cohen's d range 0.20-0.32). At the individual level, 41-53% of the adolescents increased in their affective or cognitive well-being. Adolescents with higher risk profiles (i.e., more depressive symptoms, lower atmosphere at home, and more COVID-19 impact) improved more strongly in their well-being. Positive user evaluations and app engagement were unrelated to changes in affective and cognitive well-being. This proof-of-concept study tentatively suggests that Grow It! supported adolescents during the pandemic.","Dietvorst, Legerstee, Vreeker, Koval, Mens, Keijsers, Hillegers","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-01982-z","20220507","Experience sampling method; Internalizing problems; Prevention; Serious game; e-health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-08","",31087,""

"Differential impacts of COVID-19 and associated responses on the health, social well-being and food security of users of supportive social and health programs during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","The effects of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the lives of underserved populations are underexplored. This study aimed to identify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health responses on the health and social well-being, and food security of users of Housing First (HF) services in Toronto (Canada) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted from July to October 2020 in a subsample of 20 adults with a history of homelessness and serious mental disorders who were receiving HF services in Toronto. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect narrative data regarding health and social well-being, food security and access to health, social and preventive services. A thematic analysis framework guided analyses and interpretation of the data. The COVID-19 pandemic and response measures had a variable impact on the health, social well-being and food security of participants. Around 40% of participants were minimally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, among the remaining participants (impacted group), some experienced onset of new mental health problems (anxiety, stress, paranoia) or exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorders (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder). They also struggled with isolation and loneliness and had limited leisure activities and access to food goods. The pandemic also contributed to disparities in accessing and receiving healthcare services and treatment continuity for non-COVID-19 health issues for the negatively impacted participants. Overall, most participants were able to adhere to COVID-19 public health measures and get reliable information on COVID-19 preventive measures facilitated by having access to the phone, internet and media devices and services. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated response measures impacted the health, social well-being, leisure and food security of people with experiences of homelessness and mental disorders who use supportive social and housing services in diverse ways.","Mejia-Lancheros, Alfayumi-Zeadna, Lachaud, O'Campo, Gogosis, Da Silva, Stergiopoulos, Hwang, Thulien","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13826","20220507","COVID-19 pandemic; food security; health; homelessness; response measures; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-08","",31089,""

"Public Sentiment Analysis in Social Media on the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Using VADER Lexicon Polarity","Recently Natural Language Processing (NLP) constituted an important area of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence, where the virtual and digital world has become an essential aspect of our daily lives. Sentiment analysis and data mining are sub-fields of NLP, which draw the attention of researchers to search and mine various issues on social media. This study explores the public's sentiments and opinions towards the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination doses in Saudi Arabia. It tries to provide insights on the motivations and barriers in taking the first and second vaccine doses and how the public's awareness and attitudes differ in the two doses. The research objects are 6.232 public tweets and comments that have been harvested from official social media platforms (Twitter and YouTube) between December 19, 2020, and December 10, 2021. The sentiment analysis measured polarity using the NLTK VADER analyzer, and the opinions were identified and classified based on the multidimensional scaling method. The results show that in the case of the first vaccine dose of the 2989 opinions enrolled, 61.5% of the public were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccinationâ€”the majority trust the vaccine safety and the Ministry of Health measures and decisions. While 21.1% show negative attitudes towards the vaccination, most of them untrust the vaccine and are worried about its syndromes. In the case of the second vaccine dose of the 3,243 opinions enrolled, 63.2% also show positive attitudes toward taking the vaccine. Trusting the vaccine safety and not being prevented from work, travel, and other activities are the primary motivations to receive the vaccine in this phase. While negative sentiments scored 30.3%, the most frequent determinant is the suspicion of the vaccine safety, symptoms, and decision discrepancies. Identifying public sentiments and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination would provide a better understanding of the reasons behind vaccine rejection or acceptance and would help the health policymakers better develop and implement vaccine awareness strategies and appropriate communication to enhance vaccine taking.","Jeehaan Algaraady et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E004C-5F8-AD9","20220507","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Applied Linguistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Language Description and Documentation; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Discourse and Text Linguistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities; sentiment analysis; vaccination; data mining; content analysis; opinions classification; multidimensional scaling; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-08","",31091,""
