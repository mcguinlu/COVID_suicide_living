"Ongoing use of SSRIs and the hospital course of COVID-19 patients: a retrospective outcome analysis","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV2 virus continues to have devastating consequences worldwide. Though vaccinations have helped to reduce the impact of the virus, new strains still pose a threat to unvaccinated, and to a lesser extent vaccinated, individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to identify treatments that can prevent the development of severe COVID-19. Recently, acute use of SSRI antidepressants in COVID+ patients has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms compared to placebo. Since SSRIs are a widely used anti-depressant, the aim of this study was to determine if COVID+ patients already on SSRI treatment upon admission to the hospital had reduced mortality compared to COVID+ patients not on chronic SSRI treatment.

MethodsA retrospective observational study design was used. Electronic medical records of 9,043 patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 from 03/2020 to 03/2021from six hospitals were queried for demographic and clinical information. Using R, a logistic regression model was run with mortality as the outcome and SSRI status as the exposure. An adjusted logistic regression model was run to account for age category, gender, and race. All tests were considered significant at p of 0.05 or less.

ResultsIn this sample, no patients admitted on SSRIs had them discontinued. This is consistent with current recommendations. There was no significant difference in the odds of dying between COVID+ patients on chronic SSRIs vs COVID+ patients not taking SSRIs, after controlling for age category, gender, and race. The odds of COVID+ patients on SSRIs dying was 0.98 (95%CI: 0.81, 1.18) compared to COVID+ patients not on SSRIs (p=0.83).

ConclusionIn times of pandemics due to novel infectious agents it is difficult, but critical to evaluate safety and efficacy of drugs that might be repurposed for treatment. This large sample size of 9,043 patients suggests that there will be no significant benefit to use of SSRIs to decrease mortality rates for hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who are not currently on SSRI medications. This study shows the utility of large clinical databases in addressing the urgent issue of determining what commonly prescribed drugs might be useful in treating COVID-19.","Steven H.

"Relationship among work-treatment balance, job stress, and work engagement in Japan: A cross-sectional study","There is a drive to support workers undergoing medical treatment who wish to continue working in Japan, known as the work-treatment balance. It is hoped that this support for the work-treatment balance could boost their mental health. This study examines the relationship among the work-treatment balance, job stress, and work engagement. This study was conducted in December 2020 in Japan, with 27,036 participants. We divided the participants into three groups by the receipt state of support for the work treatment balance: control group (no need the support), unsupported group, and supported group. The scores of the parameters of the job content questionnaire and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-3) were compared among groups using a multilevel regression with age-sex or multivariate-adjusted models. In the two models, the job control score of the unsupported group was significantly lower than that of the control group. The two social support scores of the supported group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The scores of the UWES-3 of the unsupported group were significantly lower than those of the control group. The support of work-treatment balance for workers could have a positive impact on their mental health.","Kazunori Ikegami; Hajime Ando; Hisashi Eguchi; Mayumi Tsuji; Seiichiro Tateishi; Koji Mori; Keiji Muramatsu; Yoshihisa Fujino; Akira Ogami","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.23.21265407","20211026","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19238,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on African American cancer survivors","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had profound effects on population health to date. African American cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to developing severe consequences; therefore, understanding the impact of the virus on this patient population is critical. The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors cohort is a unique effort to understand the determinants of poor outcomes in African American cancer survivors. To date, more than 4500 cancer survivors and nearly 950 primary caregivers have been enrolled; participation includes a survey and the collection of biospecimens, medical records, and tumor tissue. Beginning in the spring of 2020, a supplemental survey focusing on the impact of COVID-19 was offered to enrolled participants. The analysis included 890 survivors. Nearly all survivors (&gt;99%) reported changes in their daily activities in an effort to reduce the risk of infection. More than 40% of the survivors reported some disruption in their access to medical care. A substantial proportion of the survivors (&gt;40%) reported feeling anxious, depressed, and/or isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 40% of the patients reported changes in health behaviors shown to negatively affect survivorship outcomes (physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol use) as a result of the pandemic. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on African American cancer survivors is substantial: it has affected both their physical and mental health. Coupled with changes in health behaviors, these factors will likely affect outcomes in this high-risk patient population, and this makes further study and interventions necessary to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes.","Beebe-Dimmer, Lusk, Ruterbusch, Baird, Pandolfi, Wenzlaff, Hastert, Harper, Thompson, Schwartz","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33987","20211027","African American; coronavirus; epidemiology; outcomes; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19239,""
"Online mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic","Identify users, services, and reasons for seeking online mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive, retrospective study, with documentary analysis of medical records of users served between April and July 2020. Of the 258 accesses, 159 were complete, and 99 were offline messages. Although there were 61 (38.36%) consultations in May, in April, there were 49 (30.82%) in 18 days of reception. More than 89% of accesses were women between 40 and 59 years. Among the motivations in the search for care, anxiety, fear, depression, sadness, crying, stress, and suicidal ideation stand out. Chat is a quick, early and short-wait intervention opportunity for people in need of mental health care.

"Machine Learning-based Predictive Modelling of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms During Eight Months of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic: Repeated Cross-Sectional Survey Study","Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic has increased the burden of mental illness on Canadian adults. However, the complex combination of demographic, economic, lifestyle, and perceived health risks contributing to patterns of anxiety and depression have not been explored. Objectives: To harness flexible machine learning methods to identify constellations of factors related to symptoms of mental illness, and to understand their changes over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional samples of Canadian adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18yrs) completed online surveys in six waves, May-Dec 2020 (n=6,021), using quota sampling strategies to match the English-speaking Canadian population on age, gender, and region. Surveys measured anxiety and depression symptoms, socio-demographics, substance use, and perceived COVID-19 risks and worries. First, principal components analysis was used to condense highly comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms into a single data-driven measure of emotional distress. Second, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a machine learning algorithm that can model non-linear and interactive relationships, was used to regress this measure on all included explanatory variables. Variable importance and effects across time were explored using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results: PCA of responses to nine anxiety and depression questions on an ordinal scale revealed a primary latent factor, termed ""emotional distress"", explaining 76% of variation in all nine measures. Our XGBoost model explained a substantial proportion of variance in emotional distress (r2=0.39). The three most important items predicting elevated emotional distress were increased worries about finances (SHAP=0.17), worries about getting COVID-19 (0.17), and younger age (0.13). Hopefulness was associated with emotional distress and moderated the impacts of several other factors. Predicted emotional distress exhibited a non-linear pattern over time, with highest predicted symptoms in May and November, and lowest in June. Conclusions: Our results highlight factors which may exacerbate emotional distress during the current and possible future pandemics, including a role of hopefulness in moderating distressing effects of other factors. The pandemic disproportionately affected emotional distress among younger adults and those economically impacted.","Hueniken, SomÃƒÂ©, Abdelhack, Taylor, Elton Marshall, Wickens, Hamilton, Wells, Felsky","https://doi.org/10.2196/32876","20211027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19241,""
"<i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i> CCFM6432 mitigates chronic stress-induced anxiety and gut microbial abnormalities","The discovery of psychobiotics has improved the therapeutic choices available for clinical mental disorders and shows promise for regulating mental health in people by combining the properties of food and medicine. A <i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i> strain CCFM6432 was previously isolated and its mood-regulating effect was investigated in this study. Viable bacteria were given to chronically stressed mice for five weeks, and then the behavioral, neurobiological, and gut microbial changes were determined. CCFM6432 significantly reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors, mitigated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, and reversed the abnormal expression of hippocampal phosphorylated CREB and the c-Fos protein. In particular, CCFM6432 improved the gut microbial composition by inhibiting the over-proliferated pathogenic bacteria (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Escherichia-shigella</i>) and promoting beneficial bacteria growth (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>). Lactic acid, rather than bacteriocin, was further confirmed as the key compound that determined the antimicrobial activity of CCFM6432. Collectively, these results first proved the psychobiotic potential of the <i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i> strain. Ingestion of CCFM6432, or fermented food containing it, may facilitate mental health management in daily life, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tian, Chen, Qian, Zou, Zhu, Zhao, Zhang, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01608c","20211027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19242,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the clinical response to dupilumab treatment and the psychological status of non-infected atopic patients","Dupilumab is an effective treatment for atopic dermatitis and was found to improve results of clinician- and patient-oriented tests with relevant benefits across multiple domains related to the disease. To investigate the effects of significant psychological stress on clinician- and patient-oriented tests for severe AD patients treated with dupilumab. Patients were investigated before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a severely affected area. Forty-five adult patients suffering from severe AD were enrolled. Clinician-oriented (EASI, SCORAD and NRS scores for sleep loss and itching) and patient-oriented tests (DLQI, POEM and HADS) were administered at baseline (T0) and after 16 (T1) and 24 (T2) weeks. The T2 examination took place just before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further examination took place at 32 weeks (T3) during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. In comparison to baseline, dupilumab treatment rapidly improved the scores of all tests. After this, the pandemic and lockdown started, and scores of clinician-oriented tests remained almost stable, while patient-oriented scores markedly deteriorated, although they remained better than at baseline. Some personal and social situations seemed to be linked to a worse result. Despite dupilumab being effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission of AD, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown significantly impaired patients' perception of the disease, quality of life and anxiety and/or depression. However, this psychological status did not modify the therapeutic response to dupilumab.","Rovati, Rossi, Gelmetti, Tomasi, Calzavara-Pinton, Venturini, Calzavara-Pinton, Arisi","https://doi.org/10.1684/ejd.2021.4135","20211027","COVID-19; atopic dermatitis; dupilumab","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19243,""
"""A World Upside Down"": Experiences of Informal Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The caregiving process may result in negative outcomes for caregivers. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has contributed additional challenges for family caregivers of older adults with chronic illnesses. Little is known about the additional impact of the pandemic on caregivers. The purpose of the current study was to understand the effects of the pandemic on the caregiving experience. A qualitative descriptive content analysis was conducted on nine blogs of caregivers of older adults. Blogs were identified using purposive sampling. Bloggers were American, middle-aged, and caring for an older adult with dementia. Caregivers reported ""a world upside down"" and change that contributed to uncertainty; the need for support; and how isolation, depressive symptoms, and threat contributed to negative psychological well-being. Managing and struggling in response to caregiving challenges and wishing for resolution were also reported.

"I Am a Nurse, Not a Martyr: Qualitative Investigation of Nurses' Experiences During Onset of the Coronavirus Pandemic","Nurses have always played an essential role during epidemics, risking their lives caring for sick and dying patients. However, the unprecedented nature of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has left organizations and healthcare professionals ill-prepared and under-equipped to manage the severity, manifestations, and acute and long-term implications. While COVID-19 has presented profound physical and mental health implications for nurses, we know little about nurses' professional experiences within their organizational context. Thus, this qualitative descriptive study fills that gap through in-depth exploration of nurses' shared professional experiences working in hospitals during the first surge of COVID-19 in the United States. Twenty-two nurses were interviewed via telephone during April and May 2020. Through thematic analysis four main themes emerged: (1) fear, (2) collective resilience through shared trauma, (3) uncharted territory, and (4) perceived disposability. Nurses felt ill-praepared for the rapid changes wrought by COVID-19; yet they also felt proud with a renewed sense of meaning in their work. While unit colleagues were a great source of strength, nurses still reported disappointment, even feeling abandoned by their organizations. Our study indicates that nurses relied on one another to cope and find meaning. These findings are invaluable for policy development and the establishment of preventive and early intervention strategies. Done right, such efforts could better support nurses by encouraging team building, protection, and rewards to maintain nurses' wellbeing during such outbreaks and in their aftermath. Organizations also ought to make nurses' health and wellbeing a priority by streamlining communication, transparency, and leadership visibility.","Jun, Rosemberg","https://doi.org/10.1177/15271544211054435","20211027","COVID-19; nursing; occupational groups; organization; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19245,""
"Does Walking Reduce Postpartum Depressive Symptoms? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","<b><i>Background:</i></b> Rising demands for traditional postpartum depression (PPD) treatment options (<i>e.g.</i>, psychiatry), especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are increasingly difficult to meet. More accessible treatment options (<i>e.g.</i>, walking) are needed. Our objective is to determine the impact of walking on PPD severity. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A structured search of seven electronic databases for randomized controlled trials published between 2000 and July 29, 2021 was completed. Studies were included if walking was the sole or primary aerobic exercise modality. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies reporting PPD symptoms measured using a clinically validated tool. A simple count of positive/null effect studies was undertaken as part of a narrative summary. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Five studies involving 242 participants were included (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Ë†Â¼28.9 years; 100% with mild-to-moderate depression). Interventions were 12 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4) and 24 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1) weeks long. Each assessed PPD severity using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and was included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect estimate suggests that relative to controls walking yielded clinically significant decreases in mean EPDS scores from baseline to intervention end (pooled mean differenceÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-4.01; 95% CI: -7.18 to -0.84, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°86%). The narrative summary provides preliminary evidence that walking-only, supervised, and group-based interventions, including 90-120+ minutes per week of moderate-intensity walking, may produce greater EPDS reductions. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> While limited by a relatively small number of included studies, pooled effect estimates suggest that walking may help mothers manage PPD. This is the first-time walking as treatment for PPD, an exercise modality that uniquely addresses many barriers faced by mothers, has been summarized in a systematic way.

Using 2020 Uniform Data System data, the author analyzed 1,113 CHCs in the 50 U.S. states (representing 26,865,015 total patients). Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between COVID-19 prevalence and the percentage of patients who screened positive for depression and had follow-up depression care documented at CHCs in 2020. On average, each increase of 1 percentage point in COVID-19 prevalence within a CHC patient population was independently associated with a 0.47-percentage point decrease of eligible patients with a follow-up depression care plan documented in 2020. Findings appear to be consistent with recent evidence indicating disruptions in health care delivery coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Exploring the scope of homoeopathy in combating the unfortunate consequences of post-COVID-19 survivors based on non-COVID conditions: a narrative review","The long-term consequences of COVID-19 survivors care and post-coronavirus infection are not yet well understood. The review aims to see whether homoeopathy can help COVID-19 survivors recover from its consequences and improve their quality of life. A systematic search of published articles for post-COVID sequelae and the impact of Homoeopathy were conducted. For the literature search, the major electronic bio-medical database PubMed/MEDLINE was used. In addition, supplementary searches were conducted through the references of those published articles. A total of 113 records were identified of which 61 studies included for this review. Homoeopathy is effective in the treatment of mental disorders including anxiety and depressive disorder (ADD), some research studies have found, although systematic reviews disagree. Likewise, some medical societies denounce homoeopathy for pain management; other literature shows that it can be used to treat pain effectively. Homoeopathy can aid in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as Crataegus, a homoeopathic medication, was found to be just as effective as a standard angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretic treatment for minor cardiac insufficiency. The outcomes for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Influenza, and Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIs) are also promising. Based on the results of homoeopathy in non-COVID conditions, it can be thought of in the management of post-COVID-19 outcomes. Consequently, we propose that while investigating post-COVID-19 patient rehabilitation, homoeopathic management may be included as part of the follow-up route and as much data as possible in the context of homoeopathy should be collected, so that in future, the role of homoeopathy in dealing with it can be better demonstrated.","Dixit, Giri, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1515/jcim-2021-0200","20211027","COVID-19; COVID-19 post-intensive care syndrome; homoeopathy; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19248,""
"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Mental Health Symptoms during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Southeast Asia","The Covid-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the mental health of the general public and high-risk groups worldwide. Due to its proximity and close links to China, Southeast Asia was one of the first regions to be affected by the outbreak. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general adult population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in Southeast Asia during the course of the first year of the pandemic. Several literature databases were systemically searched for articles published up to February 2021 and two reviewers independently evaluated all relevant studies using pre-determined criteria. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis model. In total, 32 samples from 25 studies with 20,352 participants were included. Anxiety was assessed in all 25 studies and depression in 15 studies with pooled prevalence rates of 22% and 16% respectively. Only two studies assessed insomnia, which was estimated at 19%. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was similar amongst frontline HCWs (18%), general HCWs (17%), and students (20%) whilst being noticeably higher in the general population (27%). This is the first systematic review to investigate the mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Southeast Asia. A considerable proportion of the general population and HCWs reported mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression; the pooled prevalence rater, however, remain significantly lower than those reported in other areas such as China and Europe.

"The Relationship between the Fear of Covid-19, Depression, and Spiritual Well-Being in Pregnant Women","The purpose of this study wasÃ‚Â to explore the relationship between pregnant women's fear of coronavirus (COVID-19), depression, and spiritual well-being. This cross-sectional research was carried out with 336 pregnant women living in a city in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey between the 1st of March and 30th of March 2021. For data collection, the scales of the Fear of COVID-19, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Spiritual Well-being were administered to the participants. The pregnant women's fear of COVID-19 was found to be at a moderate level, their depression was at a mild level, and their spiritual well-being was above the moderate level. It wasÃ‚Â found that there wasÃ‚Â a significant negative correlation between the spiritual well-being levels of pregnant women and their fear of COVID-19 and depression. Moreover, it wasÃ‚Â also found that there was a significant positive correlation between pregnant women's levels of fear of COVID-19 and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Burnout Among Surgeons in the UK During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cohort Study","Surgeon burnout has implications for patient safety and workforce sustainability. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of burnout among surgeons in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online survey was set in the UK National Health Service and involved 601 surgeons across the UK of all specialities and grades. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and aÃ‚Â bespoke questionnaire. Outcome measures included emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and lowÃ‚Â personal accomplishment, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). A total of 142 surgeons reported having contracted COVID-19. Burnout prevalence was particularly high in the emotional exhaustion (57%) and depersonalisation (50%) domains, while lower on the lowÃ‚Â personal accomplishment domain (15%). Burnout prevalence was unrelated to COVID-19 status; however, the greater the perceived impact of COVID-19 on work, the higher the prevalence of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation. Degree of worry about contracting COVID-19 oneself and degree of worry about family and friends contacting COVID-19 was positively associated with prevalence on all three burnout domains. Across all three domains, burnout prevalence was exceptionally high in the Core Trainee 1-2 and Specialty Trainee 1-2 grades. These findings highlight potential undesirable implications for patient safety arising from surgeon burnout. Moreover, there is a need for ongoing monitoring in addition to an enhanced focus on mental health self-care in surgeon training and the provision of accessible and confidential support for practising surgeons.","Houdmont, Daliya, Theophilidou, Adiamah, Hassard, Lobo, Ahmed, Babu, Baker, Bartlett, Beckingham, Bhatti, Brooks, Brown, Burke, Byrne, Chetter, Cook, Coulston, Cruddas, Dias, Dor, Dube, Grant, Hammond, Hargest, Joachim, Joseph, Kara, Karavias, Kotecha, Kushairi, Lal, Lam, Lasrado, Lee, Mann, Mannu, Maxwell-Armstrong, McCaslin, McDermot, Miller, Miller, Morgan, Nandhra, Narayanasamy, O'Brien, Parry, Peters, Pitsika, Psaltis, Sargen, Sarmah, Shyamsundar, Reddy, Rollins, Roslan, Shalhoub, Stanislas, Tan, Tewari, Thomas, Thomas, Tiernan, Toogood, Trimble, Vauhan, Wheldon, White, White, Wijetunga, Wilson, Winterborn, Wyld, Young","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-021-06351-6","20211027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19251,""
"Critical Care Nurses' Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A US National Survey","Given critical care nurses' high prepandemic levels of moral distress and burnout, the COVID-19 pandemic will most likely have a tremendous influence on intensive care unit (ICU) nurses' mental health and continuation in the ICU workforce. To describe the experiences of ICU nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Nurses who worked in ICUs in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited to complete a survey from October 2020 through early January 2021 through social media and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. Three open-ended questions focused on the experiences of ICU nurses during the pandemic. Of 498 nurses who completed the survey, 285 answered the open-ended questions. Nurses reported stress related to a lack of evidence-based treatment, poor patient prognosis, and lack of family presence in the ICU. Nurses perceived inadequate leadership support and inequity within the health care team. Lack of consistent community support to slow the spread of COVID-19 or recognition that COVID-19 was real increased nurses' feelings of isolation. Nurses reported physical and emotional symptoms including exhaustion, anxiety, sleeplessness, and moral distress. Fear of contracting COVID-19 or of infecting family and friends was also prevalent. Intensive care unit nurses in the United States experienced unprecedented and immense burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding these experiences provides insights into areas that must be addressed to build and sustain an ICU nurse workforce. Studies are needed to further describe nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify effective resources that support ICU nurse well-being.","Guttormson, Calkins, McAndrew, Fitzgerald, Losurdo, Loonsfoot","https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2022312","20211027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19252,""
"Individual Differences in the Affective Response to Pandemic-related Stressors in COVID-19 Healthcare Workers","We investigated the evolving prevalence of mood and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers from May, 2020 to January, 2021; risk factors for adverse outcomes; and characteristic modes of affective responses to pandemic-related stressors. 2,307 healthcare workers (78.9% female, modal age 25-34) participated in an online survey assessing depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), demographic variables, and self-reported impact of pandemic-related stressors. 334 subjects were reassessed Ã¢Ë†Â¼6 months later. The prevalence of clinically significant depression and anxiety was 45.3% and 43.3%, respectively, and a majority (59.9%-62.9%) of those individuals had persistent significant symptoms at 6-month follow-up. Younger age, female gender, and specific occupations (support staff &gt; nurses &gt; physicians) were associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptoms. The most important risk factors were social isolation and fear of contracting COVID-19. The prevalence of clinically significant mood and anxiety symptoms increased by 39.8% from May, 2020 to January, 2021. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were highly correlated and associated with nearly identical risk factors, suggesting that they are not capturing independent constructs in this sample. Principal components analysis identified seven orthogonal symptom domains with unique risk factors. Clinically significant mood and anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent and persistent among healthcare workers, and are associated with numerous risk factors, the strongest of which are related to pandemic stressors and potentially modifiable. Interventions aimed at reducing social isolation and mitigating the impact of fear of infection warrant further study.","Zebley, Wolk, McAllister, Lynch, Mikofsky, Liston","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.08.008","20211027","COVID-19; Depression; anxiety; diagnostic heterogeneity; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19253,""
"QUALITY EVALUATION OF STRESS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION APPS FOR COVID-19","COVID-19 has caused increased stress, anxiety and depression with increased barriers to treatment. Mobile apps offer a potential solution, but there is no information on the quality of such apps recommended for COVID-19. This study aims to evaluate the quality of stress, anxiety and depression apps recommended for COVID-19. A search was conducted to identify relevant apps on the iOS and Android platforms. 44 apps were evaluated using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), and the American Psychiatric Association's app evaluation model for data privacy and security. Overall quality scores of iOS and Android apps were 3.69Ã‚Â±0.43 and 3.66Ã‚Â±0.47. Thirty percent had good/excellent overall scores. In general, the iOS and Android versions of the apps scored best for functionality (4.21Ã‚Â±0.48, 4.12Ã‚Â±0.53), followed by aesthetics (3.84Ã‚Â±0.50, 3.78Ã‚Â±0.56), information (3.39Ã‚Â±0.54, 3.40Ã‚Â±0.60), and engagement (3.31Ã‚Â±0.81, 3.34Ã‚Â±0.84). Over half (59%) shared personal information with third parties and 14% were compliant with data protection standards. Only free apps available in Singapore were evaluated. Our results are time sensitive due to addition, removal, and update of apps in the app stores, thus our results should be extrapolated with caution to apps from other countries and paid apps. Apps that addressed all three conditions had the highest overall quality scores. The top ranked apps (Sanvello, Woebot, Happify, Youper, Bloom) were of good quality, but majority were of acceptable quality and had room for improvement.

"Prevalence of Psychological Distress in Hawai'i during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring Disparities Using 11 Waves of Data from the Household Pulse Survey","Utilizing 11 waves of data from the Household Pulse Survey collected between April and November 2020, this study examines disparities in psychological distress (defined as having symptoms of anxiety/depression) among adult residents of Hawai'i during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that 36.4% of the respondents reported symptoms of distress. Younger age, female, and lower household income were associated with higher levels of psychological distress than older age, male, and higher household income. The prevalence ratios of distress for those aged 18-24, 25-34, 35-44 and females were 43.1%, 47.3%, 44.1%, and 39.3% respectively. Asians experienced lower prevalence compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Two practical implications are offered. First, the economic sequelae of COVID-19 impact psychological distress even when the community infection rate is stable. Second, disparities in psychosocial distress demonstrate that social and economic resources are needed by social groups such as young adults, females, and racial/ethnic minorities that have experienced the highest impact. Strategies need to be developed to mitigate the unavoidable local consequences of a pandemic.","Zhang, Wu, Walkover","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+of+Psychological+Distress+in+Hawai'i+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Exploring+Disparities+Using+11+Waves+of+Data+from+the+Household+Pulse+Survey.","20211027","Adults; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi; Psychological Distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19255,""
"Evaluating changes in student health, wellbeing and social circumstances before and during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Australia","The impacts of COVID-19 have been felt on a global scale, with associated physical distancing restrictions and economic downturn having flow-on effects for mental health and wellbeing across the community, and for university students in particular. First-year pharmaceutical and medical science students completing a common introductory population health course at an Australian university are routinely surveyed at the beginning of the semester as part of the course. Survey data inform teaching approaches based on understanding the 'real life' commitments and health profiles of students, and deidentified data form part of the teaching material. The 2020 student cohort was invited to complete a second follow-up survey during COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions. A total of <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 126 students completed both the initial and follow-up surveys (50.6% response rate), and <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 99 (39.8% of the total cohort) consented for their data to be included in research. There was a non-significant decrease in student employment; however, 22% of all students reported loss of work due to COVID-19. There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of students undertaking sufficient levels of physical activity, and a statistically significant increase in reported family stressors associated with loss of employment or an inability to gain employment between March and May 2020. Two-thirds of respondents reported increased stress as an impact of the transition to online learning. Implementation of holistic strategies, incorporating attention to additional factors influencing students' capacity to engage in study, and which may have long-term impacts across the life of the degree program, should be considered.","Post, Vitry, Baldock","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12078","20211027","COVID-19; Mental health; Pharmaceutical and medical science students; Social circumstances/determinants; University student wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19256,""
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: the psychological well-being in a cohort of workers of a multinational company","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychological well-being (PWB) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in workers of a multinational company. Employees (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years) were recruited from Latin American, North American, New Zealand and European sites of a multinational company operative during all the pandemic period. The self-reported Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWBI) was employed to assess the global PWB and the effects on 6 sub-domains: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, general health and vitality. The influencing role of age, gender, geographical location, COVID-19 epidemiology, and restrictive measures adopted to control the pandemic was explored. A total of 1335 workers completed the survey. The aggregate median PWB global score was in a positive range, with significantly better outcomes detected in the Mexican and Colombian Latin American sites compared to the other worldwide countries (p&lt;0.001). Among the European locations, a significantly higher PWB score was determined in Spain compared to the German and French sites (p&lt;0.05). Comparable geographical trends were demonstrated for all the PWB sub-domains. Male workers had a significantly better PWB compared to females (p&lt;0.05), while a negative correlation emerged with aging (p=0.01). COVID-19 epidemiology and pandemic control measures had no clear effects on PWB.

"Peer Phubbing and Chinese College Students' Smartphone Addiction During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Boredom Proneness and the Moderating Role of Refusal Self-Efficacy","COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the physical behavior and mental health of people. Long-term and strict isolation policies are widely used to ensure social distancing, which may cause excessive smartphone use and increase the risk of smartphone addiction. Previous researchers have identified that some factors that affect smartphone addiction, but there was little research conducted during COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to examine the effect of peer phubbing on smartphone addiction, how boredom proneness may mediate this effect, and lastly how refusal self-efficacy may moderate the indirect and direct pathways during COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1396 college students (mean age=20.48, SD=1.08) were surveyed and completed four scales (Peer Phubbing Scale, Refusal Self-efficacy Scale, Smartphone Addiction Index Scale, Boredom Proneness Scale). The statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS 22.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro. This study found that peer phubbing was positively associated with smartphone addiction. Boredom proneness mediated the effect of peer phubbing and smartphone addiction. Furthermore, refusal self-efficacy moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and smartphone addiction as well as boredom proneness and smartphone addiction. Specifically, peer phubbing had a greater impact on smartphone addiction for college students with higher levels of refusal self-efficacy, and the boredom proneness on smartphone addiction was stronger for college students with low levels of refusal self-efficacy. This study is important in investigating how peer phubbing is related to the smartphone addiction of Chinese college students during COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that college students' boredom proneness and refusal self-efficacy may be prime targets for prevention and intervention programs. Thus, this study explored ""how"" and ""when"" peer phubbing may enhance college students' smartphone addiction during COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Ye, Yu","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S335407","20211027","COVID-19; Chinese college students; boredom proneness; peer phubbing; refusal self-efficacy; smartphone addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19258,""
"Pain Management and Opioid Therapy: Persistent Knowledge Gaps Among Primary Care Providers","Given the opioid epidemic in the US, it is vital that clinicians who prescribe opioids for pain management to do so in an evidence-based manner, eg considering all pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options, assessing risk of opioid use disorder prior to initiating opioids. Continuing education regarding the evidence-based prescribing of opioids is now required for US healthcare providers who prescribe opioids. A ""blueprint"" of the content to be included in continuing education programs was developed by the US Food and Drug Administration and updated in 2018. To understand the baseline knowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals in prescribing opioids for pain management, we posed 27 unique knowledge-based questions and 1 confidence question to clinician participants before or during 2 continuing educational programs that were based respectively on the 2016 and 2018 FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) educational blueprints for pain management. Overall, 5571 clinicians completed these programs, including 1925 physicians (1516 [79%] identifying as primary care), 1181 physician assistants, 737 advanced practice nurses, 719 nurses, and 479 pharmacists. Responses to pretest questions in both programs indicated profound and persistent gaps in knowledge, particularly in definitions and mechanisms of pain, general principles of pharmacologic analgesic therapy, and specific aspects of opioid analgesic therapy and addiction. Participants in both programs also expressed limited confidence in their abilities to incorporate patient engagement techniques into pain management or develop a treatment plan for a patient with chronic pain. These data support an ongoing need for comprehensive clinician-based education as outlined in the FDA REMS educational blueprint, especially given recent data of escalating overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Williamson, Martin, Argoff, Gharibo, McCarberg, Atkinson, Berger, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S316637","20211027","CME; REMS; analgesics; chronic pain; continuing medical education; opioid; opioid-related disorders; pain management; primary health care; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19259,""

Lockdown policies strongly restrict human mobility but mobility reduce does harm to economics. Governments meet a thorny problem in balancing the pros and cons of lockdown policies, but lack comprehensive and quantified guides. Based on millions of financial transaction records, and billions of mobility data, we tracked spatio-temporal business networks and human daily mobility, then proposed a high-resolution two-sided framework to assess the epidemiological performance and economic damage of different lockdown policies. We found that the pandemic duration under the strictest lockdown is less about two months than that under the lightest lockdown, which makes the strictest lockdown characterize both epidemiologically and economically efficient. Moreover, based on the two-sided model, we explored the spatial lockdown strategy. We argue that cutting off intercity commuting is significant in both epidemiological and economical aspects, and finally helped governments figure out the Pareto optimal solution set of lockdown strategy.","Zhang, Li, Zhang, Li, Chen, Song, Shibasaki, Yan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103502","20211027","COVID-19; Economic damage; Epidemiological performance; Metropolitan lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19263,""

A total of 133 college students from different U.S. universities completed a short online questionnaire as soon as they came back from their study abroad experience (T1) and approximately six months after (T2), when they were resuming their Fall 2020 academic semester. Consistent with the stress process model, secondary stressors associated with reacculturation were predictive, concurrently and longitudinally, of mental health outcomes, especially loneliness, indicating that students who had the hardest time returning home unexpectedly were at the highest risk for worsened mental health over the following months. These findings reveal that reacculturation following unplanned termination of a study abroad experience is not an event as much as it is a process that unfolds over a period of months, as would be understood from the perspective of the stress process model.","Fanari, Segrin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2021.04.013","20211027","COVID-19; Loneliness; Psychological health; Reacculturative stress; Reentry shock; Study abroad","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19264,""
"Mental health risk factors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, distancing measures were enforced to reduce virus spread, which likely had an impact on the overall mental health of the population. To investigate the prevalence of mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety and insomnia), and associated risk factors, during a physical distancing period imposed in the first wave of COVID-19. During the first month of Portugal's state of emergency, an online survey was created and disseminated through social media channels. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were assessed via self-reported questionnaires. Univariate linear regressions were used to identify associations between the collected variables and mental health outcomes. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for clinical outcomes, with adjustment for potential confounders. We analysed data from 1626 participants: a significant proportion showed depression (30.2%), anxiety (53.1%) and insomnia (36.3%) symptoms. Multivariate regression models showed that being male and working from home were protective for all mental health outcomes analysed, whereas the perception of infection, being under psychiatric care and taking medication were risk factors (P &lt; 0.05). Days in isolation and being unemployed were risk factors for depression and insomnia (P &lt; 0.05). Younger age and being a student were risk factors for depression, whereas being a healthcare professional was protective (P &lt; 0.05). Indirect contact with COVID-19 was a risk factor for anxiety (P &lt; 0.05). COVID-19-related distancing measures were associated with high levels of adverse mental health symptoms.

Participants competed a 25-min questionnaire adapted from the Western Australia Health and Wellbeing Surveillance system. Participants provided information on their socio-demographic status, lifestyle behaviours, mental health, and psychosocial health during and post-lockdown. Open-ended questions explored key issues in greater detail. Changes between the lockdown and post-lockdown period were assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test and One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Normal tests as appropriate. Sex differences were examined using the Mann-Whitney U test. A content analysis approach examined responses to the open-ended questions with frequencies and variations in responses determined using Chi-Square tests. A total of 547 complete responses were obtained. Compared to post-lockdown period, lockdown was associated with a significantly lower levels of physical activity, poorer mental well-being and sense of control over one's life, and a higher level of loneliness. Similarly, during lockdown, there was a significantly higher consumption of junk food, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks but no change in fruit and vegetable intake. Participants recalled health campaigns on hand washing and social distancing and there was a retrospective view that more timely and informative campaigns on physical activity, nutrition and mental well-being should have been available during lockdown. While advice on infection control measures were appropriately provided, there is a need for concurrent health promotional information to help combat the changes in physical, mental and psychosocial well-being observed during quarantine to prevent negative health consequences in the community even if there are minimal effects of the pandemic itself.","Bhoyroo, Chivers, Millar, Bulsara, Piggott, Lambert, Codde","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11971-7","20211027","COVID-19; Depression; Health promotion; Loneliness; Nutrition; Pandemic; Physical activity; Social isolation; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19267,""
"Risk factors for mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in ophthalmic personnel and students in USA (&amp; Canada): a cross-sectional survey study","The COVID-19 pandemic poses mental health challenges to frontline healthcare workers. Eye care professionals may be especially susceptible to mental health problems due to high-risk exposures to patients. Yet, no prior research has studied mental health issues among eye care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic among eye care professionals. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study among eye care professionals and students in the United States and Canada from June 23 to July 8, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 8505 eye care professionals and students received email invitations to the survey and 2134 participated. We measured mental health outcomes including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress using validated scales, as well as potential risk factors including demographic characteristics, state-level COVID-19 case counts, participants' patient interactions, childcare responsibilities, and pre-pandemic stress levels. Linear multiple regression and logistic regression analyses were used to determine relationships between risk factors and mental health outcomes. We found that 38.4% of eyecare professional participants in the survey met screening threshold as probable cases of anxiety, depression, or both during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for self-reported pre-pandemic stress level and state COVID-19 case daily cases, significant risk factors for depression, anxiety, and psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic included: being female, younger age, and being Black or Asian. Interestingly, we found two somewhat surprising protective factors against depression symptoms: more frequent interactions with patients and having a greater proportion of childcare responsibilities at home. This study showed a high prevalence of mental health problems and revealed disparities in mental health among eye care personnel and students: Female, younger, Black, and Asian populations are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. These results indicate that it is critical to identify mental health issues more effectively and develop interventions among this population to address this significant and growing public health issue. The strategies and policies should be reflective of the demographic disparities in this vulnerable population.","Pang, Li, Robbs, Wang, Jain, Ticho, Green, Suh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03535-1","20211027","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Ophthalmologist; Optometrist; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19268,""
"Academic experiences, physical and mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on students and lecturers in health care education","In keeping with nation-wide efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) transformed fully its pedagogical delivery to online mode, where we investigated teaching and learning experiences, physical and mental health of undergraduate students and lecturers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study on undergraduate students and lecturers in a health science faculty using a self-developed pretested questionnaire through anonymous online data collection method. Fifty-six lecturers (100% response rate) and 279 students (93.3% response rate) participated. The positive experiences reported by students include becoming independent (72.8%) and adapting to online learning (67.4%), while lecturers learned new teaching techniques (50.0%) and became more innovative (50.0%) by learning new tools (48.2%). However, studying at home caused students to feel more distracted (72.0%) with a feeling of uncertainty towards examinations (66.7%), while lecturers felt that students' laboratory skills were compromised (44.6%). Even though online delivery of assessments enabled lecturers to explore all options (50.0%), they found it difficult to maintain appropriate questions (41.1%) and fair assessments (37.5%). Majority of students missed eating out (68.8%) and felt a lack of participation in extracurricular activities (64.9%), while lecturers reported more time for exercise (51.8%), despite having more screen time (50.0%) and computer-related physical stress (44.6%). In terms of mental health, increased stress in students was reported (64.9%), though they had more time for self-reflection (54.8%). Although lecturers reported a closer relationship with family (44.6%), they also felt more stressed due to deadlines, unexpected disruptions and higher workloads (44.6%) as well as concerns related to work, family and self (39.3%). In this abrupt shift to online teaching, students and lecturers in our study identified both positive and negative experiences including the impact on their physical and mental health. Our findings are important to provide the evidence for online pedagogical benefits and can serve to promote the enhancement and adaptation of digital technology in education. Our findings also aim to promote the importance of addressing physical and mental health issues of the university community's well-being through provision of emotional and mental health support and appropriate programs.","Idris, Zulkipli, Abdul-Mumin, Ahmad, Mitha, Rahman, Rajabalaya, David, Naing","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02968-2","20211027","COVID-19; Experiences and impact; Lecturers; Online education; Pandemic; Students; University","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19269,""
"Association between health locus of control and perceived stress in college student during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study in Iran","The COVID-19 pandemic as a global mental health crisis has affected everyone, including students. The present study aimed to determine and investigate the relationship between health locus of control and perceived stress in students of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences (southern Iran) during the outbreak of COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study examined 250 students of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences. We performed simple random sampling and utilized the demographic information form, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale (MHLCS) by Wallston, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by Cohen to collect data. We analyzed data using the SPSS, Pearson correlation coefficient, and the hierarchical regression model with an error level of 5%. The mean perceived stress was 30.74Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.09, and 92.4% of the students had moderate and high stress levels. Among the components of the health locus of control, the internal health locus of control (IHLC) had the highest mean in students (27.55Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.81). Furthermore, the internal health locus of control (RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.30, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) had a significant inverse relationship, with perceived stress and the chance health locus of control (CHLC) (RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.30, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) had a significant direct relationship. In the final regression model, the health locus of control and all the variables predicted 22.7% of the perceived stress variation in students during the COVID-19 period. The results indicated that the internal health locus of control was associated with a reduction of perceived stress, and the powerful others health locus of control (PHLC) was related to its increase in students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the uncertain future, in the present work, universities are suggested to design web-based educational interventions alongside the curriculum to further strengthen the internal health locus of control and thus help reduce their perceived stress.","Ganjoo, Farhadi, Baghbani, Daneshi, Nemati","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03543-1","20211027","COVID-19; Health locus of control; Perceived stress; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19270,""
"Medical Scribe Impact on Provider Efficiency in Outpatient Radiation Oncology Clinics Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Medical documentation has become increasingly challenging for providers, particularly with time constraints and changes to office visit formats during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Medical scribes may help mitigate this burden. Our objective was to determine how scribes affect provider workflow efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic controls. Providers completed a survey in February 2020 (S1, pre-pandemic) and one year into the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2021 (S2, during-pandemic). Standardized surveys administered during S1 evaluated perceived impact of scribes on clerical work, medical documentation, and efficiency during office visits using the Likert Scale. Surveys administered during S2 also addressed scribe use during telemedicine visits, in addition to office visits. Provider perception of time spent on documentation with or without a scribe was evaluated using a 5-level ordinal scale. Provider response was assessed using descriptive frequency statistics. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. Analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). All tests were two-sided with an alpha level of 0.05. Fifty-eight providers responded to the surveys: 36 (62%) for S1, 22 (38%) for S2. Scribe use decreased perceived clerical work, facilitated chart review, recording of physical exam findings, note documentation and improved efficiency, both before and during the pandemic (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.5, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.7, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.8, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.8, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.9 respectively). Scribe use significantly decreased perceived time to complete documentation pre-pandemic (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.002) and during the pandemic for both in person (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt; 0.0001) and telemedicine visits (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0004). More providers took over 60 minutes to complete medical documentation without the use of a scribe pre-pandemic (72% versus 30% with a scribe, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.006) and during the pandemic, for both in person (40% versus 0% with a scribe, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.002) and telemedicine visits (35% versus 0% with a scribe, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.002). Even with increased telemedicine visits during the pandemic, 17 (77%) providers strongly agreed that scribe use decreased their daily clerical work and improved efficiency and 18 (82%) strongly agreed scribes were just as helpful during telemedicine visits as during in person visits. Scribe use decreases provider time spent on medical documentation and improves overall efficiency. This improvement in clinical efficiency was similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for both in person and telemedicine clinic visits. Integration of scribes into radiation oncology clinics may improve provider satisfaction by reducing burden of documentation and may improve provider well-being.","Wang, Devine, Von Eyben, Bagshaw","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.07.682","20211027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19271,""
"Problematic use of the internet during the COVID-19 pandemic: Good practices and mental health recommendations","With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accelerated spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus came jurisdictional limitations on mobility of citizens and distinct alterations in their daily routines. Confined to their homes, many people increased their overall internet use, with problematic use of the internet (PUI) becoming a potential reason for increased mental health concerns. Our narrative review summarizes information on the extent of PUI during the pandemic, by focusing on three types: online gaming, gambling and pornography viewing.

"Are non-face-to-face interactions an effective strategy for maintaining mental and physical health?","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to social isolation measures, forcing many people to stay indoors, stop daily outdoor activities, and limit face-to-face social interactions with friends, colleagues, and family. This study aimed to identify if non-face-to-face interaction affects depressive symptoms and frailty in older adults. We included 3834 older adults (age: 71.1 Ã‚Â± 6.9 [mean Ã‚Â± standard deviation] years; range: 60-96 years; 2153 women) from the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology-Study of Geriatric Syndromes. Interaction status was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were categorized into: ""both interactions"" (both face-to-face and non-face-to-face interactions), ""face-to-face only"" (only face-to-face interactions), ""non-face-to-face only"" (only non-face-to-face interactions), ""no interactions"" (neither face-to-face nor non-face-to-face interactions) groups. Depressive symptoms and frailty were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and Kihon Checklist, respectively. Potential confounding factors-adjusted odds ratios for both, face-to-face only and non-face-to-face only groups for developing depressive symptoms were 0.39 (95%CI, 0.26-0.57; p&lt;0.001), 0.56 (95%CI, 0.38-0.84; p=0.004), and 0.51 (95%CI, 0.27-0.96; p=0.038), respectively, and those for development of frailty were 0.44 (95%CI, 0.30-0.65; p&lt;0.001), 0.59 (95%CI, 0.39-0.87; p=0.008), and 0.63 (95%CI, 0.34-1.15; p=0.128), respectively. Our findings indicate that non-face-to-face interactions are also important in preventing the deterioration of mental health, which is a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, non-face-to-face interactions alone may not be sufficient to maintain physical health, and it is important to maintain opportunities for face-to-face interaction among older adults, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Katayama, Lee, Bae, Makino, Chiba, Harada, Morikawa, Tomida, Shimada","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104560","20211026","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; frailty; interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19273,""
"Social frailty and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults in Japan: Role of home exercise habits","We examined the association between social frailty and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Additionally, we investigated whether home exercise habits moderated the impact of social frailty on depressive symptoms. This cross-sectional study included 1,103 community-dwelling older adults (54.0% female, mean age [standard deviation]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 81.1 [5.0] years) from a semi-urban area of Japan who completed a mailed questionnaire survey in October 2020. Social frailty status was categorized as non-social frailty, pre-social frailty, and social frailty, which was assessed by financial difficulties, living alone, lack of social activity, and contact with neighbors. Depressive symptoms were defined as a Kessler 6 score Ã¢â€°Â¥5. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the association between social frailty and depressive symptoms, and also conducted stratified analysis of home exercise habits during the pandemic. A total of 309 (28.0%) participants had depressive symptoms. Compared with non-social frailty, social frailty was associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.80, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.16-2.79, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009).

"Emotion Regulation and Diurnal Cortisol: A Longitudinal Study of Early Adolescents","Aberrant patterns of diurnal cortisol, a marker of stress reactivity, predict adverse physical and mental health among adolescents. However, the mechanisms underlying aberrant diurnal cortisol production are poorly understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the core emotion regulation (ER) strategies of rumination (brooding, reflection), reappraisal, and suppression were prospectively associated with individual differences in diurnal cortisol during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of significant stress. A community sample of 48 early adolescents (M<sub>age</sub>=13.45; 60% males) was recruited from British Columbia, Canada. Participants completed ER measures before the pandemic, and diurnal cortisol was assessed by collecting eight saliva samples over two days during the first COVID-19-related lockdown in the region. As expected, brooding predicted elevated waking cortisol and a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR), whereas reflection predicted lower waking cortisol and suppression predicted a steeper CAR. Unexpectedly, reappraisal was not associated with diurnal cortisol production. Results indicate that ER strategies may represent a mechanism underlying individual differences in biological markers of wellbeing during stress.","Rnic, Jopling, Tracy, LeMoult","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108212","20211026","COVID-19; adolescence; diurnal cortisol; emotion regulation; longitudinal; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19275,""
"Depressive Symptoms Mediate COVID-associated Stigma and Quality of Life: Stigma Instrument Validation and Path Analysis","The aim of this study was to adapt and modify the HIV/AIDS Stigma Instrument-Patient to develop the COVID-19 Stigma Instrument-Patient (CSI-P) and validate its psychometric characteristics, as well as explore how affected individuals in China experienced COVID-related stigma and its associated variables, including depressive symptomology and quality of life (QOL). From September to October 2020, 151 COVID-19 survivors recruited in Shanghai, China, completed a set of measures of demographic characteristics, depression, stigma, and QOL. The 15-item CSI-P-2 achieved a Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± of 0.67 to 0.91. The six-factor structure was obtained by exploratory factor analysis. The mean score for the CSI-P-2 in Chinese COVID survivors was 8.14Ã‚Â± 9.98. Regression analysis showed that survivors' age, comorbid diseases, education levels, and loneliness level were the factors influencing their COVID-19 stigma, explaining 37.80% of the total variance (F=19.25, p&lt;0.001). Also, stigma's effect on QOL was significant in direct and indirect paths mediated by depressive symptomology. First, this sample might limit the generalization of the findings to other Chinese-speaking regions. Second, future longitudinal or experimental studies are warranted for checking and further refinement of the scale. Finally, future studies are needed on the changing dynamics of stigma in different stages of the pandemic. The 29-item CSI-P-2 with six domains is an instrument with sound psychometric properties that can be used to measure COVID-19 stigma during the COVID-19 outbreak and, later, for COVID-19 survivors. Future studies should explore how to integrate the significant demographic and psychological characteristics influencing the experience of stigma work on this study into the development of stigma-reducing interventions.","Huang, Sun, Zhang, Lu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.043","20211026","COVID-19; influencing factors; psychometrics; stigma; survey; survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19276,""
"Intersections between pneumonia, lowered oxygen saturation percentage and immune activation mediate depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue syndrome-like symptoms due to COVID-19: a nomothetic network approach","COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms including increased depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue-syndrome (CFS)-like and physiosomatic symptoms. To delineate the associations between affective and CFS-like symptoms in COVID-19 and chest computed tomography scan anomalies (CCTAs), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin, calcium, magnesium, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and soluble advanced glycation products (sRAGEs). The above biomarkers were assessed in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 heathy controls who had measurements of the Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue (FF) Rating Scales. Partial Least Squares-SEM analysis showed that reliable latent vectors could be extracted from a) key depressive and anxiety and physiosomatic symptoms (the physio-affective or PA-core), b) IL-6, IL-10, CRP, albumin, calcium, and sRAGEs (the immune response core); and c) different CCTAs (including ground glass opacities, consolidation, and crazy paving) and lowered SpO2% (lung lesions). PLS showed that 70.0% of the variance in the PA-core was explained by the regression on the immune response and lung lesions latent vectors. One common ""infection-immune-inflammatory (III) core"" underpins pneumonia-associated CCTAs, lowered SpO2 and immune activation, and this III core explains 70% of the variance in the PA core, and a relevant part of the variance in melancholia, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by lung lesions and lowered SpO2 which may cause activated immune-inflammatory pathways, which mediate the effects of the former on the PA-core and other neuropsychiatric symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Al-Jassas, Al-Hakeim, Maes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.039","20211026","COVID-19; chronic fatigue syndrome; inflammation; major depression; neuro-immune; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19277,""
"Physical and mental health impacts during COVID-19 quarantine in adolescents with preexisting chronic immunocompromised conditions","To evaluate physical and mental health indicators in adolescents with preexisting chronic immunocompromised conditions during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine. A cross-sectional study included 355 adolescents with chronic conditions and 111 healthy adolescents. An online self-rated survey was used to investigate socio-demographic features, healthcare routine, and the quarantine impact on physical and mental health. The validated self-reported version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was also applied. The median of age [14 (10-18) vs. 15 (10-18) years, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.733] and frequencies of female (61% vs. 60%, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.970) were similar between adolescents with preexisting chronic conditions and healthy adolescents during quarantine of COVID-19 pandemic. The frequencies of abnormal total difficulties score of SDQ were similar in patients and controls (30% vs. 31%, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.775). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.965; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.091-3.541, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.024), fear of underlying disease activity/complication (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.009; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.001-1.018, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.030) were associated with severe psychosocial dysfunction in adolescents with chronic conditions, whereas school homework (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.449; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.206-0.981, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.045) and physical activity (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.990; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.981-0.999, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.030) were protective factors.

Ninety-two COVID-19 survivors evaluated at 1-month follow-up, 122 evaluated at 3Ã‚Â months and 98 evaluated at 6Ã‚Â months performed neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations and were compared with a healthy comparison group (HC) of 165 subjects and 165 patients with major depression (MDD). Cognitive performances were adjusted for age, sex, and education. Seventy-nine percent of COVID-19 survivors at 1Ã‚Â month and 75% at 3- and 6-month follow-up showed cognitive impairment in at least one cognitive function. No significant difference in cognitive performances was observed between 1-, 3-, and 6-months follow-up. COVID-19 patients performed worse than HC but better than MDD in psychomotor coordination and speed of information processing. No difference between COVID-19 survivors and MDD was observed for verbal fluency, and executive functions, which were lower than in HC. Finally, COVID-19 survivors performed the same as HC in working memory and verbal memory. The factor that most affected cognitive performance was depressive psychopathology which, in turn, interact with cognitive functions in determining quality of life. Our results confirm that COVID-19 sequelae include signs of cognitive impairment which persist up to 6Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge and affect quality of life.","Poletti, Palladini, Mazza, De Lorenzo, Furlan, Ciceri, Rovere-Querini, Benedetti, Irene, Sara, Beatrice, Ceciclio, Stefania, Valentina, Elisa, Jacopo, Marta, Elena, Federica, Sarah, Greta, Camilla, Marica, Paola, Anna, Cristiano, Sabina, Beatrice, Teresa, Aurora, Chiara, Chiara, Benedetta, Giordano","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-021-01346-9","20211026","COVID-19; Cognitive impairment; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19279,""
"Prevalent, Incident, and Persistent Insomnia in a Population-Based Cohort Tested Before (2018) and During the First-Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)","High rates of sleep and mental health problems have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, but most of the evidence is retrospective without pre-pandemic data.This study documented rates of prevalent, incident, and persistent insomnia and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) compared to pre-pandemic data (2018). Data were derived from a longitudinal, population-based study of insomnia in Canada. When the first lockdown started in the province of Quebec, a subsample of participants who had completed the latest 2018 follow-up were surveyed (April-May 2020) about their sleep, insomnia, and psychological symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic. Prevalence, incidence, and persistence rates of insomnia, and severity of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were estimated, as well as their associations with confinement, loneliness, social support, use of electronics, and other lifestyle changes occurring during the pandemic. A sleep/health survey and validated questionnaires of insomnia, sleep quality, stress, fatigue, anxiety, and depression were administered at both assessments. The sample consisted of 594 adults (mean age: 48.3 Ã‚Â± 13.1 years; 64.0% women). Prevalence of insomnia increased from 25.4% to 32.2% (symptoms) and from 16.8% to 19% (syndrome) from 2018 to 2020, for an overall 26.7% increase in insomnia rates. Of those classified as good sleepers in 2018 (n = 343), 32.6% (n = 112) had developed new insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among participants who had insomnia in 2018, the persistence rate was 76.5% two years later. There was a significant worsening of sleep quality, fatigue, anxiety and depression (all ps &lt; 0.005) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2018. Significant associations were found between sleep and psychological symptoms and with living alone and being in confinement, lower social support, increased time using electronic devices, reduced physical exercise, and higher financial stress. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with significant increases in insomnia and psychological symptoms compared to the pre-pandemic period. Large scale public sleep and mental health intervention programs should be prioritized during and after a pandemic such as the the COVID-19.","Morin, VÃƒÂ©zina-Im, Ivers, Micoulaud-Franchi, Philip, Lamy, Savard","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab258","20211026","COVID-19; confinement; insomnia; pandemic; psychological symptoms; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19280,""

"Student Pharmacists during the Pandemic: Development of a COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (COVKAP) Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused innumerable changes to all aspects of human life and behavior, including academic life. This study describes the development of a COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (COVKAP) Survey among U.S. student pharmacists. The survey was administered at Doctor of Pharmacy programs in three states-Tennessee, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The COVKAP survey-an online cross-sectional survey-was distributed to U.S. student pharmacists enrolled in three different colleges of pharmacy in three states during the fall semester of 2020. The survey was developed using literature review and Dillman's recommendations for survey design. The COVKAP survey consisted of 23 closed and Likert-scale questions, and three open-ended questions. The research team conducted descriptive and inductive thematic analyses on the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively using SPSS (v27) and Dedoose<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> software. A total of 421 responses were received. Respondents were predominantly female (72%) and White (79%). The average age of respondents was 23.4 years. The qualitative analysis revealed three themes: (1) Wellbeing and mental health struggles; (2) Being part of the decision-making process; (3) Necessity of adequate protection measures. Preliminary study findings indicate that student pharmacists' concerns and the challenges that they face in their academic pursuits are largely similar across the three states in this study and inform about the importance of recognizing and mitigating the impact of widespread disruption in education. This disruption provides an opportunity for pharmacy academia to examine practices and methods that can be improved upon to help students become successful practitioners.","Cernasev, Desai, Jonkman, Connor, Ware, Sekar, Schommer","https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9040159","20211026","COVID-19 pandemic; remote learning; student pharmacist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19282,""
"New Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Their Anesthetic and Analgesic Considerations","Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) inhibit the presynaptic neuronal uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and prolong the effects of the monoamines in the synaptic cleft within the central nervous system, leading to increased postsynaptic receptor activation and neuronal activities. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can have multiple clinical indications, including as the first-line agents for the management of depression and anxiety, and as analgesics in the treatment of chronic pain. The effects of reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin are often dose-dependent and agent-dependent. There are five FDA-approved serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran and sibutramine) currently being marketed in the United States. As the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the incidence and prevalence of anxiety and depression across the country, there are significantly increased prescriptions of these medications perioperatively. Thus, anesthesiologists are more likely than ever to have patients administered with these agents and scheduled for elective or emergency surgical procedures. A thorough understanding of these commonly prescribed serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and their interactions with commonly utilized anesthetic agents is paramount. There are two potentially increased risks related to the continuation of SNRIs through the perioperative period: intraoperative bleeding and serotonin syndrome. SNRIs have some off-label uses, more new indications, and ever-increasing new applications in perioperative practice. This article aims to review the commonly prescribed serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and the current clinical evidence regarding their considerations in perioperative anesthesia and analgesia.","Fanelli, Weller, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3390/neurolint13040049","20211026","desvenlafaxine; duloxetine; levomilnacipran; milnacipran; serotonin; serotonin syndrome; serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; sibutramine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19283,""

Healthcare providers were required to be flexible while continuing to provide patient care. To understand how healthcare providers in the mental health and substance use field experienced the COVID-19 response at their workplace, a quality improvement initiative was designed. This initiative aimed to evaluate their perceptions using an online survey tool that explored their insights related to communication, redeployment and safety and well-being.

"Virtual learning experiences in population health nursing course during the COVID-19 pandemic","To discuss the virtual learning strategies used in population health nursing course during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The School of Nursing faculty in a South Central University in the United States quickly combined innovation with digital resources and transitioned a course in population health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing faculty were challenged to develop student nursing objectives in assessment, planning, intervention and evaluation of vulnerable populations in the community through a virtual environment. The experiences of five clinical groups are described, covering adults with disabilities, older people, patients with COVID-19 and youth populations. The course objectives were met through use of a digital environment. Collaborative interventions were designed and implemented with community stakeholders while maintaining social distancing policies. Successes included increased frequency of communication and learning opportunities for students and the community, and student satisfaction. Barriers to student learning were not related to the digital learning environment, although the older adults required modifications to use electronic devices. Virtual classrooms are a viable platform to teach population health nursing and to benefit vulnerable populations. Virtual learning offers benefits within academia and the community. Technology offers the possibility to improve mental health among older people and enhance knowledge among the general population. Students are better able to connect with clinical faculty and stakeholders through digital platforms. Nurses play a vital role in improving population health and can collaborate with community stakeholders to implement innovative and sustainable solutions to nursing education, practices and policy. Digital platforms can enhance the involvement of students through these collaborations during and after the pandemic.","Manakatt, Carson, Penton, Demello","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12725","20211026","COVID-19; digital learning; learning outcome; older people; population health nursing; virtual learning; vulnerable population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19285,""
"Pre-Pandemic Peer Relations Predict Adolescents' Internalizing Response to Covid-19","The goal of the current longitudinal study was to investigate the role of adolescents' peer victimization and aggression prior to COVID-19 on the change in their depressive and anxious symptoms from pre- to mid-pandemic. We hypothesized that, although adolescents overall would display an increase in internalizing symptoms from pre- to mid-pandemic, this response would be weakened or perhaps even reversed when adolescents experienced high levels of victimization or aggression prior to the pandemic. Participants included 96 racially/ethnically diverse adolescents (42 males, 53 females; 1 other) with an average age of 16.79Ã‚Â years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.60). At Time 1 (T1; June 2019 through February 2020; pre-pandemic), adolescents completed self-report measures of their peer relations (aggression, victimization) and internalizing symptoms (depressive, anxious). At Time 2 (T2; May through July 2020; mid-pandemic), adolescents completed self-report measures of their internalizing symptoms (depressive, anxious). On average, adolescents' anxious and depressive symptoms increased from T1 to T2, although they exhibited substantial variability, with reports ranging from decreasing symptoms to increasing symptoms. Although on average adolescents reported increases in anxious symptoms from T1 to T2, adolescents with higher T1 peer victimization reported less positive change in anxious symptoms. Similarly, although on average adolescents reported increases in depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, adolescents with higher levels of T1 aggression reported less positive change in depressive symptoms from T1 to T2. Discussion focused on restrictions on in-person peer interactions necessitated by COVID-19 that may reduce adolescents' distress when their pre-pandemic daily lives were characterized by negative peer relations.","Mlawer, Moore, Hubbard, Meehan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-021-00882-1","20211026","Aggression; Anxious symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Peer victimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19286,""

Changes to service delivery have resulted in 71% of clinicians performingÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 75% of their consultations remotely. Diagnosing and treating epilepsy has changed, with a fifth of respondents being significantly less confident in diagnosing epilepsy.

We also investigated the association between emotional state and practicing meditation/yoga, physical activity or having a mental disease. For that, a sample of 717 participants, recruited through social media, were randomly assigned to listen to negative or positive news about COVID-19. After that, both groups were guided through a short relaxation pause. Their emotional state was measured before they listened to the audios and after each audio. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate the effects of news group, relaxation pause, mental health and well-being practices. Negative news worsened their emotional state, whereas positive news improved it. A brief relaxation pause improved the effects of negative news content and may mitigate the effects of this valence of information.

"Trends of new-onset psychosis or mania in psychiatric emergency departments during the COVID19 pandemic: a longitudinal comparative study","COVID19 infection was associated with possible psychiatric manifestations, including psychosis and mania. In addition, psychiatric disorders might be triggered by severe psychological reactions to the pandemic or the measures taken to contain it. This study aimed to assess the trends of new-onset psychosis/mania during the pandemic timeline. Psychiatric emergency department records during January-July 2019 and 2020 of two regional mental health centers were manually examined. Cases of new-onset psychosis or mania were found in 326 out of 5161 records examined. The ratio of these cases increased by 45.5% in 2020 compared to 2019 (189 out of 2367, 137 out of 2479, respectively, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The peak increase was in April 2020 (9.4% vs. 4.7%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015). There was no association between the rise of new-onset psychotic or manic episodes and national incidence of COVID19 cases, as observed during Israel 2nd wave. PCR tests were negative, except a single case. In this study, an increase in new-onset psychosis/mania was identified during the initial phase of the pandemic. Though causality could not be directly inferred, lack of infection symptoms, negative PCR testing and temporal distribution incongruent with COVID19 caseload did not support a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2.

"Clinical efficacy of COMPASS, a digital cognitive-behavioural therapy programme for treating anxiety and depression in patients with long-term physical health conditions: a protocol for randomised controlled trial","Approximately 30% of people with long-term physical health conditions (LTCs) experience mental health problems, with negative consequences and costs for individuals and healthcare services. Access to psychological treatment is scarce and, when available, often focuses on treating primary mental health problems rather than illness-related anxiety/depression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a newly developed, therapist-supported, digital cognitive-behavioural treatment (COMPASS) for reducing LTC-related psychological distress (anxiety/depression), compared with standard charity support (SCS). A two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial (1:1 ratio) with nested qualitative study will be conducted. Two-hundred adults with LTC-related anxiety and depression will be recruited through national LTC charities. They will be randomly allocated to receive COMPASS or SCS only. An independent administrator will use Qualtrics randomiser for treatment allocation, to ensure allocation concealment. Participants will access treatment from home over 10 weeks. The COMPASS group will have access to the digital programme and six therapist contacts: one welcome message and five fortnightly phone calls. Data will be collected online at baseline, 6 weeks and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks post-randomisation for primary outcome (Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, daily functioning, COVID-19-related distress, illness-related distress, quality of life, knowledge and confidence for illness self-management, symptom severity and improvement).

We explored factors associated with mortality using primary care population data from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2014. Data were obtained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink which compiles anonymised patient data from primary care in the UK. Cause of death data was supplemented from the Office of National Statistics when available. The analysis included 70Ã¢â‚¬â€°431 PWE, with 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°241 registered deaths. The number of deaths within the database increased by 69% between the first and last year of the study. Epilepsy was considered as a contributing cause in approximately 45% of deaths of PWE under 35. Factors associated with increased risk of death included attendance at emergency departments and/or emergency admissions (OR 3.48,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 3.19 to 3.80), antiepileptic drug (AED) polytherapy (2 AEDs: OR 1.60,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 1.51 to 1.71; 3 AEDs: OR 2.06,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 1.86 to 2.29; 4+AEDs: OR 2.62,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 2.23 to 3.08), status epilepticus (OR 2.78,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 1.64 to 4.71), depression (OR 1.67,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 1.57 to 1.76) and injuries (OR 1.54,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 1.43 to 1.67). No seizures in the prior year (OR 0.52,Ã¢â‚¬â€°95% CI 0.41 to 0.65). Our results add to existing evidence that deaths in epilepsy are increasing. Future studies could focus on identifying PWE at high risk and addressing them with clinical interventions or better self-management. Identifying specific risk factors for younger people should be a priority as epilepsy may be a factor in close to half of deaths of PWE under 35 years of age.","Wojewodka, Gulliford, Ashworth, Richardson, Ridsdale","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052841","20211027","epidemiology; epilepsy; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19294,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on ethnic minority communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of ethnic minority community leaders","To explore the perspectives of ethnic minority community leaders in relation to: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their communities; and their community's perception, understanding and adherence to government guidelines on COVID-19 public health measures. A phenomenological approach was adopted using qualitative semistructured interviews. Community organisations and places of worships in the West Midlands, England. Community leaders recruited through organisations representing ethnic minority communities and religious places of worship. A total of 19 participants took part. Participants alluded to historical and structural differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Many expressed their community's reluctance to report symptoms for the fear of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials and historical racism in the society. Access and adherence to government guidelines was an issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford or have access to masks and sanitisers. The study highlights the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ethnic minority communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the community, and community leaders can enable dissemination of key messages to deliver targeted yet sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing the root causes of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.","Mahmood, Acharya, Kumar, Paudyal","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050584","20211027","COVID-19; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19295,""

"The effect of information-seeking behaviours on prevention behaviour implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic: mediating effects of anxiety and fear","It is important to understand determinants of prevention behaviours during the emergence of an infectious disease and pandemic. We aimed to investigate the association between information-seeking and prevention behaviours, and the mediating effects of psychiatric factors during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 1970 participants from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Etiology Research Center cohort participated in an online survey 55 days after the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in South Korea. Time spent seeking COVID-19-related information; information sources; psychiatric factors including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and fear of COVID-19; and prevention behaviours were queried. The mediating effect of psychiatric factors was estimated by mediation analyses. Information-seeking time and information source affected several behavioural responses. In men, anxiety mediated associations between information-seeking and prevention behaviours including purchasing sanitary supplies (effect size 0.038, 95% confidence interval 0.002-0.095) and hoarding (0.029, 0.002-0.068). Indirect effects of fear of COVID-19 were associated with refraining from going out (men: 0.034, 0.009-0.068; women: 0.052, 0.030-0.080), wearing face masks (men: 0.085, 0.031-0.184), avoiding public transport (men: 0.020, 0.000-0.044; women: 0.031, 0.015-0.051), hoarding (women: 0.051, 0.029-0.792), and trying alternative remedies (men: 0.024, 0.004-0.053). While COVID-19-related information can help infection prevention, it can also promote anxiety and fear and lead to behaviours not recommended during the pandemic, such as hoarding and trying unvalidated alternative treatments.","Kim, Yang, Jeon, Lee, Lee, Kim, Koenen, Kim, Jung","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021085","20211026","Anxiety; COVID-19; Fear; Health Behaviour; Information Seeking Behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19297,""
"Public Willingness and Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccination at the Initial Stage of Mass Vaccination in China","The present study assessed the willingness of the general population to receive COVID-19 vaccines and identified factors that influence vaccine hesitancy and resistance. A national online survey was conducted from 29 January 2021 to 26 April 2021 in China. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors that influence vaccine hesitancy and resistance. Of the 34,041 participants surveyed, 18,810 (55.3%) were willing to get vaccinated, 13,736 (40.3%) were hesitant, and 1495 (4.4%) were resistant. Rates of vaccine acceptance increased over time, with geographical discrepancies in vaccine hesitancy and resistance between provinces in China. Vaccine safety was the greatest concern expressed by most participants (24,461 [71.9%]), and the major reason for participants' refusing vaccination (974 [65.2%]). Government agencies (23,131 [68.0%]) and social media (20,967 [61.6%]) were the main sources of COVID-19 vaccine information. Compared with vaccination acceptance, female, young and middle-aged, high income, and perceived low-risk of infection were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Histories of allergic reactions to other vaccines and depression symptoms were related to vaccine resistance. Common factors that influenced vaccine hesitancy and resistance were residing in cities and perceiving less protection with vaccines than with other protective measures. The results indicate that the rate of vaccine resistance is relatively low, but vaccine hesitancy is common. Individuals who are female, young and middle-aged, with a high income, and residing in cities are more likely to be hesitant for vaccination and should be the target populations for vaccination campaigns. Specific vaccine messaging from the government and social media could alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.","Zhao, Liu, Sun, Yan, Yuan, Zheng, Lu, Liu, Ni, Su, Zhu, Zeng, Gong, Wu, Ran, Leng, Shi, Shi, Lu, Bao","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101172","20211026","COVID-19 vaccine; determinants; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine resistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19298,""
"Correlates of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance, Hesitancy and Refusal among Employees of a Safety Net California County Health System with an Early and Aggressive Vaccination Program: Results from a Cross-Sectional Survey","Since health professionals provide frontline care to COVID-19 patients, information on vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers is needed. We developed and implemented an anonymous internet-based cross-sectional survey with direct solicitation among employees of a safety net health system. Items queried demographic and health-related characteristics, experience with and knowledge of COVID-19, and determinants of decisions to vaccinate. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance groups (acceptors, hesitant, refusers) were defined; an adapted version of the WHO vaccine hesitancy scale was included. The survey demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92 for vaccine hesitancy scale; 0.93 for determinants). General linear and logistic regression methods examined factors which were univariately associated with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine acceptance, respectively. Multivariable models were constructed with stepwise model-building procedures. Race/ethnicity, marital status, job classification, immunocompromised status, flu vaccination and childhood vaccination opinions independently predicted hesitancy scale scores. Gender, education, job classification and BMI independently predicted acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal groups. Among hesitant employees, uncertainty was reflected in reports of motivating factors influencing their indecision. Despite a strong employee-support environment and job protection, respondents reported physical and mental health effects. The appreciation of varied reasons for refusing vaccination should lead to culturally sensitive interventions to increase vaccination rates amongst healthcare workers.","Gatto, Lee, Massai, Zamarripa, Sasaninia, Khurana, Michaels, Freund, Nightingale, Firek","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101152","20211026","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; determinants; healthcare workers; nurses; pandemic; physicians; vaccine acceptance; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19299,""
"Advancing urban mental health research: from complexity science to actionable targets for intervention","Urbanisation and common mental disorders (CMDs; ie, depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders) are increasing worldwide. In this Review, we discuss how urbanicity and risk of CMDs relate to each other and call for a complexity science approach to advance understanding of this interrelationship. We did an ecological analysis using data on urbanicity and CMD burden in 191 countries. We found a positive, non-linear relationship with a higher CMD prevalence in more urbanised countries, particularly for anxiety disorders. We also did a review of meta-analytic studies on the association between urban factors and CMD risk. We identified factors relating to the ambient, physical, and social urban environment and showed differences per diagnosis of CMDs. We argue that factors in the urban environment are likely to operate as a complex system and interact with each other and with individual city inhabitants (including their psychological and neurobiological characteristics) to shape mental health in an urban context. These interactions operate on various timescales and show feedback loop mechanisms, rendering system behaviour characterised by non-linearity that is hard to predict over time. We present a conceptual framework for future urban mental health research that uses a complexity science approach. We conclude by discussing how complexity science methodology (eg, network analyses, system-dynamic modelling, and agent-based modelling) could enable identification of actionable targets for treatment and policy, aimed at decreasing CMD burdens in an urban context.","van der Wal, van Borkulo, Deserno, Breedvelt, Lees, Lokman, Borsboom, Denys, van Holst, Smidt, Stronks, Lucassen, van Weert, Sloot, Bockting, Wiers","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00047-X","20211027","Adult; Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19; Depressive Disorder; Ecosystem; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Social Network Analysis; Substance-Related Disorders; Systems Analysis; Urban Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19300,""

"Inflammation, a common mechanism in frailty and COVID-19, and stem cells as a therapeutic approach","As our life expectancy increases, specific medical conditions appear, and new challenges are met in terms of global health. Frailty has become a medical and scientific concept to define pathologies where inflammation, depressed immune system, cellular senescence, and molecular aging converge. But more importantly, frailty is the ultimate cause of death that limits our life span and deteriorates health in an increasing proportion of the world population. The difficulty of tackling this problem is the combination of factors that influence frailty appearance, such as stem cells exhaustion, inflammation, loss of regeneration capability, and impaired immunomodulation. To date, multiple research fields have found mechanisms participating in this health condition, but to make progress, science will need to investigate frailty with an interdisciplinary approach. This article summarizes the current efforts to understand frailty from their processes mediated by inflammation, aging, and stem cells to provide a new perspective that unifies the efforts in producing advanced therapies against medical conditions in the context of frailty. We believe this approach against frailty is particularly relevant to COVID-19, since people in a state of frailty die more frequently due to the hyperinflammatory process associated with this infection.","Becerra, Duran","https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.21-0074","20211027","COVID-19; MSC; aging; frailty; immunomodulation; inflammation; mesenchymal stem cell; regeneration; stem cell exhaustion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19303,""
"The impact of physical activity on psychological well-being in women aged 45-55 years during the Covid pandemic: A mixed-methods investigation","Evidence suggests that being physically active may improve quality of life through the menopausal transition. This study is one of the first to investigate how meeting the UK Physical Activity Guidelines (PAG) impacted quality of life, stress, coping and menopausal symptoms in UK midlife women, aged 45-55 years, during the unfolding Covid pandemic (Phase 1 quantitative, n=164). The study also explored their motivation to undertake regular physical activity during Covid lockdown (Phase 2 qualitative, n=4). An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used to collate quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus group) data. Participants who met PAG experienced fewer depressive symptoms and less perceived stress, and had better physical and mental health and quality of life than women who did not. This was supported by focus group discussions reporting lack of facilities, time constraints, reduced social support and existing health complaints as barriers to physical activity. Factors motivating women to exercise during Covid lockdown were benefits for physical and mental health, and support from friends (Qualitative). Women are postmenopausal for one-third of their lives, and health interventions need to promote positive healthy ageing around menopause. Menopausal changes could be used by clinicians as cues to action to promote female health and well-being. Clinicians should be promoting the health benefits of exercise and making women aware of the importance of aiming to meet the PAG for optimal health benefits. Women should be encouraged to increase their levels of physical activity by making plans and setting goals and gaining support by exercising with friends or family, as a way to better control menopausal symptoms.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2021.07.012","20211101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","",19304,""
