"COVID-19, what could sepsis, severe acute pancreatitis, gender differences, and aging teach us?","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a potentially life-threatening disease, defined as Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). The most common signs and symptoms of this pathological condition include cough, fever, shortness of breath, and sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia, or dysgeusia. The course of COVID-19 is mild or moderate in more than 80% of cases, but it is severe or critical in about 14% and 5% of infected subjects respectively, with a significant risk of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 related infection is characterized by some pathogenetic events, resembling those detectable in other pathological conditions, such as sepsis and severe acute pancreatitis. All these syndromes are characterized by some similar features, including the coexistence of an exuberant inflammatory- as well as an anti-inflammatory-response with immune depression. Based on current knowledge concerning the onset and the development of acute pancreatitis and sepsis, we have considered these syndromes as a very interesting paradigm for improving our understanding of pathogenetic events detectable in patients with COVID-19. The aim of our review is: 1)to examine the pathogenetic mechanisms acting during the emergence of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes in human pathology; 2)to examine inflammatory and anti-inflammatory events in sepsis, acute pancreatitis, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical manifestations detectable in patients suffering from these syndromes also according to the age and gender of these individuals; as well as to analyze the possible common and different features among these pathological conditions; 3)to obtain insights into our knowledge concerning COVID-19 pathogenesis. This approach may improve the management of patients suffering from this disease and it may suggest more effective diagnostic approaches and schedules of therapy, depending on the different phases and/or on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gallo, Fiorino, Posabella, Antonacci, Tropeano, Pausini, Pausini, Guarniero, Hong, Giampieri, Corazza, Federico, de Biase, Zippi, Zancanaro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155628","20210819","Acute pancreatitis; Aging; CoV-2; Covid-19; Sepsis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17242,""
"Substance use, depression, and loneliness among American veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic","Behavioral health issues, such as substance use, depression, and social isolation, are of grave concern during COVID-19, especially for vulnerable populations. One such population is US veterans, who have high rates of pre-existing behavioral health conditions and may thus be at-risk for poorer outcomes. The current study aimed to investigate substance use among US veterans during COVID-19 as a function of pre-existing depression, loneliness, and social support. We investigated the relationship between pre-pandemic depression and substance use during COVID-19 using linear (alcohol) and logistic (cannabis) regression among a large sample of US veterans (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1230). We then tested if loneliness and social support moderated these effects. Though there was a decrease in alcohol and cannabis use among the overall sample, veterans who screened for depression prior to the pandemic exhibited higher levels of substance use after the pandemic's onset. Loneliness compounded the effects of depression on rates of alcohol use. Social support was not protective for the effects of depression on either alcohol or cannabis use. Veterans with pre-existing depression may be in need of attention for substance use behaviors. Interventions aimed at alleviating loneliness among veterans may be useful in mitigating alcohol use, but not cannabis use, amid COVID-19. Our findings are among the first to report tangible behavioral health outcomes experienced by US veterans as a result of COVID-19. Results can help inform treatment efforts for veterans who are struggling with substance use during and post-pandemic.","Fitzke, Wang, Davis, Pedersen","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajad.13211","20210819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17243,""
"COVID19-associated cardiomyocyte dysfunction, arrhythmias and the effect of Canakinumab","Cardiac injury associated with cytokine release frequently occurs in SARS-CoV-2 mediated coronavirus disease (COVID19) and mortality is particularly high in these patients. The mechanistic role of the COVID19 associated cytokine-storm for the concomitant cardiac dysfunction and associated arrhythmias is unclear. Moreover, the role of anti-inflammatory therapy to mitigate cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. We investigated the effects of COVID19-associated inflammatory response on cardiac cellular function as well as its cardiac arrhythmogenic potential in rat and induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM). In addition, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the IL-1ÃŽÂ² antagonist Canakinumab using state of the art in-vitro confocal and ratiometric high-throughput microscopy. Isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were exposed to control or COVID19 serum from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe ARDS and impaired cardiac function (LVEF 41Ã‚Â±5%; 1/3 of patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CK 154Ã‚Â±43 U/l). Rat cardiomyocytes showed an early increase of myofilament sensitivity, a decrease of Ca2+ transient amplitudes and altered baseline [Ca2+] upon exposure to patient serum. In addition, we used iPS-CM to explore the long-term effect of patient serum on cardiac electrical and mechanical function. In iPS-CM, spontaneous Ca2+ release events were more likely to occur upon incubation with COVID19 serum and nuclear as well as cytosolic Ca2+ release were altered. Co-incubation with Canakinumab had no effect on pro-arrhythmogenic Ca2+ release or Ca2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling, nor significantly influenced cellular automaticity. Serum derived from COVID19 patients exerts acute cardio-depressant and chronic pro-arrhythmogenic effects in rat and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Canakinumab had no beneficial effect on cellular Ca2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling. The presented method utilizing iPS-CM and in-vitro Ca2+ imaging might serve as a novel tool for precision medicine. It allows to investigate cytokine related cardiac dysfunction and pharmacological approaches useful therein.","Dimai, Semmler, Prabhu, Stachelscheid, Huettemeister, Klaucke, Lacour, Blaschke, Kruse, Parwani, Boldt, Bullinger, Pieske, Heinzel, Hohendanner","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255976","20210819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17244,""
"COVID-19 sentiment analysis via deep learning during the rise of novel cases","Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.","Chandra, Krishna","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255615","20210819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17245,""
"Emotional Problems Prior to Adjuvant Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer","Being scheduled for radiotherapy can cause emotional distress. This study aimed to identify risk factors in 338 patients assigned to radiotherapy for breast cancer. Nineteen potential risk factors including the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated for associations with the six emotional problems included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer. Worry and fears were significantly associated with age Ã¢â€°Â¤60 years; sadness with age and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) &lt;90; depression with KPS and Charlson Comorbidity Index Ã¢â€°Â¥3; loss of interest with KPS. Trends were found for associations between sadness and additional breast cancer/DCIS, Charlson Index and chemotherapy; between depression and additional breast cancer/DCIS, treatment volume and nodal stage N1-3; between nervousness and additional breast cancer/DCIS, mastectomy and triple-negativity; between loss of interest and Charlson Index, family history of breast cancer/DCIS, invasive cancer, chemotherapy, and treatment volume. The COVID-19 pandemic did not increase emotional problems. Several risk factors for emotional problems were identified. Patients with such factors should receive psychological support well before radiotherapy.","Rades, Narvaez, Dziggel, Tvilsted, Kjaer, Schild, Bartscht","https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12561","20210819","COVID-19 pandemic; Emotional problems; breast cancer; radiation therapy; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17246,""

"Depression, Anxiety, and Alcohol Use Among LGBTQ+ People During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives.</b> To describe disparities in depression, anxiety, and problem drinking by sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and gender identity during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods.</b> Data were collected May 21 to July 15, 2020, from 3245 adults living in 5 major US metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York, New York; and Los Angeles, California). Participants were characterized as cisgender straight or LGBTQ+ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and men who have sex with men, and women who have sex with women not identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender). <b>Results.</b> Cisgender straight participants had the lowest levels of depression, anxiety, and problem drinking compared with all other sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and gender identity groups, and, in general, LGBTQ+ participants were more likely to report that these health problems were ""more than usual"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Conclusions.</b> LGBTQ+ communities experienced worse mental health and problem drinking than their cisgender straight counterparts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should assess the impact of the pandemic on health inequities. Policymakers should consider resources to support LGBTQ+ mental health and substance use prevention in COVID-19 recovery efforts. (<i>Am J Public Health</i>.

"Risk and resilience among Asian American youth: Ramifications of discrimination and low authenticity in self-presentations","This study examines adjustment patterns among a group neglected in developmental science-Asian American students in high-achieving schools. National reports have declared such schools to connote risk for elevated problems among teens. Asian American students are commonly referred to as model minorities, but little is known about adjustment issues within academically competitive settings, specifically. Guided by past research on culturally salient issues, multiple U.S. high schools were examined to (a) determine areas of relative strength versus weakness in adjustment of Asian Americans compared with Whites, and (b) more importantly, to illuminate salient within-group processes related to Asian Americans' well-being. Risk modifiers examined were perceptions of ethnic discrimination, parent perfectionism, internalized achievement pressure, authenticity in self-presentation, and closeness to school adults. Outcome variables included depression, anxiety, and isolation at school. Results demonstrated that Asian Americans fared better than Whites on anxiety and school isolation, but with low effect sizes. By contrast, they fared more poorly on almost all risk modifiers, with a large effect size on discrimination. Regression results showed that among Asian Americans the most consistent associations, across cohorts and outcomes, were for discrimination and authenticity. Findings underscore the need for greater recognition that discrimination could be inimical for students not typically thought of as vulnerable-Asian Americans in high-achieving schools; these issues are especially pressing in light of increased racism following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results also suggest that feelings of inauthenticity could be a marker of generalized vulnerability to internalizing symptoms. Implications for future theory and interventions are discussed.

"Patient Satisfaction with Virtual-Based Prenatal Care: Implications after the COVID-19 Pandemic","The objective of this study was to identify factors related to satisfaction with virtual visits during pregnancy in an effort to prioritize intervention targets for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study relied on data obtained from pregnant women (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°416) who participated in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study from May 21 to November 22, 2020. Using a cross-sectional design, this study examined factors including COVID-19 related experiences and prenatal care changes in association with patient satisfaction of virtual prenatal care. Overall, women reported being very or extremely satisfied (27.9%) or moderately satisfied (43.5%) with their virtual prenatal experiences, however, 89.9% indicated a preference for in-person care under non-pandemic conditions. Those who completed the survey further into the pandemic were less satisfied with virtual prenatal care (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.127, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). After accounting for this and other sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 pregnancy worries (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.226, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and the number of prenatal care changes due to the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.137, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) were associated with lower satisfaction. Our findings demonstrate general satisfaction with virtual visits amongÃ‚Â pregnant women in this study although in general women would prefer in-person care if it weren't for a pandemic. Women worried about the impact of pandemic on their pregnancy, as well as those experiencing transitions in their prenatal care may need more information and reassurance. Additional studies are needed to understand the unmet needs through virtual care compared to in-person care.","Liu, Goyal, Mittal, Erdei","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03211-6","20210819","Anxiety; Mental health; Obstetric; Pregnancy; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17250,""
"COVID-19-related fears and information frequency predict sleep behavior in bipolar disorder","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and consequent restrictions including social distancing had a great impact on everyday life. To date, little is known about how the restrictions affected sleep, which is commonly disturbed in bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this study was to elucidate sleep patterns during the pandemic in Austrian BD individuals. An online survey assessed sleep with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and COVID-19-associated attitudes, fears, and emotional distress of 20 BD individuals and 19 controls (HC) during the pandemic. The survey was conducted in April 2020, when very strict regulations were declared, and repeated in May, when they were loosened. Individuals with BD reported overall poor sleep according to PSQI sum at both time points. Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, daytime sleepiness, and PSQI sum were worse in individuals with BD than in HC. Individuals with BD informed themselves more frequently about pandemic-related topics. Higher information frequency and more COVID-19 fears (about the virus, own infection, contracting others) correlated with worse PSQI values. Regression models found in BD group that higher information frequency as well as higher COVID-19 fears in April predicted worse sleep characteristics in May, in particular subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and daytime sleepiness. As sufficient sleep duration and quality are essential for well-being and particularly important for vulnerable BD individuals, it is important that information about the pandemic is gathered to a reasonable extent and mental health professionals include COVID-19-related fears when currently treating BD.","Fellendorf, Reininghaus, Ratzenhofer, Lenger, Maget, Platzer, Bengesser, Birner, Queissner, Hamm, Pilz, Dalkner","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2182","20210819","COVID-19 pandemic; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; bipolar disorder; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17251,""
"Nightmare content during the COVID-19 pandemic: Influence of COVID-related stress and sleep disruption in the United States","Nightmares are often associated with psychiatric disorders and acute stress. This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced the content of nightmares. A sample of NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked about the degree to which they agreed with statements linking greater general stress, worse overall sleep and more middle-of-the-night insomnia with the COVID-19 pandemic. They were also asked if, during the pandemic, they experienced nightmares related to various themes. Logistic regression analyses examined each nightmare content as outcome and increased stress, worse sleep and more middle-of-the-night insomnia as predictors, adjusted for age, sex and race/ethnicity. Those who reported greater general COVID-related stress were more likely to have nightmares about confinement, failure, helplessness, anxiety, war, separation, totalitarianism, sickness, death, COVID and an apocalypse. Those who reported worsened sleep were more likely to have nightmares about confinement, oppression, failure, helplessness, disaster, anxiety, evil forces, war, domestic abuse, separation, totalitarianism, sickness, death, COVID and an apocalypse. Those who reported worsened middle-of-the-night insomnia were more likely to have nightmares about confinement, oppression, failure, helplessness, disaster, anxiety, war, domestic abuse, separation, totalitarianism, sickness, death, COVID and an apocalypse. These results suggest that increased pandemic-related stress may induce negatively-toned dreams of specific themes. Future investigation might determine whether (and when) this symptom indicates an emotion regulation mechanism at play, or the failure of such a mechanism.","Kennedy, Bastien, Ruby, Killgore, Wills, Grandner","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13439","20210819","COVID-19; dreams; nightmares; pandemic; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17252,""
"Being creative during lockdown: The relationship between creative potential and COVID-19-related psychological distress in narcolepsy type 1","The national lockdown imposed in several countries to counteract the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an unprecedented situation with serious effects on mental health of the general population and of subjects affected by heterogeneous diseases. Considering the positive association between narcoleptic symptoms and creativity, we aimed at exploring the psychological distress associated with COVID-19 restrictions and its relationship with depressive symptoms and creativity in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). A total of 52 patients with NT1 and 50 healthy controls, who completed a previous study on creativity, were contacted during the first lockdown period to complete an online survey evaluating psychological distress related to the COVID-19 outbreak, sleep quality, narcolepsy and depressive symptoms, and creative abilities. The patients with NT1 showed an improvement in subjective sleepiness while controls reported worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown. Depression and NT1 symptom severity proved significant predictors of COVID-19-related distress. Creative performance, namely generative fluency, turned out to be a favourable moderator in the relationship between depression and patients' distress, reducing the detrimental effect of depression on the patients' wellbeing. On the contrary, creative originality proved to be a disadvantageous moderator in the relationship between NT1 symptom severity and the distress associated with this traumatic event indicating a higher vulnerability to developing COVID-19-related distress, particularly evident in patients displaying higher originality. Overall, these results highlight a crucial role of creativity in patients with NT1, suggesting that creative potential could be used as a protective factor against the development of distress associated with the lockdown.","D'Anselmo, Agnoli, Filardi, Pizza, Mastria, Corazza, Plazzi","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13461","20210819","COVID-19; creativity; depression; distress; narcolepsy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17253,""
"Providing behavioral workforce development technical assistance during COVID-19: adjustments and needs","COVID-19 social distancing policies have triggered a historic shift in the delivery of behavioral health prevention and treatment services. Among the first responders to this monumental workforce development challenge were the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-funded Technology Transfer Centers (TTCs), which are charged with building the behavioral health workforce's capacity to provide evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery services. TTCs documented unprecedented attendance at their events in the early months of the pandemic. This study applied content analysis to identify the most common COVID-related technical assistance (TA) topics and examine attendance by topic from March to July 2020. Across 393 events, TA topics explicitly related to COVID-19 encompassed eight emergent themes: (a) delivering services via telehealth, (b) providing support and services to behavioral health consumers, (c) promoting workforce self-care, (d) understanding new laws/policies, (e) delivering evidence-based practices, (f) advancing racial equity, (g) offering networking spaces, and (h) altering organizational management and communication infrastructure. The most heavily attended events focused on the TA themes ""Advancing Racial Equity"" (average = 352) and ""Telehealth Service Delivery"" (average = 271). There was a documented shift from more intensive TA to briefer, more targeted TA provision. The TTCs rapidly virtualized training and TA offerings to address workforce needs and serve as a model for providing remote workforce development support during the COVID-19 pandemic and future national crises.","Molfenter, Becker, Kisicki, Chaple, Freese, Gotham, Greller, Hagle, Henry, Krom, Martin, Powell, Roget, Velez-Echevarria, YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab097","20210819","Behavioral health; COVID-19; Telehealth; Workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17254,""

"Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder induced by fear of coronavirus infection","Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder (ATPD) (ICD-10) is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms and can be triggered by psychological stress. In the ICD-10 definition of ATPD, episodes are short-term, lasting from days to three months, followed by complete remission. This paper reports the case of a 37-year-old woman with stress-induced new-onset psychosis instigated by fear of coronavirus infection. Physical examinations, paraclinical testing, and neuroimaging excluded an organic cause of symptoms. A thorough anamnestic investigation excluded the presence of other concomitant stress factors as the trigger of the patient's psychotic symptoms. In response to the COVID-19 lockdown, the patient developed excessive concern about coronavirus infection and, consequently, sleeping difficulties. Symptoms intensified, and she was admitted to the psychiatric ward, presenting with hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disorientation. The clinical picture fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of an Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder. After one week of antipsychotic treatment, her symptoms had remitted, and the patient was discharged. Albeit, four months after treatment discontinuation, her psychotic symptoms re-emerged, and she was readmitted. The patient recovered from symptoms within 48Ã‚Â hours of treatment initiation with antipsychotics. She later reported to have been stressed and anxious while awaiting her coronavirus test result and, following, had doubted the negative result. The present case supports previous reports describing the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on population mental health; the psychological stress caused by the fear of infection can lead to the debut of psychotic manifestations and ATPD. <b>Objetivo</b>: El Trastorno PsicÃƒÂ³tico Agudo y Transitorio (ATPD en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) (CIE-10) se caracteriza por el inicio sÃƒÂºbito de sÃƒÂ­ntomas psicÃƒÂ³ticos y puede ser gatillado por estrÃƒÂ©s psicolÃƒÂ³gico. SegÃƒÂºn la definiciÃƒÂ³n de la CIE-10 del ATPD, los episodios son breves, durando desde algunos dÃƒÂ­as hasta tres meses, seguido de remisiÃƒÂ³n completa. Este artÃƒÂ­culo reporta el caso de una mujer de 37 aÃƒÂ±os con una psicosis de nueva apariciÃƒÂ³n inducida por estrÃƒÂ©s instigada por el temor a la infecciÃƒÂ³n por coronavirus.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: El examen fÃƒÂ­sico, exÃƒÂ¡menes de laboratorio, y neuroimagenes excluyeron una causa orgÃƒÂ¡nica de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas. Una investigaciÃƒÂ³n anamnÃƒÂ©stica exhaustiva excluyÃƒÂ³ la presencia de otros factores estresantes concomitantes como desencadenantes de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas psicÃƒÂ³ticos de la paciente.<b>Resultados</b>: En respuesta al confinamiento por COVID 19, la paciente desarrollo una excesiva preocupaciÃƒÂ³n por la infecciÃƒÂ³n por coronavirus y consecuentemente, dificultades para dormir. Los sÃƒÂ­ntomas se intensificaron y fue hospitalizada en el servicio de psiquiatrÃƒÂ­a, presentando alucinaciones, delirios, discurso desorganizado y desorientaciÃƒÂ³n. El cuadro clÃƒÂ­nico cumplÃƒÂ­a con los criterios diagnÃƒÂ³sticos para un Trastorno PsicÃƒÂ³tico Agudo y Transitorio. DespuÃƒÂ©s de una semana de tratamiento con antipsicÃƒÂ³ticos, sus sÃƒÂ­ntomas habÃƒÂ­an remitido, y la paciente fue dada de alta. No obstante, cuatro meses despuÃƒÂ©s de la discontinuaciÃƒÂ³n del tratamiento, reaparecieron sus sÃƒÂ­ntomas psicÃƒÂ³ticos y fue re- hospitalizada. La paciente se recuperÃƒÂ³ de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas a las 48 horas del inicio del tratamiento con antipsicÃƒÂ³ticos. MÃƒÂ¡s tarde informÃƒÂ³ haber estado estresada y ansiosa mientras esperaba los resultados del test de coronavirus y a continuaciÃƒÂ³n habÃƒÂ­a dudado de su resultado negativo.<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n</b>: El presente caso apoya reportes previos que describen el efecto de la pandemia por COVID-19 en la salud mental de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n: el estrÃƒÂ©s psicolÃƒÂ³gico causado por el miedo a la infecciÃƒÂ³n puede conducir al debut de manifestaciones psicÃƒÂ³ticas y de ATPD. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¦â‚¬Â¥Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å¡â€šÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â (ATPD) (ICD-10) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€°Â¹Ã§â€šÂ¹Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§ÂªÂÃ§â€žÂ¶Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¤Â½Å“, Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã§â€Â±Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¨Â§Â¦Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨ ICD-10 Ã¥Â¯Â¹ ATPD Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Â¹â€°Ã¤Â¸Â­, Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Å¸Â­Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã§Å¡â€ž, Ã¦Å’ÂÃ§Â»Â­Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†, Ã§â€žÂ¶Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã§Â¼â€œÃ¨Â§Â£Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥ÂÂ 37 Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¦â‚¬â€¢Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¨Â¯Â±Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â¡Ë†Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¦Â£â‚¬, Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¦â€”ÂÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¨Â¯â€¢Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥Æ’ÂÃ¥Â­Â¦Ã¦Å½â€™Ã©â„¢Â¤Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â„¢Â¨Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Å½Å¸Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â½Â»Ã¥Âºâ€¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¥Â¿â€ Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¦Å½â€™Ã©â„¢Â¤Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¨Â§Â¦Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹ COVID-19Ã¥Â°ÂÃ©â€Â, Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œ, Ã¤Â»Å½Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥Å Â Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½, Ã¥Â¥Â¹Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã©â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Ë†Â¿, Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Å½Â°Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â¹Â»Ã¨Â§â€°, Ã¥Â¦â€žÃ¦Æ’Â³, Ã¨Â¨â‚¬Ã¨Â¯Â­Ã¦Â·Â·Ã¤Â¹Â±Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨Â¿Â·Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Å½Â°Ã§Â¬Â¦Ã¥ÂË†Ã¦â‚¬Â¥Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å¡â€šÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¯Å Ã¦â€“Â­Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â»ÂÃ¨Â¿â€¡Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥â€˜Â¨Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å â€”Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¨ÂÂ¯Ã§â€°Â©Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½, Ã¥Â¥Â¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã§Â¼â€œÃ¨Â§Â£Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â°Â½Ã§Â®Â¡Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥ÂÅ“Ã¦Â­Â¢Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€ºâ€ºÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†Ã¥ÂÅ½, Ã¥Â¥Â¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂÃ¦Â¬Â¡Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°, Ã¥Â¥Â¹Ã¥â€ ÂÃ¦Â¬Â¡Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã©â„¢Â¢Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â¼â‚¬Ã¥Â§â€¹Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¦Å â€”Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¨ÂÂ¯Ã§â€°Â©Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½ 48 Ã¥Â°ÂÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¤Â»Å½Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¥Â¹Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å , Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§Â­â€°Ã¥Â¾â€¦Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€™Å’Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜, Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©ËœÂ´Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã¦â‚¬â‚¬Ã§â€“â€˜Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¨Â¿Â° COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å ; Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¦â‚¬â€¢Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Å½Â°Ã¥â€™Å’ATPDÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Loehde, Novakovic","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1954777","20210819","Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorders; COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦; Pandemia de COVID-19; Psicosis inducida por estrÃƒÂ©s; Trastornos PsicÃƒÂ³ticos Agudos y Transitorios; stress-induced psychosis; Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¨Â¯Â±Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦; Ã¦â‚¬Â¥Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å¡â€šÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17257,""
"Impact of Perceived Severity of COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) on Mental Health of University Students of Pakistan: The Mediating Role of Muslim Religiosity","<b>Background:</b> Perceived severity of COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) is known to be associated with mental health of people in general and health professionals in particular in Western societies. However, its association with the mental health of students in Pakistan, which is predominantly a Muslim society, remains unclear so far. Moreover, the role of Muslim religiosity for such an association has not yet been investigated. We aimed to examine the association and report findings on the impact of perceived severity on mental health with a sample of students from all five provinces of Pakistan. <b>Methods:</b> We did a cross-sectional online survey from 1,525 Pakistani students in March 2020 using standardized measurement tools. We then determined the prevalence of perceived severity among students and its impact on their mental health. The strength of associations between these variables was estimated using generalized linear models, with appropriate distribution and link functions. Structural equation modeling through SmartPLS (3.0) software was utilized to analyze the results. <b>Findings:</b> The perceived severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with mental health of Pakistani students, whereas Muslim religiosity is a strong mediator between perceived severity and mental health of Pakistani students. <b>Conclusions:</b> Though the perceived severity of COVID-19 is associated with mental health, this relationship can be better explained by the role of Muslim religiosity. When tested individually, the perceived severity accounted for only 18% variance in mental health that increased up to 57% by the mediating role of Muslim religiosity. This difference clearly indicates the mediating role of Muslim religiosity in the association between perceived severity and mental health for Pakistani students.","Saleem, Bakar, Durrani, Manzoor","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.560059","20210819","COVID-19; Pakistani students; mental health; muslim religiosity; perceived severity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17258,""
"Exploring factors in fear of COVID-19 and its GIS-based nationwide distribution: the case of Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health threat of international concern, intensifying peoples' psychological risk and vulnerability by strengthening mental health stressors such as fear, panic and uncertainty. The unexpected fear of COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with suicide occurrences, similar to prior pandemics. Identifying the factors associated with fear of COVID-19 could help us to develop better mental health strategy and practice to improve the situation here in Bangladesh. This was the first attempt to present a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based distribution of fear of COVID-19 across the country's administrative districts in a nationwide sample. Data for a total of 10 067 individuals were collected by an online survey during the first wave of the pandemic (1 to 10 April 2020); data for 10 052 participants were finally analysed after excluding 15 transgender individuals. The survey questionnaire included items concerning sociodemographic, behavioural and health-related variables, COVID-19-related issues, and the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The mean fear of COVID-19 scores was 21.30 Ã‚Â± 6.01 (out of a possible 35) in the present sample. Female gender, highly educated, non-smoker, non-alcohol consumer, having chronic diseases, using social media, and using social media and not using newspapers as COVID-19 information sources were associated with a higher level of fear of COVID-19. Higher levels of fear of COVID-19 were found in districts of Magura, Panchagarh, Tangail, Sunamganj and Munshiganj; by contrast, Kushtia, Pirojpur, Chapainawabganj, Jhalokathi and Naogaon districts had lower fear of COVID-19. Based on the GIS-distribution, fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the district as well as in respect to its gender-based and education-level-based associations. However, fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases were heterogeneously distributed across the districts; that is, no consistent association of higher COVID-19 cases with higher fear of COVID-19 was found. This study being exploratory in nature may help to facilitate further studies, as well as directing governmental initiatives for reducing fear of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Providing adequate resources and mental health services in the administrative regions identified as highly vulnerable to fear of COVID-19 is recommended.","Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.984","20210819","Bangladesh; COVID-19 fear; GIS-based distribution; fear of COVID-19 scale; fear of infection; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17259,""

"Experiences of COVID-19-related anti-Asian discrimination and affective reactions in a multiple race sample of US young adults","Little remains known about both Asian and Asian American (A/AA) and non-Asian young adults' experiences and affective reactions regarding COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the nature and impact of COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination within a multi-racial sample. This study uses qualitative open-ended responses from a sub-sample of Wave I of the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES) data collected between March to September 2020. Thematic analysis was used to explore two open-ended questions: ""Are there experiences we missed in the survey so far that you wish to describe?"" and ""What are your thoughts about the current social climate?"" The data analysis for this study focused on 113 discrimination or racism-related comments. A total of 1331 young adults completed an online survey of which 611 provided comments; a multi-racial sample of 95 individuals (65.3% non-Asians, 24.7% A/AA) contributed 113 COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination or racism-related comments. Two overarching themes were: types of discrimination (societal, interpersonal, intrapersonal) and affective reactions to discrimination (fear, anxiety/distress, hopelessness/depression, and avoidance). Not only did both A/AA and non-Asian participants report witnessing or hearing reports of anti-Asian discrimination, but both groups described having negative affective reactions to anti-Asian discrimination. Anti-Asian discrimination in the face of COVID may be more widespread than initial reports indicate. Our finding suggests that anti-Asian discrimination is a societal illness that impacts all populations in the U.S. This calls for cross-racial coalitions and solidarity in the fight against discrimination and racism.","Hahm, Xavier Hall, Garcia, Cavallino, Ha, Cozier, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11559-1","20210819","Anti-Asian discrimination; COVID-19; China virus; Discrimination; Racism; Xenophobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17261,""
"COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: influential roles of political party and religiosity","Given recent declines in US vaccination rates and the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines, identifying sociodemographic influencers of vaccine willingness holds importance for developing effective public health campaigns aimed at enhancing nationwide COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The present study utilized a hierarchical binary logistic regression model to assess demographic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, pre-existing medical conditions), political party membership, religious affiliation, level of religiosity, and fear of COVID-19 as predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ('Yes', would receive a vaccine or 'No', would not receive a vaccine) in a national sample of US adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 249). Participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and completed several online questionnaires pertaining to mental health, health behaviors, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Democratic party membership and decreased level of religiosity predicted acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. This investigation supports political party membership and religiosity as influencers of COVID-19 vaccine willingness and suggests that these variables could represent potential targets for public health interventions aimed at increasing vaccine adoption.","Milligan, Hoyt, Gold, Hiserodt, Otto","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1969026","20210819","COVID-19 pandemic; fear of COVID-19; political affiliation; religion; vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17262,""
"A longitudinal approach of lockdown effects on quality of life and the expression of anxiety-depressive disorders according to sensory processing sensitivity","The COVID-19 health crisis is perceived as an anxiety-provoking situation. In some cases, policy measures such as containment can generate psychological distress. High sensory processing sensitivity is an innate component of temperament that characterises individuals with higher sensory sensitivity than their peers. It can be understood either as an individual's ability to adapt to specific situations, or as a factor of vulnerability to certain negative stimuli, which may impact upon quality of life, or manifest itself in the expression of anxiety-depressive symptoms. In this study, we investigated the effects of confinement from a longitudinal perspective on these aspects, according to the degree of sensitivity of individuals.Data collection was carried out longitudinally during the lockdown of the French population. The sample was composed of 493 adults who were asked to respond twice, anonymously, to a research protocol hosted online. We used a tool composed of the French version of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the French short version of the World Health Organisation Quality Of Life scale.The results did not show a significant change in anxiety and depression disorders and quality of life in general between the beginning and the end of lockdown. Furthermore, notable disparities were observed according to the degrees of sensitivity in relation to the type of lifestyle during lockdown.The data from the literature, based on cross-cutting approaches, was clarified by the results, as they did not show any negative effects of lockdown on anxiety-depressive disorders during the lockdown period. Moreover, the latter even seemed to have improved one aspect of quality of life.","Bordarie, Aguerre, Bolteau","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1968012","20210819","COVID-19 lockdown; anxiety-depressive disorders; longitudinal approach; quality of life; sensory-processing sensitivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17263,""
"Telehealth Adoption by Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The study examined temporal and geographic trends in telehealth availability at U.S. behavioral health treatment facilities and risk factors for not offering telehealth. Longitudinal data on 15,691 outpatient behavioral health treatment facilities were extracted daily from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator between January 20, 2020, and January 20, 2021. Facilities operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs were excluded. Bivariate analyses were used to assess trends in telehealth availability in 2020 and 2021. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine facility- and county-level characteristics associated with telehealth availability in 2021. Telehealth availability increased by 77% from 2020 to 2021 for mental health treatment facilities and by 143% for substance use disorder treatment facilities. By January 2021, 68% of outpatient mental health facilities and 57% of substance use disorder treatment facilities in the sample were offering telehealth. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities that did not accept Medicaid as a form of payment were less likely to offer telehealth in 2021, compared with facilities that accepted Medicaid. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities that accepted private insurance were more likely to offer telehealth in 2021, compared with facilities that did not accept private insurance. Although 2020 saw a dramatic increase in telehealth availability at behavioral health treatment facilities, 32% of mental health treatment facilities and 43% of substance use disorder treatment facilities did not offer telehealth in January 2021, nearly 1 year into the pandemic.","Cantor, McBain, Kofner, Hanson, Stein, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100191","20210819","Coronavirus/COVID-19; Drug abuse; Mental health systems/hospitals; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-20","",17264,""
