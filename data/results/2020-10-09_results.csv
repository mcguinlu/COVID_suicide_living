"Psychiatric morbidity and protracted symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients","We investigated the psychiatric symptomatology and the protracted symptoms in recently recovered COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity. Further research on the neurobiological commonalities between the protracted symptoms and PTSD in COVID-19 patients is warranted.","Burc Cagri Poyraz; Cana Aksoy Poyraz; Yesim Olgun; Ozge Gurel; Sena Alkan; Yusuf Emre Ozdemir; Ilker Inanc Balkan; Ridvan Karaali","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.07.20208603","20201009","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5616,""
"A potential impact of physical distancing on physical and mental health A rapid narrative umbrella review of meta-analyses on the link between social isolation and health","Background: The imperative for physical distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may deteriorate physical and mental health. We aimed at summarizing the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of social isolation and loneliness with physical and mental health. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone, and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social isolation and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis. Results: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. A total of more than 3 million individuals had participated in the 692 primary studies. The results suggest that social isolation is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social isolation is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.","Nexhmedin Morina; Ahlke Kip; Thole H Hoppen; Stefan Priebe; Thomas Meyer","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20207506","20201007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5617,""
"Turning on a dime-pre- and post-COVID-19 consultation patterns in an urban general practice","To investigate changes in general practice consultation patterns in response to reduced face-to-face patient contact during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective before and after case notes review study of one urban general practice to investigate patient contact in the first two weeks of New Zealand general practices' COVID-19 response in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Twenty percent of patients had contact with the practice in both samples, with similar proportions by age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation and presence of multimorbidity or mental health diagnoses. Similar numbers of acute illness, accident-related and prevention patient contacts occurred in both samples, with more long-term condition-related contact in 2020. While 70% of patient contacts were face-to-face in 2019, 21% were face-to-face in 2020. Most acute illness, accident-related and long-term condition-related contacts were able to be provided through virtual means, but most prevention-related contacts were face-to-face. This single practice study showed total patient contact was similar over both sample periods, but most contact in 2020 was virtual.

To outline guidance for government, health services, psychiatrists and health professionals in managing mental health effects of COVID-19 media exposure. Social and traditional media businesses attract interest by reporting threats and negativity, and heavy media exposure during disasters is associated with increased depressive and post-traumatic symptoms. There are three main recommendations for mitigation of the adverse population mental health effects of excessive media exposure and misinformation. Clear, authoritative communication from governments, health authorities and health professionals is essential, combined with correction of misinformation and addressing mistrust. Specific warnings by governments, health authorities and clinicians of the potential adverse mental health consequences of excessive COVID-19 media consumption are needed. Limitation of exposure to media and disinformation regarding COVID-19 is crucial - the less, the better. Healthcare professionals can advise patients to check information once daily, and be guided by reliable public health authorities, as part of interventions for managing the mental health impact of COVID-19.","Looi, Allison, Bastiampillai, Maguire","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220963947","20201008","COVID-19; media exposure; misinformation; population mental health; threats","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5619,""
"Socio-economic disadvantage and resource distribution for mental health care: a model proposal and example application for Victoria, Australia","A spreadsheet-based model for supporting equitable mental health resource distribution in Australia was developed, based on the Australian Health Survey (AHS) psychological distress findings associated with area socio-economic disadvantage (SED). An illustrative application is presented. Stratum-specific psychological-distress rates for area SED quintiles are applied to local government areas, catchment areas and local health networks (LHNs). A case study applies the model to Victoria, including examining recommendations in the Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health Services (RCVMHS) 2019 interim report for increases to bed stock in two LHNs. Need-adjusted demand estimates considered as a ratio of raw population proportions for catchments range between 0.6 to 1.4 in Victoria. Applying the formula to the Royal Commission recommendations suggests the proposed distribution of beds is a reasonable correction for these two LHNs and indicates next expansion priorities for more equitable distribution to other LHNs. The spreadsheet, adaptable for other states and territories, could complement National Mental Health Services Planning Framework outputs and assist in evaluation, for instance, determining potential supply shortages in the tele-mental-health response to COVID-19.Ã¢â‚¬â€°We outline research directions including consideration of the moral bases of value judgements and identification of other variables including their use in parameterisation and calibration.","Meadows, Shawyer, Dawadi, Inder, Enticott","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220963921","20201008","distributive justice; health disparities; mental health services; socio-economic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5620,""
"A Study to Evaluate Depression and Perceived Stress Among Frontline Indian Doctors Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic","Amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health care workers of multiple disciplines have been designated as frontline doctors. This unforeseen situation has led to psychological problems among these health care workers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mental health status of pan-Indian frontline doctors combating the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among frontline doctors of tertiary care hospitals in India (East: Kolkata, West Bengal; North: New Delhi; West: Nagpur, Maharashtra; and South: Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala) from May 23, 2020, to June 6, 2020. Doctors involved in clinical services in outpatient departments, designated COVID-19 wards, screening blocks, fever clinics, and intensive care units completed an online questionnaire. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to assess depression and perceived stress. The results of 422 responses revealed a 63.5% and 45% prevalence of symptoms of depression and stress, respectively, among frontline COVID-19 doctors. Postgraduate trainees constituted the majority (45.5%) of the respondents. Moderately severe and severe depression was noted in 14.2% and 3.8% of the doctors, respectively. Moderate and severe stress was noted in 37.4% and 7.6% of participants, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed working Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6 hours/day (adjusted odds ratio: 3.5; 95% CI, 1.9-6.3; P &lt; .0001) to be a significant risk factor for moderate or severe perceived stress, while single relationship status (adjusted odds ratio: 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.9; P = .002) and working Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6 hours/day (adjusted odds ratio: 10.3; 95% CI, 4.3-24.6; P &lt; .0001) significantly contributed to the development of moderate, moderately severe, or severe depression. The pandemic has taken a serious toll on the physical and mental health of doctors, as evident from our study. Regular screening of medical personnel involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 should be conducted to evaluate for stress, anxiety, and depression.","Das, Sil, Jaiswal, Rajeev, Thole, Jafferany, Ali","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.20m02716","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5621,""

"Naloxone Use by Emergency Medical Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey","The COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has hit in the midst of the opioid overdose crisis. Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians may limit their use of intranasal naloxone due to concerns of novel coronavirus infection. We sought to determine changes in overdose events and naloxone administration practices by EMS clinicians. Between April 29, 2020 and May 15, 2020, we surveyed directors of EMS fellowship programs across the US about how overdose events and naloxone administration practices had changed in their catchment areas since March 2020. Based on 60 respondents across all regions of the country, one fifth of surveyed communities have experienced an increase in opioid overdoses and events during which naloxone was administered, and 40% have experienced a decrease. The findings varied by region of the country. Eighteen percent of respondents have discouraged or prohibited the use of intranasal naloxone with 10% encouraging the use of intramuscular naloxone. These findings may provide insight into changes in opioid overdose mortality during this time and assist in future disaster planning.","Cone, Bogucki, Burns, D'Onofrio, Hawk, Joseph, Fiellin","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000746","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5623,""
"Case Report: Virtual Reality Behavioral Activation as an Intervention for Major Depressive Disorder","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence. There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one's ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using virtual reality to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of virtual reality behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for four weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a virtual reality headset. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant's depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the PHQ-9 over a month, with a beginning score of a 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of a 5 (mild depression). The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

"Digital phenotyping to enhance substance use treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: Viewpoint","The COVID-19 pandemic has required transitioning many clinical addiction treatment programs to telephonic or virtual visits. Novel solutions are needed to enhance substance use treatment during a time when many patients are disconnected from clinical care and social supports. Digital phenotyping, which leverages the unique functionality of smartphones sensors (GPS, social behavior, and typing patterns), can buttress clinical treatment in a remote, scalable fashion. Specifically, digital phenotyping has the potential to improve relapse prediction and intervention, relapse detection, and overdose intervention. Digital phenotyping may enhance relapse prediction through coupling machine learning algorithms with the enormous wealth of collected behavioral data. Activity based analysis in real time potentially can be used to prevent relapse by warning substance users when they approach locational triggers such as bars or liquor stores. Wearable devices detect when someone has relapsed to substances through measuring physiological changes such as electrodermal activity and locomotion. Despite its initial promise, privacy, security and barriers to access are important issues to address.","Hsu, Ahern, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.2196/21814","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5625,""

We employed difference-in-differences analyses to determine whether the changes in these outcomes during and after the recession for each comparison group (those with moderate mental illness, serious psychiatric disability, or physical disability) were significantly different from the changes for persons with neither a mental illness nor a disability. <b> <i>Findings:</i> </b> While the recession impacted all groups, those with mental illnesses or physical disabilities were hardest hit. Persons with disabilities were disadvantaged on all outcomes at each period, but persons with mental illnesses were the most disadvantaged. Unemployment, poverty, and use of food stamps increased for all groups, but the increase was greatest for persons with mental health problems who also saw a more substantial decline in wage income. <b> <i>Conclusions and Implications for Practice:</i> </b> The effects of the recession persist well after the recovery period. Practitioners should be aware that although most persons with mental illnesses want to work, they face significant barriers to employment. Following economic shocks such as those brought on by the current coronavirus pandemic, interventions should focus on people who are the most vulnerable, especially those with mental health problems.

"Planning for Mental Health Needs During COVID-19","The ability to effectively prepare for and respond to the psychological fallout from large-scale disasters is a core competency of military mental health providers, as well as civilian emergency response teams. Disaster planning should be situation specific and data driven; vague, broad-spectrum planning can contribute to unprepared mental health teams and underserved patient populations. Herein, we review data on mental health sequelae from the twenty-first century pandemics, including SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19), and offer explanations for observed trends, insights regarding anticipated needs, and recommendations for preliminary planning on how to best allocate limited mental health resources. Anxiety and distress, often attributed to isolation, were the most prominent mental health complaints during previous pandemics and with COVID-19. Additionally, post-traumatic stress was surprisingly common and possibly more enduring than depression, insomnia, and alcohol misuse. Predictions regarding COVID-19's economic impact suggest that depression and suicide rates may increase over time. Available data suggest that the mental health sequelae of COVID-19 will mirror those of previous pandemics. Clinicians and mental health leaders should focus planning efforts on the negative effects of isolation, particularly anxiety and distress, as well as post-traumatic stress symptoms.","Han, Schmidt, Waits, Bell, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01189-6","20201008","COVID-19; Data-informed planning; Disaster psychiatry; Mental health; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5628,""
"Health Benefits In 2020: Premiums In Employer-Sponsored Plans Grow 4Ã‚Â Percent;Ã‚Â Employers Consider Responses To Pandemic","The annual Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey is the benchmark survey of the cost and coverage of employer-sponsored health benefits in the United States.

Data collection took place from mid-January through July, with half of the interviews being completed in the first three months of the year. Most of the key metrics that we measure-including premiums and cost sharing-reflect employers' decisions made before the full impacts of the pandemic were felt. We found that in 2020 the average annual premium for single coverage rose 4Ã‚Â percent, to $7,470, and the average annual premium for family coverage also rose 4Ã‚Â percent, to $21,342. Covered workers, on average, contributed 17Ã‚Â percent of the cost for single coverage and 27Ã‚Â percent of the cost for family coverage. Fifty-six percent of firms offered health benefits to at least some of their workers, and 64Ã‚Â percent of workers were covered at their own firm.

"The impact of COVID-19 on smoking patterns in Pakistan: findings from a longitudinal survey of smokers","We investigated the influence of COVID-19 on smoking patterns in Pakistan. In a longitudinal survey, we asked cigarette smokers in Pakistan about their smoking behaviours before and since COVID-19. Smokers were recruited before COVID-19 using two-stage random probability sampling. Since COVID-19, three subsequent waves were conducted over the telephone, asking additional questions on social determinants, mental health and wellbeing. Based on the first two waves, we estimated the proportion of smokers who stopped, decreased, maintained, or increased smoking. We also explored any factors associated with the change in smoking patterns. In those who stopped smoking soon after COVID-19, we estimated the proportion relapsed in subsequent waves. We estimated all proportions based on complete-case analysis. We recruited 6,014 smokers between September 2019 and February 2020; of these, 2,087 (2,062 reported smoking outcomes) were followed up in May 2020 after COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 14% (290/2,062) smokers reported quitting. Among those who continued smoking: 68% (1210/1772) reduced, 14% (239/1772) maintained, and 18% (323/1772) increased cigarette consumption; 37% (351/938) reported at least one quit attempt; 41% (669/1619) were more motivated while 21% (333/1619) were less motivated to quit. Changes in smoking patterns varied with nicotine dependence, motivation to quit, and financial stability since COVID-19. Among those reporting quitting soon after COVID-19, 39% (81/206) relapsed in the subsequent months (June-July 2020). There have been significant bidirectional changes in smoking patterns since COVID-19 in Pakistan. While many people stopped, reduced, or tried quitting smoking, some increased smoking, and some relapsed after quitting. We observed significant and complex changes in people's smoking patterns, which are likely to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and replicated in similar events in the future. Assessing these changes are essential for most low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, where the vast majority of tobacco users live, but cessation support is still rudimentary. If provided routinely, smoking cessation interventions can potentially support millions of highly motivated individuals in quitting successfully both in general as well as in global events like COVID-19, in particular.","Siddiqi, Siddiqui, Khan, Ansaari, Kanaan, Khokhar, Islam, Mishu, Bauld","https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa207","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5630,""
"Covid-19 Estimating the burden of symptomatic disease in the community and the impact of public health measures on physical, mental and social wellbeing: a study protocol","<b>Introduction</b>: Covid-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, governments have implemented unprecedented public health measures to contain the virus. This study will provide evidence to inform responses to the pandemic by: i) estimating population prevalence and trends of self-reported symptoms of Covid-19 and the proportions of symptomatic individuals and household contacts testing positive for Covid-19; ii) describing acceptance and compliance with physical-distancing measures, explore effects of public health measures on physical, mental and social wellbeing; iii) developing a mathematical network model to inform decisions on the optimal levels of physical distancing measures. <b>Methods</b>: Two cross-sectional nationally-representative telephone surveys will be conducted in Ireland using random digit-dialling, with response rates estimates based on proportion of non-operational and non-answering numbers. The first survey with four waves in May and June will address adherence to social distancing measures and whether the respondent or other household members are or have been unwell during the preceding two weeks with one or more symptoms of Covid-19. The second survey with three waves in June, July and September will address knowledge, attitudes, and compliance towards physical-distancing measures and physical, mental and social wellbeing. The mathematical network model will be developed for all-Ireland (on various levels of spatial granularity including the scale of counties and electoral divisions) based on outputs from both cross-sectional surveys and relevant publicly available data to inform decisions on optimal levels and duration of physical distancing measures. <b>Discussion</b>: This study will contribute to our understanding of the impact and sustainability of public health measures of the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings will have long-lasting benefits, informing decision-making on the best levels, and duration of physical-distancing measures, balancing a range of factors including capacity of the health service with the effects on individuals' wellbeing and economic disruption.

"The Born in Bradford COVID-19 Research Study: Protocol for an adaptive mixed methods research study to gather actionable intelligence on the impact of COVID-19 on health inequalities amongst families living in Bradford","The UK COVID-19 lockdown has included restricting social movement and interaction to slow the spread of disease and reduce demand on NHS acute services. It is likely that the impacts of restrictions will hit the least advantaged disproportionately and will worsen existing structural inequalities amongst deprived and ethnic minority groups. The aim of this study is to deliver rapid intelligence to enable an effective COVID-19 response, including co-production of interventions, that address key issues in the City of Bradford, UK, and nationally. In the longer term we aim to understand the impacts of the response on health trajectories and inequalities in these. In this paper we describe our approach and protocol. We plan an adaptive longitudinal mixed methods approach embedded with Born in Bradford (BiB) birth cohorts which have rich existing data (including questionnaire, routine health and biobank). All work packages (WP) interact and are ongoing. WP1 uses co-production and engagement methods with communities, decision-makers and researchers to continuously set (changing) research priorities and will, longer-term, co-produce interventions to aid the City's recovery. In WP2 repeated quantitative surveys will be administered during lockdown (April-June 2020), with three repeat surveys until 12 months post-lockdown with an ethnically diverse pool of BiB participants (parents, children aged 9-13 years, pregnant women: total sample pool N=7,652, N=5,154, N=1,800). A range of health, social, economic and education outcomes will be assessed. In WP3 priority topics identified in WP1 and WP2 will be explored qualitatively. Initial priority topics include children's mental wellbeing, health beliefs and the peri/post-natal period. Feedback loops will ensure findings are fed directly to decision-makers and communities (via WP1) to enable co-production of acceptable interventions and identify future priority topic areas.

"Stressors, coping and symptoms of adjustment disorder in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic - study protocol of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) pan-European study","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the people in Europe are exposed to self-isolation, quarantine, job loss, risk of contracting COVID-19, or grief of loved ones. Such a complex array of stressors may lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. This research protocol describes a study launched by the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms of adjustment disorder across European countries. The longitudinal online cohort study aims (1) to explore psychosocial reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic across ten European countries; (2) to examine the relationships between risk and resilience factors, stressors and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the pandemic; and (3) to investigate whether these relationships are moderated by coping behaviours. In ten countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden), between 1,000 and 2,000 participants will be recruited, depending on the size of the country. Participants will be assessed at two timepoints with a six-month interval. Following a conceptual framework based on the WHO's social framework of health, an assessment of risk and resilience factors, COVID-19 related stressors and pandemic-specific coping behaviours will be measured to estimate their contribution to symptoms of adjustment disorder. The Adjustment Disorder New Module 8 (ADNM-8) will be used to assess symptoms of adjustment disorder. As a secondary measure, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder will be measure using the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5). The relative contribution of risk factors, resilience factors, and stressors on symptoms of adjustment disorder or symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder will be estimated using multilevel analysis. To determine the moderating effects of different types of coping behaviours on these relationships, a multilevel mediation analysis will be carried out. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Durante la actual pandemia de COVID-19, las personas en Europa estÃƒÂ¡n expuestas a autoaislamiento, cuarentena, pÃƒÂ©rdida de empleo, riesgo de contraer COVID-19 o duelo de sus seres queridos.

Este protocolo de investigaciÃƒÂ³n describe un estudio lanzado por la Sociedad Europea de Estudios de EstrÃƒÂ©s TraumÃƒÂ¡tico (ESTSS) para investigar el impacto de la pandemia COVID-19 en los sÃƒÂ­ntomas del trastorno de adaptaciÃƒÂ³n en paÃƒÂ­ses europeos.<b>Objetivo:</b> El estudio longitudinal de cohorte en lÃƒÂ­nea tiene como objetivo (1) explorar las reacciones psicosociales a la pandemia de COVID-19 en diez paÃƒÂ­ses europeos; (2) examinar las relaciones entre los factores de riesgo y resiliencia, estresores y sÃƒÂ­ntomas de trastorno de adaptaciÃƒÂ³n durante la pandemia; e (3) investigar si estas relaciones son moderadas por comportamientos de afrontamiento.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> En diez paÃƒÂ­ses (Austria, Croacia, Georgia, Alemania, Italia, Lituania, PaÃƒÂ­ses Bajos, Polonia, Portugal y Suecia) serÃƒÂ¡n reclutados entre 1,000 y 2,000 participantes, dependiendo del tamaÃƒÂ±o del paÃƒÂ­s. Los participantes serÃƒÂ¡n evaluados en dos momentos con un intervalo de seis meses. Siguiendo un marco conceptual basado en el marco social de salud de la OMS, una evaluaciÃƒÂ³n de los factores de riesgo y resiliencia, factores estresantes relacionados con COVID-19 y el comportamiento de afrontamiento especÃƒÂ­fico de la pandemia serÃƒÂ¡n medidos para estimar su contribuciÃƒÂ³n a los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de trastorno de adaptaciÃƒÂ³n. El nuevo mÃƒÂ³dulo de trastorno de adaptaciÃƒÂ³n 8 (ADNM-8) se utilizarÃƒÂ¡ para medir los sÃƒÂ­ntomas del trastorno de adaptaciÃƒÂ³n. Como medida secundaria, se evaluarÃƒÂ¡n sÃƒÂ­ntomas de trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico usando el cribaje de TEPT en atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria para DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5).<b>AnÃƒÂ¡lisis de datos:</b> La contribuciÃƒÂ³n relativa de los factores de riesgo, factores de resiliencia y los estresores sobre los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de trastorno de adaptaciÃƒÂ³n o sÃƒÂ­ntomas de trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico se estimarÃƒÂ¡ mediante anÃƒÂ¡lisis multinivel. Para determinar los efectos moderadores de diferentes tipos de conductas de afrontamiento en estas relaciones, se llevarÃƒÂ¡ a cabo un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de mediaciÃƒÂ³n multinivel. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>:Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â½â€œÃ¥â€°ÂCOVID 19Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´, Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¦Â´Â²Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¦Â°â€˜Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã©Å¡â€Ã§Â¦Â», Ã©Å¡â€Ã§Â¦Â», Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã¤Â¸Å¡, Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œCOVID-19Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã§â€”â€ºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¦â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Ââ€šÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â³Â»Ã¥Ë†â€”Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ¦Ë†â€“Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã¦ÂÂÃ¨Â¿Â°Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§â€Â±Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¦Â´Â²Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¼Å¡ (ESTSS) Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶COVID-19Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Â¬Â§Ã¦Â´Â²Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>:Ã§ÂºÂµÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¤Â¸Å Ã©ËœÅ¸Ã¥Ë†â€”Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨ (1) Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¦Å¸Â¥10Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Â¬Â§Ã¦Â´Â²Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹COVID-19Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€; (2) Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»; (3) Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦â€°â‚¬Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>:Ã¥Â°â€ Ã¥Å“Â¨10Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶ (Ã¥Â¥Â¥Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¥Ë†Â©, Ã¥â€¦â€¹Ã§Â½â€”Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¤ÂºÅ¡, Ã¤Â¹â€Ã¦Â²Â»Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã¥Â·Å¾, Ã¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ½, Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Ë†Â©, Ã§Â«â€¹Ã©â„¢Â¶Ã¥Â®â€º, Ã¨ÂÂ·Ã¥â€¦Â°, Ã¦Å’ÂªÃ¥Â¨Â, Ã¦Â³Â¢Ã¥â€¦Â°, Ã¨â€˜Â¡Ã¨Ââ€žÃ§â€°â„¢Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€˜Å¾Ã¥â€¦Â¸) Ã¦â€¹â€ºÃ¥â€¹Å¸1,000Ã¨â€¡Â³2,000Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦, Ã¥â€¦Â·Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥Ââ€“Ã¥â€ Â³Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â§â€žÃ¦Â¨Â¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â°â€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©â€”Â´Ã©Å¡â€Ã¥â€¦Â­Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã§â€šÂ¹Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â Â¹Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦Â¡â€ Ã¦Å¾Â¶Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Å¸ÂºÃ§Â¡â‚¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â¦â€šÃ¥Â¿ÂµÃ¦Â¡â€ Ã¦Å¾Â¶, Ã¥Â°â€ Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Â¸Âº, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ£â‚¬Å Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Ââ€”8Ã£â‚¬â€¹ (ADNM-8) Ã¥Â°â€ Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã©â€¡ÂÃ©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤ÂºÅ’Ã§ÂºÂ§Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã©â€¡Â, Ã¥Â°â€ Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬Å DSM-5Ã¥Ë†ÂÃ§ÂºÂ§PTSDÃ§Â­â€ºÃ¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€¹ (PC-PTSD-5) Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾Â</b>:Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â´Â¡Ã§Å’Â®Ã¥Â°â€ Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Â¼Â°Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ§Â±Â»Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨, Ã¥Â°â€ Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Lotzin, Acquarini, Ajdukovic, Ardino, BÃƒÂ¶ttche, Bondjers, BragesjÃƒÂ¶, Dragan, Grajewski, Figueiredo-Braga, Gelezelyte, Javakhishvili, Kazlauskas, Knefel, Lueger-Schuster, Makhashvili, Mooren, Sales, Stevanovic, SchÃƒÂ¤fer","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2020.1780832","20201008","COVID-19; adjustment disorder; coping style; coronavirus; disaster; mental health; pandemic; posttraumatic stress; stress-related disorders; stressors; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In this pan-European longitudinal cohort study, launched by the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS), we will investigate risk and resilience factors, stressors and maladaptive adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5633,""
"Psychological distress and state boredom during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: the role of meaning in life and media use","Epidemics are associated with increased burden of psychological distress. However, the role of boredom on mental health during epidemic periods has seldom been explored. This study attempted to examine the effect of state boredom on psychological outcomes, and the role of media use and meaning in life among the indirectly exposed Chinese adults in the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. An online survey was administered to 917 Chinese adults on 28 January 2020 (1 week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess state boredom, anxiety, depression, stress, media use and meaning in life. Moderated mediation analysis was conducted. Our results indicated that the effect of state boredom on anxiety and stress, but not depression, were mediated by media use and that sense of meaning in life modified this association. Meaning in life served as a risk factor, rather than a protective factor for the negative psychological outcomes when people experienced boredom. The association between boredom and media use was significant for high but not low meaning in life individuals. These findings demonstrated that boredom and media use were associated with an increased burden or psychological distress in the sample. It is important to pay attention to the possible negative impact of boredom and media use during COVID-19, and find more ways to cope with boredom, especially those with high presence of meaning in life. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Las epidemias estÃƒÂ¡n asociadas con aumento de la carga de malestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico. Sin embargo, el papel del aburrimiento en la salud mental durante periodos de epidemia ha sido rara vez explorado.<b>Objetivo</b>: Este estudio intentÃƒÂ³ examinar el efecto del estado de aburrimiento en las consecuencias psicolÃƒÂ³gicas y el papel del uso de los medios y significado en la vida entre los adultos chinos indirectamente expuestos en la fase inicial del brote de COVID-19.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: Se administrÃƒÂ³ una encuesta online a 917 adultos chinos el 28 de Enero del 2020 (una semana despuÃƒÂ©s de la declaraciÃƒÂ³n oficial de la transmisiÃƒÂ³n del coronavirus persona a persona). Se usaron cuestionarios de auto-reporte para evaluar el estado de aburrimiento, ansiedad, depresiÃƒÂ³n, estrÃƒÂ©s, uso de medios y significado en la vida. Se realizÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de mediaciÃƒÂ³n moderado.<b>Resultados</b>: Nuestros resultados indicaron que el efecto del estado de aburrimiento sobre la ansiedad y el estrÃƒÂ©s, pero no depresiÃƒÂ³n, estuvieron mediados por el uso de los medios y que el sentido de significado en la vida modificÃƒÂ³ esta asociaciÃƒÂ³n. El significado en la vida sirviÃƒÂ³ como factor de riesgo, mÃƒÂ¡s que como un factor protector para las consecuencias psicolÃƒÂ³gicas negativas cuando la gente experimentÃƒÂ³ aburrimiento. La asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre aburrimiento y uso de los medios fue significativa para el significado alto pero no bajo en la vida en los individuos.<b>Conclusiones</b>: Estos hallazgos demostraron que, en la muestra, el aburrimiento y el uso de los medios estuvieron asociados con un aumento de la carga o malestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico. Es importante poner atenciÃƒÂ³n acerca del posible impacto negativo del aburrimiento y el uso de los medios durante el COVID-19, y encontrar mÃƒÂ¡s formas de lidiar con el aburrimiento, especialmente aquellos con presencia alta de significado en la vida. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½â€ Ã¦ËœÂ¯, Ã¥Â°â€˜Ã¦Å“â€°Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€¢Ã¥â€ºÂ¾Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨COVID-19Ã§Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Ë†ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸, Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã§â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã§â€“Â¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤ÂºÅ½2020Ã¥Â¹Â´1Ã¦Å“Ë†28Ã¦â€”Â¥ (Ã¥ÂÂ³Ã¥Â®ËœÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Â®Â£Ã¥Â¸Æ’Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¤Â¼Â Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥â€˜Â¨) Ã¥Â¯Â¹917Ã¥ÂÂÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ , Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜, Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’Â, Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€º, Ã¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ (Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’Â) Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§â€Â±Ã¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã§Å¡â€ž, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â½â€œÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¤Â»Â¬Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¦â€”Â¶, Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂ±Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã¤Â»â€¦Ã¤Â½â€œÃ§Å½Â°Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã©Â«ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â½â€œÃ¥â€°ÂÃ¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¤Â¸Â­, Ã¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Â¸Â¦Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¦â€°Â¾Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â€”Â Ã¨ÂÅ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢, Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã©â€šÂ£Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€¦Â·Ã¦Å“â€°Ã©Â«ËœÃ§â€Å¸Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Chao, Chen, Liu, Yang, Hall","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2020.1769379","20201008","Boredom; COVID-19; disaster; meaning in life; media use; mental health; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ State boredom during the outbreak was associated with psychological distress.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Disaster-related media use mediated the relationship between state boredom and stress and anxiety.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Meaning in life served as a risk factor for the negative psychological outcomes when people experienced boredom.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5634,""
"Assessment of the Potential Adverse Events Related to Ribavirin-Interferon Combination for Novel Coronavirus Therapy","We aimed to analyze and evaluate the safety signals of ribavirin-interferon combination through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), so as to provide reference for the rationale use of these agents in the management of relevant toxicities emerging in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 8 March 2020 were analyzed. The proportion of report ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and Bayesian confidence interval progressive neural network (BCPNN) method were used to detect the safety signals. A total of 55 safety signals were detected from the top 250 adverse event reactions in 2200 reports, but 19 signals were not included in the drug labels. All the detected adverse event reactions were associated with 13 System Organ Classes (SOC), such as gastrointestinal, blood and lymph, hepatobiliary, endocrine, and various nervous systems. The most frequent adverse events were analyzed, and the results showed that females were more likely to suffer from anemia, vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea, and insomnia.

"Addressing the Syndemic of HIV, Hepatitis C, Overdose, and COVID-19 Among People Who Use Drugs: The Potential Roles for Decriminalization and Safe Supply","People who use drugs (PWUD) face concurrent public health emergencies from overdoses, HIV, hepatitis C, and COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented syndemic. Responses to PWUD that go beyond treatment--such as decriminalization and providing a safe supply of pharmaceutical-grade drugs--could reduce impacts of this syndemic. Solutions already implemented for COVID-19, such as emergency safe-supply prescribing and providing housing to people experiencing homelessness, must be sustained once COVID-19 is contained. This pandemic is not only a public health crisis but also a chance to develop and maintain equitable and sustainable solutions to the harms associated with the criminalization of drug use.","Bonn, Palayew, Bartlett, Brothers, Touesnard, Tyndall","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+the+Syndemic+of+HIV,+Hepatitis+C,+Overdose,+and+COVID-19+Among+People+Who+Use+Drugs:+The+Potential+Roles+for+Decriminalization+and+Safe+Supply.","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5637,""
"Asian-Pacific perspective on the psychological well-being of healthcare workers during the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to significant strain on front-line healthcare workers. In this multicentre study, we compared the psychological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in various countries in the Asia-Pacific region and identified factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. From 29 April to 4 June 2020, the study recruited healthcare workers from major healthcare institutions in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A self-administrated survey that collected information on prior medical conditions, presence of symptoms, and scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relating to COVID-19 was compared, and multivariable logistic regression identified independent factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes within each country. A total of 1146 participants from India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam were studied. Despite having the lowest volume of cases, Vietnam displayed the highest prevalence of PTSD. In contrast, Singapore reported the highest case volume, but had a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. In the multivariable analysis, we found that non-medically trained personnel, the presence of physical symptoms and presence of prior medical conditions were independent predictors across the participating countries. This study highlights that the varied prevalence of psychological adversity among healthcare workers is independent of the burden of COVID-19 cases within each country. Early psychological interventions may be beneficial for the vulnerable groups of healthcare workers with presence of physical symptoms, prior medical conditions and those who are not medically trained.","Chew, Ngiam, Tan, Tham, Tan, Jing, Sagayanathan, Chen, Wong, Ahmad, Khan, Marmin, Hassan, Sharon, Lim, Mohaini, Danuaji, Nguyen, Tsivgoulis, Tsiodras, Fragkou, Dimopoulou, Sharma, Shah, Patel, Sharma, Komalkumar, Meenakshi, Talati, Teoh, Ho, Ho, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.98","20201008","Asia-Pacific; COVID-19; healthcare workers; pandemic; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5638,""

"Integration of Online Treatment Into the &quot;New Normal&quot; in Mental Health Care in Post-COVID-19 Times: Exploratory Qualitative Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an immediate and large-scale uptake of online treatment for mental health care. However, there is uncertainty about what the &quot;new normal&quot; in mental health care will be like in post-COVID-19 times. To what extent will the experiences gained during the pandemic influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online mental health care treatment in the future? In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. From the interviews, we learn that the new normal in mental health care will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental health care professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from this type of treatment. Sustainable upscaling of online mental health care requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility of mental health care providers. Online treatment could work for those who are open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done before online treatment is inherently part of mental health care.","Bierbooms, van Haaren, IJsselsteijn, de Kort, Feijt, Bongers","https://doi.org/10.2196/21344","20201008","COVID-19; mental health care; online treatment; sustainability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5640,""

"â€œMy Husband Thinks Iâ€™m Crazyâ€: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children","Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothersâ€™ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothersâ€™ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19. Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partnersâ€™ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partnersâ€™ dismissals of mothersâ€™ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.","Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96","20201009","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; relationships; work-family; family; conflict; health; decision-making; covid-19; parenthood","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5644,""
"Physically distant but socially close? Changes in intergenerational non-physical contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic among older people in France, Italy and Spain","Keeping physical distance is intended to mitigate the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face interactions on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are particularly relevant for older peopleâ€™s mental health implications. Our analyses rely on an on-line representative survey conducted in Italy, Spain and France during April 14-24 2020. We considered the sub-sample of individuals aged 50+ (N=4,207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyse how changes in intergenerational relationships differed by socio-economic factors in the three considered countries and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in physical interactions. Finally, changes in the use of digital devices has been explored as a consequence of both, decreased in physical and increased in non-physical intergenerational contacts. Our findings are relevant to understand changes in intergenerational relationships during the pandemic and to better plan future outbreak responses.","Bruno Arpino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AD-ACD-44A","20201009","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; family relationships; sars-cov-2; digital contacts; intergenerational relationships; covid; older people; social contacts; coronavirus; intergenerational contacts","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-09","",5645,""
