"Experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analysis of risk perceptions and mental health in a student cohort","Objective: This study examined the COVID-19 risk perceptions and mental health of university students on returning to campus in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey was completed during the first four weeks of the academic year (October 2020) by 897 university students. The survey included demographics and measures of experiences of COVID-19 testing, self-isolation, shielding, perceived risk, mental health and indices capturing related psychological responses to the pandemic. Results: We observed higher levels of depression and anxiety, but not stress, in students compared with pre-pandemic normative data, but lower than levels reported earlier in the pandemic in other similar cohorts. Depression, anxiety and stress were independently associated with greater loneliness and reduced positive mood. Greater worry about COVID-19 was also independently associated with anxiety and stress. Female students and those with pre-existing mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Although students perceived themselves at only moderate risk of COVID-19, the prevalence of depression and anxiety among university students should remain a concern. Universities should provide adequate support for students mental health during term-time. Interventions to reduced loneliness and worry, and improve mood, may benefit students overall mental well-being.","Ru Jia; Holly Knight; Holly Blake; Jessica Corner; Chris Denning; Jonathan Ball; Kirsty Bolton; Joanne R Morling; Carol Coupland; Grazziela Figueredo; David Ed Morris; Patrick Tighe; Armando Villalon; Kieran Aylling; Kavita Vedhara","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248467","20201222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8483,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Vaccine Hesitancy among Farmworkers from Monterey County, California","Objectives. To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on farmworkers from Monterey County, California. Methods. We recruited adult farmworkers (n=1115) between July 16, 2020 and November 30, 2020. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, economic and social stressors experienced during COVID-19, and willingness to be vaccinated via interviews by phone. Results. Study participants, particularly female farmworkers, reported adverse effects of the pandemic on their mental health and home environment (e.g., 24% overall reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms). The pandemic also resulted in greater financial burden for many farmworkers, with 37% food insecure and 51% unable to pay bills. Half of respondents reported that they were extremely likely to be vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy was most common in participants who were women, younger, born in the United States, and living in more rural areas. Conclusions. We found that the pandemic has substantially impacted the mental and physical health and economic and food security of farmworkers. Public Health Implications. This study highlights the need to provide farmworkers with supplemental income, and increased mental and family health, and food support services.","Ana M Mora; Joseph A Lewnard; Katherine Kogut; Stephen Rauch; Norma Morga; Nicholas Jewell; Maximiliano Cuevas; Brenda Eskenazi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248518","20201222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8484,""
"Impact of housing conditions on changes in youth's mental health following the initial national COVID-19 lockdown: A cohort study","Abstract Objective To investigate whether changes in youth's mental health were dependent on housing conditions during the initial Danish national COVID-19 lockdown. Design Cohort Setting The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) at participants' 18th year of life and subsequently three weeks into the initial national lockdown (April 2020) Participants 7445 youth aged 18 to 23 Exposure Housing conditions measured as direct access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition during the lockdown. Main outcome measures Comparisons of before and during lockdown mental health parameters measured as adjusted mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for changes in scores of mental well-being (Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS)) and Quality of Life (QOL; adapted Cantril ladder). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % CI for onset of low mental well-being (score [&le;]20), low QoL (score [&le;]5), and loneliness. Results Participants had a median age of 20 years at lockdown and were predominantly female. Youth without direct access to outdoor spaces had a greater decrease in mental well-being compared to those with a garden, mean difference: -0.83 (95 % CI -1.19,-0.48), and correspondingly greater odds of onset of low mental well-being, OR: 1.68 (95 % CI 1.15, 2.47). Youth in higher density households and those living alone also had greater odds of onset of low mental well-being (OR: 1.23 (95 % CI 1.05, 1.43) and OR: 1.47 (95 % CI 1.05, 2.07), respectively). Onset of low QoL was associated with living in denser households, as well as living alone. Living alone more than doubled odds of onset of loneliness, OR: 2.12 (95 % CI 1.59, 2.82). Conclusion Youth's mental health declined from before the pandemic to three weeks into the initial national lockdown. However, not all youth were equally affected and our findings inform policy makers that youth living alone, in denser households, and without direct access to outdoor spaces are especially vulnerable.","Jonathan Groot; AmÃ©lie ClÃ©o Keller; Andrea Joensen; Tri-Long Nguyen; Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen; Katrine Strandberg-Larsen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191","20201222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8485,""

"Invited Commentary: Reckoning With the Relationship Between Stressors and Suicide Attempts in a Time of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a unique set of risk exposures for populations, which might lead to an increase in suicide. While large-scale traumatic events are known to increase psychological disorders, thus far the science has not shown a clear link between these events and suicide. In this issue of the Journal, Elbogen et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;189(11):1266-1274) used representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to show that 4 dimensions of financial strain-financial debt/crisis, unemployment, past homelessness, and lower income-are associated with subsequent suicide attempts. There are 3 main lessons we can take from Elbogen et al.: First, with populations facing record-breaking unemployment, economic recession, and reduced wages, we can anticipate an increase in suicide in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, these data show the centrality of financial stressors, marking the current moment as distinct from other disasters or large-scale trauma. Third, the data teach us that financial stressors are linked and cumulative. In this way, Elbogen et al. provide a sobering harbinger of the potential effects on suicide of the collective stressors borne by the COVID-19 pandemic and other mass traumatic events that are accompanied by substantial financial stressors.","Ettman, Catherine K; Gradus, Jaimie L; Galea, Sandro","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa147","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Epidemiol;189(11): 1275-1277, 2020 11 02.; Publication details: Am J Epidemiol;189(11): 1275-1277, 2020 11 02.; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Economic Recession; Humans; Suicide, Attempted; Unemployment; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8487,""
"The adverse health effects of punitive immigrant policies in the United States: A systematic review","BACKGROUND: Immigrants in the United States (US) today are facing a dynamic policy landscape. The Trump administration has threatened or curtailed access to basic services for 10.5 million undocumented immigrants currently in the US. We sought to examine the historical effects that punitive laws have had on health outcomes in US immigrant communities. METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched the following databases from inception-May 2020 for original research articles with no language restrictions: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Library (Wiley), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Social Work Abstracts (Ovid). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019138817. Articles with cohort sizes >10 that directly evaluated the health-related effects of a punitive immigrant law or policy within the US were included. FINDINGS: 6,357 studies were screened for eligibility. Of these, 32 studies were selected for inclusion and qualitatively synthesized based upon four themes that appeared throughout our analysis: (1) impact on healthcare utilization, (2) impact on women's and children's health, (3) impact on mental health services, and (4) impact on public health. The impact of each law, policy, mandate, and directive since 1990 is briefly discussed, as are the limitations and risk of bias of each study. INTERPRETATION: Many punitive immigrant policies have decreased immigrant access to and utilization of basic healthcare services, while instilling fear, confusion, and anxiety in these communities. The federal government should preserve and expand access for undocumented individuals without threat of deportation to improve health outcomes for US citizens and noncitizens.","Vernice, Nicholas A; Pereira, Nicola M; Wang, Anson; Demetres, Michelle; Adams, Lisa V","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244054","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;15(12): e0244054, 2020.; Publication details: PLoS One;15(12): e0244054, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8488,""

search was carried out through the PubMed search engine  The keywords were ""Pandemics"", ""COVID-19"", ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"", ""H1N1 Influenza"", ""Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection"", ""Post Traumatic Stress Disorder"" and ""Patients""  Original works, reviews and clinical cases of the last 20 years, published in scientific journals, were included  DISCUSSION: The literature describes the development of psychopathology in all the pandemics investigated, highlighting symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological trauma, as well as a high prevalence of PTSD  The etiology of these manifestations is not fully elucidated, although it would be influenced by conditions experienced, medications, and failure of early detection  There is also an important association with prolonged stays in intensive care unit  At post-discharge follow-up, higher rates of mental health pathology were observed in surviving patients, compared to the general population, among which PTSD stood out  CONCLUSIONS: The impact of pandemics is increasingly being studied  Mental health is positioned as an important dimension to take into account in the subsequent quality of life of the general population and survivors  The pandemic caused by COVID-19 is still in development, and the effects it will have on mental health can be extrapolated through the existing evidence of previous pandemics  Only time will tell if the lessons have been learned and the necessary action taken  (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] INTRODUCCIÃ“N: Las pandemias han sido catÃ¡strofes

"Innate Inhibiting Proteins Enhance Expression and Immunogenicity of Self-Amplifying RNA","Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a cutting-edge platform for both nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics. saRNA is self-adjuvanting, as it activates types I and III interferon (IFN), which enhances the immunogenicity of RNA vaccines but can also lead to inhibition of translation. In this study, we screened a library of saRNA constructs with cis-encoded innate inhibiting proteins (IIPs) and determined the effect on protein expression and immunogenicity. We observed that the PIV-5Ã‚Â V and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a proteins enhance protein expression 100- to 500-fold inÃ‚Â vitro in IFN-competent HeLa and MRC5 cells. We found that the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein partially abates dose nonlinearity inÃ‚Â vivo, and that ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor, but not the IIPs, enhances protein expression of saRNA inÃ‚Â vivo. Both the PIV-5Ã‚Â V and MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins were found to enhance the percentage of resident cells in human skin explants expressing saRNA and completely rescued dose nonlinearity of saRNA. Finally, we observed that the MERS-CoV ORF4a increased the rabies virus (RABV)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) by Ã¢Ë†Â¼10-fold in rabbits, but not in mice or rats. These experiments provide a proof of concept that IIPs can be directly encoded into saRNA vectors and effectively abate the nonlinear dose dependency and enhance immunogenicity.","Blakney, McKay, Bouton, Hu, Samnuan, Shattock","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011","20201222","RNA; gene delivery; immunomodulation; innate immunity; interferon; nanoparticles; replicon; self-amplifying; vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8500,""
"Differential effect of gender, marital status, religion, ethnicity, education and employment status on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria","We examine the differential effect of gender, marital status, ethnicity, religion, education and employment status on mental health indicators (successful coping, stress &amp; self-esteem) during COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. Applying a cross sectional approach, we administered an anonymised online questionnaire to select 353 individuals (<i>mean ageÃ‚Â </i>= 34.84,Ã‚Â <i>SD</i>Ã‚Â = 11.19) from 17 April to 24 May 2020. Married individuals coped better, were less stressed and reported high self-esteem. Christians were less stressed and have high self-esteem. Yoruba ethnic group coped better and were high in self-esteem, while Igbo ethnic group was less stressed. Also, postgraduate degree holders coped well; secondary education holders were highly stressed; while first degree holders were high in self-esteem. Self-employed respondents successfully coped, while the unemployed were high in stress and low in self-esteem. Marital status and employment status directly and interactively affected overall mental health. Officially employed persons reported higher self-esteem and less stress. Married females, single males and self-employed males coped better, while self-employed singles recorded highest stress. No gender difference was observed in mental health indicators. The degree of differences in Nigerians' mental health indicators according to socio-demographics and the importance in improving mental health during and post COVID-19 pandemic are highlighted.","Lawal, Alhassan, Mogaji, Odoh, Essien","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1865548","20201222","COVID-19; Mental health; Nigeria; employment status; gender; marital status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8501,""
"Determinants of Mental Health Outcomes Among People With and Without Diabetes During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Arab Gulf Region","To determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety among people with and without diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study collecting demographic and mental health data from 2166 participants living in the Arab Gulf region (568 with diabetes, 1598 without diabetes). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 61% and 45%, in people with diabetes (PWD) and 62% and 44%, respectively, in people without diabetes. PWD who have had their diabetes visit cancelled by the clinic were more likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms than those without diabetes [OR (95% CI): 1.37 (1.02, 1.84) and 1.37 (1.04, 1.80), for depression and anxiety; respectively]. PWD who had no method of telecommunication with their health care providers (HCP) during the pandemic, PWD with A1C of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10%, women, employees (particularly HCPs), students, unmarried individuals, and those with lower income were more likely to report depression and/or anxiety symptoms (all p&lt;0.01). Fear of acquiring the coronavirus infection; running out of diabetes medications; or requiring hospitalization for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis; and lack of telecommunication with HCPs were all associated with significantly higher odds of having depression and anxiety symptoms among PWD. The remarkably high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among subgroups of PWD, calls for urgent public health policies to address mental health during the pandemic and re-establish health care access for PWD.","Al-Sofiani, Albunyan, Alguwaihes, Kalyani, Golden, Alfadda","https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-0407.13149","20201222","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Diabetes; Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8502,""
"COVID-19: anxiety among hospital staff and associated factors","During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital staff have experienced a variety of mental health challenges. European research on anxiety and stress among hospital workers during the pandemic is limited. This study aimed to describe the anxiety levels of Finnish hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multidimensional, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all hospital staff working at two Finnish specialized medical care centres in the spring of 2020 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°= 1,995). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was used to measure the workers' anxiety. The total mean GAD-7 score was 4.88, indicating normal anxiety levels. However, 30% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 1,079) of the respondents had mild, 10% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°194) moderate and 5% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°88) severe anxiety. Key risk factors were young age, working in a university hospital, problems in cooperation between co-workers, difficulty concentrating at work, a health-threatening physical and psychological workload, and a fear of being infected at work. Hospital staff experienced a variety of work-related stress and anxiety issues that should be visible to hospital administrators and policymakers alike. The anxiety is independent of whether the worker is directly involved in caring for or in any way coming into contact with COVID-19 patients. Key message Fifty-five percent of hospital staff have normal anxiety levels. The remaining workers may need targeted support interventions, and a smaller proportion (15%) are in danger of developing longer-term problems affecting their well-being. The anxiety experienced by hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than that of the population on average. If the pandemic continues, the well-being of hospital staff may be widely threatened. Despite the different geographical locations and COVID-19 situations, hospital workers in Finland and China had similar anxiety levels. The anxiety is independent of whether staff are working in the front line of managing the COVID-19 pandemic or of the number of covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The hospital workers felt anxiety because they were facing a new situation which causes changes in their work and daily routine. Health care employers should engage in long-term follow-up as regards the personnel's recovery from the burden caused by the pandemic and from work in general. It is necessary to make easily attainable, flexibly delivered and cost-effective treatment interventions for anxiety available to hospital staff.","Mattila, Peltokoski, Neva, Kaunonen, Helminen, Parkkila","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1862905","20201222","COVID-19; anxiety; hospital staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8503,""
"Biochemical study on the protective effect of curcumin on acetaminophen and gamma-irradiation induced hepatic toxicity in rats","Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the few recommended analgesic and antipyretic drugs in some critical cases such as viral disease COVID-19. However, the unrestricted use of APAP develops liver disorders. Hepatotoxicity and liver injury can also be induced by ionizing radiation (IR) during radiotherapy. The data of the current study represents that treatment of rats with either APAP-overdose, or gamma-irradiation (R) induces hepatotoxicity, results in significant increases of the hepatic-enzymes activities (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH, and MDH), as well as enhancement of triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, combined with declines in albumin and total protein contents. An enhancement of the lipid peroxides (malondialdehyde; MDA), and nitric oxide levels along with a decline of reduced glutathione contents and suppression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities are also observed within the liver tissues of intoxicated animals. TNF-ÃŽÂ±, IL-1ÃŽÂ², IL-6, iNOS, Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), miR-802 gene expression, NF-ÃŽÂºB, and calcium levels are up-regulated, while Nuclear factor erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2), Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein and gene expressions, as well as, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), NAD(P)H-Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and miR-122 gene expressions are down-regulated in the livers of intoxicated animals. All these parameters show significant improvement in R/APAP intoxicated animals. Curcumin pretreatment develops an amelioration of these effects in APAP-overdose, R-exposure, or R/APAP treatments. In conclusion, oral administration of curcumin shows hepatoprotective effects against APAP-overdose induced hepatic damage in normal and gamma-irradiated rats through prospective regulation of the therapeutic targets CYP2E1, Nrf2, and NF-ÃŽÂºB, via organizing the miR-122 and miR-802 gene expression.","Eassawy, Salem, Ismail","https://doi.org/10.1002/tox.23077","20201222","acetaminophen; curcumin; gammaÃ¢â‚¬Âirradiation; microÃ¢â‚¬ÂRNA; nuclear factor erythroidÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated factorÃ¢â‚¬Â2 (Nrf2); nuclear factorÃ¢â‚¬Âkappa B (NFÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃŽÂºB)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8504,""

"Face Tuning in Depression","The latest COVID-19 pandemic reveals that unexpected changes elevate depression bringing people apart, but also calling for social sharing. Yet the impact of depression on social cognition and functioning is not well understood. Assessment of social cognition is crucial not only for a better understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD), but also for screening, intervention, and remediation. Here by applying a novel experimental tool, a Face-n-Food task comprising a set of images bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we assessed the face tuning in patients with MDD and person-by-person matched controls. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Contrary to common beliefs, the outcome indicates that individuals with depression express intact face responsiveness. Yet, while in depression face sensitivity is tied with perceptual organization, in typical development, it is knotted with social cognition capabilities. Face tuning in depression, therefore, may rely upon altered behavioral strategies and underwriting brain mechanisms. To exclude a possible camouflaging effect of female social skills, we examined gender impact. Neither in depression nor in typical individuals had females excelled in face tuning. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face sensitivity and alterations in social functioning in depression and mental well-being at large. Aberrant social functioning in depression is likely to be the result of deeply-rooted maladaptive strategies rather than of poor sensitivity to social signals. This has implications for mental well-being under the current pandemic conditions.","Kubon, Sokolov, Popp, Fallgatter, Pavlova","https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa375","20201222","depression; face pareidolia; face tuning; gender impact; non-face face-like images; social cognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8506,""
"Mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine in Italy against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","This research aimed at investigating the psychological impact of national quarantine in Italy, and the psychosocial factors that are may influence this impact. A convenience sample of 1569 people living in Italy responded to an online survey using virtual snowball sampling. The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, likelihood of infection, coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak. Gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women. The scores on well-being were significantly lower in the current study than in a previous validation study. The results of the study provided both theory and practical implications in understanding mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine.","Prati","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2020.1861253","20201222","COVID-19; cross-sectional survey; lockdown; mental health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8507,""
"Resident physicians' mental health during COVID-19: Advocating for supports during and post pandemic","There is already considerable evidence of how this novel corona virus (COVID-19) has had a major impact on our mental health and wellbeing. We are reminded of the mental health consequences of previous infectious disease outbreaks, not only for the public, but for frontline healthcare workers. Yet the lived experiences of resident physicians are missing from this discussion despite them being essential to the COVID-19 response and continuing to provide care during this time. The author asserts that considering what is known about the mental health effects of frontline healthcare work during previous outbreaks, residents are at risk given their role as physicians. In addition to baseline systemic stressors that put residents at risk of mental distress, they also face COVID-19 related stressors that exacerbate the risk given their role as trainees too. The author acknowledges and welcomes several rapid responses to residents' developing mental health needs from medical leaders across Canadian hospitals, programs, and resident bodies. Ultimately, however, medical leaders need to advocate for and implement changes that will support residents' mental health now and in the long-term well after COVID-19 has left its mark.

"Impact of simulation-based teamwork training on COVID-19 distress in healthcare professionals","Non-technical skills such as leadership, communication, or situation awareness should lead to effective teamwork in a crisis. This study aimed to analyse the role of these skills in the emotional response of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, 48 doctors and 48 nurses participated in a simulation-based teamwork training program based on teaching non-technical skills through simulation. In May 2020, this group of professionals from a COVID-19 referral hospital was invited to participate in a survey exploring stress, anxiety, and depression, using the PSS-14 (Perceived Stress Scale) and the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) measures. A control group that did not receive the training was included. We conducted a logistic regression to assess whether having attended a simulation-based teamwork training program modified the probability of presenting psychological distress (PSS-14Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18 or HADS&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12). A total of 141 healthcare professionals were included, 77 in the intervention group and 64 in the control group. Based on the PSS-14, 70.1% of the intervention group and 75% of the control group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.342) had symptoms of stress. Having contact with COVID-19 patients [OR 4.16(1.64-10.52)]; having minors in charge [OR 2.75 (1.15-6.53)]; working as a doctor [0.39(0.16-0.95)], and being a woman [OR 2.94(1.09-7.91)] were related with PSS14 symptoms. Based on the HADS, 54.6% of the intervention group and 42.2% of the control group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.346) had symptoms of anxiety or depression. Having contact with COVID-19 patients [OR 2.17(1.05-4.48)] and having minors in charge [OR 2.14(1.06-4.32)] were related to HADS symptoms. Healthcare professionals who attended COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of anxiety and depression [OR 2.56(1.03-6.36) (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.043)].

"Pandemic Grief Scale: A screening tool for dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 loss","Millions of people are grieving the loss of someone who died of COVID-19. However, there have been no screening tools developed to identify individuals who may be suffering from dysfunctional grief during the pandemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. This 5-item scale, which was based on 831 adults who lost someone to COVID-19, demonstrated solid reliability (ÃŽÂ±s = 0.86), factorial validity (PCA and CFA support), and construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. The PGS measures COVID-19 grief equivalently across demographic groups, and discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 7 (87% sensitivity and 71% specificity). An alarming 66% of the sample scored in the clinical range. The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining 18% additional variance in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These results support the PGS as an efficient and valid screening tool for clinical research and practice during a pandemic.","Lee, Neimeyer","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2020.1853885","20201222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8511,""

A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study. Two well-established test-tools were applied: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The study revealed that the levels of stress and anxiety experienced by the surveyed patients were moderate to high. We demonstrated that women with mental treatment history, those in the first trimester of pregnancy and the ones that are single or in an informal relationship tend to experience higher levels of psychological distress and anxiety. Such factors as age, education, parity, eventful obstetric history, comorbidities, and the number of hospital stays proved to be statistically insignificant in the analysis. Our findings could be used to identify patients at greater risk of experiencing adverse mental effects and to provide them with adequate psychological support. Further multi-center studies are warranted in order to draw final conclusions.","Stepowicz, Wencka, BieÃ…â€žkiewicz, Horzelski, Grzesiak","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249450","20201222","COVID-19; anxiety; distress; mental health; post-partum; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8512,""
"Factors Influencing Patients' Initial Decisions Regarding Telepsychiatry Participation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Telephone-Based Survey","Telepsychiatry enables patients to establish or maintain psychiatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the factors influencing patients' initial decisions to participate in telepsychiatry in the midst of a public health crisis. This paper seeks to examine factors influencing patients' initial decisions to accept or decline telepsychiatry immediately after the stay-at-home order in Michigan, their initial choice of virtual care modality (video or telephone), and their anticipated participation in telepsychiatry once clinics reopen for in-person visits. Between June and August 2020, we conducted a telephone-based survey using a questionnaire comprising 14 quantitative and two qualitative items as part of a quality improvement initiative. We targeted patients who had an in-person appointment date that fell in the first few weeks following the Michigan governor's stay-at-home order, necessitating conversion to virtual visits or deferment of in-person care. We used descriptive statistics to report individual survey responses and assess the association between chosen visit type and patient characteristics and future participation in telepsychiatry using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 244 patients whose original in-person appointments were scheduled within the first 3 weeks of the stay-at-home order in Michigan completed the telephone survey. The majority of the 244 respondents (n=202, 82.8%) initially chose to receive psychiatric care through video visits, while 13.5% (n=33) chose telephone visits and 1.2% (n=3) decided to postpone care until in-person visit availability. Patient age correlated with chosen visit type (P&lt;.001; 95% CI 0.02-0.06). Patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥44 years were more likely than patients aged 0-44 years to opt for telephone visits (relative risk reduction [RRR] 1.2; 95% CI 1.06-1.35). Patient sex (P=.99), race (P=.06), type of insurance (P=.08), and number of previous visits to the clinic (P=.63) were not statistically relevant. Approximately half of the respondents (114/244, 46.7%) stated they were likely to continue with telepsychiatry even after in-person visits were made available. Telephone visit users were less likely than video visit users to anticipate future participation in telepsychiatry (RRR 1.08; 95% CI 0.97-1.2). Overall, virtual visits met or exceeded expectations for the majority of users. In this cohort, patient age correlates with the choice of virtual visit type, with older adults more likely to choose telephone visits over video visits. Understanding challenges to patient-facing technologies can help advance health equity and guide best practices for engaging patients and families through telehealth.","Severe, Tang, Horbatch, Onishchenko, Naini, Blazek","https://doi.org/10.2196/25469","20201222","COVID-19; United States; decision making; mental health; telehealth; telephone visit; telepsychiatry; video visit; virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8513,""
"Patient Attitudes Toward Telepsychiatry During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide, Multisite Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated movement restrictions forced a rapid and massive transition to telepsychiatry to successfully maintain care continuity. The aim of this study is to examine a large number of patients' experiences of, use of, and attitudes toward telepsychiatry. An anonymous 11-question survey was delivered electronically to 14,000 patients receiving telepsychiatry care at 18 participating centers across 11 US states between the months of April and June 2020, including questions about their age and length of service use, as well as experience and satisfaction with telepsychiatry on a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and report data. In total, 3070 patients with different age ranges participated. The overall experience using telepsychiatry was either excellent or good for 1189 (82.2%) participants using video and 2312 (81.5%) using telephone. In addition, 1922 (63.6%) patients either agreed or strongly agreed that remote treatment sessions (telephone or video) have been just as helpful as in-person treatment. Lack of commute (n=1406, 46.1%) and flexible scheduling/rescheduling (n=1389, 45.5%) were frequently reported advantages of telepsychiatry, whereas missing the clinic/hospital (n=936, 30.7%) and not feeling as connected to their doctor/nurse/therapist (n=752, 24.6%) were the most frequently reported challenges. After the current pandemic resolves, 1937 (64.2%) respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that they would consider using remote treatment sessions in the future. Telepsychiatry is very well perceived among a large sample of patients. After the current pandemic resolves, some patients may benefit from continued telepsychiatry, but longitudinal studies are needed to assess impact on clinical outcomes and determine whether patients' perceptions change over time.","Guinart, Marcy, Hauser, Dwyer, Kane","https://doi.org/10.2196/24761","20201222","COVID-19; attitude; mental health; patients; survey; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8514,""
"Anxiety and Sleep Disturbances Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Cross-Sectional Online Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a serious concern among the global medical community and has resulted in an unprecedented psychological impact on health care workers, who were already working under stressful conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and measure the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety levels and sleep quality among health care workers in India, as well as to determine how the unavailability of personal protective equipment affects their willingness to provide patient-related care. We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted, structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from 368 volunteer male and female health care workers in India. Study participants were identified through social networking platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. The survey evaluated the participants' degree of signs and symptoms of anxiety and sleep quality based on the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and single-item Sleep Quality Scale, respectively. Information on the availability of personal protective equipment was collected based on responses to relevant survey questions. The majority of health care workers (126/368, 34.2%) were in the age group 45-60 years, and 52.2% (192/368) were doctors. Severe anxiety (ie, GAD-7 score &gt;10) was observed among 7.3% (27/368) health care workers, whereas moderate, mild, and minimal anxiety was observed among 12.5% (46/368), 29.3% (108/368), and 50.8% (187/368) health care workers, respectively. Moreover, 31.5% (116/368) of the health care workers had poor-to-fair sleep quality (ie, scores &lt;6). Univariate analysis showed female gender and inadequate availability of personal protective equipment was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (P=.01 for both). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with age &lt;30 years (P=.04) and inadequate personal protective equipment (P&lt;.001). Multivariable analysis showed that poorer quality of sleep was associated with higher anxiety levels (P&lt;.001). The COVID-19 pandemic has potentially caused significant levels of anxiety and sleep disturbances among health care workers, particularly associated with the female gender, younger age group, and inadequate availability of personal protective equipment. These factors put health care workers at constant risk of contracting the infection themselves or transmitting it to their families. Early identification of at-risk health care workers and implementation of situation-tailored mitigation measures could help alleviate the risk of long-term, serious psychological sequelae as well as reduce current anxiety levels among health care workers.","Gupta, Sharma, Kumar, Mahajan","https://doi.org/10.2196/24206","20201222","COVID-19; GAD-7; anxiety; health care worker; mental health, personal protective equipment; occupational epidemiology; online survey; pandemic; sleep; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8515,""

"Rock â€™nâ€™ Roll but not Sex or Drugs: Music is negatively correlated to depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic via reward-related mechanisms","The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected mental health. We assessed which of many leisure activities had positive psychological effects, with particular attention to music, which has been reported anecdotally to be important. Questionnaire data from over a thousand individuals primarily from Italy, Spain, and the USA during spring 2020 show that people picked music most often as the best activity to cope with psychological distress. Hours of engagement in music and food-related activities during the pandemic were associated with decreased depression symptoms. The benefits of music were mediated by individual differences in sensitivity to reward, whereas the positive effects of food-related activities were related to emotion regulation. Our results demonstrate that music is an important means of improving well-being, and suggest that the underlying mechanism is related to reward, consistent with neuroscience findings. Our data have practical significance in pointing to effective strategies to cope with mental health issues.","Ernest Mas-Herrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EB-A98-5D4","20201222","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; music; mental health; reward; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-23","",8517,""
