"The immediate impact of lockdown measures on mental health and couples' relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic - results of a representative population survey in Germany","Lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to have negative effects on mental health and relationship quality. However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. A representative sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2503; 50.2% female; mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","Sachser, Olaru, Pfeiffer, BrÃƒÂ¤hler, Clemens, Rassenhofer, Witt, Fegert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113954","20210501","COVID-19; Corona; Mental health; Pandemic; Relationship quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13383,""
"Pregnant and hungry: Addressing food insecurity in pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States","Food insecurity is a major social determinant of health impacting more than 10% of Americans. Social determinants of health are increasingly recognized as a driving force of health inequities. It is well established that food insecurity leads to adverse health outcomes outside of pregnancy such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and mental health problems. However, little is known about the impact of food insecurity during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Food insecurity and other social determinants of health are rarely addressed as part of routine obstetric care. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has only exacerbated the crisis of food insecurity across the country, disproportionally affecting women as well as racial and ethnic minorities. Women's health providers should implement universal screening for maternal food insecurity and offer resources to women struggling to feed themselves and their families. Reducing maternal health inequities in the US includes recognizing and addressing food insecurity, along with other social determinants of health, and advocating for public policies that support and protect all women's right to healthy food during pregnancy.","Dolin, Compher, Oh, Durnwald","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100378","20210501","Sars-CoV-2; diet quality; food security; maternal nutrition; pregnancy outcomes; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13384,""
"Neurological and cognitive sequelae of Covid-19: a four month follow-up","Central and peripheral nervous system involvement during acute COVID-19 is well known. Although many patients report some subjective symptoms months after the infection, the exact incidence of neurological and cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 remains to be determined. The aim of this study is to investigate if objective neurological or cognitive impairment is detectable four months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a group of patients who had mild-moderate COVID-19. A cohort of 120 health care workers previously affected by COVID-19 was examined 4Ã‚Â months after the diagnosis by means of neurological and extensive cognitive evaluation and compared to a group of 30 health care workers who did not have COVID-19 and were similar for age and co morbidities. At 4Ã‚Â month follow-up, 118/120 COVID-19 cases had normal neurological examination, two patients had neurological deficits. COVID-19 patients did not show general cognitive impairment at MMSE. In COVID-19 cases the number of impaired neuropsychological tests was not significantly different from non COVID-19 cases (mean 1.69 and 1 respectively, Mann-Whitney pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°n.s.), as well as all the mean tests' scores. Anxiety, stress and depression scores resulted to be significantly higher in COVID-19 than in non COVID-19 cases. The results do not support the presence of neurological deficits or cognitive impairment in this selected population of mild-moderate COVID-19 patients four months after the diagnosis. Severe emotional disorders in patients who had COVID-19 in the past are confirmed.","Mattioli, Stampatori, Righetti, Sala, Tomasi, De Palma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10579-6","20210501","Cognitive impairment; Post-acute COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13385,""

"Mental wellbeing and perception of health in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study in the general population","This study was aimed at evaluating mental wellbeing and health perception in the general population during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and at highlighting the correlation between them and selected variables. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out in 374 individuals, who were remotely administered two scales (&quot;Perception of Health Scale [PHS]&quot; and &quot;Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale [WEMWBS]&quot;) and a demographic and clinical questionnaire.

A positive statistically significant correlation was found between PHS and WEMWBS (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Gender, marital status, and education levels conditioned mental well-being in a statistically significant. Suffering from a chronic disorder, COVID-19 symptoms, or having a family member affected by COVID-19 infection influenced the health perception.

"Stigmatization spreads faster than the virus Viruses do not discriminate, and neither should we&quot; Combatting the stigmatization surrounding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic","Infectious diseases are one of the most important problems of the last century. Epidemics have caused the stigmatization of managers, healthcare professionals, and those likely to be infected throughout history. Although many infectious diseases caused stigmas both in the past and today, a new name is added to the list of epidemics in various regions in the world each year and the masses become alerted. The latest disease added to the list is the new coronavirus (COVID-19). Today, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has influenced the whole world, the risk of social stigmatization reappears. In this context, it is very important to take the necessary measures to prevent stigmatization and to plan the interventions.","Ozturk","https://doi.org/10.1111/ppc.12815","20210501","COVID-19; combat; mental health; outbreak; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13388,""
"Effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults experiencing financial uncertainty: a systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a period of global economic uncertainty. Financial strain, personal debt, recent job loss and housing insecurity are important risk factors for the mental health of working-age adults. Community interventions have the potential to attenuate the mental health impact of these stressors. We examined the effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults in high-income countries during periods of financial insecurity. Eight electronic databases were systematically screened for experimental and observational studies published since 2000 measuring the effectiveness of community interventions on mental health outcomes. We included any non-clinical intervention that aimed to address the financial, employment, food or housing insecurity of participants. A review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019156364) and results are reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. From 2326 studies screened, 15 met our inclusion criteria. Five categories of community intervention were identified: advice services colocated in healthcare settings; link worker social prescribing; telephone debt advice; food insecurity interventions; and active labour market programmes. In general, the evidence for effective and cost-effective community interventions delivered to individuals experiencing financial insecurity was lacking. From the small number of studies without a high risk of bias, there was some evidence that financial insecurity and associated mental health problems were amenable to change and differences by subpopulations were observed. There is a need for well-controlled studies and trials to better understand effective ingredients and to identify those interventions warranting wider implementation.","McGrath, Duncan, Dotsikas, Baskin, Crosby, Gnani, Hunter, Kaner, Kirkbride, Lafortune, Lee, Oliver, Osborn, Walters, Dykxhoorn","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215574","20210501","inequalities; mental health; psychosocial factors; public health; systematic reviews","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13389,""
"Stress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers facing COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt: a cross-sectional online-based study","This study assessed perceived stress, anxiety and depression among healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt. This was an online study where a Google form was prepared including sociodemographic and occupational data as well as three validated questionnaires to assess perceived stress, anxiety and depression, respectively. The form was distributed online to all social media groups including healthcare workers all across the country, and responses were collected until the sample size of 262. Healthcare workers (physicians, dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, nurses, technicians and administrators) working in governmental or educational hospitals from all Egyptian governorates who are members of social media groups. The mean age of participants was 33.4Ã‚Â±5.9 years, 70% were women, about 70% were married and 66% were physicians. The frequency of perceived stress, anxiety and depression observed among the study participants according to the results of their questionnaires. Then the frequencies were compared between different sociodemographic characteristics. Only 1.3% showed low perceived stress while 98.5% showed moderate to severe stress. About 9.5% did not experience generalised anxiety, while the remaining 90.5% had different degrees of anxiety as mild anxiety showed the highest per cent affecting about 40% of participants followed by moderate anxiety about 32% then severe anxiety, 18.5%. With regard to depression, 94% of participants showed mild to severe depression.

"Perceived stress in the time of COVID-19: the association with brooding and COVID-related rumination in adults with and without migraine","The main goal of this research was to explore whether migraineurs had a higher level of perceived stress than healthy controls during the times of the coronavirus and related restrictive measures, and to examine the relationship between different subtypes of rumination and perceived stress in these groups. We measured two facets of depressive rumination, brooding and reflection, along with rumination about the current COVID-19 situation to see whether these different subtypes of rumination explained perceived stress among migraineurs and healthy controls. Healthy adults (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°64) and migraine patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73) filled out self-report questionnaires online. A multiple linear regression model was used to test whether depressive rumination (i.e. brooding and reflection) and COVID-related rumination explained perceived stress among adults with and without migraine during the times of COVID-19, after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. Although we did not find any difference in the level of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group, perceived stress was more strongly associated with brooding as well as COVID-related rumination among migraineurs than healthy controls. COVID-related rumination and brooding (but not reflection) explained the level of perceived stress after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. The similar degree of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group may imply that there is great variation in the personal experience of people regarding the pandemic, that may be determined by numerous other factors. Our results demonstrate that ruminating about the pandemic and related difficulties, as well as brooding (but not reflection) appear to be associated with higher level of perceived stress during the times of the coronavirus. This association was slightly stronger among migraineurs, hinting at the increased vulnerability of this patient group in stressful situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results also suggest that ruminating about the pandemic and its consequences is weakly associated with trait-level depressive rumination, thus may be more contingent on specific factors.","KovÃƒÂ¡cs, Baksa, Dobos, EszlÃƒÂ¡ri, Gecse, Kocsel, JuhÃƒÂ¡sz, KÃƒÂ¶kÃƒÂ¶nyei","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00549-y","20210501","Brooding; COVID-19; COVID-related rumination; Depressive rumination; Migraine; Perceived stress; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13391,""
"Prevalence and associated factors of psychosocial distress among seafarers during COVID-19 pandemic","In the context of growing concerns about seafarers' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of psychosocial distress among seafarers of ocean-going vessels during the current health emergency. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 470 multinational seafarers working on two oil tanker international shipping companies. Psychosocial distress was assessed by using Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21). General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assessed genral psychiatry disorders and self-rate anxiety. Perceived health status was assessed by a single-item question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between demographic and work-related variables with mental health outcomes. Overall, 439 out of 470 invited seafarers with a mean age of 34.5 (SD: 8.05) participated in this study (participation rate: 93.4%). The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of depression, anxiety, stress, self-rated anxiety, general psychiatric disorders, and poor perceived health status was 12.3% (9.4-15.7), 11.6% (8.7-15.0), 5.9% (3.9-8.5), 2.1% (0.9-3.8), 42.6% (38.0-47.4), and 4.3% (2.6-6.6), respectively. In the multivariate model, by increasing the duration of stay (per month) on board, the odds of depression increased by 20% (OR: 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02-1.40)). Also, non-officer seafarers experienced significantly lower psychosocial distress such as anxiety and stress levels than officers. High prevalence of depression, anxiety, and general psychiatric disorders among seafarers during COVID-19 was observed. Our findings also highlight the factors that need to be considered to protect seafarers' mental well-being. Further studies to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health issues at sea are recommended.","Baygi, Mohammadian Khonsari, Agoushi, Hassani Gelsefid, Mahdavi Gorabi, Qorbani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03197-z","20210501","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychosocial distress; Seafarers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13392,""
"Can we change depressive beliefs? Modulation of belief updating by ketamine in treatment resistant depression","Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a tremendous health problem that has encouraged novel treatment strategies involving sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions. While ketamine induces rapid and sustained clinical improvement, its cognitive effects are less well known. Here we tested if ketamine alters the negative expectancies about the future that are insensitive to disconfirming information, and play a key role for the maintenance of depression. Twenty-six TRD patients performed a belief-updating task before and after ketamine treatment, and were compared to a group of thirty healthy controls. The task involved estimating likelihoods of experiencing adverse life events before and after receiving information about the actual occurrence of events in the general public. A computational reinforcement-learning (RL) model tested how much belief updating was explained by learning from positive (better than thought) and negative (worser than thought) estimation errors. Global clinical improvement was assessed by the Montgomery Asberg Depression scale (MADRS). Following a single ketamine infusion patients updated their beliefs about the future more after favorable, and less after unfavorable information, controlled for sequential testing effects by comparison to healthy controls. The emergence of optimism biases in belief updating was underpinned by asymmetric learning from positive rather than negative estimation errors, and formally mediated precocious clinical responsiveness at one week of treatment observed in 19% of the patients. These findings provide novel insight into the cognitive mechanisms of ketamine action in TRD, and through it open the window toward promising perspectives for augmented psychotherapy in mood disorder.","HUGO BOTTEMANNE et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605F-884-0FC","20210502","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; treatment resistant depression; expectancy; ketamine; mood disorders; belief updating","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13393,""
"Education, Financial Stress, and Trajectory of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Socioeconomic disparities in mental health have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have examined the mechanisms through which such disparities in mental health occurred. This pre-registered study aimed to examine socioeconomic disparities, as indexed by education levels, in the trajectory of mental health at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether financial stress associated with the pandemic mediated socioeconomic disparities in mental health. Data were drawn from the Love in the Time of COVID project, of which we included four waves of data (N = 2,204) collected between March 27th and June 21st, 2020. Education was assessed at baseline, and mental health outcomes (i.e., eudaimonic well-being, positive affect, negative affect, depressive and anxious symptoms) and financial stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed at each wave. Results indicated that there were educational disparities in eudaimonic well-being, negative affect, and depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline, with those with lower education levels reporting poorer mental health. However, education did not amplify disparities in mental health outcomes over time, showing no associations with the rates of change in mental health outcomes. Financial stress mediated the associations between education and eudaimonic well-being, negative affect, and depressive and anxious symptoms at baseline, and there were no temporal variations in the mediation effects of financial stress. These results highlight persistent educational disparities in mental health at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and such educational disparities may be partially explained by financial stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yanping Jiang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46217-DDD-93E","20210501","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-02","",13394,""
