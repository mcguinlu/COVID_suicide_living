"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on foot surgeries","Musculoskeletal dysfunction due to deformities and injuries of the foot is a common orthopedic problem. To analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on both elective and emergency foot surgeries. This study analyzed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective and emergency foot surgeries. The comparison included data collected in 2019 (March 15-October 15, when the epidemic did not influence the Polish healthcare system or patient demographics) and in a corresponding period in 2020. This study was conducted in the trauma and orthopedic surgery wards and the emergency departments of 2 regional Polish hospitals. The analysis of the data from the orthopedic wards showed a reduction in the total number of admissions in 2020 by 55%. The number of elective and emergency interventions was differently related to the pandemic, with elective interventions declining by 72% and emergency interventions increasing by 27% in 2020 compared to 2019. The total number of elective foot surgeries in children decreased by 59% in 2020. The mean duration of hospital stay was approx. 2.5 days shorter in adults and 1.7 days shorter in children during the 2nd evaluation period. The emergency department data showed a decline of 32% in the number of patients presenting with injuries during the pandemic. Nonetheless, the pandemic did not affect the mean age of patients and the female-to-male ratio. The global COVID-19 pandemic affected the epidemiology of foot injuries as well as the prevalence of foot surgeries in children and adults.","KuliÃ…â€žski, Tomczyk, Morasiewicz","https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/140610","20211005","COVID-19; epidemiology; foot surgery; lockdown; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18593,""
"Met and unmet need for mental health care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is a concern that the COVID-19 pandemic will generate large unmet needs for mental health care. Using data from an epidemiological psychiatric diagnostic interview survey (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,159) conducted on a probability sample from the general population, the proportions of met and unmet need for mental health care among individuals with and without mental disorders were compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Depression, anxiety, and daily activity among adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a two-group cross-sectional study","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has resulted in significant changes to adolescents' daily lives and, potentially, to their mental health. The pandemic has also disproportionately affected historically marginalized and at-risk communities, including people of color, socioeconomically disadvantaged people, people identifying as female, and youth. This study aimed to understand differences in depression and anxiety among two groups of US adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine demographic and daily activity variables associated with depression and anxiety. Online surveys were distributed in 2019 and 2020. Analyses of covariance compared depression and anxiety between pre-pandemic and pandemic groups. Demographic and lifestyle variables were included as covariates. Within the pandemic group, 94% of adolescents reported being out of school due to the pandemic, and another 86% and 57% were prevented from extracurricular activities or exercise, respectively. The pandemic group trended towards higher depression, with least squares adjusted means 7.62 Ã‚Â±1.36, compared to 6.28 Ã‚Â±1.42 (P=.08) in the pre-pandemic group. There was no significant difference in anxiety scores between pandemic and pre-pandemic groups, with least squares adjusted means 5.52 Ã‚Â±1.30 vs. 5.01 Ã‚Â±1.36 (P=.48). Within the pandemic group, lower socioeconomic status was predictive of anxiety, such that those in the pandemic group of lower SES were more anxious than their higher SES peers, with least squares adjusted means 11.17 Ã‚Â±2.34 vs. 8.66 Ã‚Â±2.16 (P=.02). Within the pandemic group, being out of work, school, extracurricular activities, or exercise due to the pandemic was not associated with higher depression or anxiety scores. In the present study, neither being in the pandemic group, nor experiencing changes in daily activity due to the pandemic, were associated with higher depression or anxiety. However, we found that adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds experienced significantly more anxiety during the pandemic than their more privileged peers. Both instrumental and mental health interventions for less privileged adolescents are imperative.","Jolliff, Zhao, Eickhoff, Moreno","https://doi.org/10.2196/30702","20211005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18595,""
"Exploring Factors Enhancing Resilience Among Marginalized Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Marginalized older adults are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to social isolation and physical and functional limitations. Despite these stressors, they appear to be resilient by leveraging individual, community, and societal resources. This study conducted in-depth interviews with marginalized older adults to understand how COVID-19 affected their mobility and daily lives. We also identified different levels of protective factors affecting their resiliency to pandemic stressors. COVID-19 influenced not only the physical health but also the mental health of older adults. However, they overcame adversity by using technology to continue daily activities, exchanging informal support with family and neighbors, relying on formal support from community organizations, and keeping themselves physically active in their neighborhoods. Our findings suggest a holistic approach to enhance the resilience of older adults during an unprecedented event.","Lee, Hyun, Mitchell, Saha, Oran Gibson, Krejci","https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648211048749","20211005","COVID-19; coping behavior; mental health; physical activity; protective factors; qualitative methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18596,""
"Longitudinal Impact of Childhood Adversity on Early Adolescent Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the ABCD StudyÃ‚Â® Cohort: Does Race or Ethnicity Moderate Findings?","During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, mental health among youth has been negatively impacted. Youth with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), as well as youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds, may be especially vulnerable to experiencing COVID-19-related distress. The current aims are to examine whether exposure to pre-pandemic ACEs predicts mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in youth and whether racial-ethnic background moderated these effects. From May to August 2020, 7,983 youth (M<sub>age</sub>= 12.5, range= 10.6-14.6 years old) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study<sup>SM</sup> (ABCD StudyÃ‚Â®) completed at least one of three online surveys measuring the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. Data was evaluated in relation to youth's pre-pandemic mental health and ACEs. Pre-pandemic ACE history significantly predicted poorer mental health (across all outcomes) and greater COVID-19-related stress and impact of fears on well-being. Youth reported improved mental health during the pandemic (from May to August 2020). While reporting similar levels of mental health, youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds had elevated COVID-19-related worry, stress, and impact on well-being. Race and ethnicity generally did not moderate ACE effects. Older youth, girls, and those with greater pre-pandemic internalizing symptoms also reported greater mental health symptoms. Youth who experienced greater childhood adversity reported greater negative affect and COVID-19-related distress during the pandemic. Although they reported generally better mood, Black, Asian American, and multiracial youth reported greater COVID-19-related worry and experienced COVID-19 related discrimination compared to non-Hispanic White youth, highlighting potential health disparities.","Stinson, Sullivan, Peteet, Tapert, Baker, Breslin, Dick, Gonzalez, Guillaume, Marshall, McCabe, Pelham, Van Rinsveld, Sheth, Sowell, Wade, Wallace, Lisdahl","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.08.007","20211005","COVID-19; adolescence; adverse childhood experiences; health disparities; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18597,""
"COVID-19 mitigation policies and psychological distress in young adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unusually high proportion of the population suffering from mental health difficulties, but of particular concern is the disproportionate increase in psychological distress among younger adults. In this article, we exploit an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to examine which aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic 18-25-year-olds found most challenging. We report analyses of <i>American Voices Project</i> (AVP) qualitative in-depth interview data, a <i>MyVoice</i> text-message open-ended survey, and Census Bureau <i>Household Pulse Survey</i> (HPS) data, all collected in 2020. Our interview and text-message results show that young adults were distressed about the effects of COVID-19 on the health of loved ones and older Americans. Young adults expressed concerns that the pandemic was not being treated sufficiently seriously by some politicians and the general public. The policy response was seen to be inadequate to the task of containing the disease, and some feared that the pandemic would never end. Statistical analyses of the HPS confirm that young adults' scores on the HPS's anxiety scale were significantly negatively associated with state-level policy responses. Overall, our results show that young adults found virus mitigation strategies challenging, but that a strong policy response was associated with reduced levels of psychological distress. Our results suggest that public health policy might have also operated as mental health policy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jackson, Lee Williams","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2021.100027","20211005","COVID-19; Policy response; Psychological distress; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18598,""
"The experiences of socially vulnerable groups in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid health needs assessment","This rapid health needs assessment was undertaken to urgently identify the needs of socially vulnerable groups arising during the first wave of cases of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. The objective was to develop recommendations for policy makers and stakeholders to mitigate adverse impacts on socially vulnerable groups throughout the COVID-19 response and recovery period. Rapid health needs assessment. The needs assessment employed qualitative methods to systematically collect data about the knowledge and views of key informants through semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Participants were either topic experts providing services to socially vulnerable groups who routinely face barriers to healthcare access or experts by experience. Participants included people experiencing homelessness, sex workers, people from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities and people facing challenges due to their immigration status. Data was collected over a week period in April/May 2020 and followed by thematic analysis to examine interview transcripts. Forty-two participants were included in the study, half of whom were experts by experience. Challenges with accessing and following COVID-19 information and government guidance were described as affecting all groups, due to exclusion from digital technology, translated resources, tailored support and adequate housing. Altered delivery of healthcare services, such as the closure of outreach and drop-in services, remote consultations, and online patient registration, were noted by interviewees as worsening existing barriers to accessing healthcare. Being charged for NHS care remained a key fear for migrants. All groups' access to income, education and social support were reported as being impacted by service closures and job losses, putting them at higher risk of destitution. Isolation, loneliness and deteriorating mental health were frequently reported. This assessment has highlighted the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on socially vulnerable groups and demonstrated a plethora of unmet needs. As the effects of COVID-19 continue, it is imperative that the needs of these groups are urgently and explicitly addressed and prioritised. This is essential to promote engagement with test and trace services, enable isolation adherence, and achieve high vaccine uptake in socially vulnerable populations.","Stevens, Ray, Thirunavukarasu, Johnson, Jones, Miller, Elston","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100192","20211005","COVID-19; digital exclusion; health inequalities; needs assessment; socially vulnerable","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18599,""
"Willingness of children and adolescents to have a COVID-19 vaccination: Results of a large whole schools survey in England","Vaccine hesitancy has affected COVID-19 adult vaccination programs in many countries. Data on hesitancy amongst child and adolescent populations is largely confined to parent opinion. We investigated the characteristics of vaccine hesitant children and adolescents using results from a large, school-based self-report survey of the willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccination in students aged 9 -18 years in England. Data from the OxWell Student Survey on mental health, life experiences and behaviours were used, collected from four counties across England. Local authority partners recruited schools. The vaccine hesitancy question gave six response options and were clustered to inform delivery: eager and willing were categorised as vaccination 'opt-in', don't know and not bothered categorised as 'undecided', and unwilling and anti-vaccination categorised as 'opt-out'. We conducted a multinomial regression to determine associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic, health behaviour and social connection variables. 27,910 students from 180 schools answered the vaccine hesitancy question between 14th May and 21st July 2021, of whom 13984 (50.1%) would opt-in to take a vaccination, 10322 (37.0%) were undecided, and 3604 (12.9%) would opt-out. A lower percentage of younger students reported that they would opt-in to vaccination, for example, 35.7% of 9-year-olds and 51.3% of 13-year-olds compared to 77.8% of 17-year-olds would opt-in to take a vaccination. Students who were 'opt-out' or 'undecided' (a combined 'vaccine hesitant' group) were more likely to come from deprived socioeconomic contexts with higher rates of home rental versus home ownership and their school locations were more likely to be in areas of greater deprivation. They were more likely to smoke or vape, spend longer on social media, feel that they did not belong in their school community but had lower levels of anxiety and depression. The vaccine hesitant students- the undecided and opt-out groups- were similar in profile, although the opt-out students had higher reported confirmed or probable previous COVID-19 infection than the opt-in group, whereas those undecided, did not. If government vaccination strategies move towards vaccinating younger school-aged students, efforts to increase vaccination uptake may be necessary. Compared with students who would opt-in, those who were vaccine hesitant had greater indicators of social deprivation and felt a lack of community cohesion by not feeling a sense of belonging at their school. There were indications that those students who would opt-out had higher levels of marginalisation and mistrust. If programmes are rolled out, focus on hesitant younger students will be important, targeting more marginalised and deprived young people with information from trusted sources utilising social media; improving access to vaccination centres with provision both in and outside school; and addressing fears and worries about the effects of the vaccine. The main limitation of this study is that the participant group may not be wholly representative of England or the UK, which may bias population-level estimates of willingness to be vaccinated.

"Prevalence and factors associated with food insecurity in Latin America and the Caribbean during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","We assessed the prevalence of food insecurity (FI) and its associated factors in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) early during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed secondary data analysis of a survey conducted by Facebook and the University of Maryland. We included adults surveyed from April to May 2020. FI was measured by concerns about having enough to eat during the following week. Sociodemographic, mental health, and COVID-19-related variables were collected. We performed generalized Poisson regressions models considering the complex sampling design. We estimated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95% confidence intervals. We included 1,324,272 adults; 50.5% were female, 42.9% were under 35 years old, 78.9% lived in a city, and 18.6% had COVID-19 symptoms. The prevalence of food insecurity in LAC was 75.7% (n=1,016,841), with Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Haiti with 90.8%, 86.7%, and 85.5%, respectively, showing the highest prevalence. Gender, area of residence, presence of COVID-19 symptoms, and fear of getting seriously ill or that a family member gets seriously ill from COVID-19 were associated with a higher prevalence of food insecurity. In contrast, increasing age was associated with a lower prevalence. The prevalence of food insecurity during the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in LAC was high and was associated with sociodemographic and COVID-19-related variables.","Benites-Zapata, Urrunaga-Pastor, SolÃƒÂ³rzano-Vargas, Herrera-AÃƒÂ±azco, Uyen-Cateriano, Bendezu-Quispe, Toro-Huamanchumo, Hernandez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08091","20211005","COVID-19; Food Insecurity; Latin America; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18601,""
"Internet use during COVID-19 lockdown among young people in low- and middle-income countries: Role of psychological wellbeing","Problematic internet use in adolescents has been shown to significantly increase over the past few years, with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns reinforcing this phenomena globally. We sought to explore whether problematic internet use in specific countries was related to emotional well-being and importantly whether this is predicted by psychological distress. There is a growing number of studies showing that problematic internet use is increasingly prevalent in countries with emerging economies, however we have yet to find out to what extent other factors are influencing this behaviour in adolescents and young people. This study invited young people from countries such India, Mexico, Philippines and Turkey to complete a set of self-reports on their daily internet habits, social media use, alongside questions on psychological distress, self-esteem, loneliness and escapism. A total of 1182 young people aged between 16 and 25Ã‚Â years old completed these questionnaires online. The results showed that there were significant difference in problematic internet use scores among adolescents in the Philippines and Turkey. More specifically, social media use was significantly higher amongst young people from the Philippines whereas gaming addiction was significantly high in the Turkish sample. These findings also revealed that psychological distress, loneliness, and low self-esteem consistently predicted problematic internet use. Taken together these results emphasise that there are several factors underlying growing figures of problematic internet use in young people, these factors include emotional distress, need for escapism, loneliness, and social media use, however, going forward more nuanced cultural differences should also be considered.","Fernandes, Uzun, Aydin, Tan-Mansukhani, Vallejo, SaldaÃƒÂ±a-Gutierrez, Nanda Biswas, Essau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100379","20211005","Adolescents; Covid-19; Depression; Gaming addiction; Internet use; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18602,""
"Mental health trajectories of individuals and families following the COVID-19 pandemic: Study protocol of a longitudinal investigation and prevention program","Many adults, adolescents and children are suffering from persistent stress symptoms in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to characterize long-term trajectories of mental health and to reduce the transition to manifest mental disorders by means of a stepped care program for indicated prevention. Using a prospective-longitudinal design, we will assess the mental strain of the pandemic using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and Spence Child Anxiety Scale. Hair samples will be collected to assess cortisol as a biological stress marker of the previous months. Additionally, we will implement a stepped-care program with online- and face-to-face-interventions for adults, adolescents, and children. After that we will assess long-term trajectories of mental health at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. The primary outcome will be psychological distress (depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms). Data will be analyzed with general linear model and machine learning. This study will contribute to the understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. The evaluation of the stepped-care program and longitudinal investigation will inform clinicians and mental health stakeholders on populations at risk, disease trajectories and the sufficiency of indicated prevention to ameliorate the mental strain of the pandemic.

"Cutting Edge: Lung-Resident T Cells Elicited by SARS-CoV-2 Do Not Mediate Protection Against Secondary Infection","Immunity to pulmonary infection typically requires elicitation of lung-resident T cells that subsequently confer protection against secondary infection. The presence of tissue-resident T cells in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent patients is unknown. Using a sublethal mouse model of coronavirus disease 2019, we determined if SARS-CoV-2 infection potentiated Ag-specific pulmonary resident CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and if these cells mediated protection against secondary infection. S protein-specific T cells were present in resident and circulating populations. However, M and N protein-specific T cells were detected only in the resident T cell pool. Using an adoptive transfer strategy, we found that T cells from SARS-CoV-2 immune animals did not protect naive mice. These data indicate that resident T cells are elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection but are not sufficient for protective immunity.","Roberts, Jessop, Wehrly, Bosio","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100608","20211005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18605,""
"Protecting the healthcare workforce during COVID-19: a qualitative needs assessment of employee occupational health in the US national Veterans Health Administration","Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) employee occupational health (EOH) providers were tasked with assuming a central role in coordinating employee COVID-19 screening and clearance for duty, representing entirely novel EOH responsibilities. In a rapid qualitative needs assessment, we aimed to identify learnings from the field to support the vastly expanding role of EOH providers in a national healthcare system. We employed rapid qualitative analysis of key informant interviews in a maximal variation sample on the parameters of job type, rural versus urban and provider gender. We interviewed 21 VHA EOH providers between July and December 2020. This sample represents 15 facilities from diverse regions of the USA (large, medium and small facilities in the Mid-Atlantic; medium sites in the South; large facilities in the West and Pacific Northwest). Five interdependent needs included: (1) infrastructure to support employee population management, including tools that facilitate infection control measures such as contact tracing (eg, employee-facing electronic health records and coordinated databases); (2) mechanisms for information sharing across settings (eg, VHA listserv), especially for changing policy and protocols; (3) sufficiently resourced staffing using detailing to align EOH needs with human resource capital; (4) connected and resourced local and national leaders; and (5) strategies to support healthcare worker mental health.Our identified facilitators for EOH assuming new challenging and dynamically changing roles during COVID-19 included: (A) training or access to expertise; (B) existing mechanisms for information sharing; (C) flexible and responsive staffing; and (D) leveraging other institutional expertise not previously affiliated with EOH (eg, chaplains to support bereavement). Our needs assessment highlights local and system level barriers and facilitators of EOH assuming expanded roles during COVID-19. Integrating changes both within and across systems and with alignment of human capital will enable EOH preparedness for future challenges.","Brown-Johnson, McCaa, Giannitrapani, Singer, Lorenz, Yano, Thanassi, DeShields, Giannitrapani","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049134","20211005","COVID-19; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-06","",18606,""
"COVID-19: A literature review of the impact on diagnostic radiography students","COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral disease declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Throughout the pandemic, radiography students have been working in hospitals on the frontline. The review aimed to search for evidence of the impact COVID-19 has had on diagnostic radiography students and consider whether additional support and learning needs to be implemented. A literature search strategy applied keywords, BOOLEAN search operators, and eligibility criteria on PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. Cormack's (2000) critique framework was chosen to methodologically appraise the mixed-method studies to evaluate the quality, validity and rigour. The search decisions were displayed in a PRISMA flowchart to evidence the process to identify the found articles comprised of two surveys, two semi-structured interviews and one case study. The findings identified common and reoccurring themes of personal protective equipment, mental wellbeing, accommodation and travel, assessments and learning, and transitioning to registration. The literature suggests that students felt positive impacts of the pandemic, such as being prepared for registration. However, negative effects included the fear of contracting the virus, anxieties of working with ill patients, impracticalities of accommodation and travel during clinical placement, and the adaption to online learning. Clinical staff and universities need to work together to ensure students are mentally and physically supported during the pandemic. Regular meetings and agreed channels of communication with students will allow any issues to be brought to attention and addressed.

Internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) tailored by psychologists' initial assessments to meet patients' specific needs have shown promising effects. However, few studies have evaluated patient involvement in decisions during iCBT. Aim This study aimed to explore the effect of patient-driven iCBT compared to standard iCBT on perceived control over treatment, adherence, and level of anxiety symptoms. A secondary aim was to assess the relationship between changes in empowerment and changes in anxiety symptoms. Method Participants were patients recruited form primary care and assessed as meeting the criterion for an anxiety disorder. Participants were randomized to patient-driven iCBT (n = 27) or standard iCBT (n = 28). Patient-driven iCBT was adapted to participants' preferences regarding for example focus of treatment program and order of modules. Participants randomized to the control condition received the standard iCBT program for anxiety disorders at the participating unit. The outcome measures were patients' perceived control over treatment, adherence to treatment, symptoms of anxiety, depression and general disability as well as the experience of empowerment. Results Participants in patient-driven iCBT had statistically higher perceived control over treatment (t(43) = 2.13, p = .04). Symptoms were significantly reduced in both arms with regards to anxiety, depression, and general disability. A significant time per condition interaction effect for anxiety symptoms was observed (df = 45.0; F = 3.055; p = .038), where the patient-driven condition had a significantly larger reduction in anxiety. For both groups a significant correlation of r = -0.47 was found between changes in empowerment and changes in anxiety. Conclusion Results indicate that iCBT that is patient-driven, may have a greater effect on anxiety, than standard iCBT. The effect on perceived control over treatment might also be larger in patient-driven treatments than in standard iCBT. Internet-based therapies inherently promote as active agents of their own care and might be well suited for promoting perceived control and empowerment. Findings need to be replicated given the small sample size and the explorative nature of the study.
