"Working from home and productivity under the COVID-19 pandemic: Using survey data of four manufacturing firms","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the world economy in various ways. In particular, the drastic shift to telework has dramatically changed how people work. Whether the new style of working from home (WFH) will remain in our society highly depends on its effects on workers' productivity. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of WFH on productivity are still unclear. By leveraging unique surveys conducted at four manufacturing firms in Japan, we assess within-company productivity differences between those who work from home and those who do not, along with identifying possible factors of productivity changes due to WFH. Our main findings are as follows. First, after ruling out the time-invariant component of individual productivity and separate trends specific to employee attributes, we find that workers who worked from home experienced productivity declines more than those who did not. Second, our analysis shows that poor WFH setups and communication difficulties are the major reasons for productivity losses. Third, we find that the mental health of workers who work from home is better than that of workers who are unable to work from home. Our result suggests that if appropriate investments in upgrading WFH setups and facilitating communication can be made, WFH may improve productivity by improving employees' health and well-being.","Kitagawa, Kuroda, Okudaira, Owan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261761","20211223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24269,""
"Alone but not lonely: The relationship between COVID-19 social factors, loneliness, depression, and suicidal ideation","Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been concerns that social distancing may negatively impact mental health, particularly with regards to loneliness, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. The current study explored how aspects of social distancing, communication, and online support from October 2020 to December 2020 related to loneliness, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Participants (n = 216) who self-identified as having mental health diagnoses were recruited and completed questionnaires online. Findings showed that COVID-19 related social contact, particularly electronic social contact, is associated with decreased loneliness, suicidal ideation, and depression. Online emotional support was significantly associated with decreased loneliness and depressive symptoms. Social distancing practices were not associated with increased loneliness, suicidal ideation, and depression. Our findings underscore the importance of leveraging electronic methods of social connection, especially among individuals who are at risk for suicide or depression.","Rabasco, Corcoran, Andover","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261867","20211223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24270,""
"Junior doctors' wellbeing at peak and post-peak pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional study","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals has been significant. The aim of this study was to explore the mental state and wellbeing of UK junior doctors at different phases of the initial outbreak. This is a cross-sectional study of UK-based junior doctors' perceptions of threat and support during and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and use of coping mechanisms were explored through a Google questionnaire. One hundred and ninety-six participants were included in this study (93 in period A and 103 in period B). Junior doctors reported feeling increased risk (<i>p</i>=0.001) and increased fear of contracting the virus (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) during period A. Increased levels of severe anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score &gt;15) along with increased cases level of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score &gt;10) were reported for both periods. Junior doctors described suffering more frequently with flashbacks (<i>p</i>=0.006) and nightmares (<i>p</i>=0.024) in comparison with senior colleagues during period A. During period A, 21.4% of participants felt isolated at work (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001), whereas 13% reported being easily annoyed on a daily basis, 11.7% reported very low morale (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and 66% were not aware of any psychological support being available. The use of exercise, peer support and mindfulness apps increased during period B (<i>p</i>=0.023). Healthcare systems need to urgently establish robust psychological support mechanisms and infrastructure to protect junior doctors and provide institutional resilience against the adverse consequences of the long physical and mental battle with COVID-19.","Doulias, Thrikandiyur, Titus, Soundararasha, Coxon, Amarantidis, Arulampalam","https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0272","20211223","COVID-19 pandemic; Coping mechanisms; Junior doctors; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24271,""
"Patient and provider predictors of telemental health use prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic within the Department of Veterans Affairs","The current study examined patient and provider differences in use of phone, video, and in-person mental health (MH) services. Participants included patients who completed Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 MH appointment within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from 10/1/17-7/10/20 and providers who completed Ã¢â€°Â¥ 100 VA MH appointments from 10/1/17-7/10/20. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) are reported of patients and providers: (a) completing Ã¢â€°Â¥1 video MH appointment in the pre-COVID (10/1/17-3/10/20) and COVID (3/11/20-7/10/20) periods; and (b) completing the majority of MH visits via phone, video, or in-person during COVID. The sample included 2,480,119 patients/31,971 providers in the pre-COVID period, and 1,054,670 patients/23,712 providers in the COVID period. During the pre-COVID and COVID periods, older patients had lower odds of completing Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 video visit (a<i>ORs</i> &lt; .65). During the COVID period, older age and low socioeconomic status predicted lower odds of having Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50% of visits via video versus in-person or phone (aORs &lt; .68); schizophrenia and MH hospitalization history predicted lower odds of having Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50% of visits via video or phone versus in-person (aORs &lt; . 64). During the pre-COVID and COVID periods, nonpsychologists (e.g., psychiatrists) had lower odds of completing video visits (aORs &lt; . 44). Older providers had lower odds of completing Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50% of visits via video during COVID (a<i>ORs</i> &lt;. 69). Findings demonstrate a digital divide, such that older and lower income patients, and older providers, engaged in less video care. Nonpsychologists also had lower video use. Barriers to use must be identified and strategies must be implemented to ensure equitable access to video MH services.

"Psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the population of Argentina","In addition to the implications that this pandemic has had on physical health, there are other circumstances that threaten the mental health of the population, such as lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus, uncertainty, and the increase in infections and deaths. For this reason, this study explored indicators of psychological distress in the Argentine population, as well as its relationship with sociodemographic and health variables.Cross-sectional observational study, with data collection from May to August 2020. A total of 1112 people over the age of 18 who responded to various measurement instruments through an online questionnaire participated. A bivariate analysis and logistic regression were carried out in order to determine predictive factors of psychological distress.The data revealed that 60.9% of the sample presented psychological distress. A greater number with this condition was observed in women, apart from younger people, with a greater number of symptoms associated with the disease and with worse self-perceived health. There was no evidence of association between psychological distress and contact with people infected with coronavirus disease 2019 or with material suspicious of being infected.This research provided an overview of the mental health status of a significant population sample in Argentina, months after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. These findings complement those found in other national and international studies, allowing the accumulation of evidence that states the need to demand to draw attention to the mental health of the population, especially the most vulnerable groups, on behalf of the public authorities.","Lucuix, GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, Barone, DomÃƒÂ­nguez-Salas, Luque, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, Ruiz-Frutos","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000028333","20211223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24273,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on intensive care unit workers: a nationwide survey","To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian intensive care unit (ICU) workers. Between June and August 2020, we distributed a cross-sectional online survey of ICU workers evaluating the impact of the pandemic, coping strategies, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Impact of Events Scale-Revised), and psychological distress, anxiety, and depression (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). We performed regression analyses to determine the predictors of psychological symptoms. We analyzed responses from 455 ICU workers (80% women; 67% from Ontario; 279 nurses, 69 physicians, and 107 other healthcare professionals). Respondents felt that their job put them at great risk of exposure (60%), were concerned about transmitting COVID-19 to family members (76%), felt more stressed at work (67%), and considered leaving their job (37%). Overall, 25% had probable PTSD and 18% had minimal or greater psychological distress. Nurses were more likely to report PTSD symptoms (33%) and psychological distress (23%) than physicians (5% for both) and other health disciplines professionals (19% and 14%). Variables associated with PTSD and psychological distress included female sex (beta-coefficient [B], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 2.10 and B, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.79 to 5.78, respectively; P &lt; 0.001 for differences in scores across groups) and perceived increased risk due to PPE shortage or inadequate PPE training (B, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.31 and B, 4.88; 95% CI, 3.34 to 6.43, respectively). Coping strategies included talking to friends/family/colleagues (80%), learning about COVID-19 (78%), and physical exercise (68%). Over half endorsed the following workplace strategies as valuable: hospital-provided scrubs, clear communication and protocols by hospitals, knowing their voice is heard, subsidized parking, and gestures of appreciation from leadership. This survey study shows that ICU workers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of stress and psychological burden. Respondents endorsed communication, protocols, and appreciation from leadership as helpful mitigating strategies.

"COVID-19 Limitations on Doodling as a Measure of Burnout","Pre-COVID-19, doodling was identified as a measure of burnout in researchers attending a weekly, in-person health narratives research group manifesting team mindfulness. Under the group's supportive conditions, variations in doodling served to measure change in participants reported depression and anxiety-internal states directly associated with burnout, adversely affecting healthcare researchers, their employment, and their research. COVID-19 demanded social distancing during the group's 2020/21 academic meetings. Conducted online, the group's participants who chose to doodle did so alone during the pandemic. Whether the sequestering of group participants during COVID-19 altered the ability of doodling to act as a measure of depression and anxiety was investigated. Participants considered that doodling during the group's online meetings increased their enjoyment and attention level-some expressed that it helped them to relax. However, unlike face-to-face meetings during previous non-COVID-19 years, solitary doodling during online meetings was unable to reflect researchers' depression or anxiety. The COVID-19 limitations that necessitated doodling alone maintained the benefits group members saw in doodling but hampered the ability of doodling to act as a measure of burnout, in contrast to previous in-person doodling. This result is seen to correspond to one aspect of the group's change in team mindfulness resulting from COVID-19 constraints.","Nash","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe11040118","20211223","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; doodling; team mindfulness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24275,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Women: A Scoping Review","During the gestation period, pregnant women experience physical and psychological changes, which represent vulnerability factors that can boost the development of mental health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic is producing new changes in the routines of the whole society, especially on lifestyle habits. The psychological impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and pregnant women remains unclear. A scoping review regarding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women was conducted. Searchers were conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL databases. Articles in Spanish, English and French were included. The search was conducted between November 2020 and September 2021. We identified 31 studies that evaluated 30,049 expectant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnant women showed high levels of anxiety and depression symptomatology. Fear of contagion and concerns regarding the health of the fetus were identified as the main variables related to psychological distress. An increase of the levels of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic amongst pregnant women has been observed. Moreover, an increased vulnerability of the fetus due to placental metabolic alterations is discussed. This review suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a negative psychological impact on pregnant women. Thus, high levels of anxiety and depression symptoms suggest the need for a systematic approach.","Campos-GarzÃƒÂ³n, Riquelme-Gallego, de la Torre-Luque, CaparrÃƒÂ³s-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11120181","20211223","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; mental health; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24276,""
"COVID-19 pandemic-related aspects and predictors of emotional and behavioural symptoms in youth with pre-existing mental health conditions: results from Georgia, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey","This study evaluated levels of and predictors of emotional and behavioral symptoms in youth with pre-existing mental health conditions over the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 across Georgia, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. The study included 421 children and adolescents aged 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years with pre-existing mental health conditions and corresponding ongoing treatments. We used a parent- and/or child-report, which taps into a broad range of mental health symptoms and contextual factors thought to be particularly pertinent during periods of social restrictions. Data were collected simultaneously across the countries from May 2020 to August 2020. According to parents, 121 (33.1%) children had deteriorations in the overall quality of mental health over the COVID-19, 156 (43.1%) deteriorations in the quantity of mental health care received, while 82 (25.1%) mental health care received did not meet the needs. For 121 (49.8%) of children, there was worsening in the main presenting psychiatric symptom compared to January 2020, while for 64 (26.3%) there was some improvement. In total, 128 (43.9%) children reported worsened emotional and 118 (40.6%) behavioral symptoms. The COVID-related worry, parental emotional difficulties, and parent-child relationships emerged as the most relevant predictors for higher levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties. This study found that the COVID-19 pandemic has considerably changed the daily lives of some children with pre-existing mental health conditions, where almost every second child had deteriorations in overall mental health or worsening of psychiatric symptoms.","Stevanovic, Kabukcu Basay, Basay, Leskauskas, Nussbaum, Zirakashvili","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.2013531","20211223","Cross-cultural; anxiety; depression; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24277,""
"Experiences of student and trainee autism researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in significant personal and professional adjustments. Students and trainees, including those in autism research, face unique challenges to accomplishing their training and career goals during this unprecedented time. In this commentary, we, as members of the International Society for Autism Research Student and Trainee Committee, describe our personal experiences, which may or may not align with those of other students and trainees. Our experiences have varied both in terms of the ease (or lack thereof) with which we adapted and the degree to which we were supported in the transition to online research and clinical practice. We faced and continue to adjust to uncertainties about future training and academic positions, for which opportunities have been in decline and have subsequently negatively impacted our mental health. Students and trainees' prospects have been particularly impacted compared to more established researchers and faculty. In addition to the challenges we have faced, however, there have also been unexpected benefits in our training during the pandemic, which we describe here. We have learned new coping strategies which, we believe, have served us well. The overarching goal of this commentary is to describe these experiences and strategies in the hope that they will benefit the autism research community moving forward. Here, we provide a set of recommendations for faculty, especially mentors, to support students and trainees as well as strategies for students and trainees to bolster their self-advocacy, both of which we see as crucial for our future careers. LAY SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected students and trainees, including those in autism research, in different ways. Here, we describe our personal experiences. These experiences include challenges. For example, it has been difficult to move from in-person to online work. It has also been difficult to keep up with work and training goals. Moreover, working from home has made it hard to connect with our supervisors and mentors. As a result, many of us have felt unsure about how to make the best career choices. Working in clinical services and getting to know and support our patients online has also been challenging. Overall, the pandemic has made us feel more isolated and some of us have struggled to cope with that. On the other hand, our experiences have also included benefits. For example, by working online, we have been able to join meetings all over the world. Also, the pandemic has pushed us to learn new skills. Those include technical skills but also skills for well-being. Next, we describe our experiences of returning to work. Finally, we give recommendations for trainees and supervisors on how to support each other and to build a strong community.","Kaku, McVey, Gerber, Pretzsch, Jones, Kodakkadan, Lei, Singer, Chitehwe, Poulsen, Coffman","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2662","20211223","COVID-19; autism research; pandemic; student and trainee researchers; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24278,""
"Self-reported wellbeing and health-related quality of life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people pre and post the first wave of the COVID-19 2020 pandemic","Quantify change in wellbeing and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults pre and post Australia's initial COVID-19 lockdown. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults completed an online survey at Time 1 (October-November 2019; before the initial Australian COVID-19 outbreak) and Time 2 (August-September 2020; after the first Australian lockdown). We assessed wellbeing using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and HRQoL using the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL-4D) instrument. Participants who completed both surveys (n=42) were included to quantify change in outcomes over time and by comorbidity and demographic factors. Mean reduction in wellbeing over time was 6.4 points (95%CI -14.2 to 1.4) and was associated with age (18-54yo), financial instability and mental health comorbidity. Mean reduction in HRQoL over time was 0.06 (95%CI -0.12 to 0.01) and was associated with financial instability, high physical comorbidity level and mental health comorbidity. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 18-54yo, who were financially unstable or had elevated comorbidity during COVID lockdowns experienced greater reductions in wellbeing and HRQoL.

"The role of resilience and coping among ItalianÃ‚Â healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","To evaluate the psychological state of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the field of rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional observational study. Sample of 334 HCWs including: nurses, medical doctors, therapists, scientists, and clerical workers working at the IRCCS San Raffaele Roma rehabilitation hospital during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anonymous web-based questionnaire included 14-item Resilience Scale, Brief-COPE, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Occupational and sociodemographic characteristics. High levels of resilience, low levels of anxiety, depression, and fear were observed in the study population; the most frequently used coping strategies in the Brief-COPE were acceptance, planning, and active coping. Specifically, 87% of the participants reported a moderate to high level of resilience, with the highest level observed in nurses while physicians show the lowest level. HCWs showed symptoms of anxiety (29%), depressive symptoms (10%), and fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (44%). Statistically significant differences were observed between different occupations for fear (p &lt;0.05) and resilience (p &lt;0.01). Levels of anxiety and fear appeared to be higher in female and younger workers. The latter group - who also reported higher levels of depression - showed lower levels of resilience. In our study hospital and non-hospital workers show different emotional, cognitive, and behavioural resources when facing stressful situations, like in the case of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. Our results support the role of resilience and the proper use of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies as protective factors from psychological distress.","Marcolongo, Ottaviani, Romano, Bonassi, Garramone, Infarinato, Patrizia Russo, Tamburrano, Tomino, Prinzi","https://doi.org/10.23749/mdl.v112i6.12285","20211223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24280,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and work-related stress in Umbrian healthcare workers during Phase 1 in Italy","Depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and poor sleep quality increased in healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to assess levels of psychological distress in Umbrian HCWs during the COVID-19 Phase 1 lockdown along with exploring the relationship between sociodemographic/occupational factors. Data on sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, change of job description, economic losses and emergency involvement and SARS-CoV2 infections in the workplace were collected using an anonymous online survey sent by healthcare professional associations. Data concerning psychological healthcare distress, were collected anonymously using BIAS 20 (stress balance) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). One thousand and one healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. Biological risk at work was perceived by all HCWs, less so from psychologists and more so from those working in hospitals. Stress symptoms (DASS21 &gt;14) were associated with a younger age group (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99) and less work experience (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-0.99). Younger age was also associated with anxiety symptoms (DASS 21 &gt;7) (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99), as well as graduate/post graduate education level (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.14-3.63). Working as an independent contractor was a risk factor for high stress health impact (OR 2.00; CI 1.40-2.86) and stress (OR 1.87; CI 1.20-2.92), anxiety (OR 1.89; CI 1.22-2.92) and depression (OR 1.57; CI 1.10-2.22) symptoms. Our study showed a possible relationship between healthcare type of employment and distress symptoms during Covid19 pandemic phase 1.

"Post-Covid-19 Syndrome: Improvements in Health-Related Quality of Life Following Psychology-Led Interdisciplinary Virtual Rehabilitation","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly recognized as having significant long-term impact on physical and mental health. The Primary Care Wellbeing Service (PCWBS) in Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust (BDCFT) is a psychology-led specialist interdisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in persistent physical symptoms (PPS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) with an emphasis on holistic integrated care. The PCWBS quickly recognized the risk of the long-term effects of COVID-19, particularly for social, health and care staff, and developed a 7-week virtual rehabilitation course which was piloted in October 2020. The ""<i>Recovering from COVID</i>"" course takes a whole system, biopsychosocial approach to understanding COVID-19 and post-viral fatigue (PVF) and is delivered by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a clinical psychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, dietitian, speech and language therapist, assistant psychologist, and a personal support navigator with support from a team administrator. The course focuses on understanding PVF, sleep optimization, nutrition, swallowing, activity management, energy conservation, stress management, breathing optimization, managing setbacks, and signposting to appropriate resources and services. Since the pilot, PCWBS has delivered 7 courses to support over 200 people suffering from post-COVID-19 syndrome. One hundred and forty-nine individuals that enrolled on the ""<i>Recovering from COVID</i>"" course completed the EQ-5D-5L to assess Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across 5 dimensions, including problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Subsequently, 76 individuals completed these measures at the end of the rehabilitation course showing that patient ratings were significantly improved. In response to the NIHR recommendation for rapid evaluation of different service models for supporting people with post-COVID-19 syndrome, this data offers hope that rehabilitation is effective in reversing some of the problems faced by people living with the long-term effects of COVID-19.","Harenwall, Heywood-Everett, Henderson, Godsell, Jordan, Moore, Philpot, Shepherd, Smith, Bland","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319211067674","20211223","EuroQoL; interdisciplinary; long-COVID; post-covid-19 syndrome; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24282,""

"Effectiveness of an online positive psychology intervention among Tunisian healthcare students on mental health and study engagement during the Covid-19 pandemic","Research indicates that university students present higher levels of psychological distress compared with non-student age-matched youth. These levels are higher among healthcare students, and even higher during the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, cost-effective large-scale interventions are needed in order to prevent further development of psychological distress during this period, and more generally. The aim of the current study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week Internet-based positive psychology intervention for healthcare students in Tunisia. A two-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted among a sample of 366 health care students (183 in the experimental group and 183 in the control group), with a majority of women (94%). The average age was 20.74 years (Ã‚Â±1.64). The participants completed the following online questionnaires at three time-points (before the program, immediately after, and three months later): stress, anxiety, depression, emotional regulation, optimism, hope, study engagement, and well-being. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant positive effects of the intervention on all the measured variables for the experimental group. The results showed a significant improvement immediately after the intervention compared to the control group, which was maintained three months later. This program may thus be considered as a promising means of improving students' mental health and study engagement.","Krifa, Hallez, van Zyl, Braham, Sahli, Ben Nasr, Shankland","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12332","20211223","Covid-19; mental health; positive psychology intervention; student engagement; university students; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24284,""
"'A lot of small things make a difference' Mental health and strategies of coping during the COVID-19 pandemic","The social and economic consequences of COVID-19 have the potential to affect individuals and populations through different pathways (e.g., bereavement, loss of social interaction). This study adopted a solicited diary method to understand how mental health was affected during England's first lockdown. We also considered the experiences of diary keeping during a pandemic from the perspective of public participants. Fifteen adults older than 18 years of age were recruited from northwest England. Diarists completed semistructured online diaries for 8 weeks, which was combined with weekly calls. A focus group captured participants' experiences of diary keeping. Four key factors influenced mental health, which fluctuated over time and in relation to diarists' situations. These concerned navigating virus risk, loss of social connections and control and constrictions of the domestic space. Diarists also enacted a range of strategies to cope with the pandemic. This included support from social networks, engagement with natural environments, establishing normality, finding meaning and taking affirmative action. Use of diary methods provided insights into the lived experiences of the early months of a global pandemic. As well as contributing evidence on its mental health effects, diarists' accounts illuminated considerable resourcefulness and strategies of coping with positive effects for well-being. While diary keeping can also have therapeutic benefits during adversity, ethical and practical issues need to be considered, which include the emotional nature of diary keeping. Members of the public were involved in interpretation of data as well as critiquing the overall diary method used in the study.","Halliday, Holt, Khan, Ward, Wheeler, Sadler","https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13416","20211223","coping strategies; diary method; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24285,""
"Investigation of the Effects of Home-Based Exercise and Cognitive Training on Cognitive and Physical Functions in Cardiac Patients: The COVEPICARDIO Study Protocol of a Randomized Clinical Trial","<b>Introduction:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, confinement measures are likely to produce collateral damage to health (stress, confusion, anxiety), especially in frail individuals and those living with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In cardiac patients in particular, these measures dramatically increase the level of physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle, which can decrease cardiorespiratory capacity and increase the risk of acute events, rehospitalization, and depressive syndromes. Maintaining a minimum level of physical activity and cognitive stimulation during the COVID-19 crisis is essential for cardiac patients. This study is designed to document the effects of 6 months of home-based physical exercise alone or combined with cognitive training on cognitive and physical functions in patients with CVD over 50 years old. <b>Methods and Analysis:</b> 122 patients (&gt;50 years old) with stable CVD and no contraindication to perform physical exercise training will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the 2 following arms: (1) Home-based physical exercise alone, (2) Home-based physical exercise combined with cognitive training. The intervention lasts 6 months, with remote assessments performed prior to, mid and post-training. A follow-up 6 months after the end of the intervention (12 month) is also proposed. The primary outcome is cognition, including general functioning (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score), as well as performances on measures of executive functions, processing speed, and episodic memory. The secondary outcome is physical performance, including balance, gait and mobility, leg muscle strength and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness. Tertiary outcomes include mood, anxiety, and health-related quality of life as assessed by self-reported online questionnaires. <b>Discussion:</b> With the COVID-19 crisis, there is a critical need for remote exercise and cognitive training, and to further investigate this topic, in particular for cardiac patients. The present context can be viewed as an opportunity to perform a major shift from center-based programs to home-based physical exercise. This is especially important to reach out to older adults living in remote areas, where access to such interventions is limited. <b>ClinicalTrials.gov:</b> [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04661189], NCT04661189.","Besnier, Dupuy, Gagnon, Vincent, GrÃƒÂ©goire, Blanchette, Saillant, Bouabdallaoui, Grau, BÃƒÂ©rubÃƒÂ©, Olmand, Marin, Belleville, Juneau, Vitali, Gayda, Nigam, Bherer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.740834","20211223","COVID; cardiovascular diseases; cognition; exercise; physical activity; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24286,""
"Neural Network Based Mental Depression Identification and Sentiments Classification Technique From Speech Signals: A COVID-19 Focused Pandemic Study","COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. This led to previously unforeseen measures that aimed to curb its spread, such as the lockdown of cities, districts, and international travel. Various researchers and institutions have focused on multidimensional opportunities and solutions in encountering the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focuses on mental health and sentiment validations caused by the global lockdowns across the countries, resulting in a mental disability among individuals. This paper discusses a technique for identifying the mental state of an individual by sentiment analysis of feelings such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness caused by isolation and pauses to the normal chains of operations in daily life. The research uses a Neural Network (NN) to resolve and extract patterns and validate threshold trained datasets for decision making. This technique was used to validate 2,173 global speech samples, and the resulting accuracy of mental state and sentiments are identified with 93.5% accuracy in classifying the behavioral patterns of patients suffering from COVID-19 and pandemic-influenced depression.","Ahmed, Singh, Basha, Abouel Nasr, Kamrani, Aboudaif","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.781827","20211223","COVID-19; mental depression; neural network; sentiment extraction; speech signal processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24287,""
"The Association of Maternal Emotional Status With Child Over-Use of Electronic Devices During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic may generate high levels of maternal depression/anxiety, and maternal emotional status may affect child behavioral development. Online education during the pandemic may induce child over-use of electronic-devices. However, child electronic-device over-use (especially among children under 12 who are immature in physical and mental development) during the pandemic has not attracted sufficient attention, and the association of child over-use with maternal emotional status remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to assess the characteristics of child electronic-device over-use and the association between maternal emotional status and child over-use among 1,300 children from nurseries (&lt;3 years), kindergartens (3-6 years), and primary schools (6-12 years) in Shanghai and Wuhan during COVID-19. Mothers completed an online questionnaire (including the Self-Rating-Depression/Anxiety-Scales and Family-Environment-Scale). The use of electronic devices (mobile-phones, iPads, computers, and televisions) and online courses taken by the children were investigated. Associations of maternal emotional status with electronic-device-use by child age were analyzed. The proportions of children in nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools were 8.5, 44.5, and 47.0%, their percentages following online-courses were 24.5, 48.4, and 99.0%, and their rates of electronic-device over-use were 34.2, 62.2, and 93.4%, respectively. Significant associations were observed between higher maternal anxiety/depression levels and higher risks of mobile-phone/iPad over-use among preschoolers and primary-school students. Lower family intimacy and higher conflict levels were associated with higher maternal depression/anxiety levels and higher risks of electronic-device over-use. Our findings suggested that over-use of electronic-devices among children under 12 was common during COVID-19, especially among children Ã¢â€°Â¥6 years, and online-teaching may exacerbate over-use. Maternal anxiety/depression levels were associated with over-use of portable internet-devices (mobile-phone/iPad), especially among preschoolers and school-aged students, and family environment may mediate the association. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of factors leading to over-use of electronic-device and developing strategies to decrease over-use during COVID-19.","Guo, Zhou, Xu, Hu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.760996","20211223","COVID-19 pandemic; child electronic devices over-use; family environment; maternal anxiety; maternal depression; media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24288,""
"Predictors of Psychological Distress and Coronavirus Fears in the First Recovery Phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Germany","<b>Objectives:</b> While previous research has mainly focused on the impact of the first acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, little empirical knowledge exists about depression, anxiety, and somatic symptom levels and possible predictors of symptom levels in the pandemic's recovery phase. The present study aimed to analyze the mental burden of a convenience ample of the general German population during the first recovery phase of the pandemic and to identify significant predictors of symptom levels. <b>Methods:</b> Standardized measures of anxiety (GAD-2), depression (PHQ-2), somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), and health anxiety, as well as measures of COVID-19 fears and possible vulnerability factors, were administered through a national, cross-sectional online survey (<i>n</i> = 2160, mean age 42.7 years, 75% female), asking participants for their current symptom levels and their symptom levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Our findings show significantly elevated levels of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and health anxiety in the recovery period compared to before the pandemic. The current prevalence rates based on self-reporting were 26.7% for depression, 24.5% for anxiety, and 29% for somatization. The strongest predictors of these symptom reports included domain-specific pre-existing symptom levels, neuroticism, biological COVID-19 risk factors, avoidance of illness information, and younger age. The most important predictors of COVID-19 fears were subjective COVID-19 risk perception, followed by pre-existing health anxiety, the number of biological COVID-19 risk factors, older age, neuroticism, avoidance of illness information and female gender. <b>Discussion:</b> These findings indicate the need for specific psychological programs to help individuals with enhanced psychological and biological vulnerability to cope better with the mental distress experienced during all phases of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Biermann, Vonderlin, Mier, WitthÃƒÂ¶ft, Bailer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.678860","20211223","COVID-19; anxiety; corona; depression; health anxiety; information avoidance; pandemics; somatic symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24289,""
"Peri-Traumatic Distress and Its Relationship to Resilience and Coping Among Medical Students in Malaysia During COVID-19 Lockdown","<b>Background:</b> Medical students are not spared from the challenges related to the Covid-19 lockdown. The fear and uncertainties may lead to traumatic symptoms and test their resilience and sense of coping. Thus, this study aims to determine the prevalence of peri-traumatic distress symptoms and its association with the level of resilience and the coping strategies used during the lockdown among medical students. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey involving medical students from a public university in Malaysia. It was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown or Movement Control Order (MCO) where the students were asked to fill in the COVID-19 Peri-traumatic Distress Index (CPDI), Brief COPE Inventory, and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS-25). <b>Results:</b> A total of 282 clinical and 172 pre-clinical medical students were involved. Peri-traumatic distress symptoms were reported by 27% out of the total students. This study found that those who were having peritraumatic distress symptoms were from the pre-clinical years, had poor internet access, as well as lower resilience levels, and used more dysfunctional coping strategies. Pre-clinical medical students with difficult internet access were eight times more likely to have peritraumatic distress symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Given the high level of peri-traumatic distress symptoms reported by medical students during the lockdown, it is vital to identify the vulnerable students, assess their needs and risks to mental health problems during this challenging time as the pandemic is still ongoing with countries going in and out of lockdown depending on the cases at the time. The university administration for each University in Malaysia will need to have a clear academic guideline and policy as well as providing improved infrastructure to minimize the distress faced by medical students.","Mohamed, Ismail, Shuib, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.789554","20211223","COVID-19; coping; distress; lockdown; medical students; peritraumatic; resilience; undergraduate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24290,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Epidemic on Adolescents: A Large Sample Study in China","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health emergency. However, little is known about the psychological impact of this pandemic on adolescents. We aim to assess the prevalence and influencing factors of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among adolescents in a large sample study. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 175,416 adolescents covering 31 provinces, centrally administered municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China from February 23 to March 8, 2020. The status of depression, anxiety, and PTG was assessed by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire, and post-traumatic growth inventory. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTG in adolescents was 35.9, 28.0, and 45.6%, respectively. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the slight or severe epidemic areas was similar. Regression analysis showed that female sex and older age were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and lower levels of PTG. Symptoms related to COVID-19, excessive attention to epidemic information, living in urban or severe epidemic areas, and conflicts with parents during home quarantine were risk factors for depression, anxiety, and PTG. Frequent communication with peers, exercise, and receiving public welfare psychological assistance were protective factors. Poor family economic status was a significant risk factor for depression and PTG. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggested that positive and negative psychological reactions coexist in adolescents faced with the pandemic.

This study examines pandemic-related physical and mental health and (compensatory) behavioral changes, in patients with BD as compared to healthy control individuals. <b>Method:</b> Physical and mental health and self-reported changes in daily structure and behavior due to the pandemic were assessed using a self-constructed questionnaire and the brief symptom inventory (BSI) in Germany, Austria, and Denmark in individuals with BD and a healthy control group. <b>Results:</b> The present study included 118 individuals with BD and 215 healthy controls. Individuals with BD reported statistically significant higher physical risk burden, increased weight gain, more physical comorbidities, and a decrease in physical activity and they further reported higher rates of COVID-19 testing, had more worries concerning health, and experienced more anxiety but less social distancing. <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a greater impact on physical health in individuals with BD than in healthy controls. Individuals with BD appear to be having more difficulties compensating their behavior due to the pandemic which could amplify the effect of risk factors associated with poorer physical health. This highlights the necessity for optimizing and targeting the overall treatment of both mental and physical health in patients with BD during periods with far-reaching changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Limitations:</b> Sampling issues and self-report forms, selectivity (missing elderly, and those lacking access or knowledge of technology).","Sperling, Dalkner, Berndt, Fleischmann, Ratzenhofer, Martini, Pfennig, Bauer, Reininghaus, Vinberg","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.759694","20211223","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; behavioral changes; bipolar disorder; physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24292,""
"The Trends of Psychological Status of People Entering from High-Risk Areas of COVID-19 Coronavirus During the Quarantine in Dedicated Hotels: A Longitudinal Survey Study from Guangzhou, China","The quarantine in dedicated hotels has become an inevitable safety measure due to the frequent cross-border travel since the outbreak of COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to explore the trends in the psychological status of individuals entering from high-risk areas of COVID-19 coronavirus while quarantining in dedicated hotels. A total of 591 individuals who isolated in dedicated hotels were recruited between March and June 2020. Participants self-reported mental symptoms [Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS)] every three days during the quarantine. A mixed-effects linear regression model was used to assess the trends. Participants reporting anxiety and depression symptoms at least one time during quarantine accounted for 4.5% and 18.4%, respectively. Their psychological status was alleviated during some first 9 days, and then it slightly deteriorated, which was suggested by SAS and SDS scores that were negatively correlated with the days of quarantine (T) (adjusted coefficient [ÃŽÂ²] -0.81, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.62; and ÃŽÂ² -0.75, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.53, respectively), and were positively correlated with the square of T (ÃŽÂ² 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; and ÃŽÂ² 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06, respectively). The unemployed and 18~30-year-old participants were prone to greater levels of psychological distress. No significant difference in the trend of mental health was found among different subgroups. The mental health of the people entering Guangzhou from high-risk areas of COVID-19 coronavirus resulted positive during the early period of quarantine in dedicated hotels, after which it deteriorated. The psychological status of individuals should be closely monitored at the beginning and after more than 9 days of quarantine, especially for individuals who are unemployed and 18~30-year-old ones.","Deng, Shi, Li, Jiang, Xie, Luo, Ling, Lin, Chen, Zhao, Kang, Yuan, Wen","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S331735","20211223","COVID-19; dedicated hotels; psychological distress; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24293,""
"Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulators: a review of past, present and future devices","As an emerging neuromodulation therapy, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proven to be safe and effective for epilepsy, major depressive disorders, insomnia, glucose metabolic disorders, pain, stroke, post stroke rehabilitation, anxiety, fear, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disorders, tinnitus, Prader-Willi Syndrome and COVID-19. Although the history of taVNS is only two decades, the devices carrying taVNS technique have been constantly updated. Especially in recent years, the development of taVNS devices has presented a new trend. To conclude, the development of taVNS devices has entered a new era, thus the update speed and quality of taVNS devices will be considerably improved in the future. This article reviewed the history and classification of taVNS devices. The correlation between the effectiveness and stimulation parameters from taVNS devices still remains unclear. There is a lack of standard or harmonization among different taVNS devices. Strategies, including further comparative research and establishment of standard, have been recommended in this article to promote the future development of taVNS devices.","Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Li, Wu, Li, Rong","https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2022.2020095","20211223","Auricular acupuncture; Auriculotherapy; Neuromodulation; Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation; Vagus nerve stimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24294,""
"COVID-19, Anxiety, and Hopelessness: Quality of Life Among Healthcare Workers in Turkey","The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of intense anxiety and hopelessness experienced by healthcare workers during the pandemic on their quality of life. This cross-sectional, online questionnaire-based study was conducted between August 31, 2020 and October 31, 2020, with 729 healthcare workers in Turkey. The study showed that hopelessness, the weekly working time, fatigue, and the workload of healthcare workers negatively affected their quality of life, those who found the pandemic measures inadequate had a lower quality of life and higher hopelessness levels, and those who needed knowledge on various issues to improve their skills had lower quality of life and higher levels of anxiety and hopelessness. Increasing the measures to make healthcare workers feel competent and ready during the COVID-19 pandemic and meet their information needs to improve their skills will reduce their anxiety and hopelessness and improve their quality of life. Identifying the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and quality of life will help achieve sustainable success in the delivery of health services and promote employee health and safety.","Mert, Peker Karatoprak, Demirhan, Baydemir, Ãƒâ€¡etinarslan, CantÃƒÂ¼rk, Selek, Aydin, SÃƒÂ¶zen, Gezer","https://doi.org/10.1177/01632787211067530","20211223","anxiety; coronavirus; health-related quality of life; healthcare workers; hopelessness; occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24295,""
"Measuring citizens' engagement during emergencies: Psychometric validation of the Public Health Engagement Scale for Emergency Settings (PHEs-E)","The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of citizens' behaviors in the containment of the virus. Individuals might change their intention to adhere to public health prescriptions depending on various personal characteristics, including their own emotional status, which has been recognized to be a crucial psychological factor in orienting people's adherence to public health recommendation during emergency settings. In particular, it is crucial to support citizens' alliance with authorities and feeling of trust: public engagement is a concept that refers to the general involvement of citizens into public affairs which is generally considered an effective approach to enhance citizens' understanding of their crucial role in public affairs. However, so far there is no agreement on the metrics and indexes that should be used to measures public engagement during a health crisis. The aim of this paper is to validate a psychometric scale (PHEs-E), which intends to measure the readiness of individuals to adhere to the prescribed behavioral change to contain the emergency. Data were collected throughout the pandemic in Italy: in particular, five independent samples were recruited starting from March 2020 to March 2021. Results showed that the proposed measure has good psychometric characteristics. A general linear model was computed to assess the differences of public engagement across the different data points and among citizens with different sociodemographic characteristics. Correlations with other psychological constructs (i.e. Anxiety, Depression and Self-Efficacy) were also tested, showing that more engaged citizens have a lower level of anxiety and depression, and a higher self-efficacy. This study's findings indicate that individuals' characteristics may differentiate citizens' motivation to engage in public health behavioral recommendation to prevent the COVID-19 contagion. However the scale could be useful to perform a psychological monitoring of psychological readiness to engage in public health strategies to face critical events and settings.","Graffigna, Palamenghi, Barello, Savarese, Castellini, Lozza, Bonanomi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261733","20211222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24296,""
"Associations between COVID-19 mobility restrictions and economic, mental health, and suicide-related concerns in the US using cellular phone GPS and Google search volume data","During the COVID-19 pandemic, US populations have experienced elevated rates of financial and psychological distress that could lead to increases in suicide rates. Rapid ongoing mental health monitoring is critical for early intervention, especially in regions most affected by the pandemic, yet traditional surveillance data are available only after long lags. Novel information on real-time population isolation and concerns stemming from the pandemic's social and economic impacts, via cellular mobility tracking and online search data, are potentially important interim surveillance resources. Using these measures, we employed transfer function model time-series analyses to estimate associations between daily mobility indicators (proportion of cellular devices completely at home and time spent at home) and Google Health Trends search volumes for terms pertaining to economic stress, mental health, and suicide during 2020 and 2021 both nationally and in New York City. During the first pandemic wave in early-spring 2020, over 50% of devices remained completely at home and searches for economic stressors exceeded 60,000 per 10 million. We found large concurrent associations across analyses between declining mobility and increasing searches for economic stressor terms (national proportion of devices at home: cross-correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.6 (p-value &lt;0.001)). Nationally, we also found strong associations between declining mobility and increasing mental health and suicide-related searches (time at home: mood/anxiety CC = 0.53 (&lt;0.001), social stressor CC = 0.51 (&lt;0.001), suicide seeking CC = 0.37 (0.006)). Our findings suggest that pandemic-related isolation coincided with acute economic distress and may be a risk factor for poor mental health and suicidal behavior. These emergent relationships warrant ongoing attention and causal assessment given the potential for long-term psychological impact and suicide death. As US populations continue to face stress, Google search data can be used to identify possible warning signs from real-time changes in distributions of population thought patterns.","Gimbrone, Rutherford, Kandula, MartÃƒÂ­nez-AlÃƒÂ©s, Shaman, Olfson, Gould, Pei, Galanti, Keyes","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260931","20211222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24297,""
"From low sense of control to problematic smartphone use severity during Covid-19 outbreak: The mediating role of fear of missing out and the moderating role of repetitive negative thinking","Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the use of digital devices, especially smartphones, remarkably increased. Smartphone use belongs to one's daily routine, but can negatively impact physical and mental health, performance, and relationships if used excessively. The present study aimed to investigate potential correlates of problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity and the mechanisms underlying its development. Data of 516 smartphone users from Germany (Mage = 31.91, SDage = 12.96) were assessed via online surveys in April and May 2021. PSU severity was significantly negatively associated with sense of control. In contrast, it was significantly positively linked to fear of missing out (FoMO), repetitive negative thinking (RNT), and daily time spent on smartphone use. In a moderated mediation analysis, the negative relationship between sense of control and PSU severity was significantly mediated by FoMO. RNT significantly moderated the positive association between FoMO and PSU severity. Specifically, the higher the RNT, the stronger the relationship between FoMO and PSU. The present findings disclose potential mechanisms that could contribute to PSU. Potential ways of how to reduce PSU severity are discussed.","Brailovskaia, Stirnberg, Rozgonjuk, Margraf, Elhai","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261023","20211223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24298,""
"Post-ICU Syndrome in a Cohort of COVID-19 Survivors in New York City","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the number of survivors of critical illness. These survivors are at increased risk of physical, psychological, and cognitive impairments known collectively as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). Little is known about the prevalence of PICS in COVID-19 survivors. To report the prevalence of physical, psychological, and cognitive impairment among COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) survivors receiving follow-up care in an ICU recovery clinic, to assess for associations between PICS and ICU-related factors, and to compare the cohort of ICU survivors who attended post-ICU clinic to a cohort of ICU survivors who did not. We performed a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 ICU survivors admitted from March to May 2020 who were subsequently seen in a post-ICU recovery clinic in New York City. We abstracted medical chart data on available clinical screening instruments for physical, psychological, and cognitive impairment. Associations between these outcomes and care-related variables were tested. Baseline characteristics and in-hospital treatments of the post-ICU clinic cohort were compared to COVID-19 ICU survivors from the same institution who were not seen in post-ICU clinic. 87 COVID-19 ICU survivors were seen in our post-ICU recovery clinic. The median age was 62 years and 74% were male. The median length of hospitalization was 51 days and the median length of ICU stay was 22 days. At the post-ICU follow-up visit, 29%, 21%, and 13% of patients reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, respectively. 25% had cognitive impairment. The overall prevalence of PICS was 90%. There were no associations between length of ICU stay, delirium, exposure to benzodiazepines, steroids, or systemic paralytics with positive screens for physical, psychological, or cognitive impairment. Baseline characteristics and ICU-related factors were similar in the cohort of COVID-19 ICU survivors who attended ICU recovery clinic and those who did not. PICS is common in COVID-19 survivors. We did not find any association with length of ICU stay, the use of benzodiazepines, steroids, or paralytics.","Weidman, LaFond, Hoffman, Goyal, Parkhurst, Derry-Vick, Schenck, Lief","https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202104-520OC","20211222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24299,""

To examine changes in mental health and well-being before and during the initial and later phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and test whether patterns varied with sociodemographic characteristics in a representative sample of older adults living in England. This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from 5146 older adults participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who provided data before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018 and 2019) and at 2 occasions in 2020 (June or July as well as November or December). The COVID-19 pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics, including sex, age, partnership status, and socioeconomic position. Changes in depression (8-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), quality of life (12-item Control, Autonomy, Self-realization, and Pleasure scale), and loneliness (3-item Revised University of California, Los Angeles, loneliness scale) were tested before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using fixed-effects regression models. Of 5146 included participants, 2723 (52.9%) were women, 4773 (92.8%) were White, and the mean (SD) age was 67.7 (10.6) years. The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms increased from 12.5% (95% CI, 11.5-13.4) before the COVID-19 pandemic to 22.6% (95% CI, 21.6-23.6) in June and July 2020, with a further rise to 28.5% (95% CI, 27.6-29.5) in November and December 2020. This was accompanied by increased loneliness and deterioration in quality of life. The prevalence of anxiety rose from 9.4% (95% CI, 8.8-9.9) to 10.9% (95% CI, 10.3-11.5) from June and July 2020 to November and December 2020. Women and nonpartnered people experienced worse changes in mental health. Participants with less wealth had the lowest levels of mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher socioeconomic groups had better mental health overall but responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with more negative changes. In this longitudinal cohort study of older adults living in England, mental health and well-being continued to worsen as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, and socioeconomic inequalities persisted. Women and nonpartnered people experienced greater deterioration in mental health.","Zaninotto, Iob, Demakakos, Steptoe","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.3749","20211222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24301,""

A longitudinal study was conducted in April 2020 (T0), and July 2020 (T1). Symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, burnout, levels of resilience, along with demographic and work-related variables in 443 workers were assessed. Symptoms and burnout were more pronounced at T0, whereas the levels of resilience were higher at T1. Being female, being young, holding a lower-level job, less years of experience, lower educational level and/or working rotating shifts are associated with having more post-traumatic stress symptoms and burnout.

"Fear of missing out (FoMO) and internet use: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis","FoMO has been considered a predisposing factor toward excessive internet use, and a great deal of literature has investigated the link between FoMO and internet use. However, there is still a lack of cohesion in the literature. The current study have been conducted and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). In the current systematic review and meta-analysis of 86 effect-sizes, representative of 55,134 participants (Mean age = 22.07, SD = 6.15, females = 58.37%), we found that the strength of the trait FoMO- internet use association significantly varies from r = 0.11 to r = 0.63. In some populations, FoMO appears to increase with age and it is reverse in other populations. Facebook use was unrelated to FoMO in some populations, and higher FoMO was linked with stopping Instagram use for some individuals. The FoMO- internet use association was independent of their severity, as the interaction was not significant, and this association was neither linear nor curvilinear. The FoMO-internet use association does not appear to be associated with depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms or level of life satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic was the only significant moderator of the FoMO-internet use association, strengthening this relationship. FoMO demonstrates a considerable role in internet use; however, there is no evidence of interaction or bi-directional association between the mentioned. Overall, we still don't know what factors contribute to individuals exhibiting distinct patterns in the FoMO-internet use association.","Akbari, Seydavi, Palmieri, Mansueto, Caselli, Spada","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00083","20211222","fear of missing out (FoMO); internet use; smartphone use; social media use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24303,""
"Well-being of Canadian Armed Forces Veterans and Spouses of Veterans during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Prospective Longitudinal Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to everyday life, including social distancing mandates, changes to health care, and a heightened risk of infection. Previous research has shown that Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Veterans are at higher risk of developing mental and physical health conditions. Veterans and their families may face unique social challenges that can compound with pandemic-related disruptions to negatively impact well-being. This study aims to longitudinally characterize the mental health of CAF Veterans and spouses of CAF Veterans throughout the pandemic and to understand the dynamic influences of pandemic-related stressors on psychological health over time. We employed a prospective longitudinal panel design using an online data collection platform. Study participation was open to all CAF Veterans and spouses of CAF Veterans residing in Canada. Participants were asked to complete a comprehensive battery of assessments representing psychological well-being, chronic pain, health care access patterns, physical environment, employment, social integration, and adjustment to pandemic-related lifestyle changes. Follow-up assessments were conducted every three months over an 18-month period. This study was approved by the Western University Health Sciences and Lawson Health Research Institute Research Ethics Boards. Baseline data were collected between July 2020 and February 2021. Three population segments participated in the study: 1047 Veterans, 366 spouses of Veterans, and 125 Veterans who are also spouses of Veterans completed baseline data collection. As of November 2021, data collection is ongoing, with participants completing the 9 or 12-month follow-up surveys depending on their date of self-enrollment. Data collection across all timepoints will be complete in September 2022. This longitudinal survey is unique in its comprehensive assessment of domains relevant to Veterans and spouses of Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from occupational, demographic, social, mental and physical domains, to perceptions and experiences with health care treatments and access.

Cohort telephone survey study. South Florida SCI Model System (SF-SCIMS). A convenience sample of 51 individuals with traumatic SCI who had previously completed SCIMS Form II follow-up interviews. Not applicable. Questionnaire administration included assessments of resilience, depressive symptoms, satisfaction with life, anxiety, pain, alcohol and substance use, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and impact of early COVID-19 community restrictions on various aspects of life. Of the individuals interviewed, 78% reported limited access to their regular activities, 40% to healthcare information and services, 38% to personal protective equipment (PPE), 37% to food/groceries, and 34% to medication refills. Sixteen percent of the participants had at least moderate levels of depression, and 10% had at least moderate levels of anxiety. Statistically significant increases in depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004) and significant decreases in resilience (SCI-Quality of Life Resilience subscore; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.010) were found when comparing scores on measures of psychological function at the time of the study to scores collected during the previous SCIMS Form II interview (within 2 years pre-COVID-19). Limitations to basic needs and face-to-face communication can exacerbate challenges in access for persons with disabilities. Our results show increased levels of psychological distress related to decreased access to goods and services in individuals with SCI due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study can help the SCI community to target strategies for enhanced access, outreach, shared information, and social support in preparation for future community health or weather emergencies.","Vives Alvarado, Miranda-Cantellops, Jackson, Felix","https://doi.org/10.1080/10790268.2021.2013592","20211222","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Spinal Cord injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24305,""
"Psychological Distress Amongst Medical Laboratory Professionals Involved in COVID-19-Related Duties: A Nationally Stratified Cross-Sectional Survey, Ghana","To assess the prevalence and factors associated with psychological distress (PD) and Medical Laboratory Professionals (MLPs) involvement in COVID-19-related duties. This study adopted an online cross-sectional, nationally stratified survey among 473 MLPs using Google Form with a designated link; Depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcome). We employed generalized Negative Binomial (NBR) and Poisson regression analytical approach to our study outcomes. All analyses were performed using Stata 16, and <i>P</i>-valueÃ¢â€°Â¤.05 deemed significant. The overall DASS-21 score ranged from asymptomatic psychological distress to severe symptomatic PD. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 9.1 [95%CI=6.8-12.0], 17.8 [95%CI=14.6-21.5], and 7.5 [95%CI=5.4-10.1], respectively. The result evinced a high and significant association; the univariate NBR predicted a significant increase of PD score by 12% and 18% among participants who were involved in one and two or more COVID-19-related duties, respectively, (ÃŽÂ²[95%CI] = .12 [.05-.18] and .18 [.10-.26], respectively). A binary outcome predicted approximately 2-folds of overall psychological distress among participants involved in two or more COVID-19-related duties compared with non-involvement (adjusted Prevalence Ratio [95%CI]= 2.34 [1.12-4.85]). For depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, both univariate and multivariate data analyses evinced a higher disadvantage among MLP involved in COVID-19-related duties. We observed a high tendency of experiencing significant psychological distress amongst MLP involved in COVID-19-related duties. Experience of psychological distress increased with deeper involvement in COVID-19-related activities. Psychological support should be extended to MLPs to limit the effect of these negative emotions on their cognitive and social behavior as well as job performance.","Swaray, Tetteh, Ekem-Ferguson, Awinibuno, Adu-Gyasi, Acheampong, Yawson","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211067479","20211223","COVID-19; medical laboratory professionals; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24306,""

"Implications of the School Day on Health Behaviors for Children With Type 1 Diabetes: A Survey of Parent Perspectives During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study is to survey parents of youth with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic with school closures to better understand the implications of the school day on health care behaviors. A cross-sectional, online survey was distributed to parents of youth with type 1 diabetes Ã¢â€°Â¤19 years of age in a large, academic diabetes center. Questions encompassed perceived changes in management behaviors and plans for return to school. Subgroup analysis compared parent responses by child's age, reported stressors, and socioeconomic markers. Parents reported a worsening in their child's diabetes health behaviors during school closures compared to what they perceived during a regular school day before the pandemic. More than half of parents reported feeling that their child was unable to maintain a normal routine, with particular implications for snacking between meals, daily physical activity, and sleep habits. Families with adolescents or those experiencing multiple pandemic-related stressors reported greater challenges. In open-ended responses, families highlighted difficulty in balancing school, work, and diabetes care and expressed concerns about the mental health repercussions of school closures for their children. Nearly half of parents reported being at least moderately worried about return to school, whereas only a minority reported seeking guidance from their diabetes provider. Parent-reported disruptions of school-day routines frequently had adverse consequences for diabetes management in this population. These findings highlight the importance of a school-day routine for children with type 1 diabetes; during closures, families may benefit from mitigating strategies to maintain effective habits.","March, Siminerio, Muzumdar, Libman","https://doi.org/10.1177/26350106211051298","20211223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24308,""
"Improving Youth COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Through a Novel Medical Student Driven Curriculum","Despite widespread media coverage and public health messaging, many high school students lacked formal education about COVID-19 during the pandemic. Providing this education, particularly to underserved communities, may reduce health disparities and encourage youth to engage in the sciences. Twenty-five medical students at Emory University School of Medicine created a virtual, synchronous, COVID-19 curriculum. Learners included 25 students enrolled in a pipeline program from five high schools in metro-Atlanta. The five lesson topics included virus epidemiology, COVID-19 testing and mask-wearing, vaccine fundamentals, COVID-19 risk in communities, and mental health and wellness. Lessons were standardized through medical student-teacher practice presentations to faculty. The curriculum was evaluated with a 23-item pre- and postsurvey assessing learners' COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Pre- and postsurvey scores were compared using descriptive statistics and paired-samples t test. After the curriculum, learners' (N = 9) COVID-19 knowledge scores increased from 67% correct to 90% correct. Participants were better able to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, define ""herd immunity,"" and describe how socioeconomic status can influence infection risk. In addition, after the curriculum implementation, more learners thought vaccines were safe, with 67% responding that vaccines are ""very safe,"" compared with 0% at pretest. This initiative increased learners' COVID-19 knowledge and established bridges between medical students and underserved communities. These connections are essential to combat misinformation surrounding COVID-19, encourage participation in the sciences from underrepresented areas, and empower students to be health advocates within their communities.","Kuehl, Olsen, Harris, Mandal, Watt, Spicer, Sonu","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399211060786","20211222","high school youth; medical student teachers; pipeline program; public health education; underserved communities; virtual COVID-19 curriculum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24309,""

"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Destabilizes Microvascular Homeostasis","SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause compromised respiratory function and thrombotic events. SARS-CoV-2 binds to and mediates downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cells that it infects. Theoretically, diminished enzymatic activity of ACE2 may result in increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory molecules, angiotensin II, and Bradykinin, contributing to SARS-CoV-2 pathology. Using immunofluorescence microscopy of lung tissues from uninfected, and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, we find evidence that ACE2 is highly expressed in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and significantly reduced along the alveolar lining of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. <i>Ex vivo</i> analyses of primary human cells, indicated that ACE2 is readily detected in pulmonary alveolar epithelial and aortic endothelial cells. Exposure of these cells to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was sufficient to reduce ACE2 expression. Moreover, exposure of endothelial cells to spike protein-induced dysfunction, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Exposure of endothelial cells to bradykinin caused calcium signaling and endothelial dysfunction (increased expression of von Willibrand Factor and decreased expression of KrÃƒÂ¼ppel-like Factor 2) but did not adversely affect viability in primary human aortic endothelial cells. Computer-assisted analyses of molecules with potential to bind bradykinin receptor B2 (BKRB2), suggested a potential role for aspirin as a BK antagonist. When tested in our <i>in vitro</i> model, we found evidence that aspirin can blunt cell signaling and endothelial dysfunction caused by bradykinin in these cells. Interference with interactions of spike protein or bradykinin with endothelial cells may serve as an important strategy to stabilize microvascular homeostasis in COVID-19 disease. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> SARS-CoV-2 causes complex effects on microvascular homeostasis that potentially contribute to organ dysfunction and coagulopathies. SARS-CoV-2 binds to, and causes downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cells that it infects. It is thought that reduced ACE2 enzymatic activity can contribute to inflammation and pathology in the lung. Our studies add to this understanding by providing evidence that spike protein alone can mediate adverse effects on vascular cells. Understanding these mechanisms of pathogenesis may provide rationale for interventions that could limit microvascular events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Panigrahi, Goswami, Ferrari, Antonelli, Bazdar, Gilmore, Freeman, Lederman, Sieg","https://doi.org/10.1128/Spectrum.00735-21","20211222","COVID-19; endothelial cells; spike protein","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24312,""
"When health care workers became patients with COVID-19: A qualitative study","This study aimed to describe the experiences of nurses and other health care workers who were infected with coronavirus disease 2019. An empirical phenomenological approach was used. Sixteen participants were recruited in Wuhan using purposive and snowball sampling. Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted by telephone in February 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed following Colaizzi's method. Two themes emerged: (1) Intense emotional distress since becoming infected. Participants were fearful of spreading the virus to family and overwhelmed by a lack of information, experienced uncertainty and worried about treatment, felt lonely during isolation and reported moral distress about inadequate health care staffing. (2) Coping strategies were needed. They tried their best to address negative psychological reactions using their professional knowledge and gaining support from others and community resources. Preparedness for catastrophic events and providing timely and accurate information are major considerations in government policy development, related to pandemics and adequacy of health care personnel. Mental health resources and support, both short- and long-term should be anticipated for health care providers to alleviate their fear and anxiety.","Du, Liu, Chen, Wang, Fang, Chen, Chen, Zhang, Liu, Yang, Guo, Luo","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.13034","20211222","coronavirus disease 2019; experience; health care providers; nurses; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24313,""
"Determinants of Hesitancy Towards COVID-19 Vaccines in State of Kuwait: An Exploratory Internet-Based Survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has wrought havoc upon healthcare and economic systems worldwide. COVID-19 vaccines considered a beacon of hope for normal life to return. We wished to understand the willingness of people in Kuwait to be vaccinated against COVID-19. An online, exploratory, cross-sectional study was conducted on 16-18 January 2021 using a validated structured questionnaire to collect data from adults aged 18 years or older living in Kuwait by applying a ""snowball sampling"" method. A total of 7274 people received an online link of the survey on their smartphone or computer, and 6943 people enrolled in this study (95.4%). Kuwaiti nationals represented 79.7% of the study cohort, 54.8% were aged Ã¢â€°Â¥40 years, and 66.7% were females. Hesitancy against a COVID-19 vaccine was remarkably high (74.3%), with 50.8% not planning to take it and 23.5% not sure about taking it. The overall mean perception score was 3.4 Ã‚Â± 2.8, with 66.8% having a negative attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the factors affecting the decision to take a COVID-19 vaccine was done. The decision to take a COVID-19 vaccine was significantly positively associated with younger age (OR = 1.219), being male (2.169), having a higher education level (1.362), vaccinated against seasonal influenza previously (2.706), being a non-Kuwaiti (1.329), being a healthcare worker (1.366), and working in the private sector (1.228). Options to encourage future COVID-19 vaccination were more studies showing the vaccine to be safe and efficacious (68.6%), physician recommendation (41.8%), mandatory travel requirements (39.8%), if a family or friend vaccinated (34.9%) and compulsory by government (33.1%) or for employment (29.8%). Our data suggest that considerable vaccine hesitancy persists despite the widespread availability of highly efficacious and safe COVID-19 vaccines.","Al-Ayyadhi, Ramadan, Al-Tayar, Al-Mathkouri, Al-Awadhi","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S338520","20211223","COVID-19; barriers; hesitancy; vaccine acceptance; vaccine uptake","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24314,""
"Factors Associated with Turnover Intention Among Healthcare Workers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic in China","This study assessed the prevalence of turnover intention and explored associated factors on turnover intention among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July to February 13th to 20th, 2020, in 31 provinces of mainland China. A total of 1403 healthcare workers were recruited. Hierarchical logistic regressions were used to identify potential factors associated with turnover intention among Chinese health care workers. The prevalence of turnover intention among healthcare workers was 10.1% during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Results of hierarchical regression revealed that working in Grade II hospital (OR = 1.78), technician (OR = 0.30), daily working hours over 12 h (OR = 2.92), frequency of mask replacement between 4 and 8 h (OR = 3.51), refuse volunteer to frontline (OR = 1.68), patient-physician relation unchanged (OR = 1.73), depression (OR = 2.21) and lower social support (OR = 1.75) were significantly associated with the risk of turnover intention. Additionally, healthcare worker's psychosocial syndemic (OR = 6.13) was positively associated with turnover intention. Turnover intention is relatively prevalent among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and the factors contributing to turnover intention were complex and varied. Early screening of high-risk groups for turnover intention among healthcare workers and more psychosocial health care and physical protection are needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.","Hou, Pei, Yang, Lu, Yan, Gao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S318106","20211223","COVID-19; China; healthcare workers; turnover intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24315,""
"Effect of Subjective Economic Status During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Depressive Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation Among South Korean Adolescents","This study identified the relationships between perceived household economic status and household economic downturn due to COVID-19 and adolescent depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Participants for this study were extracted from the 13th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey, conducted from August to November 2020. The participants comprised 54,948 middle and high school students selected by stratified random cluster sampling. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were 25.2% and 10.9%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower perceived household economic status significantly predicted higher prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Participants who perceived that their household economic status had declined because of COVID-19 were more likely to have experienced depression and suicidal ideation. These results were similar regardless of the participants' perceptions of household economic status. This study found that in the ongoing pandemic, there is a need for an active mental health promotion program for adolescents from low-income households, especially those who experienced a recent decline in the household economy.","Han, Song","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S326660","20211223","COVID-19; adolescent; depression; economic condition; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24316,""
"Frontline Nurses' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Associated Predictive Factors During the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Central, Uganda","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ugandan healthcare system was already under severe strain due to a lack of human resources, poor working conditions, and poor management. At the center of these challenges are nurses, the backbone of the health system. This study investigated post-traumatic stress disorder and associated predictive factors during the second wave of COVID-19 among frontline nurses in the country. This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted among 601 nurses between May and June 2021. Post-traumatic stress disorder was assessed using PTSD Checklist-Civilian. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the factors predicting PTSD. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant at 95% CI. The estimated prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 65.7%. In the multivariate logistic regression, the predictive factors of PTSD among the study participants were social support (AOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 034-0.60; p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001), fear of getting infected with COVID-19 (AOR: 3.10; 95% CI: 2.17-4.43; p &lt; 0.001) and increased workload (AOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.16-2.34; p &lt; 0.001). The results of the study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of front-line nurses. Assessing PTSD among nurses may increase the understanding of COVID-19 induced mental health issues. Identifying the risk factors like lack of social support and heavy workload and providing treatment is essential given that various waves of COVID-19 seem inevitable. Supportive strategies like counseling should be provided to the nurses to prevent or manage PTSD.","Kabunga, Okalo","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S340771","20211223","COVID-19; Uganda; frontline nurses; post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24317,""

"Assessing vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic through the analysis of microblogging content","In recent years we have witnessed a growing interest in the analysis of social media data under different perspectives, since these online platforms have become the preferred tool for generating and sharing content across different users organized into virtual communities, based on their common interests, needs, and perceptions. In the current study, by considering a collection of social textual contents related to COVID-19 gathered on the Twitter microblogging platform in the period between August and December 2020, we aimed at evaluating the possible effects of some critical factors related to the pandemic on the mental well-being of the population. In particular, we aimed at investigating potential lexicon identifiers of vulnerability to psychological distress in digital social interactions with respect to distinct COVID-related scenarios, which could be ""at risk"" from a psychological discomfort point of view. Such scenarios have been associated with peculiar topics discussed on Twitter. For this purpose, two approaches based on a ""top-down"" and a ""bottom-up"" strategy were adopted. In the top-down approach, three potential scenarios were initially selected by medical experts, and associated with topics extracted from the Twitter dataset in a hybrid unsupervised-supervised way. On the other hand, in the bottom-up approach, three topics were extracted in a totally unsupervised way capitalizing on a Twitter dataset filtered according to the presence of keywords related to vulnerability to psychological distress, and associated with at-risk scenarios. The identification of such scenarios with both approaches made it possible to capture and analyze the potential psychological vulnerability in critical situations.","Viviani, Crocamo, Mazzola, Bartoli, CarrÃƒÂ , Pasi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2021.06.044","20211223","Mental health; Psychological distress; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social network analysis; Vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24319,""
"The Sexual Long COVID (SLC): Erectile Dysfunction as a Biomarker of Systemic Complications for COVID-19 Long Haulers","Long term complications of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, involve many organ systems, dramatically worsening the quality of life, and finally contributing to impaired physical functioning. Despite the presence of well-identified pathogenetic mechanisms, the effect of ""Long COVID"" on sexual health has been only marginally addressed. To provide coverage of the current literature on long COVID, its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and relevance for erectile function. Comprehensive review of literature pertaining to the epidemiology and pathophysiology of long COVID, and its relevance for erectile function. Symptoms of long COVID are highly prevalent and involve almost all systems of the human body, with a plethora of clinical manifestations which range from minor nuisances to life-threatening conditions. ""Brain fog"" and fatigue are the most common complaints, although other neuropsychiatric complications, including sensory dysfunctions, anxiety, depression, and cerebrovascular events have also been reported. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems are also affected, with dyspnea, pulmonary fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and myocarditis occurring in some COVID long haulers. A subset of patients might develop endocrine manifestations, including onset of diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, and hypogonadism. Overall, long COVID features many complications which can impair erectile function by multiple pathogenetic mechanisms, and which could require tailored treatment: (i) careful investigation and management from the sexual medicine expert are therefore much needed, (ii) and future research on this topic is warranted. in COVID-19 long haulers, several complications can adversely affect erectile function which, upon future tailored studies, could be used as biomarker for the severity of the long COVID disease and for its follow-up.

"Prevalence and Predictors of PTSD During the Initial Stage of COVID-19 Epidemic among Female College Students in China","College students are vulnerable and may experience high stress due to COVID-19, especially girls. This study aims to identify posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related factors among the target population during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the initial phase of COVID-19 epidemic (February 23 to March 5, 2020), 2205 female college students from six provinces in mainland China were enrolled in this study and completed the online survey about the cognitive status of COVID-19, including the Impact of Event Scale-6, the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale and a self-developed 10-item Perceived threat scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed using SPSS software to explore the determinants of PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were prevalent in female college students, and 34.20% met the cut-off for PTSD. Self-reported fair or poor health (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.22-2.59), high concern about COVID-19 (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.35-2.03), beliefs that ""COVID-19 can cause a global outbreak"" (AOR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.02-1.56), the perception of ""risk of infection"" (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 2.16-2.81), beliefs that ""closed management"" and ""COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern"" would have an impact, and the fear of ""impact on life planning"" were all positively associated with PTSD (AOR = 1.37, 1.22, and 1.29, respectively); however, perceived social support from family (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.93) was negatively associated with PTSD. Among the significant variables at the bivariate level, multivariate logistic regression revealed that the greatest protector for PTSD was the high knowledge score (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.90), while had confirmed cases among relatives and friends (AOR = 7.70, 95% CI: 1.28-46.25) was the strongest predictor of PTSD. In summary, PTSD symptoms were prevalent among female college students in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Targeting vulnerable populations to improve their knowledge about COVID-19 and create an atmosphere of social support would be beneficial. Moreover, the joint efforts from family, school administrators, and policymakers are essential to improve the mental health of the female students during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Si, Su, Jiang, Wang, Gu, Ma, Li, Zhang, Ren, Liu, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211059953","20211222","COVID-19; China; PTSD; female college students; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","",24321,""
