"Internet-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for the Prevention, Treatment and Relapse Prevention of Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review","Background and ObjectivesEating disorders (EDs) are undertreated worldwide. In the UK the lag between recognition of symptoms and treatment ranges from about 15 months to in excess of two years. Internet-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) could be a viable alternative to face-to-face Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) that avoids the negative impacts of delayed interventions. Based on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) this systematic review investigated the effectiveness of minimally guided self-help ICBT, without face-to-face therapy, for the prevention, treatment and relapse prevention of all types of EDs in adults.

MethodsThe electronic databases MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched between 1991 to 2021. Inclusion criteria specified RCTs with ICBT versus inactive comparison groups. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used for quality assessments. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analyses were conducted.

ResultsFindings showed medium and large significant beneficial effect sizes for the prevention and treatment studies, respectively, whereas relapse prevention yielded mainly small non-significant beneficial effect sizes. Only the treatment studies reached clinical significance and cognitive symptoms improved more than behavioural symptoms.

ConclusionsThis systematic review reinforces the vital need to provide evidence-based Internet interventions at times when face-to-face treatment is not an option as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although ICBT is a promising intervention for eating disorders in adults and may be more effective than face-to-face CBT for treating cognitive symptoms further high-quality ED RCTs are required to increase the evidence-base and enable more precise meta-analyses to reach definitive conclusions.

HighlightsO_LIFindings showed medium and large significant beneficial effect sizes for the prevention and treatment studies, respectively, whereas relapse prevention yielded mainly small non-significant beneficial effect sizes.
C_LIO_LIFor the treatment studies, 35% of effect estimates were clinically important. None of the effect estimates for either the prevention or the relapse prevention studies reached clinical significance.
C_LIO_LIThere were statistically significant improvements on comorbid depression and anxiety for the treatment programmes.
C_LIO_LICognitive symptoms improved more than behavioural symptoms and it is suggested that ICBT may be more effective than face-to-face CBT for treating cognitive symptoms.

"HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING DIALYSIS DURING PANDEMIC COVID-19","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have complex functional and social changes that affect their quality of life (QoL), leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, mortality and overall morbidity. Several studies showed that general QoL worsened after dialysis initiation but improved by 12 weeks. The influence of coronavirus (COVID-19) among pre-dialysis CKD patients starting dialysis during pandemic COVID-19 is challenging and still largely unexplored. To evaluate the quality of life in patients with ESRD before and after initiating dialysis during pandemic COVID-19, in Constanta County, a south-eastern Romanian region. METHOD: We assessed 59 patients (mean age = 61.65year Â± 11.36, Male : Female = 3:1, 13.79% employee) with ESRD before and after dialysis started (T1-12 weeks and T2-24 weeks), using KDQOL-36TM, in the interval of time of 1 year (May 2020-May 2021). RESULTS: QoL was severely affected in patients with diabetes and hypertension, especially because of diet restrictions (58.6%, P &lt; 0.01), fatigue (67.5%, P &lt; 0.01), concerns about the kidney disease (72.4%, P &lt; 0.05) and permanent need for medical services (48.6%, P = NS). Most of the patients required acute initiation of haemodialysis on CVC (66.1%) due to uraemic manifestations and late referral, 34.4% started planned haemodialysis on AV fistula and 8.47% started planned peritoneal dialysis. An overall improvement of QoL was seen both in patients with urgent and planned dialysis initiation, in women group less than in males (P &lt; 0.05). Among dialysis patients at T2, we have found significantly lower levels for mean Mental Component Summary (MCS), calculated as 45.9 Â± 14.1, about 3.1 points less than the majority of other studies. The following mental health-related symptoms were claimed during the COVID-19 pandemic 'second and third waves': feeling sad, worrying, feeling nervous and trouble falling asleep, even though dialysis patients seemed less impacted by social distancing measures. CONCLUSION: The initiation of dialysis was an important factor in improving the QoL in our ESRD patients and the type of dialysis and planned initiation contribute substantially to the patient's perception of the disease and influence the main psychosocial parameters of QoL. COVID-19 pandemic affected the QoL of patients that started dialysis in the established interval of time, especially the mean MCS score, probably associated with the high morbidity and mortality of Romanian ESRD and dialysis patients.","Pana, C.; Tuta, L.

"HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG PATIENTS WITH ANCA VASCULITIS","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a debilitating disease that can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess the longitudinal quality of life amongst those diagnosed with AAV using the EQ-5D instrument, which allows for calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs.) METHOD: A total of 343 patients with AAV participated in this study, of which 191 (55.7%) were male, resulting in 2746 episodes. The EQ-5D-5L standardised instrument was used to evaluate health-related quality of life in the domains of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression and to generate a summary index score. Overall health was also rated using a visual analogue scale (0-100). EQ-5D questionnaires were completed during routine nephrology clinic attendances and through a vasculitis patient support smartphone app. We used a random effects model to control for multiple entries relating to individual patients. RESULTS: A lower quality of life was seen amongst those with AAV (median index value 0.80, overall population average 0.856). The mean visual analogue scale score was 75.6 Â± 17.3 (overall population average 82.8, Fig. 1). Patients' pain and discomfort level (mean 1.95) was most affected while self-care (mean 1.33) was least affected (Fig. 1). An increase in BVAS tightly correlated with a reduction in quality of life. Using the random effects model, the index score was seen to decrease with increasing age with a 2.7% reduction in index score per decade. A 7% reduction in index score was seen during periods of disease activity compared with periods of remission. Patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis had an 8% reduction in index score. A reduced quality of life was seen following COVID-19 lockdown with a 5% reduction in index score seen. Using a median survival rate of 6.16 years for patients with small vessel vasculitis, we calculated the QALYs for this population as 4.9 years. CONCLUSION: We have defined for the first time the EQ-5D index value over the full disease course in patients with AAV. Notably, we have identified a reduction in quality of life during periods of disease activity. Other studies have demonstrated a reduction in quality of life during active disease using the AAV-PRO questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36. A decrease in work productivity has also been noted. Previously reported mean index values of 0.72 and 0.76 were lower than our observed values, although both are significantly reduced compared with population norms. In conclusion, this research highlights the negative impact of AAV on patients' lives.","Riogh, E. N.

"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEIVED STRESS WITH ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SLEEP QUALITY, INSOMNIA AND DRUG ADHERENCE IN PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sleep disorders, depression and anxiety are commonly reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Public health emergencies such as pandemics can also increase these psychosocial distresses. Early diagnosis and treatment of these disorders will substantially affect patients' quality of life and medication adherence. The aim of this study was to evaluate both medication non-adherence and the incidence of perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep quality and insomnia during the COVID pandemic in patients with SLE. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive survey study. A total of 211 participants, including 160 SLE patients aged 18 years and older and 51 healthy volunteers who were similar in age and gender, were included. A questionnaire of socio-demographics and COVID-19 status, Medication Compliance Reporting Scale (MARS-5), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADA and HAD-D), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scales was assessed. The participants were interviewed face to face, and the answers were recorded by the researcher. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 41.85 Â± 12.97 years and 142 (88.7%) of the patients were female. There was no significant difference between the patient and control groups in terms of the history of COVID-19 infection, symptoms and hospitalization. Fifty-nine (36.9%) patients had high perceived stress, 16 (10.0%) had anxiety, 45 (28.1%) had depression, 77 (48.1%) had poor sleep quality and 62 (38.8%) patients had insomnia. PSS (23.64 Â± 7.86 versus 19.73 Â± 4.80, P = .001), HAD-D (5.60 Â± 3.40 versus 4.08 Â± 2.21, P = .003), PSQI (6.31 Â± 3.62 versus 4.43 Â± 2.20, P = .001) and ISI (6.81 Â± 4.98 versus 4.53 Â± 2.83, P = .002) scores were significantly higher in the patient group than controls. Patients with PSS score = 25 were categorized as patients with a high PSS score. Presence of anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and insomnia were significantly higher in patients with a high PSS score. Medication non-adherence was detected in 79 (49.4%) of the patients. Interestingly, there was no difference in MARS-5 scores between high and low PSS groups. Comparison of baseline characteristics and clinical data of the patients according to PSS score is shown in Table 1. The high PSS score was positively correlated with HAD-A, HAD-D, PSQI and ISI scores. Regression analysis revealed that high perceived stress is an independent predictor of depression [Exp(ÃŸ) 95% CI: 1.488 (1.245-1.779), P &lt; .001], and anxiety [Exp(ÃŸ) 95% CI: 1.235 (1.026-1.487), P = .026]. CONCLUSION: SLE patients demonstrated increased levels of perceived stress, depression, poor sleep quality and insomnia compared to the healthy population during the COVID-19 pandemic. SLE patients with high perceived stress had more depression, anxiety, poor sleep quality and insomnia than those without. It needs to be determined whether these findings will have an impact on patient outcomes during long-term follow-up.","Gokmen, K.; Atas, D. B.; Tugcu, M.; Velioglu, A.; Arikan, I.

"ATYPICAL HAEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19: CASE REPORT","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Renal manifestations are common in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report here the case of a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with the clinical picture of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). METHOD: Case report RESULTS: Our case is a 31-year-old man with a nasopharyngeal swab with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 positive, who was hospitalized in the Clinic of Infectious Diseases. His medical history had a respiratory illness of 7-day evolution characterized by cough, fever, dyspnoea, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and non-bloody diarrhoea, and decreased urine output with dark colour urine. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed few rounded ground-glass opacities. Laboratory tests at admission revealed the following: (i) acute kidney injury stage 3 with a serum creatinine of 3.85 mg/dL (basal value 0.9 mg/dL);serum urea 221 mg/dL. His urinary volume in the first 24 h of hospitalization was 800 mL. (ii) Severe haemolytic anaemia with haemoglobin (Hgb) level of 3.7 g/dL, and peripheral smear showing large number of schistocytes, haptoglobin &lt;10 mg/dL and indirect bilirubin 9.7 mg/dL, direct coombs testing was negative;reticulocyte count 8.9%. (iii) Severe thrombocytopaenia with platelet count of 25 000/ÂµL, prothrombin time 45%, international normalized ratio 1.7, D-dimer 1082 ng/dL and fibrinogen 880 mg/dL. Increased blood levels of enzymes and inflammatory markers were present: lactate dehydrogenase 1867 U/L and protein C reactive 9.1 mg/dL. Electrolyte disturbances characterized by hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcaemia and severe metabolic acidosis. Dynamic changes of laboratory data are presented in Table 1. The usual liver panel tests, alkaline phosphatase, <U+03B3> -glutamyl transferase and albuminemia were normal. Toxic hepatitis was excluded. Hepatobiliary and spleen imaging (ultrasonography) was normal. ELISA serologic tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C virus and cytomegalovirus were negative. Serological and virological tests for hepatitis A, B, C, HIV and CMV were negative. Stool was negative for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The results of antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth-muscle antibodies were negative, C3 serum level was mildly depressed (82 mg/dL;normal range 88- 201 mg/dL) and C4 serum level was normal (20 mg/dL;normal range 10-44 mg/dL). ADAMTS13 activity was 90% on day 10. He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, intravenous dexamethasone and supportive therapy. One week from admission, renal function recovered, and 1 week after intravascular haemolysis and thrombocytopaenia recovered. The patient was hospitalized for 21 days.

"Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine administered by electrophysiologists during COVID-19 pandemic compared with propofol administered by anesthesiologists for ablation of atrial fibrillation","Background: COVID-19 pandemic, limiting the availability of anesthesiologists, has impacted heavily on the organization of invasive cardiac procedures such as transcatheter atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Purpose: We compared the safety and efficacy of deep sedation with dexmedetomidine administered by electrophysiologists without anesthesiologist supervision, against the standard protocol performed with propofol. Methods: We retrospectively included all AF ablation procedures performed in 2020: 23 patients sedated with 1% propofol (2 ml bolus followed by infusion starting at 1 mg/Kg/h), 26 patients with dexmedetomidine (infusion starting at 0.7 mcg/Kg/h). Both groups additionally received 1 mcg/Kg of midazolam as a single bolus and 0.05 mg single boluses of fentanyl prior to ablation on each pair of pulmonary veins (PV). Primary outcomes were oxygen desaturation (&lt; 90%) or need for assisted ventilation/intubation, bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 45 bpm) and persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg). Results: Baseline characteristics and hemodynamic variables did not differ between the two groups (all p &gt; 0.05). In 8/23 (35%) patients propofol infusion velocity reduction was necessary to maintain the hemodynamic values, compared to 7/26 (27%) with dexmedetomidine. Inter-group comparison of hemodynamic variables during the procedure showed no statistically significant difference, despite a trend in favor of dexmedetomidine (3 respiratory depressions and 3 persistent hypotension episodes with propofol vs. 0 with dexmedetomidine;p = 0.057). Conclusion: Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine administered by electrophysiologists without anesthesiologist supervision is safe and effective for AF transcatheter ablation. A trend towards a lower incidence of hypotension and respiratory depression was noted when compared to propofol.","Ebrille, E.; Lucciola, M.

"Outcomes from a digital cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation programme delivered in Ireland during COVID 19","Background & Aim: COVID 19 has accelerated the uptake and acceptance of digital health tools for the prevention and management of Cardiovascular Disease. With health systems being urged to learn from the pandemic and to reassess how they will deliver services in future, robust audit and evaluation of digital interventions are required to inform best practice. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a digital CVD prevention and rehabilitation programme which was established during COVID 19 to provide cardiac patients with efficient and timely access to a home-based, structured, comprehensive programme of care. Methods: Developed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team (Nurse Prescriber, Physiotherapist, Dietitian, Cardiologist), the core components of this 12 week programme included, behavioural change support, lifestyle modification, medical risk factor management and electronic prescribing of cardio-protective medication. To support self-management, patients were provided with a Fitbit, blood pressure monitor and a workbook to support goal setting and overall tracking of progress. Patients were given access to a bespoke web-based platform and invited to attend weekly (2hr) group-based sessions, which included an exercise component and an interactive educational workshop. Results: Over a 4 month period, 105 patients were referred with an uptake rate of 73% (n=77). Of these, 97% (n=75) enrolled in the programme, with an 85% (n=64) completion rate. Significant improvements in CVD risk factors were observed between initial and end of programme assessment. The proportion of patients meeting guideline-recommended physical activity targets increased from 14 to 82% (p&lt;0.001), mean BMI (kg/m2) reduced from 28.7 to 27.7 (p&lt;0.001), mean Mediterranean diet score improved from 5.2 to 7.3 (p&lt;0.001), and anxiety and depression levels =8 (Hospital Anxiety and Depression score) both reduced by more than 50% (p&lt;0.001). The proportions achieving the recommended blood pressure (&lt;130/80 mmHg) and LDL cholesterol targets (&lt;1.4 mmol/L) increased from 24 to 68% (p&lt;0.001) and 14 to 41% (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusion: Outcomes from this programme demonstrate that digital CVD prevention and rehabilitation programmes can achieve the recommended lifestyle, medical and therapeutic targets associated with reduced CVD events and improved health outcomes.

"Physical and psychological reconditioning in long covid syndrome patients: results of a structured physical exercise program","Background: Long Covid Syndrome (LCS) is used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection. Natural history and treatments of this syndrome is still poorly understood. In literature there is currently a lack of data on the real effectiveness of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program based on structured physical exercise (SPE) in these patients. Purpose: To evaluate safety, effectiveness and feasibility of a structured individualized rehabilitation program in improving physical and psychological parameters in patients with LCS. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with LCS (19 males, mean age 57 years) underwent an accurate medical screening process, body composition evaluation, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), muscular strength assessment, quality of life (QoL), psychological assessment and counselling, before and after a 12-sessions SPE program. Results: At baseline, all LCS patients showed severe impairments in physical performance, QoL and psychological parameters. No adverse effects and dropouts were observed during training session. After the rehabilitation program, significant improvement in CPET parameters, upper and lower limb muscular strength, perceived physical and mental health, body composition, depression and anxiety and Covid residual symptoms was observed. Conclusions: The present study confirms severe impairment of patients with LCS and suggest that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program based on SPE could promote their physical and psychological recovery.","Palermi, S.; Compagno, S.; Pescatore, V.; Brugin, E.; Tegon, G.; Sarto, M.; Marin, R.; Calzavara, V.; Nizzetto, M.; Scevola, M.; Albertin, C.; Biffi, A.; Giada, F.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwac056.218","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Preventive Cardiology; 29(SUPPL 1):i311, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34435,""
"Feasibility and preliminary effects of technology-assisted interventions in hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (TecHCR): A pilot randomised controlled trial","Background: As COVID-19 pandemic continues, using technologies within cardiac rehabilitation facilitates access to care and reduces the frequency of direct contact with vulnerable cardiac patients. We aimed to assess the feasibility of technology-assisted interventions in hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (TecHCR) and preliminarily evaluate its effects on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: Between February 2021 to May 2021, a total of 28 patients with CHD were recruited and randomised to receive a 12-week TecHCR programme (n = 14) or a 12-week conventional, centre-based programme (n = 14). The TecHCR group received three center-based, supervised exercise training sessions. Participants were instructed to wear a fitness tracker watch for exercise self-monitoring at home environment, and the exercise data were shared through a web-based application for remote monitoring by the intervener. Participants received six audio-visual educational videos via a messaging application and a weekly video/telephone call follow-up. Self- Efficacy for Exercise (ESE), Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP II), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), exercise capacity and cardiovascular health outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 12th week on completion of the programme. Generalised estimating equations analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes between groups. Results: Out of 28 participants (56.46Â±12.98 years old;1 female), 67.9% had percutaneous coronary intervention and 28.6% had coronary bypass grafting surgery. Among 14 participants in the TecHCR group, three dropped out due to: 1) fear to attend face-to-face supervised exercise training during high daily COVID-19 cases;2) infected with COVID-19 and 3) found a job in overseas. Eleven participants in the TecHCR group attended all video/telephone call sessions, nine participants completed 3 supervised exercise training sessions and nine participants adhered to the weekly exercise recommendations. No treatment-related adverse events were reported. TecHCR was non-inferior to conventional, centre-based program on exercise self-efficacy, exercise capacity and cardiovascular health outcomes. TecHCR group showed significantly greater improvement in health-promoting behavior when compared with the control group (p =0.013) at post-intervention. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility in recruitment and implementation of TecHCR as an alternative delivery mode and could enhance health-promoting behavior among patients with CHD. Implications: The TecHCR program provides accessible interventions to patients without frequent visits to the outpatient centre. A full-scale randomised controlled trial is needed to confirm the effectiveness of TecHCR.","Chong, M. S.; Sit, J. W. H.; Choi, K. C.; Suhaimi, A.; Chair, S.

"Coronavirus-related stress, anxiety, and obsessive thinking in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID19 pandemic","Background: The coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic has disrupted the provision of health care, including cardiac rehabilitation. Reduced healthcare provision has been associated with reduced accessibility, wheares patients' perspectives - such as COVID19-related anxiety, stress and obsessive thinking - have been less thouroghly addressed. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of COVID19-related anxiety, stress and obsessive thinking in consecutive patients undergoing outpatient cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction at two centres - a general hospital catering a predominantly rural area and a university hospital in an urban area. From April to October 2021 we captured patients' clinical and socio-economic characteristics, and resposes to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as well as to three dedicated COVID19-related questionnaires - the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale and a customized COVID-19 Stress Scale. Results: We included 109 patients (mean age 59Â±10 years, 20% women). Fifteen (13.8%) and eleven (11%) patients reached a HADS treshold for depression and anxiety, respectively. Pateints expressed most concenrs regarding the safety of COVID19 vaccinces (60.6%) on the COVID19 Stress Scale, sleeping disturbances (14.8%) on the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and fear of interacting with infected people (30.3%) on the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale. No significant differences were observed between respondents from the general and the university hospital.

"Physical activity and psychological status of hypertensive and healthy individuals: in the era of COVID-19","Background/Introduction: Hypertension is an important and common reason of cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension can prevent, delay and/or manage with lifestyle modifications like regular physical activity participiation, stress management. During COVID-19 pandemic physical inactivity, increased stress and anxiety levels impair disease management of hypertensive individuals and becomes a serious risk factor for healthy individuals. Purpose: We aimed to investigate and compare physical activity, anxiety and depression level of hypertensive and healthy individuals. Methods: Forty hypertensive and forty healthy individuals were included in the study (Mean age: 51,15Â±6,96 years and 49,75Â±8,41 years, respectively). Patients informed about the study and invited during their cardiology visit and called by a physiotherapist in lockdown periods. In phone call, working status, quarantina compliance, sociodemographic status were asked. Physical activity levels were assessed with International Physical Activity Questionnnaire-Long Version (IPAQ), anxiety and depression levels were examined with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). Patients categorized as inactive, minimally active and active according to METs results of IPAQ and classified as increased depression and/or anxiety according to HAD results. Results: Working status, quarantina compliance and gender were similar between groups (p&gt;0,05). Anxiety and depression scores were similar but number of people who had increased depression were higher in hypertensive group. Considering physical activity, transport, vigorous domestic activities, leisure time vigorous activities and total physical activity levels were statistically different between groups (p&lt;0,01, p=0,002, p=0,002,respectively) and hypertensive individuals were less active. When we compared physical activity categorization, in hypertensive group 12,5% were active, 47,5% were minimally active and 40% were sedentary and in healthy group 32,5% were active, 50% were minimally active and 17,5% were sedentary and physical activity status were statistically significant (p=0,029). Conclusion(s): According to our results, hypertensives were more inactive and deprressed than healthy controls. Quarantine periods become very inactive periods for all populations but this is very crucial for especially risky populations. To prevent upcoming cardiovascular diseases and complications of hypertension physical activity and psychosocial support can implement by healthcare providers.","Karaduz, B.; Sener, Y.

"Home-based cardiac rehabilitation can reduce anxiety and depression in heart failure patients","Introduction: The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in physical and mental health and has become a major challenge for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. CR is an essential component in the treatment of heart failure (HF), as it improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life, as well as reducing hospitalization rates. COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation, and the CR centers were closed. Center-based CR requires the patient to travel to the hospital, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk population. In this context, home-based CR can be an excellent strategy to reduce the physical and mental consequences of the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To test the effectiveness of a home-based CR program on cardiorespiratory fitness and anxiety and depression levels in individuals with HF during covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Forty-two individuals with HF (age: 61.3Â±12.0;LVEF: 37.5Â±11.2) were included in this study. The exercise training program consisted in 12 weeks of combined exercise training (2x/week;60min/day, 60-80% VO2peak), with 4 supervised exercise sessions in the hospital context and the remaining at home. Patients were monitored using a heart rate monitor and weekly phone calls. The following parameters were evaluated: cardiorespiratory fitness through the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and anxiety and depression levels through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: After the home-based CR program, there was a significant increase in the 6MWT of 49 meters (95%IC: 38 to 60;p&lt;0.001) and a significant decrease in anxiety levels of -1.12 points (95%CI: - 2.163 to -0.075 p=0.036). No significant changes were found in depression levels (p=0.954). Furthermore, the improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness were significantly associated with the reduction in the levels of anxiety (r= -0.281;p=0.028) and depression (r=: -0.278;p=0.030). Conclusions: The home-based CR program was able to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and this improvement was associated with a decrease in anxiety and depression levels in individuals with HF. The results suggest that home-based CR can be an important strategy to minimize the physical and mental impact induced by social isolation imposed by COVID-19 pandemic in HF patients.","Gois, P.; Magalhaes, S.; Alexandre, A.; Barreira, A.; Fernandes, P.; Ribeiro, F.; Schmidt, C.; Santos, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwac056.028","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Preventive Cardiology; 29(SUPPL 1):i40, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34439,""
"Relationship between the spread of coronavirus disease 2019, social frailty and depressive symptoms in patients with heart failure","Background: Owing to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people have refrained from going out unnecessarily and have been maintaining social distance. These new lifestyle approaches have affected people physically, psychologically, and socially. Patients with heart failure (HF) are more likely to have social frailty, physical frailty, cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms, and an overlap of these conditions leads to adverse events. Therefore, multi-domain assessment and understanding of the condition of patients with HF are important for disease management. The spread of COVID-19 is a predicted risk factor for these events, but its impact in patients with HF has not been investigated. Purpose: We investigated whether the spread of COVID-19 is associated with the development of the multi-domain of frailty in patients with HF. Methods: Patients who were independent in their daily activities before admission were included in the study. The presence of social frailty (Makizako's five items), physical frailty (Fried phenotype model), cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog), and depressive symptoms (the Patient Health Questionnaire-2) in patients with HF were assessed at hospital discharge. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the development of the multi-domain of frailty in patients with HF. Results: We included 482 patients in this study. Median patient age was 74 years, and 64.5% were male. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the spread of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the development of social frailty (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.30) and depressive symptoms (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.27) but not with the development of physical frailty (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.51-3.02) and cognitive impairment (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 0.80-3.73). Conclusion: The spread of COVID-19 was associated with the development of social frailty and depressive symptoms in patients with HF. Evaluation of social frailty and depressive symptoms during hospitalization would support disease management and understand their social and psychological conditions specific to the spread of COVID-19.

"INNOVATIVE TELEMONITORED MODEL OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION IN SECONDARY PREVENTION DURING THE QUARANTINE","Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic induced the emanation of extraordinary measures like quarantine, that can be considered a risk factor for both physical and mental health in the population. In particular, gym's closure and the need to stay home didn't allow people to perform physical activity easily, with a consequent worsening of cardiovascular risk factors. During quarantine some general recommendations have been disseminated, but little is known about specific guidelines for home-based exercise prescription in patients with cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop home-based physical exercise programs for cardiac patients referred to the Center for Exercise Science and Sports of University of Ferrara. Methods: On the basis of exercise capacity obtained from the last functional evaluation, performed in presence before the closure, three structured workouts were realized following the guidelines. They are composed as follows: warm-up, strenght and balance exercises alternate to indoor walking, cool-down. Patients received an explicative iconographic via e-mail or smartphone. Some domiciliary sessions were supervised by an operator through video connection. Results: All patients showed excellent compliance with the proposed program. Adherence has been verified through biweekly recalls. No adverse events occurred. Conclusions: Telemonitored exercise prescription in cardiac outpatients was effective and safe, helping to prevent negative consequences of the abrupt cessation of physical activity due to COVID-19 pandemic. These evidence could be useful even after the end of pandemic, for all those patients that are less likely to participate in traditional cardiovascular rehabilitation programs because of difficulties in reaching facilities or leaving home.","Lordi, R.; Veronese, S.; Piccinini, A.; Ferro, A.; Zerbini, V.; Piva, T.; Raisi, A.; Mandini, S.; Grazzi, G.; Sassone, B.; Pasanisi, G.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/suac012.356","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Heart Journal, Supplement; 24(SUPPL C):C195-C196, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34441,""
"A CASE OF TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY IN SARS-COV-2 INFECTION","Cardiovascular complications are a frequent occurrence in Sars-CoV-2 infection. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a possible cause of transient ST segment elevation (1- 3% of total cases) and is characterized by a reversible left ventricular dysfunction with coronary arteries free from critical stenosis. The predominant echocardiographic pattern is an akinesia of the mid-apical myocardial segments with preserved kinetics of the basal segments. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy showed a marked increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three factors mainly contribute to the onset of cardiomyopathy in patients with COVID-19: cytokine storm, adrenergic hyperactivation and microvascular dysfunction. A 79-year-old woman was hospitalized in the Pneumology department of our hospital for bilateral interstitial pneumonia Sars-CoV-2 related. In remote medical history: in 2010 diagnosis of breast cancer with negative follow-up for disease recovery, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and syndrome of reduced mobility as a result of a previous ischemic stroke. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation with c-PAP was started and, for the detection of anterolateral electrocardiographic anomalies (diffuse symmetrical negative T waves) and an increase in myocardionecrosis markers, echocardiographic evaluation was performed, which revealed an akinesia of the mid-apical segments of the left ventricle with preserved kinetics of the basal segments and severely depressed global systolic function (ejection fraction: 30%). BNP (18.100 pg /mL), interleukin-6 (339 pg /mL) and CRP (136mg /L) were elevated on blood chemistry tests. In the suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (InterTAK Score: 67, probability: 79.8%), cardioprotective therapy with ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, diuretics, low molecular weight heparin, double antiaggregation and statin was started, deferring coronary angiography to improved clinical conditions. In the following days, due to the respiratory and haemodynamic worsening, the patient was transferred to an intensive setting, where she was intubated and treated with levosimendan and noradrenaline. Serial echocardiograms showed a progressive improvement of the global systolic function (ejection fraction at the last checkup: 55%), with complete regression of the kinetic anomalies, confirming of the diagnostic hypothesis of stress cardiomyopathy. For a pulmonary mycotic superinfection, complicated by iatrogenic pneumothorax, in the following days the patient died.

"THE ELDEST HEART TRANSPLANTED PATIENT IN EUROPE: 36 YEARS SURVIVAL AND STILL GOING ON","Development of endomyocardial biopsy for acute rejection monitoring in the early Seventies, and above all use of cyclosporine in the clinical practice starting from 1980, introduced the modern era of heart transplantation. Following the initial positive outcomes, the first Italian transplant was performed in Padua by V.Gallucci on November 15th 1985. This pioneering success was rapidly repeated in Pavia, where M.ViganÃ² performed the second transplant on Novembre 17th. Recipient was 20 years old man, suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, on urgent transplant list. Cardiac index was 1.38 l/min/m2 and pulmonary vascular resistance 1.6 WU. Donor was a 14 years old boy died of brain injury. Total ischemic time was 125 minutes. Induction immunosuppression consisted of horse anti-lymphocyte immunoglobulins, whereas maintenance therapy included cyclosporine, azathioprine and steroids. Postoperative course was complicated by pericardial effusion and cholestatic jaundice. Later pulmonary aspergillosis occurred and due to the profound immunodepression was complicated by fungal localization at L2 vertebral body. The infection was treated with surgical removal of the secondary localization and amphotericin B administration. On December 6th severe acute rejection was found at biopsy and treated with i.v. steroid pulse. Length of ICU and hospital stay was 28 and 72 days, respectively. In 1998 HCV infection was detected and eradicated in 2017 with elbasvir/grazoprevir therapy. Complications of long term immunosuppressive treatment included dyslipidemia, myeloma and basal cell carcinoma. Due to long-term calcineurin inhibitors therapy progressive chronic renal failure occurred, leading to replacement therapy in 2015 and kidney transplantation in 2016. In 2015 the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stents implantation in two marginal branches and in the anterior descending artery in 2021. Everolimus was introduced to slow down progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. In 2020 he suffered from Covid-19, but the course of infection was uneventful being cough the only symptom. We report the eldest survivor after heart transplant in Europe. Our case demonstrates that despite early and long-term complications of immunosuppressive therapy, a careful and patient tailored management allowed an amazing outcome. Nowadays heart transplant remains the best treatment for end stage heart failure and allows to resume a nearly normal quality of life.","Pisani, G.; Cattadori, B.; D'Armini, A.; ViganÃ², M.; Pellegrini, C.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/suac012.034","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Heart Journal, Supplement; 24(SUPPL C):C60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34443,""

"Characterization of patients with severe fatigue after hospitalization with Covid-19","Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing Covid-19, continues to be a public health concern. Long-term sequela after infection with Covid-19 has been reported worldwide and holds the risk of becoming a major health concern. Ongoing symptoms more than 3 months after infection is now defined as long Covid. Fatigue and psychological distress are among the most common symptoms in long Covid. Aim: To investigate severe fatigue and psychological distress after hospitalization in patients with Covid-19. Methods: Patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in the Central Denmark Region were invited for follow-up 3- 6 months after discharge. Psychological distress was measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) with a HADS score =8 identifying cases of anxiety and depression in the two subdomains. Fatigue was assessed using Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) with a FAS =35 indicating severe fatigue. Basic characteristics from the hospitalization were registered. Results: A total of 218 patients (mean age 59.9 (95% CI 58.2, 61.7), 59% men) reported a mean HADS of 7.9 (95% CI 6.95, 8.93). Cases of anxiety and depression were found in 23 and 16% of all patients, respectively. Overall, a mean FAS of 25.6 (95% CI 24.3, 26.9) was found with 34 patients (18%) reporting severe fatigue. Patients with severe fatigue (mean age of 54.2 (95% CI 50.3, 58.1), 47% males), cases of anxiety and depression was reported by 59 and 62%, respectively. Analyses of FAS in subdomains on mental and physical fatigue showed mean scores of 19.3 (95% CI 18.5, 20.2) and 20.6 (95% CI 19.8, 21.5), respectively. Conclusion: Severe fatigue is common after hospitalization in patients with Covid-19 and includes both mental and physical fatigue.

"Belgian Poison Centre: annual overview 2020","Objective: This study provides an overview of the number and type of calls received by the Belgian Poison Centre (BPC) in 2020. Methods: Data of all calls to the BPC (1 January to 31 December 2020) were collected and analyzed using appropriate statistics (SAS). Results: The BPC received 65,308 calls in 2020 (60,668 in 2019, p&lt;0.05), of which 56,106 (86%) (involving 57,523 victims) were due to an exposure, and 9,202 (14%) were an information request. Despite a minor decrease of 2.3% (21,151 in 2019 versus 20,666 in 2020, p&gt;0.05), the vast majority (35.9%) of exposures were drug-related, of which paracetamol represented 8.2%. Drugs within the category â€œnervous systemâ€ (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants, etc.) were most frequently involved (39.6%). There were 11,836 in 2019 versus 12,247 in 2020 (p&gt;0.05). Relating to chemical household products, in the battle against the coronavirus, people bought large quantities and often highly concentrated products, especially products for personal hygiene and cleaning. Poured into smaller containers such as water or soft drink bottles, this led to accidents in which people accidentally drank from the drink container. In an effort to improving cleaning or disinfection, people also started (accidentally) combining or mixing products, with the risk of releasing irritating vapours. Irritation of the mucous membranes and severe shortness of breath were not uncommon. The BPC received 46.1% more calls for bleach and bleach-containing products than in 2019 (835 calls in 2019 compared to 1,220 calls in 2020, p&lt;0.05). A 12.3% increase of cosmetic- and food-related exposures was noted (8,291 in 2019 versus 9,308 in 2020, p&lt;0.05), of which a stable number of exposures (877 in 2019 versus 876 in 2020, p&gt;0.05) were due to essential oils. Exposures to type 1 biocides significantly increased from 322 in 2019 to 1,676 in 2020 (p&lt;0.05), and exposures to type 2 biocides from 406 to 902 (p&lt;0.05). Finally, a 28.2% increase in exposures related to the group â€œplants, mushrooms and animalsâ€ was observed, with 3,256 in 2019 and 4,175 in 2020 (p&lt;0.05).

"Making Meaning of COVID-19: An Exploratory Analysis of US Adolescent Experiences of the Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic will mark the lives and trajectories of adolescents who lived through it. The pandemic upended social contexts, disrupted schools, and, for many, impacted the physical, financial, and psychosocial health of themselves, their families, and their communities. Contextual changes, however, are not solely deterministic of developmental outcomes. As Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory and Spencer's Phenomenological Variant of the Ecological Systems Theory demonstrate, young people interpret, make meaning, and respond to socioecological contexts as part of their developmental processes. The current study explored meaning making qualitatively through how adolescents in the United States were experiencing COVID-19. Participants were asked via an online survey about their emotions, how they felt COVID-19 was impacting them, and challenges in their lives. Participants (N = 816, mean 15.86 years old) came from 18 states and responded between April and June 2020. Thematic analyses identified 3 themes related to experiences of shifting socioecological context: inadequacy of virtual means of communication;interconnection of daily routines, social life, and mental health;and missing out on key experiences and milestones. Limited socializing fed into emotional responses and connected to the disruption of everyday life. Further analysis focused on Latino/a participants per the pandemic's disproportionate impact on Latinx communities and 2 subgroups by location that had experienced differential extremes of COVID-19 rates during this timeframe. These analyses allowed for examination of different patterns based on socioecological contexts. Translational impacts for those working with young people include considering their processing of the varied and expansive socioecological shifts caused by COVID-19. What is the significance of this article for the general public? The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the social, physical, and educational development of adolescents. The present study explores how these young people interpret and respond to the changes and challenges they face during this time. The analyses of their perspectives highlight the need for individuals and institutions who work with youth to support young people in reforming social connections (particularly beyond technological means) and reimagining and reframing future trajectories.","Velez, G.; Hahn, M.; Troyer, B.","https://doi.org/10.1037/tps0000326","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Translational Issues in Psychological Science;: 14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34448,""
"Culturally Responsive Scalable Mental Health Interventions: A Call to Action","For decades, the field of psychology has been calling for culturally responsive interventions, developed with and for diverse populations. COVID-19 has highlighted the utility of digital and scalable minimally guided mental health interventions for helping individuals who lack access to or desire traditional face-to-face services. However, many of these interventions lack research that supports their efficacy. Moreover, the interventions with empirical support tend to derive that support from studies with small sample sizes and limited diversity. These limitations may lend to more cultural mistrust regarding mental health services in communities that are already underserved. In this paper we argue for specific considerations when developing and adapting minimally guided digital scalable mental health interventions as well as propose some frameworks that may be helpful for those developing and adapting these interventions.","Alvarez, J.

"Adapting, surviving, discovering: Creative practitioners in the COVID-19 crisis","This study investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the work and creative practice of individuals who identify as artists, producers or makers. Through qualitative, open-ended interviews, this research demonstrates that, regardless of the many obstacles creators had to face, the pandemic translated into an opportunity to advance new knowledge about themselves, their values and motivations, and identify how they would like to manage their creative practice in the future. The paper ends with three key findings. First, the challenges of this time prompted participants to generate new perceptions of their creative identity. Second, they often found a valuable connection to nature and â€˜the great outdoorsâ€™ amid the pandemic. Third, the most pressing challenges they had to face were related to their mental health and financial stability.","Reyes, Valeria Duarte, Gauntlett, David","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjoc.2022.100027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Creativity;: 100027, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34450,""
"Sexual Health during COVID-19: A Scoping Review","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic impacted profoundly on the wellbeing and social interactions of the world population, and all dimensions of sexual health were potentially affected by globally implemented preventive measures. Objectives The scoping review aimed to compile existing research investigating possible effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on adult sexual health, i.e., sexual behavior, functioning, and satisfaction. Further, studies on the interplay between mental health and sexual well-being during the pandemic were reviewed. Methods The review was conducted in accordance with guidelines established by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist. On October 11-12, 2021, PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Cochrane, Sociological s and Scopus were systematically searched for relevant peer-reviewed papers employing quantitative methodology. Additionally, unpublished (â€˜greyâ€™) research studies on the subject were retrieved. The screening, data extraction and analysis of evidence were conducted by four independent reviewers using an iterative approach. Results Based on 107 studies included, the scoping review showed that the pandemic had had a wide impact on all dimensions of sexual health. Except for solo sex activities, mainly negative COVID-19 implications were identified, although findings were, in sum, characterized by complexity and unpredictability. Thus, sexual behavior, functioning, and satisfaction during the pandemic appeared to be mitigated by a broad range of sociodemographic and contextual factors. Finally, sexual health seemed deeply entwined with overall mental health. Conclusions The scoping review revealed a broad range of COVID-19- related effects on sexual health, including an overall decline in partnered sex and a concurrent increase in solo sex activities. It also emphasized a need for future research to shed light on possible long-term consequences of the pandemic in various population groups and on all aspects of sexual health.","Toldam, Nana Ernst, Graugaard, Christian, Meyer, Rikke, Thomsen, Louise, Dreier, Sabine, Jannini, Emmanuele A.; Giraldi, Annamaria","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sxmr.2022.06.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexual Medicine Reviews;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34451,""
"A review study of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual sexual behavior, purchasing sex toys, and related consequences","Globally, COVID-19, both during and after the pandemic, has not only slowed countriesâ€™ economic development but has also affected social and daily life. Due to COVID-19, physical contact among couples has been reduced, and physical sexual activities have been affected and decreased. In order to satisfy their sexual needs and avoid mental health issues, individuals have shown an increasing inclination to purchase sex toys. Therefore, we conducted this review study to investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual activities, purchasing sex toys, and related consequences. Specifically, the present paper examines 45 studies and focuses on four themes: (1) COVID-19 and sex toys;(2) COVID-19 and sex (i.e. sexual life, sexuality, sexual health, sexual behavior);(3) factors affecting purchasing sex toys;and (4) COVID-19 consequences. The study findings reflect that, during to the pandemic, sex toy sales doubled in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, and the UK, and tripled in New Zealand. Sex toys have entailed positive (i.e. increased satisfaction, confidence, pleasure) and negative (addiction, allergic reaction, risk of sexually transmitted infection, embarrassment, and guilt) implications. In addition, participants all over the world engaged more in using sex toys and watching pornography to satisfy their sexual needs. Further, the use of online dating applications also increased, in order to have sex with close or casual partners. Regarding purchasing sex toys, we postulate that people buy these products due to lack of opportunity, relationship avoidance, loneliness, cost-effectiveness, time-saving, and emotionless behavior. Moreover, the pandemic has worsened family and sexual relationships. It has also increased anxiety, stress, and violence in society. In this context, we assert that there is still a need to explore the factors influencing individualsâ€™ intentions toward purchasing sex toys, and studies need to be conducted to understand in more detail COVID-19â€™s effects, both during and after the pandemic.","Qalati, Sikandar Ali, LimÃ³n, MÃ³nica Lorena SÃ¡nchez, Bhayo, Sajid Hussain","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2022.06.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexologies;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34452,""

"Disparities in Chronic Physical Health Conditions in Sexual and Gender Minority People using the United States Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System","This study analyzed the physical health status of adults who belong to a sexual or gender minority (SGM) population, and whether health inequities correlate with access to quality healthcare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2014-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) included data for 64,696 adults who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, other, and/or transgender and 1,369,681 adults who identified as cisgender and straight. Multivariable logistic regressions of the weighted sample were conducted to examine associations between demographics and health and access outcomes. After accounting for demographic variables, drinking, and smoking behavior, SGM respondents reported poorer physical and mental health, which worsened after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. SGM respondents had higher odds than non-SGM of having asthma, arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), as well as difficulties â€œsee[ing] the doctor because of cost,â€ particularly after the start of the COVID pandemic. SGM respondents had higher odds of lack of access to healthcare provider, delayed medical care, and issues taking medications due to cost and fewer routine checkups. Thus, the SGM group faced worse health and higher rates of some chronic conditions. This study found a significant relationship with cost barriers attributable to larger societal discrimination regarding SGM individuals, particularly in the workplace. Further research exploring these results is critical, but these findings have identified areas of healthcare inequity to be addressed via preventative health efforts in both public health and primary care settings.","Pinnamaneni, Manasvi, Payne, Lauren, Jackson, Jordan, Cheng, Chin- I.; Ariel Cascio, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101881","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports;: 101881, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34454,""

"Depression Fallout from the Pandemic in a Sample of the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Community in Houston Texas, USA","Objectives: The outbreak of COVID-19 may increase the risk of depression among Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) community given the additional stressors they face including immigration, encountering a new culture, and language barrier. We aimed to assess depression and its predictors during COVID-19 among MENA community in Houston, Texas. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated survey consisted of sociodemographic, general health, and COVID-19 questions. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine predictors of depression. The outcome of interest was â€œmoderate/severeâ€ versus â€œno/mildâ€ depression and measured using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: A total of 368 individuals completed the survey. The overall prevalence of â€œmoderate/severeâ€ and â€œmildâ€ depression was 31.79% and 68.21%, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that people with self-reported depression (OR=2.76, 95%CI=1.15-6.65) and those expressed ""I don't knowâ€ for having depression (OR=9.03, 95%CI=1.55-52.62) were more likely to have â€œmoderate/severeâ€ depression compared to participants reported no depression. Individuals who said â€œYesâ€ to the question ""Has the COVID-19 outbreak been so frightening/upsetting that you tried hard not to think about it, or tried to avoid situations that reminded of it?â€ were more likely to have â€œmoderate/severeâ€ depression compared to those who said â€œNoâ€. (OR=3.63, 95%CI=1.64-8.03). In addition, those having ""no difficultyâ€ (OR=0.13, 95%CI=0.03-0.51) and those having â€œsome difficultyâ€ (OR=0.20, 95%CI=0.07-0.56) doing errands alone because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition were less likely to have â€œmoderate/severeâ€ depression compared to those with ""a lot of difficulty/can't do at all"". Conclusions: Depression in the MENA community may be predicted by social and physical wellbeing, self-reported symptoms of depression and COVID-19 related factors. Predictors identified should be considered when designing interventions to improve the social and health needs of MENA group in the context of the existing racial and immigrant health in the US.","Fatima, B.; Majd, Z.; Zeidat, S.; Atrooz, F.; Alrousan, G.; Abughosh, S.; Salim, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.1456","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(7):S562, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34456,""

"HyFlex Teaching Process Evaluation During COVID Pandemic for a Baccalaureate Core Course About Issues in Nutrition & Health","Objective Evaluate HyFlex feasibility and effectiveness among higher-health-risk college students. Use of Theory or Research The Bloom's Revised Taxonomy cognitive process dimension was used to scaffold critical thinking and creative thinking in analyzing/evaluating controversies and co-creating solutions to improve nutrition/health issues. Interactive solo/group learning activities were designed based on gamer's motivation, gamification framework and Social Cognitive Theory. Target Audience Twenty-seven multi-ethnic junior-rank college students from eight different majors/concentrations enrolled. During 10 weeks, about one-third students tested COVID+, one-third reported directly exposed to COVID+ individuals, and one-third self-disclosed experiencing mental health issues and seeing a counselor. In week 2, the class voted to switch from face-to-face (F2F) to HyFlex where students could flexibly attend class F2F/online twice/week synchronously. Course/Curriculum Description One major learning outcome for this 3-credit baccalaureate core course was the co-creation of multidisciplinary solutions to improve current nutrition/health issues. Students built collaborative skills through concept mapping, Six Thinking Hats and crucial conversation. Canvas, Google Docs/Sheets/Jamboard, Zoom were the primary modalities. Evaluation Methods HyFlex feasibility was assessed by needs and benefits. HyFlex effectiveness was compared between higher-health-risk and lower-health-risk students. Success indicators included engagement level in learning activities, confidence through personal coaching, and demonstrable knowledge and skill gain through final grades and end-of-term course and student learning experience evaluations. Results Twenty-six students completed the course. One student withdrew due to COVID infection and mental health issues. Seventy-seven percent students scored A, 19% B and 4% C. Students highly valued the receiving empathy through personal coaching and grace period for late assignment submission. Without HyFlex, most higher-health-risk students would have failed the course. HyFlex also enabled more inclusive team building activities to warm up the class and lower social anxiety. Overall, the online students were less engaged than the F2F students. But health conditions had significantly compromised their learning ability. Conclusions HyFlex, empathy through personal coaching and grace period for late assignment submission have helped higher-health-risk undergraduate students cope better with learning during the COVID pandemic.

"Eating and Weight Behaviors Among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Weight Concerns: Parentsâ€™ Perspectives","Background According to 2018 CDC data, approximately 1 in 44 children have Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Children with ASDs have an increased propensity towards overweight and obesity due to limited diets and physical inactivity. High-quality research interventions to address obesity in this population are limited, and none have been informed by an intentional process to understand parent stresses and barriers to change surrounding meals and eating behaviors. Objective This qualitative study aimed to explore parentsâ€™ perceptions of their autistic children's eating behaviors, weight, and the support they need from healthcare providers to improve their children's weight status. Study Design, Setting, Participants Participants in this study were recruited using criterion sampling from Texas. Semi-structured Zoom interviews were conducted with 10 parents of overweight/obese autistic children between the ages of 6-12 years. Measurable Outcome/Analysis Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim using NVivo Pro 12.0. Two trained coders independently analyzed transcripts using an open-coding and consensus-building approach for thematic analysis. Results Seven themes were identified: (1) Child's eating attitudes and behaviors;(2) Factors influencing child's nutrition knowledge and skills;(3) Meal planning and preparation;(4) Parental attitudes and experiences toward feeding;(5) Parental attitudes towards child's weight;(6) Parental distress;and (7) Possible Interventions. All parents reported feeding-related stress and many expressed feelings of helplessness to improve these behaviors. Parents also shared concerns related to behavioral regressions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected their child's ongoing therapies. A multidisciplinary approach targeting individualized nutrition and feeding advice for their children was desired. A range of in-person and online interventions including cooking classes and parental vlogs was recommended. Conclusions This study supports the need for nutrition education for parents caring for autistic children and access to evidence-based, individualized approaches for their child's needs from physicians, dietitians, therapists, and other healthcare providers. Future research should be directed at developing interventions that support and educate parents in improving their child's nutritional and health needs and optimizing coping strategies in parents.

"COVID-19â€™s Impact on Head Start Teachersâ€™ Relationships, Health Behaviors, and Stress Levels","Background Early care and education (ECE) workers experience physical and mental barriers to health. The novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) worsened ECE workers' physical health, emotional stress, and financial burdens. These measures of well-being are important as they have also been linked to ECE workers' relationship with children in their classrooms. Objective Examine the impact of COVID-19 on the well-being of North Carolina (NC) Head Start (HS) teachers with an emphasis on their personal/professional relationships, personal health behaviors, and stressors. Study Design, Setting, Participants A cross sectional convenience sample of NC HS teachers were recruited to participate in the study. Data were collected from teachers across all three regions of North Carolina September 2020-March 2021 using an online 27-item survey. Measurable Outcome/Analysis Researchers analyzed demographic information and quantitative survey data using basic descriptive statistics. Two researchers coded participantsâ€™ open-ended responses using basic thematic analysis. Results Survey respondents (nÂ =Â 88) were predominantly female (97.6%), Black/African American (46.6%) or White (43.2%), with an average age of 43 years old. Teachers reported increased challenges to maintaining relationships with coworkers (57.9%), children in their classrooms (84.4%), and the children's families (81.1%). Half (50.6%) reported COVID-19 impacted their health. Over 70% indicated COVID-19 made physical activity challenging, 61.5% experienced weight gain, and 59% increased their snacking. Teachers expressed an increase in six psychological distress indicators;nervousness (88.9%), hopelessness (54.3%), restlessness (72.4%), sadness (50.6%), everything is an effort (58.4%) and worthlessness (31.2%). Conclusions Survey results furthered the understanding of COVID-19â€™s effects on HS teacher health. In a workforce overburdened with stress, COVID-19 compounded and created barriers to wellness. Future research should explore avenues to reduce health barriers for all ECE workers during the ongoing pandemic.

"Changes in Eating Habits Among Eating Competent and Non-Eating Competent College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background Recent quantitative studies have illuminated dietary- and lifestyle-related changes that students experienced during global coronavirus lockdowns. Limited qualitative research on the US undergraduate student population has been published on this topic. Objective The study aimed to describe eating-related behavior changes reported by US undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a secondary aim, this study described behavior changes among students who were and were not Eating Competent (EC). Study Design, Setting, Participants This was a secondary analysis of data collected from an online survey administered from October through December 2020 to students at a major northwestern public university. The original survey consisted of previously validated and/or published instruments, including the Satter Eating Competence Inventory (ecSI 2.0â„¢). Using a direct content analysis approach, this study coded respondentsâ€™ answers to the open-ended question â€œIn what ways have your eating habits changed since the US coronavirus outbreak?â€ Measurable Outcome/Analysis Codes were written and classified under the four dimensions of Eating Competence: Eating Attitudes, Food Acceptance, Internal Regulation, and Contextual Skills. Other codes were developed to represent responses that did not fit within these dimensions. Respondents were categorized as EC or not EC based on their ecSI 2.0â„¢scores. Results Responses from 1,529 participants were analyzed. Preliminary findings indicate that EC university students more frequently reported behavior changes like eating more fruits and vegetables and more home-cooked meals than non-EC students. Non-EC students more often reported eating more takeout, more processed foods, and more sugar compared to EC students. Mental-health-related changes, eating less regularly, disordered eating, and weight concerns were more commonly reported by non-EC students. Conclusions Compared to non-EC students, EC students reported more health-promoting behavior changes during the pandemic. This study highlights the potential benefit of teaching EC-related strategies to the US undergraduate student population and further elucidates behavior changes among students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Perceived Barriers and Facilitators to the Healthfulness of Communities With Low-Income","Background The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges affecting the wellbeing of individuals in communities with low income. Understanding where people live and how those environments can facilitate or hinder living a healthy lifestyle is essential for developing interventions that target behavior change and health promotion. Objective This study compares Extension Nutrition Educatorsâ€™ (NEs) perceptions of the barriers and facilitators impacting the healthfulness of the environment of communities with low income in eleven states before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design, Setting, Participants Trained researchers conducted focus groups and interviews with NEs prior to (nÂ =Â 97) and during (nÂ =Â 77) the first two years of the pandemic in Alabama, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Measurable Outcome/Analysis Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded by researchers using inductive thematic analysis. Cross-tabulation analysis was used to compare data pre-and-during COVID-19. Results NEsâ€™ revealed COVID-19 not only exacerbated existing barriers (i.e., lack of access to healthy foods, transportation, nutrition education and information, and physical and mental health resources) but also created new challenges in these communities. NEs stated increased unemployment rates led to financial hardships and greater food insecurity. Participants mentioned COVID-19 restrictions (i.e., social distancing, shutdowns, etc.) and fear of exposure made services and resources more difficult to acquire, and impacted dietary behavior, physical activity patterns, and mental health. Likewise, limited access to technology and connectivity decreased the ability to learn about and access services and resources. Nonetheless, NEs suggested new opportunities were designed to mitigate COVID-related barriers, such as virtual programming, COVID-19 relief programs, food distribution programs, grocery store delivery services, and revised social marketing approaches to increase awareness of available resources/services. Conclusions Given the onset of new barriers resulting from COVID-19, there is a need to consider these barriers when developing or adapting health promotion strategies to support the healthfulness of communities.

"A rapid assessment of take-home naloxone provision during COVID-19 in Europe","Background : In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. In the following weeks, most European countries implemented national lockdowns to mitigate viral spread. Services for people who use drugs had to quickly revise their operating procedures to rearrange service provision while adhering to lockdown requirements. Given the scarcity of literature published on overdose prevention during COVID-19 in Europe, we aimed to examine how these changes to service provision affected take-home naloxone (THN) programmes and naloxone availability across Europe. Methods : Between November 2020 and January 2021, we conducted a rapid assessment with country experts from European countries that provide THN. We sent country experts a template to report monthly THN distribution data (January 1, 2019-October 31, 2020) and a structured 6-item survey for completion. Results : Responses were received from 14 of the 15 European countries with THN provision of which 11 participated in the rapid assessment: Austria, Denmark, England, Estonia, Lithuania, Northern Ireland, Norway, Scotland, Spain (Catalonia only), Sweden, and Wales. All reported reduced organisational capacity during COVID-19, and some put into place a range of novel approaches to manage the restrictions on face-to-face service provision. In six countries, the introduction of programme innovation occurred alongside the publication of government guidelines recommending increased THN provision during COVID-19. Eight of the eleven participating countries managed to maintain 2019-level monthly THN distribution rates or even increase provision during the pandemic. Conclusion : Through programme innovation supported by public guidelines, many European THN programmes managed to ensure stable or even increased THN provision during the pandemic, despite social distancing and stay-at-home orders affecting client mobility.","McDonald, Rebecca, Eide, Desiree, Abel-Ollo, Katri, Barnsdale, Lee, Carter, Ben, Clausen, Thomas, Day, Ed, Fonseca, Francina, HolmÃ©n, Elin, Horsburgh, Kirsten, Kelleher, Mike, KÃ¥berg, Martin, Ladenhauf, Martin, McAuley, Andrew, Metrebian, Nicola, Neale, Joanne, Parkin, Stephen, Ratcliffe, Kevin, Rintoul, Chris, Smith, Josie, Stifanoviciute, Viktorija, Torrens, Marta, Thiesen, Henrik, Strang, John","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103787","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103787, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34463,""

"Bidirectional associations between depressive symptoms and cigarette, e-cigarette, cannabis, and alcohol use: Cross-lagged panel analyses among young adults before and during COVID-19","Background The literature regarding bidirectional relationships of depressive symptoms to cigarette and alcohol use is mixed, and limited regarding e-cigarette and cannabis use. Moreover, COVID-19 has significantly impacted mental health and substance use, especially among young adults. Thus, this is a critical period for focused research on these relationships among young adults. Methods We analyzed longitudinal data (assessments in Fall 2018, 2019, and 2020) from 3,006 young adults (Mage=24.56 [SD=4.72], 54.8% female, 31.6% sexual minority, 71.6% White, 5.3% Black, 12.2% Asian, 11.4% Hispanic) from 6 US metropolitan statistical areas. Cross-lagged panel models were conducted to examine bidirectional associations between depressive symptoms and past 30-day use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cannabis, and alcohol (respectively), controlling for sociodemographics. Results During the study period, depressive symptoms decreased before the pandemic but increased during, cigarette and e-cigarette use decreased in both periods, alcohol use showed no change before but increases during the pandemic, and cannabis use increased in both periods. Additionally, each outcome demonstrated greater stability before versus during COVID-19. Finally, greater antecedent depressive symptoms correlated with more days of subsequent cigarette (ÃŸ=0.03, SE=0.01, p=.011) and e-cigarette use (ÃŸ=0.03, SE=0.01, p=.021), but fewer days of alcohol use (ÃŸ=-0.02, SE=0.01, p=.035). W2 cannabis use and alcohol use, respectively, were related to W3 depressive symptoms (cannabis: ÃŸ=0.09, SE=0.02, p&lt;.001;alcohol: ÃŸ=0.06, SE=0.02, p=.002). No other cross-lagged associations were significant. Conclusions Intervention efforts targeting depression and substance use should explicitly address the potential for onset and escalation of substance use and depressive symptoms, respectively, especially during societal stressors.","Wang, Yan, Duan, Zongshuan, Romm, Katelyn F.; Ma, Yan, Douglas Evans, W.; Bennett, Breesa, Fuss, Caroline, Klinkhammer, Katharina E.; Wysota, Christina N.; Berg, Carla J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107422","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Addictive Behaviors;: 107422, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34465,""
"Predictors of mental health symptomatology among Kurdish patients who recovered from COVID-19 in Iraq","While a growing body of research has documented severe psychosocial consequences of the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for the affected people, research mainly focused either on health care workers or the general population. There is a dearth of scientific research on the mental health status of recovered patients, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of the current study was to determine the mental health symptomatology and its associated factors among Iraqis who recovered from COVID-19. Participants were Iraqi Kurdish individuals who had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19, and they were recruited based on lists of recovered patients provided by from public health institutions. Using standardized demographic and mental health questionnaires, structured telephone interviews with 57 recovered patients were contacted. It was found that 31.6% of the participating recovered patients with COVID-19 met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 21.05% were classified with probable depression. Hospitalized survivors had higher PTSD and depression symptoms than those not hospitalized. We also found that higher levels of PTSD and depression symptoms were predicted by younger age, hospitalization due to COVID-19, and having a family member who died from COVID-19. In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, psychological and psychiatric treatment may be particularly relevant for younger adult patients and those with more severe COVID-19 symptoms who experienced hospitalized care.","Ibrahim, Hawkar, Goessmann, Katharina, Ahmad, Araz Ramazan, Saeed, Ayoub Kareem, Neuner, Frank","https://doi.org/10.1007/S44202-022-00043-5","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Discover Psychology; 2(1):31-31, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34466,""
"The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on illness perceptions of psoriasis and the role of depression: Findings from a cross-sectional study","Background Illness perceptions in psoriasis have an impact on adherence and disability. Changes in dermatological healthcare provision during the Covid-19 pandemic and distress may have affected illness perceptions in psoriasis patients. Objectives To test whether illness perceptions about psoriasis changed during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic in a tertiary population with psoriasis and whether pandemic effects differed depending on depressive burden, given this population's high depression prevalence. Methods In a cross-sectional survey of nÂ =Â 188 tertiary patients with dermatologist-confirmed psoriasis recruited before and during the pandemic, eight illness perceptions domains were assessed using the Brief-Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (BIPQ). Presence of depression was assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results Beliefs about treatment control and patients' understanding of psoriasis were significantly worse in patients responding during the pandemic compared to before Covid-19. These differences were greater when depression was absent (treatment control: adjusted pÂ &lt;Â 0.001;coherence: adjusted pÂ =Â 0.01). However, participants during the pandemic felt less emotionally affected (adjusted pÂ =Â 0.02) and concerned (adjusted pÂ =Â 0.007) about psoriasis, independently of depression. Conclusions We found diverse pandemic effects on illness perception domains in psoriasis. Uncertainty and reduced healthcare access may drive poorer treatment and coherence beliefs during Covid-19. These beliefs can hinder patients' health-promoting behaviours and may explain the high pandemic non-adherence reported previously in psoriasis. Appropriate interventions are needed to establish positive long-term cognitions and improve psoriasis management, for example, using the PsoWell patient materials. Dermatology services should invest in engaging and educating patients regardless of concurrent psychological distress.","Lada, Georgia, Chinoy, Hector, Talbot, Peter S.; Warren, Richard B.; Kleyn, C.

"Child Mental Health and Income Gradient from Early Childhood to Adolescence: Evidence from the UK","Background: Mental health problems are increasingly prevalent among children and adolescents. Children from low income families are likely to have worse mental health than their wealthier peers. Understanding the association between economic deprivation and poor child mental health, how it varies across ages from early childhood to teen years, and the mechanisms underlying the association is of paramount importance to tackle this increasing public health problem which has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: This study aims to investigate the relationship between family income and child mental health problems from childhood to adolescence in the UK, its potential variation with age, and the potential mechanisms that may explain the relationship. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, child mental health was measured by the Total Difficulties Score (TDS), Internalising and Externalising subscales, all derived from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 years. Family income was operationalised as permanent income, with lagged transitory income used as robustness check. A secondary exposure was frequency of poverty. Cross-sectional analysis using multivariable logistic regression was conducted at each survey age, based on the Grossman health production function. Results: Results were available for 8,096 children, the prevalence of mental health problems (TDS) ranged from 4.6% to 11.1% across all ages. Unadjusted results indicated significant protective effects of higher family income on the likelihood of the child having poorer mental health in all age groups. The relationship weakened after adjustment for confounding and potential mediating factors, and marginal effects of income on TDS were -0.024(SE=0.009), -0.014(SE=0.004), -0.009(SE=0.006), -0.048(SE=0.010) and -0.041(SE=0.011) at age 3, 5, 7, 11, and 14 years, respectively (p&lt;0.001 in all age groups except age 7 where p=0.163). Adjust- ment for poor maternal mental health and low mother-to-infant attachment reduced the strength of the association between income and child mental health. Fully adjusted model suggested an increased independent effect of poor maternal mental health on children's mental health as children grew older. Discussion: While family income is strongly associated with a child's mental health, much of this effect is explained by other risk factors such as maternal depression, and therefore the direct effects are relatively small. This may suggest that policies targeting income redistribution may reduce child mental health inequalities, and also be beneficial to the wider family, reducing the prevalence of other associated risk factors. This is even more important as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic pushes more families into poverty.","Yang, M.; Creswell, C.; Carson, C.; Violato, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Child+Mental+Health+and+Income+Gradient+from+Early+Childhood+to+Adolescence:+Evidence+from+the+UK","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics; 25(SUPPL 1):S36-S37, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34469,""
"Does Creative Aging Imply Healthy Aging? Evidence from a Prospective Study of Canadian Seniors","Population aging concerns have motivated an examination of programmes targeting healthy aging, which include interventions that improve the mental health of senior populations. Consequently, there is increased interest in how exposure to the arts can achieve such an objective. However, few studies have quantitatively examined the benefits resulting from a foray into artistic expression. Addressing this knowledge gap, our prospective study of the elderly examines the impact on mental health from participation in creative activities. From January 2020 until May 2021, a random sample of senior residents in a Canadian city, participated in weekly 2-hour art sessions which included: drawing, painting, collage, clay-work, performance, and sculpting. Of the 252 participants, 130 were randomly assigned to the arts programme, with the remaining 122 serving as the control. In addition to collecting socioeconomic and demographic data, participants filled out a series of mental health questionnaires over the study-period. Results suggest that the intervention reduced respondent loneliness and improved their wellbeing. Additionally, the programme enriched the quality of one's social interactions, while enhancing their physical functioning and vitality. Examples of where the intervention was most impactful include a reduction in the probability of ''worrying so much I can't sleep'', accompanied by an increase in the degree to which they consider themselves a ''happy person''. By the end of the study, participants also tended to feel ''full of life'', having more energy than previously. Evidence also suggests that they were less apt to lack companionship and the likelihood of ''getting upset easily'', along with feeling ''down in the dumps'', declined. Of particular note, improved outcomes were increasing in attendance, further supporting the efficacy of our intervention. We recommend that artsbased programming be continued on a greater scale as our findings corroborate with past evidence, which is especially noteworthy given COVID-19 likely attenuated our conclusions.","Watson, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Does+Creative+Aging+Imply+Healthy+Aging?+Evidence+from+a+Prospective+Study+of+Canadian+Seniors","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics; 25(SUPPL 1):S35, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34470,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and adolescents' quality of life and mental health","Background The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected the life of children and ado-lescents, with potential negative repercussions on their well-being. How-ever, this impact may have differed depending on context, household or individual level characteristics. We aimed to 1) identify risk factors for having been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic 2) evaluate the association between experiencing a heavy pandemic impact and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health status of children and adolescents. Methods We invited children of adult participants in a Geneva population-based cohort (Specchio-COVID19), and from a random sample drawn from state registries to participate in the SEROCoV-KIDS cohort study. Children and adolescents aged 2-17 years old were included between December 2021 and February 2022. Parents were asked about the impact of the pandemic on their child(ren) with the Coronavirus impact scale, which covers health, financial and social aspects at the child and household level;a score higher than one standard deviation above the mean was deemed as a heavy im-pact. They also reported about their child(ren)'s HRQoL with the Ped-sQLTM, mental health with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and on socio-demographic characteristics. Risk factors for having been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 were estimated with generalized esti-mating equations, as was the association between having experienced a heavy pandemic impact and having a poor HRQoL or mental health. Results Out of 1051 participants, 133 (12.7%) had experienced a heavy COVID-19 impact, 164 (15.6%) had a poor HRQoL, and 112 (12.7%) a poor mental health. Older age (aOR = 1.06;95%CI = 1.01-1.11), average to poor parent-child relationship (aOR = 5.34;95%CI = 2.39-11.94), average to poor par-ent's mood (aOR = 2.77;95%CI = 1.63-4.71) and average to poor house-hold financial situation (aOR = 2.68;95%CI = 1.51-4.76) were associated with having been heavily impacted by the pandemic, after adjustment for age and sex. Participants who had experienced a heavy COVID-19 impact were more likely to present a poor HRQoL (aOR = 2.60;95%CI = 1.64-4.13) and a poor mental health (aOR = 3.75;95%CI = 2.15-6.55) compared to those with an average impact. Discussion Older children and adolescents, living in unfavourable family and financial conditions seemed at higher risk for being heavily impacted by the pan-demic, which in turn was strongly associated with a decreased HRQoL and mental health.","Viviane, R.; Roxane, D.; Elsa, L.; Andrea, L.; HÃ©lÃ¨ne, B.; RÃ©my, B.

"Management of the difficult patient in a COVID-19 Internal Medicine unit","Aim of the study: During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, a significant number of subjects did not join the vaccination campaign and also oppose the proposed procedures and therapies, even when these are absolutely necessary or even â€œlife-savingâ€. In the medical departments this has sometimes led to the emergence of important contrasts between these patients and the medical and nursing staff, updating the problem of managing the so-called â€œhateful patientâ€, a definition coined in 1978 by J.E. Groves. The amplification and, at times, media distorsion, of the current pandemic evolution have increased the frequency and extent of conflicts between â€œthose who careâ€ and â€œthose who are cared for. Materials and Methods: In our COVID-19 Internal Medicine Unit we have started a monitoring system that helps to highlight the frequency, type, extent of problems encountered taking care of uncooperative, manipulative, hostile patients or even conspiracy theory followers and the possible emotional consequences on psycological well-being of health professionals, using a short anonymous questionnaire to be discussed in a focus group. Conclusions: We believe that this approach can be an additional tool to contain the emotional stress and feelings of inadeguacy, helplessness or anger that can be connected to working in a COVID-19 unit.","Uccelli, M.; Di Timoteo, E.; Castelli, F.; De Astis, E.; Calzamiglia, T.; Rocchi, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Management+of+the+difficult+patient+in+a+COVID-19+Internal+Medicine+unit","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Italian Journal of Medicine; 16(SUPPL 1):25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34472,""
"Assessing the Dynamics of the Mental Health Apple and Android App Marketplaces","Background: COVID-19 has increased interest and uptake of mental health apps. As healthcare payers consider reimbursement for some apps and creation of app formularies, questions remain about the state of these apps and how to judge their value. As apps are not static and constantly changing and updating, we investigated the dynamics of the app marketplaces to better understand their privacy, efficacy, and safety features in the 'real world'. Methods: A sample of 250 apps were reviewed between September 1st 2021 and December 1st 2021. Apps were selected from mindapps. org based on their age of last review on mindapps.org, with apps approaching six months since being updated in this database reviewed first. Mindapps.org is the world's largest free-to-access database of mental health apps that currently curates 650 apps each rated across 105 dimensions. For this study, each of the 250 apps were again reviewed across 105 dimensions and results were compared to changes from the prior rating of the same app ~6 months ago. Results: The average app updates every 364 days although some nearly weekly. Privacy features changed the most since the last update with 38% of apps reflecting a change. 37% of apps changed in regards to features offered with the most common change as adding physical exercise related content to the apps. Functionality and access changed in 27% of apps with the most common change being increase in accessibility features as well as offering offline access to the app. 20% of apps changed their cost structure with 12% adding a fee for use of the app. Reviewers noted that ads to support apps were in some cases intrusive. Discussion: The dynamic nature of the app stores is reflected in app privacy, features, and functionality. For payers to be able to offer app formularies, they need to create metrics to assess these changes in the app landscape or else tightly control app updates themselves. Other aspects necessary for valuation such as real-world engagement with the apps as well as mean effect size are not publicly available and thus not reported in our results. To truly understand the economic value of mental health apps, dynamic pricing models combined with transparency in data reporting from apps will be necessary.","Stoeckl, S. E.; Hernandez, E.

"Subclavian Cannulation Strategy","Background: For patients with acute respiratory distress requiring veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), there are several cannulation strategies that may be used. The typical cannulation strategy for VV ECMO is either femoral-femoral or a femoral-internal jugular due to the advantage of using larger vessels to access and can typically be done at the bedside under ultrasound and x-ray guidance. However, there is concern for limited mobility and an increased risk of infection due to the location of the cannulas. VV ECMO with a dual-lumen cannula placed via the subclavian approach is an effective cannulation strategy. Case Review: 38-year-old male with a past medical history of childhood asthma and depression. He was hospitalized for respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and intubated on hospital day 2. Despite heavy sedation, paralytics, and prone positioning, his P/F ratio remained less than 50 with peak pressures in the 40s. The multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with cannulation for VV ECMO on day four of intubation. He was cannulated using a 25 French multistage cannula via the left common femoral vein and a 21 French single-stage return cannula via the right common femoral vein. He underwent a tracheostomy on ECMO day four and was able to tolerate weaning of the ventilator over the next few days. Despite only requiring a sweep gas flow of 0.5L/min on ECMO day six, the patient had worsening oxygenation and was unable to achieve a blood flow of more than 3L/min due to chatter. The chest x-ray (CXR) revealed the drainage cannula was now too high and his PaO2 decreased from 101 to 50 despite the same ventilator settings. The drainage cannula was pulled back 6cm at the bedside and flows were increased from 3L/min to 4 L/min with an increase in the PaO2 to 83. On ECMO day seven, oxygenation remained suboptimal and the CXR demonstrated a worsening pneumomediastinum, so the decision was made to transition the patient to a dual-lumen cannula in order to optimize ECMO flow and allow for more aggressive weaning of the ventilator. By ECMO day 12, he was weaned off sedation, out of bed with physical therapy, tolerating CPAP and able to Facetime with his family. ECMO support was utilized to allow for more aggressive ventilator weaning given the pneumomediastinum and increase rehab and nutrition. On ECMO day 16, he was weaned off sweep while on a T-piece with 20L 60%. He remained off sweep for 24 hours and tolerated physical therapy without requiring additional support. By day 17, he was decannulated at bedside. Discussion: By transitioning the ECMO cannulation strategy to optimize oxygenation, facilitate weaning of mechanical ventilation and allow for increased mobility, patients may be decannulated at a higher functional status than if they continued with the original cannulation strategy. Since 2020, our institution has performed 137 dual-lumen subclavian cannulations for patients on VV ECMO with a survival rate of 63%.","Sterling, R.; Anderson, B.; Amerson, S.; Della Volpe, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Subclavian+Cannulation+Strategy","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: ASAIO Journal; 68(SUPPL 1):45, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34474,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Psychiatric Services and Individuals with Serious Mental Illness in New York State during 2020","Background: New York State was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic's initial US surge in March 2020. The pandemic precipitated dramatic and immediate changes throughout the State's psychiatric treatment system and presented serious threats to the wellbeing of individuals with serious mental illness in 23 State-operated psychiatric hospitals. Methods: We describe how the State mental health authority rapidly restructured the public mental health system and implemented infection control and vaccination programs targeting individuals with serious mental illness. Results: Changes in the supply of and demand for psychiatric services: When the pandemic struck, general hospitals in the NYC and its suburban region immediately closed about 20% of their inpatient psychiatric beds. The NYC public hospital system, which accounts for ~40% of the city's inpatient psychiatric beds, converted ~30% of its adult inpatient capacity and 40% of its child/adolescent capacity to COVID-19 medical services. State-operated psychiatric hospitals responded by significantly increasing admissions. These shifts were coordinated to create a single psychiatric inpatient system of care during the height of the pandemic. We will present data showing a dramatic shift to telehealth platforms for outpatient psychiatric outpatient services in the early stages of the pandemic. Risk of infection and mortality among individuals with serious mental illness: Within 3 months of the onset of the pandemic in NYS, five of the 23 State-operated psychiatric hospitals reported 50% or more of their residential/inpatient census exposed to COVID-19. Over an 18-month period from 2020-2021 spanning 3 distinct COVID-19 surges, ~12% of the almost 11,000 patients treated in these programs were diagnosed with COVID-19 illness and 53 died from the virus. We will review infection control practices implemented in these State-operated psychiatric hospitals to mitigate the impact of the virus. Implementing a COVID-19 vaccination program: Within 8 months of onset of the pandemic, surveillance testing and vaccination programs were implemented in all 23 State-operated psychiatric hospitals. We will present data showing marked reductions in COVID- 19 transmission in this population following this implementation, which occurred while COVID-19 cases were peaking in NYS during the 2nd surge in January-February 2021. Population level management of the economic fallout related trauma, stress, anxiety, and depression: Finally, we will review results from 2 surveys of New Yorkers who used psychiatric services during the pandemic. We will report on their experiences with access to care, telehealth, and the impact of COVDI-19 on their health and wellbeing. Discussion and Implications: Mental health authorities can rapidly implement new policy and protocols to protect the health of individuals served in psychiatric hospital systems during urgent public health crises. Assertive cross-agency coordination is necessary to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these individuals.","Smith, T.

"Preferred mode of presentation: Symposium Title of Symposium: Impact of COVID 19 on the mental health of children and adolescents","The COVID 19 pandemic has affected everyone in one form or the other. Children and adolescents seem to be a vulnerable group considering their critical period of development. The pandemic has affected their daily routines. High rates of depression, anxiety and stress reaction has been observed in children and adolescents during the pandemic. Containment measures including closure of schools, isolation and restriction of outdoor activities have impacted their day to day activities. This can additionally lead to difficulties with social development and may in turn contribute to onset of various metal health issues in this age group. Besides onset of new symptoms, children already having mental health issues including psychiatric disorders and neuro developmental disorders may experience an exacerbation of pre-existing symptoms. Disruption of services including medical services, special schools and rehabilitation services also poses one of the major challenges. Witnessing the death of either parent, relatives or both parents to COVID is quite stressful and one of the major psychosocial issues which hasn't been adequately addressed. This can further lead to mental health issues along with various economic and logistic issues including employment, homelessness, migration and poverty.Addressing these issues includes inter-sectoral coordination and there is pressing need to focus on mental health issues of children and adolescents in a more holistic manner.","Sagar, R.; Rajhans, P.; Patra, B.

"A new challenge: post-COVID syndrome in adolescents","Post-COVID syndrome (or long COVID) is a set of multiple symptoms oc-curring after a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and persisting for more than 2 months. The pediatric population is also affected, especially pre-adolescents and adolescents, even if data about this age group are still scarce. Persistent symptoms can have a strong impact on quality of life and schooling, school absenteeism and social withdrawal being of major concern. For this reason, the Division of General Pediatrics at the Univer-sity Hospital of Geneva has set up in May 2021 a specific consultation for adolescents with post-COVID syndrome, offering global and multidiscipli-nary care. To date 50 patients have been addressed to our consultation by their gen-eral practitioner. The mean age is 14 years, two thirds are girls. The symp-toms are multiple and non-specific, and are similar to those described in adults. The most frequent ones are fatigue, dizziness, headaches, dysp-nea, loss of smell, brain fog, sleep disorders, mood disorders. The Peds-QL questionnaire (assessing 4 aspects of teenagers' daily life), shows an impact of these symptoms on the quality of life, schooling and daily activities being the most affected. Reassuringly, peer relationships seem preserved. Impact on schooling is important, with two thirds of pa-tients reporting an impact on school performance, and one fourth having extended school absenteeism. The Adolescent Depression Rating Scale shows that 44% of our patients are at risk for depression. One third needs a psychological support. If necessary, patients can be referred to specialized consultations in our multidisciplinary group (ENT, pulmonology, neurology, cardiology, etc.) or to complementary examinations (Tilt-Test, stress test). Patients having symptoms due to physical activity (fatigability, shortness of breath, dysau-tonomia with standing position intolerance) can benefit from a progres-sive and individualized reconditioning program with an adapted sport coach. We offer a global follow-up to patients and families. School attendance is supported by making individual arrangements if required, through close collaboration with the education system. Repetition of the questionnaires 3-6 months after the beginning of the follow-up shows a trend towards clear improvement, however a longer follow-up period would be necessary to confirm these observations. (To allow fully up-to-date informations, numbers are susceptible to change until June).","Perrin, A.; Posfay-Barbe, K.

"A Systematic Review of the Impact of Covid- 19 on Cancer Patients and Survivors from an Economic, Social and Psychological Perspective","Background: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death and has been found to have a significant associated economic burden. That cancer diagnosis comes with a financial burden on patients and survivors is known but little is known about the psychological and social impact of COVID-19 or how the resulting economic environment has exasperated this further. Aims of the Study: This systematic review examines the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients and survivors from an economic, social and psychological perspective. Methods: A systematic review of the literature published between January 2020 and March 2021 was completed by searching electronic databases. The review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database. Results were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: A total of 55 articles were identified. Approximately 93% of the psychological studies reviewed reported increased anxiety, depression, psychological distress and worry in cancer patients. Evidence in 50% of social studies reviewed, showed that national stayat- home guidelines compounded and contributed to feelings of increased loneliness and social isolation. While the underlying economic conditions were found to impact health systems both positively and negatively with reports of a modified workflow and transitioning to telemedicine. Discussion and Limitations: National stay-at-home guidelines implemented to stop the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations were found to have a negative social effect on patients. Increased anxiety, depression, psychological distress and worry among cancer patients was found. Furthermore, there is evidence of socio-economic inequalities with certain subgroups more vulnerable to the economic strain caused by Covid-19 than others. Psychological strain and financial distress are side effects associated with cancer treatment but COVID-19 exasperated these side effects further. Many of the papers reviewed were reliant on single institutions and lack long term follow-up and in some cases data were only available for short periods which had negative implications on sample size. Implications for Healthcare Provision and Use: COVID-19 has reduced healthcare capacity, adversely impacting delivery and access to healthcare and causing a re-distribution of resources to meet with demand. In addition environmental considerations such as national and institutional COVID-19 guidelines and the reaction/ behaviour of patients to these guidelines will influence both demand and supply behaviour. The underlying economic conditions were found to impact health systems both positively and negatively with reports of a modified workflow and transitioning to telemedicine. Implications for Health Policy: The results provide reflections on how care for cancer patients undergoing treatment were affected by the pandemic. This informs continued plans for the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy and operationalisation plans for Ireland's blueprint for universal health care, SlÃ¡intecare. Implications for Future Research: Before COVID-19, studies were already shown to be lacking particularly on the financial burden of cancer on patients. The need for more studies in this area is paramount in order to fully understand the challenges that cancer patients face particularly because of COVID. The systematic review revealed few papers on survivors (two years post treatment)of cancer. The late effects of cancer and its treatment are well documented and extend further than active treatment and with only a few studies reporting on the psychological effects the true impact and risk to survivors is not yet fully understood.","Murphy, A.; Kirby, A.; Lawlor, A.; Drummond, F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Systematic+Review+of+the+Impact+of+Covid-+19+on+Cancer+Patients+and+Survivors+from+an+Economic,+Social+and+Psychological+Perspective","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics; 25(SUPPL 1):S23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34480,""
"The Social and Economic Factors Underlying the Incidence of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in US Counties During the Initial Outbreak Phase","This paper uncovers the socioeconomic and health/lifestyle factors that can explain the differential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on different parts of the United States during the initial outbreak phase of the pandemic. Using a dynamic panel representation of an epidemiological model of disease spread, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for US counties from the daily reported number of cases over a 20-day period of rapid disease growth. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high median income have a high incidence of cases but reported lower deaths. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is found to be associated with more deaths and more cases. The remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports is evidence of the spread of the virus by way of international travel. The distributions of age, race and health risk factors such as obesity and diabetes are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with better access to health care, as measured by the number of primary care physicians per capita, have lower deaths, and so do places with more health awareness as measured by flu vaccination prevalence. Environmental health conditions such as the amount of air pollution are found to be associated with counties with higher deaths from the virus. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","Mukherji, N.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Social+and+Economic+Factors+Underlying+the+Incidence+of+COVID-19+Cases+and+Deaths+in+US+Counties+During+the+Initial+Outbreak+Phase","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Review of Regional Studies; 52(1):127-150, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34481,""
"Long term sequelae after hospitalization for severe COVID-19: a comparison between the first two pandemic waves","Background: A significant proportion of survivor COVID-19 patients presented sequelae that impact on the quality of life and social-health systems. We described long term sequelae in hospitalized for severe disease patients. Materials and Methods: 143 patients was evaluated at 6 and 12 months after discharge in a prospective study by medical examination, laboratory tests, spirometry, Hamilton test for anxiety and depression, ECG. The results was compared between survivors of the first two pandemic waves. Results: mean age was 66Â±8 years;90 (63%) was male, median BMI was 26,7Â±2 Kg/m2. After 6 months 32,1% of patients reported dyspnoea, 35% fatigue, 14% transiet hair loss, 18,8% arthralgia, 10,4% concentration and memory deficit, about 53% anxiety and/or depression. At 12 months symptom prevalence decreased. Prevalent spirometric feature was restrictive. DLCO was altered in about 70% of patients at 6 months. At 12 months the percentage was the same in first wave patients and decreased to 45% in second wave patients. Healthy state was worse in survived of first wave. Conclusions: approximately 1/3 of patients recovered from COVID-19 have sequelae of disease that improved over time. Data analysis are invalidated by patients heterogeneity (background, severity disease and clinical feature, received therapy);its possible that better knowledges in disease management in second pandemic wave had a favorable impact on long-term outcomes.","Marchetti, A.; Bitti, G.; Postacchini, L.; Martino, G.

"Prolonged ECMO Support of an Adult with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS and Right Heart Failure in a Children's Hospital","ECMO has become a widely recognized support modality for patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure, and has been increasingly utilized in the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Long-term support on ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is also becoming more commonplace with eventual lung recovery, obviating the need for lung transplantation. However, long-term ECMO support has not been well studied for SARS-CoV-2 ARDS patients. We report the case of a 39-year-old female with severe SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS successfully supported on venovenous ECMO (V-V ECMO) for 5,208 hours (217 days) in a high ECMO-volume, quaternary care children's hospital in 2021. At the time of this writing, this is the longest reported patient successfully supported on ECMO for SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Our patient was initially cannulated at our children's hospital with dual-site V-V ECMO, via the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and right common femoral vein. Bedside tracheostomy was performed on ECMO day 40, for early mobility, oral feeding, interaction, and pulmonary rehabilitation planning. Unfortunately, during her course she suffered multiple complications including bacterial co-infections, bleeding requiring anticoagulant changes from unfractionated heparin (UFH) to bivalirudin, multiple ECMO circuit changes due to blood product consumption and coagulopathy, and pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy tube placements. Approximately 1.5 months into her ECMO course, she suffered acute hypoxemia and echocardiography revealed indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure. Initial right heart catheterization while on V-V ECMO revealed elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP=15-20 mmHg) and severe systemic desaturation with main pulmonary artery (MPA) pressure of 30 mmHg. Pulmonary hypertension and right heart support was initiated in the form of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inotropes, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuresis. Ultimately, due to necessity of right-heart decompression and support, on ECMO day 86 she was transitioned to single-site V-V ECMO utilizing a 31 Fr dual-lumen venovenous cannula (ProtekDuo (LivaNova, UK)) placed via her RIJ through her right atrium (RA) into the MPA in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Subsequent heart catheterization more than 2 months later revealed severe right ventricular (RV) diastolic dysfunction (RVEDP=35 mmHg) and moderate left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP=24 mmHg)). During her course, multiple trials off ECMO were attempted with varying lengths of time off ECMO support, but ultimately required ongoing ECMO support. She developed evidence of end-organ dysfunction from her cor pulmonale, including oliguric renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), hepatic injury with elevated transaminases and hyperammonemia leading to depressed mental state, feeding intolerance, and coagulopathy. Additionally, due to long-term nasogastric enteral tube placement for caloric supplementation and enteral medication administration, she developed concerns for invasive sinusitis with erosion into ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. As she was an adult patient being cared for in a free-standing academic children's hospital, multiple adult medicine consultants were involved in her care. Specifically, adult nephrology, cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery (for ProtekDuo cannula placement), and gastroenterology/ hepatology were integral into her care, along with our pediatric critical care medicine and ECMO teams. Notably, this was the first patient supported on ECMO to receive tracheostomy, RA-MPA dual-lumen VV cannula, and full autonomous mobility outside of the ICU at our well-established ECMO program, which has served as the index patient leading to future advances in the care of our ECMO patients. Over time and with multiple therapies to alleviate her cor pulmonale, the patient's echocardiograms evealed improved, half-systemic right-sided cardiac pressures. She was ultimately decannulated from ECMO at our center before being transferred back to the referring adult facility, and discharged to home 8 months after her initial presentation with acute respiratory failure.","Malone, M.; Pasala, S.; Garcia, X.; Earls, A.; Frazier, B.; Furrh, S.; Moss, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prolonged+ECMO+Support+of+an+Adult+with+SARS-CoV-2+ARDS+and+Right+Heart+Failure+in+a+Children's+Hospital","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: ASAIO Journal; 68(SUPPL 1):4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34483,""
"WILDLIFE SECTOR EVALUATION TOOL","Strengthening wildlife and broader environmental health capacity is critical for building back better and greener in COVID-19 recovery efforts. However, no standard capacity assessment tool exists for wildlife or environmental health services, resulting in poor understanding of necessary functions and a low recognition of gaps in implementation and financing. In many cases, wildlife and environmental health is fragmented across mandates and sectors, with critical gaps that leave countries vulnerable to health security threats. In a review of Joint External Evaluations (JEE) and Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) evaluation reports from 107 countries, the majority did not show evidence of a functional wildlife health surveillance system. The limited focus to date on wildlife health hinders implementation capacity for biodiversity and ecosystem-specific objectives, while also missing critical opportunities to contribute to human and domestic animal health outcomes. Encouragingly, recent efforts to support countries in strengthening wildlife health capacity indicate practical entry points for more equitable inclusion of wildlife and environment sector partners in One Health implementation efforts. Key findings and lessons learned will be provided from pilot missions to test draft capacity and needs assessment tools for wildlife and environmental health.","Machalaba, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=WILDLIFE+SECTOR+EVALUATION+TOOL","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Public Health in Africa; 12(SUPPL 1):11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34484,""

"Proposal from the World Association of Social Psychiatry (WASP)","Covid-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented crisis seen by the humanity in the last two years with a magnitude no less than the two world wars. Globally, more than 260 million cases have been reported and more than 5 million deaths have been attributed to Covid-19 till the end of November 2021. Despite introduction of the vaccine nearly a year ago, though there has been a big hope of controlling the pandemic, there have been repeated rises in infections due to the mutations in virus, like the coming of Delta, Delta plus and Omicron variants, which are increasingly infectious. There have already been two waves of the pandemic with the second wave being very lethal in India. The pandemic had both direct as well as indirect effects on mental health of the population across allover the world. Many countries had to resort to lockdowns to control the spread of infection, which had serious economic consequences, adding to the mental and social distress. Other infection control measures like quarantine and social isolation, and inability of the persons with existing mental illnesses to access treatment further added to the problem. Introduction of vaccine brought some hope, but it has been a great challenge to cover such a huge population with vaccine alongwith dealing with vaccine hesitancy. This symposium being proposed by the World Association of Social Psychiatry. The symposium will assess the current situation with focus on psychosocial aspects, social psychiatry approach used to deal with the mental health issues, challenges ahead and the lessons learnt to deal with any future challenges of similar nature.","Kallivayalil, R.

"ATTITUDES OF UNIVERSITY OF OSIJEK'S STUDENTS TOWARDS ONLINE LEARNING DURING LOCKDOWN DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Due to COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, in the spring of 2020 Republic of Croatia imposed a lockdown, which included a measure of transferring the educational process on all educational levels from classroom to distance education. Characteristics of learning in higher education during the lockdown were identical to those pertaining to online learning. Aiming to determine the attitudes of students of Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek towards online learning and the factors affecting their attitudes, we have conducted a quantitative research. In so doing, we have collected the data using the surveying method on a convenient sample (N = 327) via Internet. The results have shown that students have a slightly negative attitude towards online learning, provided that students who have used online learning tools more frequently before the pandemic have a more positive attitude towards it. By applying the technology acceptance model (TAM), we have confirmed the indirect correlation between the perceived ease of use of online learning tools and the attitude towards online learning with a strong mediation effect of perceived usefulness of online learning.","Jurlina, J.; Papo, D.; Potlimbrzovic, H.","https://www.google.com/search?q=ATTITUDES+OF+UNIVERSITY+OF+OSIJEK'S+STUDENTS+TOWARDS+ONLINE+LEARNING+DURING+LOCKDOWN+DUE+TO+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Metodicki Ogledi-Methodical Review; 29(1):263-283, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34487,""
"Mental healthcare delivery for patients hospitalized with COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the healthcare system its limits, largely remaining a puzzle with no definitive treatment and ever emerging variants. The overwhelming psychological stress on such patients (observed devastation, concerns about deterioration, physical isolation, social discriminations) and the CNS effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection together may lead to various psychiatric symptoms like insomnia, depressive mood, anxiety, aggressive outbursts and even suicidal ideations. Literature suggests that up to 35% have depressive symptoms, 28% have anxiety and 20% may have impaired consciousness and confusion which is linked with severe progression of disease. Persons with mental illnesses are at a higher risk of contracting viral infections because of a myriad of factors, such as a chronically dysregulated innate immune system, cognitive and higher motor functioning, and sometimes deficient personal hygiene. The recommendations and necessary social isolation can limit the continuation of tailored care, support and treatment for these patients. The situation worsens when these patients develop COVID-19 and require hospitalization for management, away from familiar caregivers and receive care through the barriers of personal protective equipment (PPE). All patients admitted at our hospital were screened for need of mental healthcare telephonically and received counselling, with in person consultation provided as required on a case-to-case basis for further management. The experience sharing of COVID-19 recovered health care professionals via audio announcement system was initiated to boost the morale of patients. All the patients were managed within COVID-19 isolation protocols.

"COVID-19's Financial and Patient Access Impact on US-Based Clinical Organizations Providing Mental Health Services","The need for mental health and substance use services has long outpaced the ability of the U.S. health care system to provide it. The societal and economic impact of COVID-19 - and public health measures to reduce the spread of it - have only exacerbated this deficit by further deepening chronic financial underfunding of clinical organizations providing mental health and substance use services. While short-term financing policy changes, such as the lifting of restrictions on reimbursable telehealth services or one-time relief grants/loans, have offered temporary solutions;none have resolved the underlying deficits. Findings from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the U.S. Government, indicate that among the 51.5 million adults with mental illnesses in 2019, 26% perceive an unmet need for treatment. This represents an increase from annual survey findings from the previous decade. Meanwhile, as the pandemic spread across the U.S. in the early months of 2020, community-based organizations providing mental health and substance use services experienced disruption in their ability to provide care. To further understand the implications of these service disruptions on patient access to care, the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, a nonprofit U.S.-based organization representing 3,500 community-based organizations providing mental health and substance use services, conducted a series of surveys among its members between June of 2020 and September of 2021. In the first such survey conducted in June of 2020, 71% of responding organizations indicated they had to cancel, reschedule, or turn away patients over the previous three months. This had an immediate impact on the finances of these organizations as they primarily rely on patient visits/encounters to seek reimbursement from the government and/or health plans for the services they provide. In the same survey, 44% of surveyed organizations indicated they could survive six months or less in the financial environment at the time, with an average revenue loss of 24% since the impact of COVID-19 began earlier that year. As the U.S. Government made relief funding available to these clinical organizations, subsequent surveys indicated temporary improvements in financial outlook. These surveys also indicated an increase in demand for services, far outpacing the capacity of these organizations to keep up. In a survey conducted in September of 2021, 78% of clinical organizations surveyed indicated they had experienced an increase in demand for services and 62% indicated their patient wait list had increased over the previous three months.When asked what inhibits their ability to meet demand, 97% of survey respondents indicated difficulties recruiting new employees. Reasons given included an inability to offer competitive salaries, burnout among potential candidates, and a general lack of qualified candidates. By further detailing survey findings and adding policy and financing context, this workshop will offer insights into the immediate impact of COVID-19 on the ability of U.S.-based clinical organizations providing mental health and substance use services to remain financially viable and provide access- to-care that meets patient demand. Additionally, we will offer policy, financing, and regulatory recommendations for improvements in the short- and long-term.","Ingoglia, C.; Venkatesh, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19's+Financial+and+Patient+Access+Impact+on+U.S.-Based+Clinical+Organizations+Providing+Mental+Health+Services","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics; 25(SUPPL 1):S16-S17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34489,""
"The psychological experience of the Internal Medicine patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Premises: The current pandemic period caused an intensification of the psychological difficulties experienced during hospitalization with important consequences on emotional and cognitive area of the patient. Methods: A descriptive analysis of psychological interviews and observation cards was carried out to detect emotional and cognitive reactions during the hospital stay of a sample of 88 patients who were admitted to the U.O. of Internal Medicine - Critical Area of the Garibaldi Hospital. Results: The emotional reactions manifested are mainly anxiety (87.5%) fear (67%) sadness (49%) distrust (25%) anger (9%) and despair (12%). The mood deflected in 39% of patients. The length of hospitalization in 64% ranged from 7 to 14 days, in 21% it was longer than 14 days and in 13% within 7 days with a diagnosis of transient emotional reaction in 86% of patients. The motivations related to emotional reactions were: health conditions, distance from family, inability to meet family members, sense of abandonment, fear of getting infected, changing habits, noises, limitations of personal space, loss of intimacy, undergoing painful or invasive clinical trials, relationships with medical and nursing staff. Conclusions: The pandemic and the resulting limitations may intensify the experience of strong psychophysical stress caused by hospitalization. An appropriate and continuous psychological support may improve the emotional state of the patient and consequently the doctor-patient relationship and compliance, reducing the healing time and the length of hospitalization.","Indelicato, L.; Sgroi, C.; Timpanaro, I.; Neri, S.

"Impacts of the Pandemic on Utilization of Critical Healthcare among New York Medicaid Beneficiaries with Schizophrenia","Background: People with schizophrenia are more likely to become ill with COVID-19 and have poorer COVID-19 outcomes because of pre-existing health conditions and social disadvantage. This risk may be modified by the strength of their connection to the healthcare system. In New York (NY), a state badly impacted by the pandemic, drivers of racial/ethnic healthcare disparities could reduce access to healthcare for minorities relative to white individuals, even if insured. Evidence is limited on the pandemic's impacts on this population's access to behavioral and physical healthcare and whether differences by race/ethnicity exist. Aims of the Study: To examine the early impacts of the pandemic on racial/ethnic differences in access to healthcare among adult NY Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia. Methods: We constructed a cohort of Medicaid beneficiaries aged 18-64 with schizophrenia observed in the pre-pandemic period (March 7, 2019-March 6 2020) or in the early post-pandemic period (March 7 - May 15 2020). Outcomes included access to critical behavioral health outpatient care (utilization of routine and specialty services, and antipsychotic drugs) and unavoidable hospitalizations (suicidality, cardiometabolic emergencies, and pneumonia). We estimated logistic regression models for each outcome. The main independent variables were race/ethnicity, time, and their interaction;adjustors included age, sex, disability, and county. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI for differences between minorities and whites were computed. Results: We identifed 23,486,821 and 4,481,176 person-days, preand post-pandemic period respectively, with a majority non-white. Utilization and racial/ethnic differences did not change over time for specialty oupatient care, which favored blacks over whites (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.19, 1.24), or hospitalizations for suicidality and cardiometabolic emergencies. Differences in routine outpatient care and antipsychotic utilization between minorities and whites, largely favoring whites, decreased in the post-pandemic period without closing the gaps. Differences in pneumonia hospitalizations changed over time, with minorities less likely than whites to be hospitalized in the post-pandemic period;e.g., Latinx: pre-period OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.66, 1.18;post-period OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.87. Discussion and Limitations: We found that access to critical behavioral health care and unavoidable hospitalizations for adults with schizophrenia in NY and differences by race/ethnicity remained largely unchanged following the onset of the pandemic. This constancy is noteworthy given how severely NY and its healthcare system were affected by the pandemic. However, the post-pandemic emergence or widening of racial/ethnic differences in hospitalizations for pneumonia is concerning given the larger burden of COVID- 19 disease observed among minorities. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Identifying the provider-level factors that enabled the preservation of access to critical behavioral health and hospitalization care will improve the system's capacity to confront future public health emergencies. Implications for Health Policies: Our findings suggest that policies that aimed to preserve healthcare access were successful;however, policies are needed to address the potential for racial/ethnic differences in access to care for the public health emergency. Implications for Further Research: Future research should assess the impact of variable telehealth adoption on quality and effectiveness of care for this population.","Horvitz-Lennon, M.; Leckman-Westin, E.; Finnerty, M.; Jeong, J.; Tsuei, J.; Chen, Q.; Zelevinsky, K.; Normand, S.

"Relationships between Current and Lifetime Mental Health Issues and Self-Reported Relative Placement in Society","Background: It is well established that mental health issues can impact overall health status, personal relationships, workplace productivity, and other social outcomes. Less is known about how and to what extent mental health issues affect self-esteem and relative well-being in society. These relationships are particularly important to understand during the global COVID-19 pandemic when many people suffer from temporary and permanent mental health challenges. If mental health challenges result in corresponding drops in individuals' social placement vis-Ã -vis their peers, then it will be extremely difficult for them to thrive in personal relationships, athletic activities, nutrition, and the labor market. Method: Analyzing data from a large and nationally representative longitudinal survey, we determine whether recent and lifetime mental health problems are significantly related to respondents' selfassessed relative placement in society. Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) provide the data for our research. Respondents are between the ages of 32-38 at Wave IV and ages 38-44 at Wave V. At each wave, subjects were asked to rate their relative placement in society in terms of wealth, education, and jobs. The scale has 10 categories, with 1 representing the lowest placement and 10 the highest. Respondents also answered several questions pertaining to their mental health status including: ever diagnosed with depression, every diagnosed with PTSD, ever diagnosed with anxiety or panic disorder, and any psychological or emotional counseling during the past 12 months. Finally, Add Health surveys collect detailed data on socio-demographics, physical health status, living arrangements, and other pertinent information. Our empirical approach first examines bivariate relationships between self-reported mental health measures and self-reported relative placement in society. These associations are calculated at Wave IV and then again at Wave V. Next, we estimate cross-sectional multivariate regression models with selfreported relative placement in society as the dependent variable, each of the mental health measures as a key predictor (separately), and a large set of control variables. As with the bivariate analyses, we estimate these relationships separately for Wave IV and V data. The final empirical models pool data from Waves IV and V and estimate fixed-effects regressions to control for potential bias due to time-invariant heterogeneity. Results: Preliminary results indicate that all of our mental health measures are negatively and significantly associated with selfreported placement in society. The effect sizes are large in magnitude, particularly for respondents with a diagnosis of depression. The relationships are less pronounced for individuals who reported any psychological or emotional counseling during the past 12 months. The effect sizes diminish somewhat with the fixed-effects specifications, but remain statistically significant. These results have important policy implications for mental health counselors, employers, and society in general as mental health problems become more common and less stigmatized.","French, M.

"Psychological and gastroenterical prevention in â€œlong COVIDâ€ syndrome","Those who have faced SARS-Cov-2 disease have a 60% higher risk of developing mental disorders within a year of infection. Anxiety, depression and sleep problems are the most frequent. A research published in the British Medical Journal highlights how the risk is greater among those who have had a severe form of the disease, but also emerges among those who have not needed hospitalization. Less than a year after infection, among the healed there is an increase in diagnosis or prescription of drugs for mental disorders equal to 64 cases more per 1,000 people than those who have not contracted the virus. In particular, among those who had become ill there was an increase of 24 cases of sleep disorders per 1,000 people, 15 cases per 1,000 of depressive symptoms, 11 per 1,000 of neurocognitive decline and 4 per 1,000 of substance use disorders (excluding opioids). The gut microbiota has been associated with a plethora of disorders, including some pathologies involving the brain. Recently, a group of researchers found that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have a different microbial â€œsignatureâ€ than healthy people. The findings, published in Science Advances, suggest that patients with depression are characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota, and previous studies have found that depressed people have alterations in the gut microbiota. Proper diet and nutrition in order to replenish the gut microbiome can promote good mental balance and help prevent mental disorders as much as good mental hygiene can help counteract gastrointenstinal disorders.","Colorato, M.; Aceranti, A.; Serini, T.; Palazzolo, A.; Tuvinelli, M.; Vernocchi, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+and+gastroenterical+prevention+in+â€œlong+COVIDâ€+syndrome","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Italian Journal of Medicine; 16(SUPPL 1):80, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34494,""

"An Italian survey of psychological effects of emerging coronavirus outbreaks on healthcare workers and potential acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposed enormous burdens of morbidity and mortality while severely disrupting people, especially frontline healthcare working in hospitals.The vaccine discovery gives hope to the world population, but it was received with skepticism and fear stressed by the great media coverage. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey of the quality of life during pandemic era and the likelihood of COVID- 19 vaccine acceptance on a sample of healthcare at the Italian Hospital more involved by COVID-19 pandemic. Results: 3134 survey respondents represented a random sample in which was represented different health workers.Of these survey participants, 644 contracted SARS-CoV-2.Healthcare workers could be psychologically stressed by covid-19 pandemic.A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression and sadness (52%), anxiety (40.9%), insomnia (33.02%) and distress (55.4%).Most healthcare workers have documented vaccination through scientific articles 1423 (45.4%) by social media news 348 (11.1%) while 152 (4.8%) haven't documented at all.They would take a vaccine if it were proven safe and effective. Conclusions: Health workers who have to be on the front line during an epidemic are more exposed to psychological distress as, in addition to guaranteeing the necessary care and assistance, they are constantly in the condition of being affected by the epidemic itself.Specific projects aimed at the prevention of burn-out and distress of health workers will be carried out to improve the entire care process.","Carleo, C.; Para, O.; Zinghetti, M.; Dalla Gasperina, D.; Maffioli, L.; Bonelli, G.; Abenante, A.; Speroni, S.; Dentali, F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+Italian+survey+of+psychological+effects+of+emerging+coronavirus+outbreaks+on+healthcare+workers+and+potential+acceptance+of+the+COVID-19+vaccine","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Italian Journal of Medicine; 16(SUPPL 1):67, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34496,""
"NEW ZOONOTIC CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: THE APPLICATION OF WASTEWATER-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGY (WBE) FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE HEALTH","The new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in China in late 2019 and, since then, it has spread rapidly, culminating in the pandemic. Studies show that symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can eliminate the virus through feces and urine, making it possible to detect viral RNA in excreta and, consequently, in wastewater. One Health is the inseparable union of animal, human and environmental health and within this concept, it is possible to use an environmental sample (wastewater) to monitor the circulation of the new coronavirus in a population, whether in companies, schools, neighborhoods, and municipalities. In this context, the present study aimed to demonstrate the successful use of WBE through a contingency plan model adopted in a company (Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant -IHPP) located in the city of Foz do IguaÃ§u, Brazil. Thus, statistical analysis and modeling were applied, using the results of weekly monitoring, between June/2020 and September/2021, of 10 representative points of each sector of the IHPP. During 65 monitored weeks, 500 mL of samples were sent conditioned on ice to the Federal University of ABC for detection and quantification of RNA fragments of the new coronavirus by reverse transcription technique followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). An occurrence variation of 7.7 and 2.6 log10 copies of RNA.L-1 was observed, and it is possible to correlate with the tendency of an increase in the number of cases in the IHPP and in the city of Foz. The results demonstrated the viability of the WBE approach in monitoring the new coronavirus, being a useful tool for decision-makers with the epidemiological surveillance and the health department. This approach may also be useful in detecting outbreaks caused by other waterborne pathogens not only in the human population but also in the companion animal population.","Cabral, A.; Augusto, M.; Miranda, T.; Duran, A.; Claro, I.; Siqueira, A.; Silva, K.; Bueno, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=NEW+ZOONOTIC+CORONAVIRUS+PANDEMIC:+THE+APPLICATION+OF+WASTEWATER-BASED+EPIDEMIOLOGY+(WBE)+FROM+THE+PERSPECTIVE+OF+ONE+HEALTH","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Public Health in Africa; 12(SUPPL 1):38-39, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34497,""
"Changes in Outpatient Care for Alcohol Use Disorders Among the Commercially Insured in the US during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) account for considerable illness, disability, and mortality. Since the onset of COVID-19, heavy and problematic alcohol use increased. Overall healthcare visits dropped in the US and telemedicine use surged. No prior work has assessed the impact of the pandemic on receipt of AUD care and the role of telemedicine. Aims of the Study: Compare outpatient AUD utilization in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020 among a national commercially insured population of adults ages 18-64. Methods: Using OptumLabs Data Warehouse claims, we developed two AUD cohorts. Individuals were identified as having AUD in the first year and AUD outpatient visit utilization was tracked in the second year. The 2019 cohort (N=23,204) covered the period 2018- 2019 and the 2019 cohort (N=24,445) 2019-2020. In unadjusted analyses we compared the weekly percent of individuals who had an outpatient AUD visit, comparing 2019 and 2020 with a focus on weeks 12-52 (aligning with the start of the 2020 US COVID-19 emergency declaration). We also examined in 2020 what fraction of outpatient visits were conducted via telemedicine (phone or video). We fit logistic regression models examining the association between at least one outpatient AUD visit weeks 12-52 in 2019 vs. 2020, with patient characteristics-demographic (age, sex, US region) and clinical (AUD severity, alcohol related medical condition, co-occurring substance use disorder, prior year mental health outpatient visit, prior year mental health/substance use disorder emergency department visit/hospitalization). Results: Following an initial drop of ~20%, by week 16 (one month after the US pandemic start), the weekly AUD outpatient visit rate was similar to pre-pandemic. Telemedicine for AUD care quickly increased: from &lt;2% of AUD outpatient visits pre-pandemic in 2020, to 29.8% within the first week (week 12), peaking week 19 (59.2%), and remaining 45.5%-55.6% through 2020. There was no change in receiving at least one AUD outpatient visit weeks 12-52 in 2019 vs. 2020;nor an association between patient demographic and clinical characteristics and receiving at least one outpatient AUD visit. Discussion (with limitations of the study): Initial US pandemic disruptions in AUD outpatient visits resolved within weeks, largely aided by telemedicine. Demographic and clinical characteristics were not associated with differential changes in receipt of AUD care. Limitations include: (i) an inability to evaluate whether utilization reflects patient needs;(ii) individuals with new onset AUD during the pandemic were not included in the study;(iii) AUD is under-diagnosed in clinical care and claims data;(iv) the data are limited to individuals commercially insured-results may differ among Medicaid and Medicare populations. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Telemedicine quickly diffused into AUD care during the pandemic and minimized care disruptions. Implications for Health Policies: Telemedicine can be a valuable tool to facilitate access to AUD care. Federal, state and health plan policies that enable the continued use of telemedicine should be considered. Implications for Further Research: Additional research is needed to better understand which models of AUD care that incorporate telemedicine improve patient access, equity, and AUD care quality.","Busch, A.

"Psychiatric Emergencies in Los Angeles County During, and After, Initial COVID-19 Societal Restrictions: An Interrupted Time- Series Analysis","Background: In the USA, the early stage of COVID-19 led to stateimposed restrictions on population movement, work activity, and social gatherings. Some research finds that emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric care declined during these restrictions. This work, however, does not control for strong patterning over time in ED visits, does not examine subtypes of ED visits, and does not test whether these visits strongly rose above expected levels after the loosening of societal restrictions. Aims of the study: We improve upon the literature and analyze, in the largest hospital in the most populous county in the US (Los Angeles, California), two COVID-19-related aims. First, we control for strong temporal patterning and test whether psychiatric ED visits fall below expected levels during the 1st stage of strong societal restrictions-and if so, which ED subtypes account for this decline. Second, we test whether psychiatric ED visits rebounded to greater than expected levels after the loosening of societal restrictions. Method: We obtained counts of psychiatric ED visits (66,451 total over 156 weeks, Jan 2018 to Dec 2020) from Los Angeles County and USC (LAC+USC) hospital. We applied Box-Jenkins time series methods to identify and remove autocorrelation in psychiatric ED visits before examining their relation with the 1st stage of societal restrictions (i.e., March 13 to May 8, 2020) as well as the subsequent period of relaxed restrictions (i.e., May 8 to Dec 31, 2020). If results rejected the null, we explored which type of visits (i.e., depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, suicidal ideation, alcohol use, substance use) accounted for the changes. Results: Psychiatric ED visits fell by 58.47 per week during the 1st stage of societal restrictions (SD=17.59, p&lt;.005). This coefficient sums to 526 fewer visits over the 9-week period, accounting for a 13% fall in visits. Alcohol use and anxiety disorder accounted for the largest share of the reduction. After the 1st stage of societal restrictions, however, we observe no ''rebound'' above expected values in psychiatric ED visits overall (coef= -6.89, SD=13.86, p=.60) or by diagnostic subtype. Discussion: Initial societal restrictions due to COVID-19 reduced the demand for psychiatric ED care. However, after the relaxing of societal restrictions, psychiatric ED visits did not experience a compensatory rebound. This pattern of results does not support the speculation that foregone ED care during the initial societal restrictions subsequently led to a psychiatric ''pandemic'' of urgent visits. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: The perturbation of ED visits during COVID-19 societal restrictions does not appear to warrant an increase in psychiatric care teams to meet higher ED demand in the long-run. Implications for Health Policies: If replicated, results should encourage attempts to shift, to non-urgent settings, a portion of psychiatric visits that present in the ED. Implications for Further Research: The effectiveness of alternative treatment modalities during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., telemedicine) in lieu of ED care, as well as a more careful understanding of potential resilience during societal disruptions, merits further investigation.","Bruckner, T.; Das, A.; Ro, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychiatric+Emergencies+in+Los+Angeles+County+During,+and+After,+Initial+COVID-19+Societal+Restrictions:+An+Interrupted+Time-+Series+Analysis","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics; 25(SUPPL 1):S5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34499,""
"Burden of covid-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental health: eating disorders spreading","Adolescents are not an at risk population for severe COVID-19. However, an increase of mental health disorders in this age group were reported. The aim of this study was to compare rates of referred adolescents with eating disorders (ED) requiring inpatient treatment at the University Chil-dren's Hospital Zurich before and during the pandemic. Methods Retrospective data analysis of referred adolescents in need for inpatient treatment because of ED (anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, eating disorders not otherwise specified) between 2019-2021. Inpatients on the pediatric ward (requiring urgent intervention) and those on the psychosomatic ward were evaluated separately. Results Pediatric ward: the rate of adolescent inpatients with eating disorders in-creased significantly in June 2020, shortly after the end of the lockdown: from June - December 2020, admission rates were 67% higher compared to the same time frame in 2019, and the number of treatment days in-creased 76%. Throughout 2021, the average treatment days per month remained high: they were only 6.4% lower (93.6 d/month) compared to June - December 2020 (100.1 d/month). Psychosomatic ward: In 2020, there were 94% more patient referrals for inpatient treatment compared to 2019, and in 2021 115%. Only 38% of referred patients could be accepted for inpatient treatment in 2020, and 47% in 2021, in contrast to 94% in 2019. Discussion Our data show a sharp increase of adolescent inpatients treated for eating disorders shortly after the end of the pandemic lockdown and persisting throughout 2021. This could be a sign of increased vulnerability in this age group. More than 80% of patients mentioned the lockdown with closures of schools, sport clubs and other adolescent meeting venues as inducing fac-tors for developing an eating disorder, possibly associated with the disap-pearance of structures that provide support and regulate self-esteem. In-creased conflicts between family members were also reported. The figures also show an increased shortage of inpatient treatment capac-ity, with long waiting times even before the pandemic, and worsening af-ter the lockdown. The burden of patient and their family was high during the waiting period leading to an excessive demand for outpatient triage clinics.","Beykirch, J.; Gamper, L.; Landolt, M.; Rutishauser, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Burden+of+covid-19+pandemic+on+adolescents'+mental+health:+eating+disorders+spreading","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Swiss Medical Weekly; 152(SUPPL 258):22S, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34500,""

"Impact of covid-19 pandemic in patients with preexisting mental illness visiting outpatient department of tertiary health care centre-a cross sectional observational study","Background-COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. Vulnerability of individuals with pre-existing psychiatric illness was of concern but have been scarcely studied. While there has been extensive work on the effect of pandemic on the mental health of the general population, health care workers, infected persons and survivors, there has been little research on the impact of pandemic on people living with mental illness. Aims-The study aimed to ascertain Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in patients with pre-existing mental illness and their current psychopathology. Methodology - 100 participants aged 18-65 years, who visited Psychiatry OPD, were assessed using semi-structured proforma that included socio-demographic and clinical variables. The psychological impact due to life stress was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale. Current Psycho-pathology was assessed by DASS-21 scale. The perceived loneliness and social isolation were assessed by De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Results-Out of 100 participants, 55% reported to have faced variable degrees of difficulties during pandemic, 64% reported to have worsened mental illness, 40% faced difficulty in accessing medications, resulting in non-compliance. 61% managed to visit hospital during pandemic, while 35% could not access consultation services. Only 4% sought teleconsultation. Psychological impact of COVID was found to be positively correlated with the perceived loneliness and social isolation during quarantine(r=11.619, p=0.01). Conclusion-These results highlight a significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of psychiatric patients and elucidates prominent association with demographic factors and the difficulty to access mental health care. There is need to strengthen telepsychiatry services in recent times.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+covid-19+pandemic+in+patients+with+preexisting+mental+illness+visiting+outpatient+department+of+tertiary+health+care+centre-a+cross+sectional+observational+study","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 64(SUPPL 3):S608-S609, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34504,""

About 51 students (44%) reported they had good concentration during the online courses and 32% answered they had depressive thoughts. Conclusion: The lack of interpersonal communication, lower motivation and concentration are the most significant issues faced by pharmacy students during the pandemic.","Gavazova, E.; Grekova-Kafalova, D.","https://doi.org/10.46542/pe.2022.221.569572","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: PHARMACY EDUCATION; 22(1):569-572, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34511,""
"Os efeitos de intervenÃ§Ãµes baseadas em mindfulness em tempos da COVID-19: uma revisÃ£o sistemÃ¡tica","IntroduÃ§Ã£o: a crise de saÃºde pÃºblica ocasionada pela COVID-19, doenÃ§a causada pelo SARS-CoV-2, impÃ´s ameaÃ§as fÃ­sicas e sofrimento psÃ­quico tanto aos pacientes infectados quanto aos indivÃ­duos que vivenciam o isolamento social e as diversas restriÃ§Ãµes governamentais, propiciando o aparecimento de sintomas de ansiedade, depressÃ£o, alÃ©m de insÃ´nia, estresse e alteraÃ§Ãµes do ritmo biolÃ³gico. Diante desse cenÃ¡rio estressor, as intervenÃ§Ãµes baseadas em atenÃ§Ã£o plena (MBIs), se mostraram ferramentas potencialmente adequadas na reduÃ§Ã£o do sofrimento psicolÃ³gico e na geraÃ§Ã£o de bem-estar da populaÃ§Ã£o em geral. Objetivo: descrever os efeitos das intervenÃ§Ãµes baseadas em mindfulness em tempos da COVID-19. MÃ©todo: foi realizada uma revisÃ£o sistemÃ¡tica da literatura sobre os efeitos da intervenÃ§Ã£o mindfulness em tempos da COVID-19. Os artigos foram pesquisados em quatro bases de dados (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus e Science direct) e o protocolo PRISMA foi utilizado para realizaÃ§Ã£o desta revisÃ£o. No total, quatorze artigos foram incluÃ­dos no estudo. Resultados: a utilizaÃ§Ã£o de tÃ©cnicas de mindfulness na populaÃ§Ã£o com prejuÃ­zos na saÃºde mental em consequÃªncia da pandemia da COVID-19 mostraram-se benÃ©ficas, ocorrendo melhora no escore de estresse emocional e reduÃ§Ã£o dos sintomas de ansiedade, atravÃ©s de prÃ¡ticas formais de meditaÃ§Ã£o tipo mindfulness, como respiraÃ§Ã£o consciente, escaneamento corporal, e aplicaÃ§Ã£o da estratÃ©gia de reduÃ§Ã£o do estresse baseada em atenÃ§Ã£o plena (MBSR). EstratÃ©gias tambÃ©m foram aplicadas atravÃ©s de aplicativos de smartphone que tiveram o objetivo de promover o aumento da atenÃ§Ã£o plena e o desenvolvimento da aceitaÃ§Ã£o, sem julgamentos, das experiÃªncias traumÃ¡ticas jÃ¡ vividas, alÃ©m de intervenÃ§Ã£o integrada na internet com o uso da atenÃ§Ã£o plena, treinamento de relaxamento respiratÃ³rio, habilidades de refÃºgio e mÃ©todo do abraÃ§o de borboleta. ConclusÃ£o: com o perpassar da pandemia, ainda com elevada mortalidade, continuidade dos isolamentos sociais, e, consequentemente, intensificaÃ§Ã£o do sofrimento psÃ­quico na populaÃ§Ã£o e profissionais de saÃºde, as intervenÃ§Ãµes baseadas em atenÃ§Ã£o plena (MBIs) estÃ£o sendo eficazes para diminuir esse sofrimento, prevenir aparecimento de transtornos mentais crÃ´nicos e promover impactos positivos no bem-estar fÃ­sico e mental.Alternate : Introduction: the public health crisis caused by COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has imposed physical threats and psychological suffering on both infected patients and individuals who experience social isolation and various governmental restrictions, leading to the appearance of symptoms like anxiety, depression, as well as insomnia, stress, and changes in biological rhythm. In face of this stressful scenario, interventions based on mindfulness (MBIs) have proved to be potentially adequate tools in reducing psychological suffering and generating well-being in the general population. Objective: to describe the effects of mindfulness-based interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted on the effects of mindfulness intervention in times of COVID-19. The articles were searched in four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Science direct) and the PRISMA protocol was used to conduct this review. In total, fourteen articles were included in the study. Results: the use of mindfulness techniques in the population with impaired mental health because of the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be beneficial, with improvement in emotional stress scores and reduction in anxiety symptoms, through formal mindfulness meditation practices such as mindful breathing, body scanning, and application of the mindfulness-based stress reduction strategy (MBSR). Strategies were also applied through smartphone applications that had the objective of promoting the increase of mindfulness and the development of the acceptance without judgment of the traumatic experiences already lived, in addition to an integrated intervention on the internet with the use of mindfulness, the training of respiratory relaxation, refuge skills and Butterfly Hug Method. Conclusion: with the pandemic going through, still with high mortality, continuity of social isolation, and, consequently, intensification of psychic suffering in the population and health professionals, interventions based on mindfulness (MBIs) are being effective to reduce this suffering, prevent the appearance of of chronic mental disorders and promote positive impacts on physical and mental well-being.","Dara Fernanda Brito, Duarte, Jaiany Rodrigues, LibÃ³rio, Giovana MacÃªdo EgÃ­dio, Cavalcante, Taysa Leite de, Aquino, Larissa de Carvalho, Bezerra, Ana LuÃ­za de Aguiar Rocha, Martin, JoÃ£o Victor Rodrigues de, Lacerda, Friary, Vitor, Juliane dos Anjos de, Paula","https://doi.org/10.36311/jhgd.v32.13313","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Human Growth and Development; 32(2):315-326, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34512,""

"Exposure to COVID-19 Infection and Mortality Rates Among People With Disabilities in South Korea","Background: With the delayed eradication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people with disabilities, a socially vulnerable class of individuals, face aggravated hardships caused by a pause in support services and lack of care due to stricter social distancing policies combined with the challenges of their disabilities. Given this background, we aim to investigate COVID-19 infection rates and mortality among people with disabilities, who face heightened physical and mental health threats amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Gender, age, health insurance premiums, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the severity of the disability, and the type of disability were compared among people with disabilities who had been infected with or died from COVID-19 using the nationally representative National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-COVID database (DB). Results: We found that the COVID-19 infection rate was higher among those with low income, those with severe disability, and those with ""other"" disabilities (i.e., speech disabilities, hepatic dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, facial disfigurement, intestinal fistular/urinary disability, epilepsy, intellectual disability, autistic disorder, and mental disorders). The mortality rate was markedly higher (i.e., 15.90 times higher, odds ratio [OR]: 15.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.16 -41.06) among people aged 80 years or older as compared with those aged 60 years or younger. The odds for mortality were 2.49 times higher (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.33 -4.64) among people with severe disabilities as compared with mild disabilities. Conclusions: Among people with disabilities, we found that COVID-19 infection rates differed according to income level, severity of the disability, and disability type, while the COVID-19 mortality rate differed according to age and severity of the disability.","Jeon, Woo-Hwi, Oh, In-Hwan, Seon, Jeong-Yeon, Kim, Jin-Nam, Park, So-Youn","https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2022.6996","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Health Policy and Management;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34514,""

"Support and Companionship in Virtual Communities: Establishing a COVID-19 Counseling Network for Soldiers and the Collective Healing Phenomenon","Counseling people, particularly those in the military engaged in group living, who are in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge. Therefore, supporting the people in quarantine who are experiencing psychological and interpersonal problems has become a new challenge in military mental health. This study's primary concern was how to overcome the problems caused by physical quarantine. The study subject was a virtual counseling network and its operating experience during the quarantine period in Taiwan amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic. For soldiers who mainly live in groups, this study discussed how the virtual counseling network combined with the existing military support group to determine what influence the network had on people in quarantine. This study found that this group exhibited four types of experiences: togetherness, empathy, confidence, and belonging and cohesion. Such experiences are beneficial for group healing through mutual support and companionship. Collective cohesion and psychological healing can be achieved through a virtual community. This is worthy of attention, particularly in the pandemic or post-pandemic era. Physical isolation has become a fact of life, and such isolation is not just isolation from disease but also between regional boundaries. Counseling and support systems in virtual space or the operation of virtual teams must be considered for the future.","Chiu, P.

"INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL DISTANCE ON PHENOMENOLOGY OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Numerous questions and discussions have been raised regarding the approach that countries have undertaken in order to address the COVID-19 crisis. Problems which had been marginalized during the crisis came to light, such as the phenomenology of criminal offences influenced by the COVID-19. For instance, devastating effects on mental health, stemming from the fact that measures of social distancing and restrictions on freedom of movement led to an increase in depression and anxiety, insomnia and hopelessness. Authors of this paper will try to point out the importance of psychological and social factors in the analysis of the increase and decrease of criminal offences influenced by COVID-19 by analyzing reports and comparing the Republic of Croatia with other countries in the world. The analysis strives to underline the need to adopt better strategies and plans for the purpose of fight against COVID-19 and to mitigate the consequences of its effects.","Gracin, D.; Desic, I.","https://doi.org/10.30925/zpfsr.43.1.9","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: ZBORNIK PRAVNOG FAKULTETA SVEUCILISTA U RIJECI; 43(1):167-187, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34518,""
"EFFECTIVENESS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS EDUCATED BY DISTANCE LEARNING DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A RANDOMIZED- CONTROLLED TRIAL","Introduction: Students educated by distance learning experienced more physical inactivity and poorer quality of life (QOL) due to COVID-19 pandemic. Current study aimed to reveal the impacts of 4-week physical activity counseling (PAC) on step counts, physical activity (PA), anxiety, depression, and QOL in university students. Material and Methods: Students (19.97 +/- 1.14 years) were randomly grouped as PAC (n=15, progressive increases in step counts) or control (n=16, maintaining routine activities). Step count (pedometer applications), PA (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and QOL (Short Form-36) were evaluated remotely. The students were followed up between December 2020 and March 2021. Results: Out of all students (4147.32 +/- 2916.54 steps/day), 29% were inactive;67.7% had anxiety;61.3% were depressed before PAC. After PAC, step count (mean difference (MD): 3999.69 steps/day, Cohen's d=1.8), total walking (MD: 734.15 MET-min/week, Cohen's d=0.4) and total PA (MD: 924.22 MET-min/week, Cohen's d=0.4) scores, and role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and emotional well-being subscales scores of QOL significantly increased in PAC group compared with controls;anxiety scores decreased vice versa (p&lt;0.05). Changes in depression, total vigorous and moderate PA scores, and other QOL subscales scores were similar between groups (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion While PAC, a feasible, effective, and safe method during COVID-19 pandemic, improved anxiety, step count, PA level and QOL in students, PAC did not affect depression and some domains of QOL. Therefore, PAC should be offered to students and explored in other segments of society to prevent long-term effects of COVID-19.","Bargi, G.","https://doi.org/10.30621/jbachs.1027410","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: JOURNAL OF BASIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH SCIENCES; 6(2):40-50, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34519,""
"AN INVESTIGATION OF STRESS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION STATES OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: This study was planned to investigate stress, anxiety, and depression states of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: This research was designed as a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The study group comprised students who were studying at the university, were over the age of 18 years, and agreed to participate in the research. An online survey was introduced to 540 university students (sample). Dependent variables were stress, anxiety, and depression. Independent variables included sociodemographic variables, chronic disease, having acquaintances with a diagnosis of COVID-19, presence of an at-risk individual in the home, participants' thoughts regarding the preventive measures, their hopes for the future, feeling rested upon awakening, and types of anxiety and problems experienced during the COVID-19 period. An introductory information form developed by the research authors was used along with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis VA, Post-Hoc Analysis, Odds Ratio (OR) and The Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient tests were used in the study. Results: The majority of students were women (73.2%);undergraduate students comprised the majority of the sample (64.9%);more than half (54.8%) were ages 20-21 years;and more than a third (34.6%) had a low or very low-income level. Nearly all the students (96.3%) stayed with their families during the pandemic, and one-fifth lived in villages. Related to their situations during the pandemic, most university students reported depression (79.7%), anxiety (61.4%), and stress (68.6%). Sex (p=.001), income (p=.001), chronic disease (p=.001), presence of an at-risk individual (persons with a chronic disease, a healthcare worker, etc.) (p=.025), lack of hope for the future (p=.001), and feeling unwell after sleep (p=.001) were found to be factors affecting the students' DASS-21 total score. A positive correlation was found between future anxiety and depression (rpb=.088, p=.035) as well as future anxiety and stress (rpb=.105, p=.012). Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant psychosocial effect on university students.","Vural, B.

"Depression and eating disorders among health care professionals in Morocco during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: In Morocco, the first confirmed case of COVI D-19 was on March 2nd, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Due to the subsequent increase in confirmed cases in Morocco, a state of medical emergency with lock down was declared on March 20th, 2020. Pandemics, such as COVID-19, may lead to or further exacerbate psychological distress. The pandemic's impact on mental health and eating disorders among health care professionals in Morocco is unknown. The aim of this study was to screen for depression and eating disorders among healthcare workers in Morocco during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a sample of Moroccan healthcare workers via an online platform. The questionnaire included the SCOFF and PHQ-9 screening tools to assess for the presence of depression and eating disorders. A total of 389 questionnaires were completed. Results: Of the participants, 29.3% had moderate to severe depression. Females and older participants had statistically significant higher rates of depression (p=0.012, 0.000, respectively). Eating disorders were present in 42% of our sample. The presence of an eating disorder was more likely among participants that were younger (&lt;22 years old, p=0.01), obese (p=0.009), using cannabis (p=0.009), emotional eating (p&lt;0.001) or diagnosed with depression (p=0.001). Conclusion: The pandemic has negative impacts on mental health and eating behaviors among a sample of Moroccan health care workers. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, both rates of depression and eating disorders increased. This supports the need for increasing access to mental health services among healthcare professionals in Morocco as well as reducing the stigma associated with getting help.","Lahlou, L.; Ziouziou, I.; Abdelnaby, A.; Kharroubi, A.; Wakrim, S.; Mouhadi, K.; Ajdi, F.","https://doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/12155","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE; 19(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34521,""
"The effect of perceived social support and life orientation on anxiety caused by online education in Covid 19 conditions","The Covid-19 pandemic has created a disadvantaged student population due to the sudden obligation for distance learning. Poor performance of online educational tools, risk of transmission and staying at home cause stress and anxiety in students. This research examines the effects of usability and accessibility of the online learning system on students' anxiety in presence of students' perceived social support as well as students' perceived optimistic/pessimistic life orientation. The survey instrument prepared for this purpose includes questions about the online learning system used, Covid-19 anxiety, life orientation and perceived social support. Web-based questionnaires were collected from 5,682 students from different universities and the data was analyzed for the role of social support and life orientation on anxiety caused by stress born of distance learning. Findings show that accessibility has a negative effect on anxiety while the effect of perceived social support on access problems could not be ascertained. It was determined that the optimism dimension had a moderating effect on students ' anxiety and the pessimism dimension had a mediating effect. The research results are consistent with the literature.","Halis, Mine, Yildirim, Duygu","https://doi.org/10.20525/ijrbs.v11i4.1809","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Research in Business and Social Science; 11(4):310-322, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34522,""
"Zoom Fatigue: A Review","Video conferences have helped us to remotely connect study rooms, classrooms, but after attending one or 2 virtual meetings, listening to an online webinar or two, and perhaps speaking, people begin to express feeling exhausted and nervous. [...]a new term emerged, also named after a popular application, resulting from the excessive use of video conferencing platforms: 'Zoom Fatigue'. Due to its rapid spread and high morbidity and mortality rates, it was declared a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020 by the World Health Organization and a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO 2020). In a study, 10,591 participants tested the relationship between videoconference fatigue and five theoretical nonverbal mechanisms (mirror, anxiety, being physically trapped, excessive gazing through a grid of facing faces, and the cognitive load from generating and interpreting nonverbal cues). [...]after attending a few virtual meetings, listening to a few online webinars, and perhaps speaking, people feel exhausted and begin to express that they feel nervous (Epstein 2020). [...]the term 'Zoom Fatigue' has emerged, inspired by the name of a popular application resulting from the excessive use of video conferencing platforms (Wiederhold 2020, Sklar 2020).

"The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on caregivers of family members with mental health issues: the untold story (Special section)","COVID-19 was officially declared as a global pandemic in March 2020, confirming the disease's threat to human health and well-being. Since then, the world is dealing not only with the infections, but also with the negative effects on mental health. Countries have closed their borders in the war against the pandemic, travel between and within the country has been restricted, and life has come to a halt in many parts of the world. The government-imposed limitations in all pandemic-affected nations, including Malaysia, have had an indirect and harmful impact towards the caregivers of family members with depression. This has been the subject of several studies by the researchers. However, there was paucity of information regarding this issue in the Malaysian context. Hence, this article aims to explore the challenges faced by the caregivers before the pandemic, psychological impacts of COVID-19 towards the community and caregivers of family members with mental health issues, as well as the needs to help the latter during the pandemic. To the researcher's knowledge, no such study has been performed in the Malaysian context. Thus, more research on this topic is required in the future.

"Delivery of Digital Mental Health Therapy: Types and Effectiveness","Issues and information on mental health problems are frequently discussed through media channels. However, public awareness on mental health problems is still low. In addition, individuals with a mental health problem refuses to receive treatment. To overcome these problems, professional public health agencies around the world have designed digital mental health therapy. Digital mental health therapy has given a focus to the delivery of psychological and physical health rehabilitation treatments. Although digital mental health therapy has been shown to be effective in improving mental health conditions, however the appropriate type of digital platform used to provide the therapy for a particular type of mental health problem has yet to be studied. Therefore, this article focuses on the types of digital platforms used in therapy of mental health problems and its effectiveness on various aspects of health as well as rehabilitation. In this regard, content analysis of previous studies related to the type of digital platform and its effectiveness are done. The results of the content analysis showed that SMS the most widely used platform to deliver mental health problem therapy followed by smartphone applications, websites and online chat. Overall, the findings from the results of previous studies show positive changes in emotions, thoughts and behaviours. This suggests that mobile therapy for mental health has great potential to be implemented for individuals who have constraints to access in-person therapy or during critical times such as COVID19 pandemic situations which limiting population movement.","Rahman, T.

"How to do social distancing in a shack: COVID-19 in the South African context","Can vaccines be mandated? A scholar of medical ethics, Moodley makes the case for vaccine mandates on the grounds of 'the greater good' argument where individual rights have to be balanced out against co-morbid health in a vulnerable society, high levels of fatigue among health workers, overburdened hospitals, and the risks of non-treatment for other chronic illnesses displaced by the prioritisation of COVID-19 patients. Hoare outlines her lived experience as a liaison psychiatrist working as part of a frontline COVID-team in a large public hospital and explores several important themes, including vulnerability in health care, connection with patient experience, group processing of trauma, reintegration following trauma, and the importance of embedded mental health care in all health systems. The establishment of the DATCOV platform - an active national COVID-19 vaccine surveillance system for COVID-19 hospital admissions in South Africa - transcended the private and public sectors. [...]inequity in quality of health care is alluded to by a 1.5-fold greater risk of death in patients admitted to the public health sector, compared with the private health sector where patients were more likely to be managed in intensive care units and with interventions such as mechanical ventilation.","Jansen, Jonathan, Madhi, Shabir A.","https://doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2022/13989","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: South African Journal of Science; 118(5/6):1-3, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34528,""

"The ethics behind mandatory COVID-19 vaccination AUTHOR: post-Omicron: The South African context","The legitimacy of mandatory vaccine policies is underscored by a public health ethics framework based on the principles of limited autonomy, social justice and the common good. Ideally, vaccine uptake ought to occur on a voluntary basis as an act of solidarity to ensure that everyone is protected. Given that the altruistic approach has failed and vaccine uptake remains sub-optimal in South Africa, in this paper, I argue for vaccine mandates, in a post-Omicron context. This viewpoint is substantiated by several considerations. Healthcare workers are fatigued after 2 years of treating COVID-19 and many are still treating patients with post-viral syndromes, mental health conditions and cardiovascular complications. Health systems remain under pressure as people with non-COVID diseases, neglected during the pandemic, are also now presenting to medical practices and hospitals. Although South Africa has emerged from a relatively less severe fourth wave of COVID-19, there have been many deaths. Vaccine and natural immunity in a relatively young general population has been advantageous. However, the country has a high prevalence of HIV and those who are untreated may not be able to clear the coronavirus easily. Similarly chronic illnesses place many at risk for severe disease from COVID variants, especially if unvaccinated. The future is shrouded in uncertainty. The next variant could be similar to or less severe than Omicron, yet still impact negatively on health systems, education and the economy. Physical distancing is not ideal in many low socio-economic settings, making vaccines an important component of our prevention toolbox. Our safest option now is to ensure that as many South Africans as possible are vaccinated and receive boosters. Vaccine mandates work to achieve this end.","Moodley, Keymanthri","https://doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2022/13239","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: South African Journal of Science; 118(5/6):1-6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34530,""
"Effect of Game-based Learning using Live Streaming on Learners' Interest, Immersion, Satisfaction, and Instructors' Perception","Many people have preconceived notions about games and distrust the effects of game-based learning and show negative attitudes. In fact, there are limitations and disadvantages of game-based learning, and it is difficult to overcome them. More than half of the inconveniences or problems of teachers who want to try game-based learning revealed by the 2009 survey have not been solved yet. Due to the sudden spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Education has issued a policy to convert classes at schools and academies into non-face-to-face. Non-face-to-face classes have the characteristics that instructors and learners will be spatially separated, spatially simultaneous, interactive, and teaching and learning behavior will be mediated by the screen. And these features are common to live streaming. Taking advantage of this, this study aims to approach improving the perception of game-based learning as an advantage of ""watching games"" beyond ""playing games"" by using live streaming for game-based learning. This study conducted game-based learning and game streaming learning for 210 third-year middle school students, compared the effects of game-based learning on learning interest, immersion, and satisfaction with the results of previous studies to verify the design and prove the combined effect of live streaming and game-based learning. In addition, in-depth interviews with instructors who conducted game-based learning confirmed that awareness of the introduction, value, and finance of game-based learning improved.","Lee, W.

"Confidence and attitudes of the citizens of the Republic of Croatia towards the sources and information about the COVID-19 virus","In the first part an overview of initial social and behavioural studies on the topic of the pandemic caused by the spread of the COVID-19 virus was presented. These studies were conducted in the early stages of the pandemic (Mar/Apr 2020) and they address various aspects of the impact of a COVID-19 pandemic: knowledge and information assessments, risk perception, assessments of citizens' willingness to adapt and change their lifestyle to prevent the spread of the virus, and the impact of the pandemic's social implications on the mental health and well-being of citizens. In the second part, the results of our research were presented. The research was based on a questionnaire conducted on a sample of 1,010 adult citizens of Croatia. The aim was to determine which sources of information about the COVID-19 virus citizens trust the most, what kind of information they trust and what the indications are for long-term mental adjustment to life with the virus. The results showed that citizens are most inclined to trust their family and friends and to a lesser extent, doctors and experts. In addition, the citizens of the Republic of Croatia are generally not inclined to relativize the danger of the virus - they do not perceive it as a common flu that is only dangerous for the elderly population. They are also not inclined to believe that COVID-19 is merely a fabrication by the Government or the pharmaceutical industry. We also found very low confidence in media information about the virus. Nevertheless, citizens are still inclined to seek out information about the virus. Finally, citizens show a willingness for mental adaptation, i.e., they have mostly come to terms with the idea that the virus will remain present in the long run, with the need to adapt to a new way of life.","Prpic, Hrvoje, KuciÅ¡, Vlasta","https://doi.org/10.15847/obsOBS16220221903","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Observatorio (OBS); 16(2):44, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34532,""
"Pandemic, (post) neoliberalism, and helplessness of street vendors in Mexico","Based on ethnographic work and the analysis of social programs and public speeches, I examine the relationship between governmental measures and the (re)production or containment of conditions of inequality experienced by street vendors in Mexico City during the COVID-19 pandemic. I argue that from the president's office the symbolic violence of discourses (linked to urban neoliberalism) that stigmatize workers given their structural impossibility of complying with confinement norms was confronted. However, it was precisely the structural economic violence which was not contained by social policies that effectively suspend the workers' dependence on the market, especially during the moments of greatest risk and major restrictions on economic activities. This forced them to go out to the streets in search for income, thus failing to comply with the official regulations and exposing them to illness, as well as to administrative sanctions and police repression for working.","Moctezuma-Mendoza, V.","https://doi.org/10.15446/bitacora.v32n2.99829","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: BITACORA URBANO TERRITORIAL; 32(2):185-197, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34533,""
"Investigating Distorted Thinking Patterns and Psychological Distress in Students taking Online Education during COVID-19 Outbreak","Purpose: The objective of this study was to assess the predictive association between distorted thinking patterns and psychological distress (depression, stress, anxiety) in university e-learners during COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: In this correlational study, 643 participants between age18 to 29 years (M= 21.27, SD+4.06) participated online through convenient sampling technique. They were sent an online google questionnaire, including the informed consent form, the depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS-21), and cognitive distortions scale in Urdu, which assessed the distorted thinking patterns of adults. Findings: Analysis through Pearson product moment correlation revealed that the distorted thinking patterns of predictive thinking, rigid thinking and stress-creating thinking pattern had a strong positive association with depression, stress, and anxiety. The distorted thinking pattern of self-criticism/selfblame also had a strong positive association with depression and stress, and a moderate positive association with anxiety. Multiple stepwise regression was performed to calculate the predictive association between distorted thinking patterns and psychological distress of university students seeking digital education during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analysis revealed that distorted thinking patterns of stress-creating thinking, self-criticism/self-blame, and predictive thinking are predictors of depression. However, stress-creating thinking was the strongest predictor of depression. Stress-creating thinking, predictive thinking, and rigid thinking were predictors of anxiety in university students during online education and stress-creating thinking is the strongest predictor of anxiety as well. Moreover, the distorted thinking patterns of stress creating thinking, self-criticism/self-blame, and rigid thinking strongly predicted stress in university students engaged in distant education during the COVID-19 outbreak. Implications to Research and Practice: The study's findings emphasize the role of distorted thinking patterns in the stress experience of students during COVID and encourage teachers and universities to consider the findings while developing an online education system for the students.

"TRADE RESTRICTIONS IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19: A GATT PERSPECTIVE","The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the early 2020 prompted many developing and developed countries to impose trade restrictions with the objective of ensuring domestic supply. Most of these restrictions were on the import and export of medical supplies and agricultural goods. This paper examines the nature of various international trade measures adopted worldwide between the months of March and June 2020, and attempts to contextualize them in the background of rising neo-nationalism. Further, the paper analyses the legality of the measure adopted with reference to the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Three major exemptions to prohibition on imposition of trade restrictive measures are studied;namely, measures imposed to relieve a critical shortage, measures imposed for protection of public health, and measures necessary to ensure national and international security. The paper also sheds light on the modern world's experience with trade protectionisms during the Great Depression & Global Financial Crisis in order to draw some parallels with the current trade patterns. It is seen that the GATT framework would accommodate many of the trade restrictions that were imposed in early months of 2020, as long as they were imposed in a non-discriminatory manner and for a short period of time. Thus, the legal framework for international trade proves incapable of ensuring free trade in times of global crises like a pandemic. Nevertheless, these measures hold the potential for new interpretations of critical GATT provisions. As far as the impact of these measures on developing and least developed countries are concerned, a case can be made for relaxed export restrictions. Seeing that a change in the GATT framework might not be a completely viable suggestion, the paper argues for a strict interpretation of GATT exceptions in a way that right to health is upheld and is at the crux of every trade policy adopted in times of a health emergency like this. The paper concludes with exploring the role of international cooperation in trade as a key aspect of tackling consequences of the pandemic.","Vasmatkar, A.

The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of Covid-19 on the learning of university students in Andalusia, and how psychosocial (fear of Covid-19, life satisfaction, stress, uncertainty), learning (learning strategies, motivation, study time and habits, facilitating conditions, self-regulation) and socio-demographic factors (gender, age, course, address, scholarship, future employment, mobility, dropout) have been influenced. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study design was applied based on the distribution of an online survey. A total of 1873 university students, aged between 17 and 59 years (M = 22.42, SD = 4.45) participated in the study. The results revealed that: 1) the pandemic has affected students differently depending on the population strata to which they belong;2) there has been an increase in the levels of stress and uncertainty affecting students' mental health;3) academic dropout is a factor that has been and is present during the incidence of the pandemic;4) learning has been affected by the pandemic due to fear and uncertainty which has had a significant impact on students' motivation and self-regulation.

"Evaluation of the political psychological reflections of the COVID-19 process in the context of Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic, with its rapid contagion and deadly effect, emerged in China and surrounded the whole world. This pandemic, unlike other pandemics has emerged in the global age. Due to the disappearance of borders as a result of globalization, both the physiological and psychological spread of the virus has been rapid. The transmission of the Covid-19 virus through contact and droplets has provided its physiological spread, while digital media channels have provided its psychological spread. The negativities experienced in health, economy, politics and cultural structures have shaken the societies in the context of political-psychology. Anxiety and fear caused by the pandemic have negatively affected the psychology of individuals and therefore the whole society. In this study, the effects of the COVID-19 process on Turkey and how Turkey responded to the pandemic were tried to be evaluated in the context of political psychology. By examining the researches published in the process, the improvements made in the field of health against the pandemic, the regulations covering the whole society and the measures to overcome the process with the least damage were mentioned. It has been concluded that, as a result of the negative factors that directly affect mental health such as compulsory social isolation, losses, death anxiety brought by the pandemic, as well as processes such as unemployment and bankruptcy caused by inadequate socio-economic policies, a pandemic of mental disorders may occur in future.","Koprulu, G.; Ak, M.","https://doi.org/10.5505/kpd.2022.16779","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: KLINIK PSIKIYATRI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY; 25(2):209-218, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34537,""

"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection-Related Stigma, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Iranian Healthcare Workers","Background: Psychological conditions aggravate during outbreaks. Here, we have discussed the existing COVID-19 depression, anxiety, and stress and the resulting stigma and its different aspects in Iranian health care workers and their 1st-degree relatives. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, information of our study groups (237 participants including health care workers and their nuclear family members) was collected via two online stigma and depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS) questionnaires. Results: The DASS questionnaire's mean depression, anxiety, and stress scores were 13.59 Â± 5.76, 11.07 Â± 4.38, and 15.05 Â± 5.86, respectively, in our study population. Marriage status was effective on depression and stress scores. Married participants were having less depression (P = 0.008) but more stressful (P = 0.029) than single ones. Education was found to be effective on anxiety and stress scores. Those with an associate, master, Ph.D., and higher college degrees were significantly less anxious and stressed than those with a diploma or bachelor's degrees (P = 0.032 and 0.016, respectively, for anxiety and stress). Participants with a history of psychiatric conditions showed significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress rates than those without a past psychiatric condition (P = 0.001). Healthcare workers and their nuclear family members suffer from severe stigma (mean stigma scores were 33.57 and 33.17, respectively). Conclusions: Healthcare workers and their nuclear family members in Iran suffer from severe COVID-19 related stigma. We also showed that depression, anxiety, and stress are common among Iranian Healthcare workers and their nuclear family members during this pandemic. This study showed that people with preexisting psychiatric conditions need extra mental care during the pandemic.

"Coping with chronic stress during COVID-19 and beyond - A faith perspective","Spiritual coping has been defined as an individual's ability to utilise faith in God combined with certain Christian beliefs and religious practices to appraise, understand, and effectively cope with stress. We aimed to show the Christian how specific spiritual coping strategies and religious practices could be used to effectively assess and handle chronic stress from a faith perspective amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and beyond. A literature study was conducted to identify positive and negative coping strategies during the COVID-19 era and highlighted the adverse effects of chronic stress and defensiveness. Recent findings on religion, the validated bio-engineered chronic stress phenotype, the Coping Strategy Indicator (CSI), Africultural Coping Systems Inventory (ACSI) and the effect of spiritual coping skills were assessed. In addition, certain Bible passages and theological perspectives regarding spiritual coping were explored to identify traces of the fight-or-flight response in the Garden of Gethsemane. The novel chronic stress phenotype reflecting stroke risk, could determine the prevalence of chronic stress. Positive coping strategies were identified, to show how positive spiritual coping skills could be utilised from a faith perspective, in coping with chronic stress amid COVID-19 and beyond. The Believe-Belong-Behave pastoral model, consisting of individual skills, corporate practices, and practical action steps, showed the Christian how certain spiritual coping skills and practices could be implemented during stress coping. The scriptural insights gained from this study, combined with the pastoral model reviewed, could offer a harmonious contribution toward the Christian's ability to utilise spiritual coping strategies amid COVID-19 chronic stress-induced symptoms and complexities. Contribution: This article used an inter-disciplinary approach to compare recent findings within Theology, Neurophysiology, Bio-engineering, and Psychology regarding religion, stress-phenotyping, positive stress-coping and mental health. The scriptural foundation encouraged a faith-in-action response to chronic stress during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","le Roux, S.; Denton, R. A.; Malan, L.; Malan, N.

"Experiences of wellbeing and resilience among refugee mothers and families in Calgary during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of participation in HIPPY, a home visiting program","In order to provide meaningful and effective support to refugees in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during post-pandemic recovery efforts, it is critical to explore the experiences of refugee mothers and families during the pandemic, and to identify sources of resilience that can be leveraged to promote individual and household wellbeing. From November 2020 to June 2021, we conducted in-depth interviews with mothers from refugee backgrounds (n = 28) who resettled in Calgary, Alberta and are currently participating in the Multicultural Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) program. Interviews were conducted virtually using Microsoft Teams;we sought to better understand the pathways and barriers to wellbeing experienced by refugee mothers during the pandemic. The results indicate that the refugee mothers and families in our study experienced widespread disruptions to education and employment and increased motherhood burden, contributing to diminished wellbeing. Mental health was further impacted by heightened levels of worry, stress and social isolation, as well as intense fear pertaining to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Some mothers reported experiencing barriers to accessing healthcare services and reliable health information during the pandemic. In the face of these challenges, the mothers demonstrated great resilience and identified tangible individual, household and extra-household factors and resources that supported them in coping with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our findings suggest that participation in HIPPY played a significant role in fostering the resilience of the participating mothers and families during the pandemic, speaking to the potential of home visiting intervention models in mitigating household hardship during current and future public health crises.","Zivot, C.; Dewey, C.; Brockington, M.; Nwebube, C.; Asfour, G.; Vattikonda, N.; Bell, D.; Srinivasan, S.; Little, M.","https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2022036","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: AIMS PUBLIC HEALTH; 9(3):521-541, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34541,""
"Mental Health Treatment for College Students on Campus: Evolving to Meet the Growing Need","Higher education has traditionally promoted increased opportunities for young people to gain technical and occupational skills for personal advancement. Matriculation to postsecondary education often coincides with a developmental period associated with increased rates of behavioral health conditions, including major mental illness and substance use disorders. Studies have shown that rates during the past decade of both mental illness and treatment use are increasing in this group. Ideally, colleges and universities need to address the unique mental health needs of this growing population using evidenced-based approaches. Various evidence-informed models and novel interventions exist to help both students and schools prepare to meet these growing needs. Continued engagement and outreach to transition-age youth who may struggle with academic persistence for a multitude of reasons will be important to maintain diversity and equity in institutions of higher learning.

"Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Older Adult Population: Data from the LOST in Lombardia Study","Most COVID-19 fatalities have occurred among older adults;however, evidence regarding the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population is limited. Telephone interviews were conducted in November 2020 with a representative sample of 4400 Italians aged &ge;65 years from the Lombardy region. We determined the prevalence of a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through unconditional multiple logistic regression models, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of infection and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We further evaluated whether infection was related to a reduction in mental wellbeing. Of the participants, 4.9% reported a previous infection. No significant relationship between sex and infection was observed. Prior infection was less frequently reported in subjects aged &ge;70 (OR = 0.55;95% CI: 0.41&ndash;0.74) compared to 65&ndash;69 years, with no trend after 70 years of age. Those with at least one chronic condition reported a lower infection rate compared to healthy subjects (OR = 0.68;95% CI: 0.49&ndash;0.93). Participants who lived alone more frequently reported infection than those who cohabited (OR = 2.33;95% CI: 1.29&ndash;4.20). Prior infection was related to increased depressive symptoms (OR = 1.57;95% CI: 1.17&ndash;2.10).

"Prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Meta-Analysis Attending SDG 3 and 4 of the 2030 Agenda","Background: Most universities around the world have been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Many students were isolated at home and underwent a forced transition from face-to-face learning to e-learning, at least in the first few months. The subsequent months and years were typically characterised by a slow return to normal learning under COVID-19 protocols and restrictions. A potential consequence of the lockdowns, social restrictions and changes to learning is the development of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) in university students, affecting their health and well-being (SDG3) and quality of education (SDG4). Materials and Methods: Medline was searched through PubMed for studies on the prevalence of PTSD in university students from 1 December 2019 to 31 December 2021. The pooled prevalence of PTSD was calculated with random-effects models. Results: A total of six studies were included, across which the prevalence of PTSD among university students was 23%. Meta-regression showed that the prevalence of PTSD was significantly higher with older age, but independent of the percentage of women in a study or its methodological quality. Conclusions: Our results suggest that students suffer from PTSD at a moderate rate. Measures are needed to address the mental health issues of university students that have arisen during COVID-19 all around the world.","Idoiaga, Nahia, Legorburu, Idoia, Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara, Lipnicki, Darren M.; Villagrasa, Beatriz, SantabÃ¡rbara, Javier","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14137914","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(13):7914, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34544,""
"Online Learning Self-Efficacy as a Mediator between the Instructional Interactions and Achievement Emotions of Rural Students in Elite Universities","Previous research has shown that social capital (teachersâ€™ and peersâ€™ interaction) is a challenge for rural students in Chinaâ€™s elite universities due to underlying issues of online learning self-efficacy (OLSE) and the quality of interaction. To understand how interaction quality is influenced, the present study drew on the achievement emotion theory to explore the mediating role of OLSE between social interactions (teacherâ€“student, studentâ€“student) and achievement emotions (enjoyment, hopelessness, shame). Data were collected using an online questionnaire with a sample of rural students studying at elite universities (n = 479) in China.

(2) Methods: Here, 10,210 online questionnaires from 3 junior high schools in Xiâ€™an and Hanzhong from 23 to 27 February 2020, were collected to explore the impact of family factors on childrenâ€™s mental health in Northwest China during home quarantine based on the ecosystem theory, by using OLS, logit regression models, and the Shapley value decomposition method. (3) Results: The mental health of northwestern Chinese children changed significantly after home quarantine. We also found that during home quarantine, some factors, such as a high-income family, lack of siblings, living with parents, mothers with middle- or high-level occupations, frequent parentâ€“child communication, and better parentâ€“child relationships, were positively related to childrenâ€™s mental health. (4) Conclusions: Different from previous studies, this paper found that the psychological condition of children in Northwest China tended to be improved during the epidemic. In addition, family factors, especially the parentâ€“child interaction, played an important role in the mental health of children during the epidemic.","Jin, Xiaoyi, Dong, Yitong, Du, Wei","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14127202","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(12):7202, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34546,""
"Cleaning in Times of Pandemic: Perceptions of COVID-19 Risks among Workers in Facility Services","Cleaning services are a transversal activity that guarantees the proper functioning and conditions of safety, hygiene, and health across all economic sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the need for clean, sanitary spaces, particularly in health services and other areas with a large number of people. The workers in these services were often placed on the frontline without any specific training or information. Their low average schooling aggravated this situation. Therefore, exploring these workers' perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential influence on their mental health was the primary goal of our research. Structured interviews were conducted based on questionnaires in a sample of 436 women. Their characterisation focused on three aspects related to the pandemic. First, to prevent infecting others (85.5%) and that people close to them could die (86.0%) were the dominant concerns;second, the feeling of permanent vigilance was mentioned (56.2%);and third, the fear of not getting medical care (60.7%). Thus, the workers felt there was a need for more dissemination of individual protection measures, as well as more training, better general working conditions, and access to psychological counselling.","Dias, Isabel, Lopes, Alexandra, Azevedo, JosÃ©, Maia, Ana Sofia, Baptista, JoÃ£o Santos","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11070276","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(7):276, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34547,""
"Embitterment during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Reaction to Injustice, Humiliation, and Breach of Trust","The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had an impact on the health of many people, but also on politics, the economy, and everyday life at large. It has been shown that some people respond with anxiety and depression, which is not surprising. Another reaction in the context of COVID-19 is embittered fights and disruptions between family members, friends, and neighbors, but also problems on a societal and political level, mutual public insults, political demonstrations, and even aggressive outbursts with a high number of participants. This calls for a separate explanation. One trigger may be embitterment, an emotion known to anybody in reaction to injustice, humiliation, and breach of trust, in association with helplessness. It comes along with a nagging desire to fight back and is usually accompanied by aggressive fantasies and combatively impulses towards the wrongdoer. This emotion also spreads indiscriminately to other people and the world. There are few initial studies which show that there is a significant increase in the rate of embitterment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased embitterment was related to financial losses, concern about restricted societal freedom, job insecurity, oppositional attitudes, helplessness, dissatisfaction with life, and inclination to join anti-COVID-19 demonstrations. These findings suggest that it is important to foster resilience against stressors, be it because of the virus itself, restrictions in daily freedom, negative comments by other persons, or imbalanced press releases. Of importance is also to abstain from insulting comments towards people who do not follow the mainstream, to allow adjustment of rules to given situations, and to take people along by listening to their grievances, instead of leaving demonstrations on the street as the only method to voice concerns.","Linden, Michael, Arnold, Christopher P.; Muschalla, Beate","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint3030016","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 3(3):206-211, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34548,""
"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Insomnia in Military Personnel: A Retrospective Study during the Second COVID-19 Epidemic Wave in Peru","Studies in military personnel are scarce and have reported increased rates of medical consultations and insomnia. The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a number of factors that increase the prevalence of insomnia, which has established consequences in the military. However, reported data are from different settings. We aimed to identify the prevalence and factors associated with insomnia during the second COVID-19 epidemic wave in Lambayeque, Peru. A retrospective study in 566 participants was conducted face-to-face in November 2021. The dependent variable was insomnia, measured with the Insomnia Severity Index. The independent variables were socio-labor variables, physical activity, food insecurity, eating behavior disorder, fear of COVID-19, and resilience. The prevalence of insomnia was 23% (95% CI: 19.6&ndash;26.7%). In multivariate analysis, insomnia was associated with a personal history of mental health (PR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01&ndash;2.93), food insecurity (PR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.05&ndash;1.95), fear of COVID-19 (PR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.87&ndash;3.54), and high resilience (PR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42&ndash;0.86). Overall, the Peruvian military population presents a high prevalence of insomnia during the pandemic period. Special attention should be paid to factors that influence insomnia. Prevention and promotion programs should be established to reverse this negative trend in the military.","Valladares-Garrido, Mario J.; PicÃ³n-ReÃ¡tegui, Cinthia Karina, Zila-Velasque, J.

"A Bibliographic Analysis of Primary Studies on Physical Activity and COVID-19 during 2020&ndash;2021","Physical distancing and restrictions have been implemented to reduce the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In contrast, the impact of the pandemic on levels of physical activity has been the subject of studies worldwide. Since the first reported case in December 2019, the number of scientific studies on COVID-19 has grown in a way that has never been seen before. The current study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis of primary studies on physical activity and COVID-19 during the first two years of the pandemic. The search was carried out using the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. Our analysis identified a total of 2023 published documents from 10,199 authors, with an annual growth rate of 330% between 2020 and 2021. Open-access scientific journals were the main sources of publication, and the level of collaboration among the most influential researchers contributed to productivity. A co-occurrence analysis of the authors' keywords indicated a high prevalence of themes related to mental health, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep, and quality of life. In conclusion, the bibliometric analysis revealed a high volume of primary studies on physical activity and COVID-19 during the first two years of the pandemic, and mental health was a much discussed topic.","Ciuldim, Melissa, Verlengia, Rozangela, Crisp, Alex Harley","https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia3030024","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Epidemiologia; 3(3):314-322, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34550,""
"The Challenges of Modular Learning in the Wake of COVID-19: A Digital Divide in the Philippine Countryside Revealed","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is a global health crisis that has affected educational systems worldwide. North Eastern Mindanao State University (NEMSU), a typical countryside academic institution in the Southern Philippines, did not escape this dilemma. The advent of remote learning to continue the students' learning process has caused difficulties for both the students and the educational institutions. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the students' level of submission of assigned tasks from printed remote learning modular materials under the College of Teacher Education of NEMSU. We evaluated whether the distance of students' residences to the campus or the nearest online learning facilities affects the level of modular task retrievals. We also determined the current situation, challenges, and struggles of the students with remote learning. Our results showed that out of 392 printed learning modules sent to Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) students, 299 or 76% were retrieved. There were also 292 Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED) students who received the learning modules, and 237, or 81%, complied with their tasks. We found that 68% of the total number of students reside within a &lt;30 km radius, while 32% were within a 30&ndash;40 km radius. We also found that the distance of their residences from the NEMSU campus slightly affected the percentage of modular learning material retrievals for both the BEED and BSED students, with R2 = 0.38 and R2 = 0.07, respectively. Nonstructured interview results showed that most students were constrained by many challenges and struggles in complying with the tasks. These include internet connectivity problems, inadequate learning resources, difficulty understanding the module contents and assessment instructions, overloaded remote learning tasks, poor learning environment, and mental health problems. This study also revealed that the country's digital divide became more apparent as we navigated this new mode of the remote learning system.","Bustillo, Ermelyn, Aguilos, Maricar","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12070449","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(7):449, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34551,""
"Understanding Sensitization, Cognitive and Neuropathic Associated Mechanisms behind Post-COVID Pain: A Network Analysis","This study aimed to describe a network including demographic, sensory-related, psychological/cognitive and other variables in individuals with post-COVID pain after hospitalization. Demographic (i.e., age, height, weight, months with symptoms), sensory-related (Central Sensitization Inventory -CSI-, Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms -S-LANSS-, PainDETECT), psychological/cognitive (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale -HADS-A/HADS-D-, Pain Catastrophizing Scale -PCS-, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia -TSK-11-) and other (sleep quality and health-related quality of life -EQ/5D/5L) variables were collected in 146 COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID pain. A network analysis was conducted to quantify the adjusted correlations between the modelled variables, and to assess their centrality indices (i.e., the connectivity with other symptoms in the network and the importance in the system modelled as network). The network revealed associations between sensory-related and psychological/cognitive variables. PainDETECT was associated with S-LANSS (&rho;: 0.388) and CSI (&rho;: 0.207). Further, CSI was associated with HADS-A (&rho;: 0.269), TSK-11 (&rho;: 0.165) and female gender (&rho;: 0.413). As expected, HADS-A was associated with HADS-D (&rho;: 0.598) and TSK-11 with PCS (&rho;: 0.405). The only negative association was between sleep quality and EQ-5D-5L (&rho;: &minus;0.162). Gender was the node showing the highest strength, closeness, and betweenness centralities. In addition, CSI was the node with the second highest closeness and betweenness centralities, whereas HADS-D was the node with the second highest strength centrality. This is the first study applying a network analysis for phenotyping post-COVID pain. Our findings support a model where sensitization-associated symptoms, neuropathic phenotype, and psychological aspects are connected, reflecting post-COVID pain as a nociplastic pain condition. In addition, post-COVID pain is gender dependent since female sex plays a relevant role. Clinical implications of current findings, e.g., developing treatments targeting these mechanisms, are discussed.","FernÃ¡ndez-de-las-PeÃ±as, CÃ©sar, Herrero-Montes, Manuel, Cancela-Cilleruelo, Ignacio, RodrÃ­guez-JimÃ©nez, Jorge, ParÃ¡s-Bravo, Paula, Varol, Umut, del-Valle-Loarte, Pablo, Flox-BenÃ­tez, Gema, Arendt-Nielsen, Lars, Valera-Calero, Juan A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12071538","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diagnostics; 12(7):1538, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34552,""
"In Whose Best Interest? Parental Hesitancy toward the COVID-19 Vaccine for Children in Japan: A Literature Survey Study","In early February 2022, the Japanese government sent COVID-19 vaccine vouchers to children ages 5&ndash;11. Using keywords obtained from the voucher, the frequently asked questions section, and experts, we descriptively analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of vaccination for children and their parents through a web-based literature survey of media articles and government homepage statements in Japan. For children, vaccination helps prevent severe symptoms and may be particularly beneficial for children in low-income families by lowering the rate of suicide and at-home child abuse. For parents, not vaccinating their child allows them to fulfill a more traditional role as a parent (mothers in particular), reduces the gender gap for mothers, and provides greater peace of mind about their child's future fertility. We also examined the governmental vaccination campaigns targeting children from public health perspectives. We argue that the letter accompanying the vaccine voucher should clearly emphasize that further transmission will be prevented, reducing domestic infection. In addition to the biological dimensions of COVID-19 in Japan, we emphasize cultural issues and hope that these can be useful for other countries as they create their own vaccination strategies. Public health in Japan could be promoted if all citizens, regardless of age, acquired fundamental knowledge and skills, the motivation to learn, and the ability to utilize knowledge and skills and think, judge, and express personal ideas.","Takahashi, Shizuko, Nakazawa, Eisuke, Akabayashi, Akira","https://doi.org/10.3390/covid2070060","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: COVID; 2(7):827-836, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34553,""
"Mediating Effect of Psychological Process Variables on the Relationship between Dysfunctional Coping and Psychopathologies: A Comparative Study on Psychopathologies during COVID-19","The COVID-19 crisis has had repercussions on global mental wellbeing. This study aimed: (1) to identify the mediating role of psychological process variables, namely psychological mindedness, psychological mindfulness, and psychological inflexibility on the relationship between dysfunctional coping and psychopathologies in Indonesian undergraduate students subjected to national quarantine orders throughout July, 2020 and (2) to compare the level of anxiety, depression, and anxiety between Indonesian and Malaysian undergraduate students. A cross-sectional study was performed with 869 Indonesian undergraduate students from Nahdlatul Ulama University of Surabaya (UNUSA) and 515 undergraduate students from Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS). The BIPM, MAAS, AAQ-I, DASS-21, and Brief COPE were used to assess the research variables. The proportion who scored 'moderate';and above for depression, anxiety, and stress were 20.2%, 25.0%, and 14.2%, respectively, in Malaysian samples and 22.2%, 35.0%, and 23.48% in Indonesian samples. In Study 1, psychological mindedness, psychological mindfulness, and psychological inflexibility significantly mediated the relationship between dysfunctional coping and psychopathologies. In Study 2, Indonesians demonstrated significantly higher anxiety and stress compared to Malaysian samples. Despite the contrasting COVID-19 situations in Malaysia and Indonesia, psychopathologies were more affected in Indonesia. Hence, our study suggests how crucial it is for mental health providers to consider promoting psychological mindedness, psychological mindfulness, and psychological flexibility to alleviate the corresponding psychopathologies among undergraduate students.","Hambali, Nurfarah Lydia, Ayu, Friska, Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping, Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin Mohd, Algristian, Hafid, Sahri, Moch.; Giloi, Nelbon, Rahim, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul, Omar, Azizan, Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree, Wider, Walton","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12070206","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(7):206, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34554,""
"Suffering and smiling: Nigerians' humorous response to the coronavirus pandemic","Nigerians have intriguing penchant for humour even in moments of life tribulations, grief and uncertainties. They tend to defy being overwhelmed by sorrow, fear or even their helplessness in the face of adversity. Consequently, despite the global hysteria that has trailed the outbreak of the dreaded coronavirus, Nigerians stoically manage their grief through humour. The growing predilection for humour production and consumption in the country, which is partly occasioned by the advent of social media and an unprecedented growth of the Night of a Thousand Laughs (a stand-up comedy industry), deserves scholarly attention on account of its social and mental health impacts. This work blends Freudian psychoanalysis with Merton's functional analysis to build a framework of analysis that captures the psychogenesis and consequences of Nigerians' humorous response to the coronavirus pandemic. Semiotic method was used to analyse some selected humorous memes, cartoons, pictures and videos on or about COVID-19 obtained from WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube between March and August, 2020. In so doing, these humorous stuffs were subjected to both broad and context specific analyses. It was found that although the humours were expressed in different styles, they are mostly aggressive (intended to ridicule their leaders using satire, sarcasm), and self-enhancing (used as mechanisms to cope with boredom and anxiety occasioned by the pandemic) and, in a few cases, self-defeating (involved self-mockery: use of remarks that are self-demeaning or self-disparaging). The article concludes that the COVID-19-induced humours are a route to their peddlers' unconscious realm and a defence mechanism to anxiety, stress and boredom. While the spread of these jokes has manifest function of self-enhancing, their latent consequence is that they trivialize the pandemic and, by extension, make people reluctant to take precautionary measures and comply with the established guidelines and protocols.","Ali, A.","https://doi.org/10.1386/jams_00076_1","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: JOURNAL OF AFRICAN MEDIA STUDIES; 14(2):245-256, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34555,""
"An Evaluation of the Referral Process From General Practice (Gp) to the North-West Community Mental Health Team (Nw Cmht)","AimsAs more emphasis is placed on a move from the traditional hospital-based practice to care in the community, CMHTs are becoming the main channel for delivering specialist care in England. Access to most CMHTs occurs via written referrals, which vary significantly in content and quality. Such variability and inconsistency with the information provided can impact on the triage process and delay access to treatment for patients, making the process unnecessarily protracted and time consuming. One key factor that would drive the success and survival of CMHTs is how they gate-keep their service. This starts by adopting formal strategies when vetting and screening referrals. The aims were to determine if NW CMHT is responding to referrals appropriately, to consider if service users received good quality correspondence about referral decisions and if the outcomes of such meetings were properly documented.MethodsThe NW CMHT consists of 4 pods (A to D) and the audit included all GP referrals assessed by pod B over a month. A sample size of 28 referrals was included in the audit and the referrals were from 16 different GP practices. Data were obtained from patient electronic records and entered onto a SmartSurvey form for ease of collection prior to results being analysed.Results32% of referrals came from two GP surgeries. Areas of good practice included all referrals being discussed within 4 days of receipt, and 50% reviewed by the next day. For referrals identified as needing further information and discussion, this was also done quickly between 2â€“5 days of receiving the referral. Also 68% of service users (SU) had a letter sent out to them within 2â€“5 days. It was unclear in 75% of referrals whether the SU was aware of the referral to NW CMHT and the reasons for the referral were only â€˜fullyâ€™ documented in 57%.ConclusionThe vast majority of GP referrals were treated in a timely manner, even if additional data gathering was needed and multiple referral discussions had. Recommendations included addressing the lack of consistency in documentation of referral discussions, developing effective ways to cut back on clinical time lost gathering what should be standard information, and education of GP practices around making good quality referrals. It was felt that a review of the referral forms would be beneficial, however a barrier to this change was that this is a trust wide form and there would need to be consensus across all CMHT localities.","Flew, Kathryn Dr, Christiana Elisha-Aboh, Dr, Shaharyar Alikhan, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.387","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S132-S133, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34556,""

"COVID-19-Related Knowledge and Anxiety Among Health-Care Workers in a Tertiary Care Centre in Kerala","Introduction:The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an immense threat to both physical as well as mental health globally. The outbreak is immeasurably affecting all the communities worldwide. The pandemic fatigue has led to inadequate addressing of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health especially among the health-care workers (HCWs), mainly due to the fear of disease contraction, mortality of the condition, raised work stress, as well as the saturation of news on media and other social platforms. Prolonged confinement at home may also adversely impact mental health.Method:An online survey was conducted using a developed questionnaire to evaluate the knowledge and anxiety among 118 HCWs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital. Since the study was conducted during the period in which no standard questionnaires were available, an online questionnaire was developed based on a few articles published in indexed journals on the similar topic which was further approved by 5 experts in the field. The questionnaire along with an informed consent was sent to all the HCWs employed in the hospital to assess their knowledge and anxiety related to COVID-19.Result:A total of 92.47% of participants were strongly aware that the major mechanism in COVID spread is droplet infection. An equal percentage of participants had good knowledge that the infection can always be prevented by maintaining social distance, appropriate hand washing, hand sanitizing, and using a mask. However, around 40.67% of participants avoided large meetings even in hospitals due to fear of the pandemic.Conclusion:It is important to study the mental health impacts of HCWs during the pandemic. There is a need to intensify the awareness program and address the mental health issues of HCWs during this COVID-19 pandemic.","K. P, Lakshmi, Prasanna, Preetha, Chandra, Subash, G.

"Patient Perceptions of Cancer and Reconstructive Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic profoundly impacted care for breast cancer patients. Oncologic and reconstructive surgeries were delayed as hospitals attempted to preserve personal protective equipment and bed capacity. Little is known about how this unprecedented time has affected breast cancer patients? mental health and perceptions regarding their care. Methods: A survey was sent to surgical oncology and plastic surgery patients who received breast cancer care between March and May 2020, during which our institution suspended elective surgery. The survey questions included patient demographics, as well as questions focused on worries related to COVID-19, individualized cancer and reconstructive care, and patient satisfaction with telemedicine. Descriptive statistics were used to assess patient responses. Results: 56 breast cancer patients completed the survey, which reflected a 25% response rate. A majority of patients expressed moderate concern about contracting COVID-19, accessing high-quality cancer care (78%), and receiving timely surgical care (68%). Only 43% of patients reported delays in their surgical cancer and reconstructive care, when in actuality 57% of patients experienced surgical delays. Overall, patients were satisfied with telemedicine and did not feel it negatively impacted their care (69%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions of routine oncologic and reconstructive care for breast cancer patients. Patients were concerned about receiving high-quality cancer and reconstructive care, and the results of this study uncovered gaps in patient?physician communication. The implementation of telemedicine was received positively. These data can be used to improve future health system practices as the medical community faces new potential shutdowns of surgical services.","Sorice-Virk, Sarah, Patel, Viren, Christopher, Adrienne N.; Morris, Martin P.; Broach, Robyn B.; Rothman, Jami D.; Serletti, Joseph M.","https://doi.org/10.1177/22925503221101938","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Plastic Surgery;: 22925503221101938, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34559,""
"How Social Media, FoMO, and Isolation Influence Our Perceptions of Others Who ""Break the Rules""","Research has suggested that social media usage increases during times of social isolation. However, rather than making users feel more connected to others, social media may cause negative mental health and relational outcomes, including a fear of missing out (FoMO).

As the pandemic wore on, many remained online, watching people they knew ""returning to normal,"" potentially creating high levels of FoMO despite disagreeing with others' decisions. This study examines whether social media use (frequency and purpose) influences individuals' perception of the acceptability of others' behavior, and whether those perceptions impact individuals' own behavioral decisions. Participants (N = 459) from the United States were recruited from late 2021 to early 2022 to complete an anonymous online survey regarding the ""acceptableness"" of behavior shown in posts by friends and family. Results indicated that increased social media frequency was correlated with an increased sense of FoMO, which was significantly and positively associated with favorable perceptions of others' behaviors, such as gathering indoors with others, even when public health officials discouraged it. However, FoMO was not significantly related to users' personal intentions to follow public health recommendations. A post hoc analysis determined that fear of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between FoMO and the perception of others' behavior, as well as the relationship between FoMO and behavioral intentions.","Scheinfeld, E.; Voorhees, H.

"Universal crisis psychoeducational interventions in schools: A scoping review","In times of crisis, schools are expected to help students deal with the situation and any help offered should consider the social and emotional problems arising from the critical event. Therefore, school-based activities enabling children to recognize the experience and work through it are essential to sustain their normal development and prevent academic and mental health problems. This paper provides an overview of the literature on universal school crisis interventions. We performed a scoping literature search in Scopus, ERIC, and Psych Info for articles published between January 2000 and May 2021 and identified 32 universal school-based crisis interventions based on three main crisis types (armed conflict, natural disaster, and Covid-19). Analysis of the methodologies and theoretical backgrounds generated six key psychoeducational factors commonly adopted. Comparing the different programmes in terms of topics, course content, duration, and methodology can help administrators and educators select the most appropriate crisis intervention for their school and situation. We also discuss the collaboration between mental health care specialists, school teams, and other important factors needed to implement these programmes and ensure their effectiveness under real-life conditions.","Capurso, Michele, De Stasio, Simona, Ragni, Benedetta","https://doi.org/10.1177/01430343221104986","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: School Psychology International;: 01430343221104986, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34562,""
"Event Time Perspective in Adaptation to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Insights from Two Chinese Samples","Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the way people construct their time perspective (TP). This study investigated past and future TP in Hubei, China, comparing a â€˜pre-pandemicâ€™ sample collected before the pandemic (late 2019, n = 138) to a â€˜habitual-pandemicâ€™ sample collected when the pandemic was largely under control (beginning 2021, n = 109). Using the time line paradigm, participants generated significant past and future personal events indicating dates, emotional valence, and intensity for each. We used these data to test the predictions that the COVID-19 pandemic would shorten TP and evoke pessimism for the future and disappointment for the past. Counter to these predictions, we found: (a) typical levels of positivity in both samples for both past and future events;(b) a higher proportion of positive memories in the habitual-pandemic sample than pre-pandemic one;(c) past and future time extension in the habitual-pandemic sample;and (d) the future was more often completed with oneâ€™s own â€˜peaceful deathâ€™ in the habitual-pandemic sample. To determine whether the â€˜peaceful deathâ€™ phenomenon is adaptive or maladaptive we examined its coincidence with other timeline characteristics. The analyses indicated that the â€˜peaceful deathâ€™ phenomenon in both samples was associated with a moderately positive TP and a plurality of prospects with frequent references to travel. These results allow to propose that an elongated TP and a distant â€˜peaceful deathâ€™ may buffer pandemic-related uncertainty and that an accelerated TP functions in the service of self-continuity and well-being.

"Characteristics Analysis of Mental Health Data of College Students Based on Convolutional Neural Network and TOPSIS Evaluation Model","With the rapid development of modern society, there are many problems concerning the physical and mental health of students. This paper develops a feature analysis method of the mental health data of students in different colleges and regions and of different ages based on a convolutional neural network and TOPSIS evaluation model and studies the college students' mental health analysis model based on convolutional neural network. First, through the data cluster summary and internal characteristics analysis of college students' psychological questionnaire survey data in different regions and grades, we established a college students' mental health grade system and evaluation index system. Then, the TOPSIS analysis method is used to analyze the characteristics of the data results, and the feasibility of the accuracy of the evaluation index standard is analyzed. Finally, the experimental results show that the college students' mental health analysis model based on convolutional neural network can effectively classify and summarize various mental health data, quickly locate the mental health problems of different students and analyze the optimal solutions, and can effectively promote the process of analysis and research on the mental health problems in modern college students.","Zhou, L.

"Exploring childrenâ€™s knowledge of COVID-19 and stress levels associated with the pandemic in Nigeria: a mixed-method study","BackgroundChildren have been relatively spared from the direct effects of COVID-19 globally, but there are significant concerns about indirect effects on the most vulnerable childrenâ€™s well-being. Nigeria is the largest African nation, but little is known about childrenâ€™s experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aims were to determine childrenâ€™s knowledge of COVID-19 and their mental health responses to the pandemic.MethodsChildren aged 6â€“17 years living in Calabar, Nigeria, were surveyed using a combination of online data collection assisted by parents and on-site data collection at schools. Parents filled out sociodemographic details, while children answered questions about COVID-19 knowledge and preventive measures. An adapted version of the â€˜Perceived Stress Scale for Childrenâ€™ was used to assess stress with additional free text space for expression of views and experiences of COVID-19.ResultsA total of 265 children completed questionnaires, mean age was 12.5 years, 52.1% were girls. All children knew about the virus and over two-thirds (67.8%) had good knowledge of COVID-19 transmission. Children identified television (60.8%), parents (44.2%) and social media (32.8%), as main sources of COVID-19 information. The overall mean stress score among the children was 20.47. Children mentioned the following as stressors: fear of the COVID-19 disease, effect of pandemic restrictions on schooling and social interactions as well as home/family tensions. Parental love and support were overwhelmingly reported as strengths.ConclusionsNigerian children in this study had good knowledge and understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures to counter the virus. Children had high stress levels and expressed pandemic-related concerns but parental love and support were mitigating factors. Government and child health service providers need to tailor health and support services in response to childrenâ€™s needs and concerns.","Asemota, Osamagbe Aiyudubie, Napier-Raman, Sharanya, Takeuchi, Hajime, Raman, Shanti, Asemota, Enosakhare Aiyudubie, Ezeh, Nonye","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001444","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 6(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34565,""
"The Precariat and the Pandemic: Assessing the Well-Being of Metro Orlando's Hospitality Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for precaritization highlighting the instability plaguing many American workers. As the rapid spread of the virus led to the closure of businesses, both temporarily and permanently, the nation reached record high levels of unemployment. The effects of the pandemic have fallen unequally among different groups forcing women, people of color, and low-income, precarious workers to endure the brunt of the economic downturn. In particular, the hospitality industry, comprised of those employed in restaurants, bars, event/convention centers, theme parks, and the like, was and continues to be the hardest hit by the effects of COVID-19. We explore the experiences of 454 hospitality industry workers in the Metro Orlando, Florida area during the COVID-19 pandemic using data collected using an online survey. The purpose of this research is twofold. First, it seeks to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic upon hospitality workers in the metro Orlando area across the dimensions of employment status, financial stability, mental health, housing, and food security. The second aim of this research adopts Kalleberg and Vallas' recommendation for analysis of hierarchies in precarious work by identifying differential outcomes across the aforementioned dimensions along the lines of race, gender, and income type (salaried, tipped, hourly) to explore stratification within the precariat. Findings reflect the potentially devastating consequences of precarity and expand upon conceptualizations of the precariat by offering empirical evidence of disparities within this group.

"The mediating role of life satisfaction in the relationship between depression, anxiety, stress and burnout among Portuguese nurses during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic had a large consequence on healthcare systems, increasing the risks of psychological issues in health professionals. Nurses, in particular, have been exposed to multiple psychosocial stressors and struggled with intensive work, insufficiency of resources and uncertainty in the face of an unknown disease. Life satisfaction might protect nurses from the consequences of chronic stress. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of satisfaction with life in the relationship between depression, stress, anxiety and burnout (personal, work-related, and client-related). A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was performed, using an online questionnaire distributed via social networks. A total of 379 nurses completed the survey, comprising standardized measures of satisfaction with life, resilience (Resilience Scale), depression, anxiety, stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales), and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale). A hierarchical regression model was estimated for each burnout dimension. Participants showed high levels of work, personal and client-related burnout, 57.3%, 57%, and 35.1%, respectively. More than 70% of the respondents had a normal level of depressive symptoms, 66.8% presented normal level of anxiety and 33.5% of the respondents reported mild, moderate, severe or extremely severe symptoms of stress. The results revealed that life satisfaction partially mediated the association between stress and personal burnout, depression and work-related burnout, and the association between anxiety and client-related burnout in nurses. The COVID-19 pandemic brought added difficulties for nurses' work conditions, whereby it became necessary to develop adaptative measures that reduce stressors in work environment and promote nurses' life satisfaction.","Martins, SerrÃƒÂ£o, Teixeira, Castro, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-00958-3","20220719","Anxiety; Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Life satisfaction; Mediating; Nurses; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34567,""
"A narrative review on yoga: a potential intervention for augmenting immunomodulation and mental health in COVID-19","The ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a significant mortality rate of 3-5%. The principal causes of multiorgan failure and death are cytokine release syndrome and immune dysfunction. Stress, anxiety, and depression has been aggravated by the pandemic and its resultant restrictions in day-to-day life which may contribute to immune dysregulation. Thus, immunity strengthening and the prevention of cytokine release syndrome are important for preventing and minimizing mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, despite a few specific remedies that now exist for the SARS-CoV-2virus, the principal modes of prevention include vaccination, masking, and holistic healing methods, such as yoga. Currently, extensive research is being conducted to better understand the neuroendocrinoimmunological mechanisms by which yoga alleviates stress and inflammation. This review article explores the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating potentials of yoga, along with its role in reducing risk for immune dysfunction and impaired mental health. We conducted this narrative review from published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE databases. Screening was performed for titles and abstracts by two independent review authors; potentially eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review. References of included articles and articles of major non-indexed peer reviewed journals were searched for relevance by two independent review authors. A third review author checked the excluded records. All disagreements were resolved through discussion amongst review authors or through adjudication by a fourth review author. Abstracts, editorials, conference proceedings and clinical trial registrations were excluded. Yoga is a nonpharmacological, cost-effective, and safe intervention associated with several health benefits. Originating in ancient India, this vast discipline consists of postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation (dhyana/dharana), and relaxation. Studies have demonstrated yoga's ability to bolster innate immunity and to inhibit cytokine release syndrome. As an intervention, yoga has been shown to improve mental health, as it alleviates anxiety, depression, and stress and enhances mindfulness, self-control, and self-regulation. Yoga has been correlated with numerous cardioprotective effects, which also may play a role in COVID-19 by preventing lung and cardiac injury. This review paves the path for further research on yoga as a potential intervention for enhancing innate immunity and mental health and thus its role in prevention and adjunctive treatment in COVID-19.","Basu-Ray, Metri, Khanra, Revankar, Chinnaiyan, Raghuram, Mishra, Patwardhan, Sharma, Basavaraddi, Anand, Reddy, Deepak, Levy, Theus, Levine, Cramer, Fricchione, Hongasandra","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-022-03666-2","20220719","Catastrophization; Complementary therapies; Covid-19; Immunomodulation; Psychological stress; Yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34568,""
"A qualitative analysis of feelings and experiences associated with perinatal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Rates of perinatal mental health difficulties (experienced during pregnancy and the 12-months postpartum) increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, anxiety and depression were estimated to affect more than half of perinatal women during the first national lockdown. However, little is known about women's qualitative experiences of distress. This study aimed to extend published quantitative findings resulting from the same data set (Harrison et al., Women Birth xxxx, 2021;Ã‚ Harrison et al., J Reprod Infant Psychol 1-16, 2021) to qualitatively explore: 1) the feelings and symptoms associated with maternal perinatal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) the associated sources of distress. As part of an online survey during May 2020, 424 perinatal women responded to an open-ended question regarding a recent experience of distress. Qualitative data were analysed using an initial content analysis, followed by an inductive thematic analysis adopting a realist approach. Data were explored in the context of self-reported perinatal anxiety and depression symptoms. Initial content analysis of the data identified twelve distinct categories depicting participants' feelings and symptoms associated with psychological distress. Despite the high rates of probable depression in the sample, women's descriptions were more indicative of anxiety and general distress, than of symptoms traditionally related to depression. In terms of the associated psychosocial stressors, a thematic analysis identified five themes: Family wellbeing; Lack of support; Mothering challenges; Loss of control due to COVID-19; and Work and finances. Unsurprisingly given the context, isolation was a common challenge. Additionally, psychological conflict between maternal expectations and the reality of pregnancy and motherhood, loss of autonomy and control, and fears surrounding family health, safety, and wellbeing underlay many of the themes. This study presents an array of feelings and symptoms expressed by perinatal mothers which may be useful to consider in relation to perinatal wellbeing. Furthermore, our data highlights severalÃ‚Â common sources of distress, includingÃ‚Â multiple COVID-19 specific factors. However, many were related to more general perinatal/maternal experiences. Our findings also point to considerations that may be useful in alleviating distress in pregnancy and early motherhood, including social support, realistic perinatal/maternal expectations, and support for those with perceived perinatal trauma.","Jones, Harrison, Moulds, Lazard","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04876-9","20220719","Antenatal; COVID-19; Mental health; Perinatal anxiety; Perinatal depression; Perinatal distress; Postnatal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34569,""
"Experiences with use of technology and telehealth among women with perinatal depression","Perinatal depression (PD) affects 10-20% of childbearing women. Telehealth is increasingly utilized for mental health services to increase access to care and overcome COVID-19 pandemic barriers. Women's perspectives on telehealth services for PD is unknown, however. This study's primary objective was to obtain the perspectives of women who participated in an 8-week group videoconference intervention for PD symptoms, including how technology impacted their experience. We utilized theoretical sampling and included perinatal women who had completed the 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral intervention group. Semi-structured focus groups with four to six women were conducted on a videoconference platform. Primary analysis used grounded theory and a secondary analysis used qualitative description and was conducted by two coding teams. The teams collaborated on the final themes across the analyses. Three groups, with a total of 17 participants were conducted. Composition consisted of seven postpartum and ten pregnant women from the 47 total participants. Identified core themes regarding their experiences of the videoconference intervention were: positive experiences, negative experiences, suggestions and ideas, and screening and communication. This study provides growing evidence informed by perinatal women of positive experiences with engagement in a videoconference intervention for PD. Telehealth may be a reasonable and acceptable platform to increase access and retention for mental health services in childbearing women. Further, this pilot work showcases videoconferencing delivery for a wide range of effective and affordable mental health services in low-resource communities.","Parameswaran, Pentecost, Williams, Smid, Latendresse","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04889-4","20220719","Depression; Perinatal depression; Telehealth; Videoconference","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34570,""
"Anxiety, depression, and related factors in hemodialysis patients during the lockdown period of COVID- 19 in China: a multicenter study","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) made a huge impact on hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to survey the anxiety, depression and related factors of HD patients during the lockdown and to explore the factors that affect their anxiety and depression. From February 1 to 15, 2020, an online survey was conducted in HD patients; the survey collected information on demographic data, epidemic perception, travel status and Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The original SAS and SDS data from 96 HD patients gathered between May and August 2018 were retained as data for the control group.

"Effect of Yoga on the Stress, Anxiety, and Depression of COVID-19-Positive Patients: A Quasi-Randomized Controlled Study","The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in reports of increase in stress, anxiety, and depression across society, especially in people who have tested positive for COVID-19, which affects their mental health and well-being. This article reports a quasi-randomized controlled study conducted in the COVID wards of a hospital to examine the efficacy of add-on yoga intervention in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression in COVID-affected patients under quarantine. The peripheral capillary oxygen saturation level and heart rate of the COVID-19-affected patients were also measured. A total of 62 COVID-19-positive patients participated in the study. The participants were randomized into a control group (n = 31), which received conventional medical treatment alone, and a yoga intervention group (n = 31), which received 50 minutes of yoga intervention along with the conventional medical treatment. Standardized Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Perceived Stress Scale were administered at the beginning and end of the quarantine period. A significant decrease in stress, anxiety, and depression was observed in the patients who undertook the add-on yoga intervention. There was also a significant decrease in anxiety in the control group, but the intervention group had a larger decrease compared to the control group. Further significant improvements in oxygen saturation and heart rate levels were observed in the group of patients who were practicing yoga, but no significant improvement was observed in the control group. Findings of this study suggest that yoga intervention can be an effective add-on practice in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression levels of COVID-19 patients.","Sharma, Sahni, Sharma, Kumar, Garg","https://doi.org/10.17761/2022-D-22-00013","20220719","COVID-19; SPO2; Yoga; anxiety; depression; heart rate; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34573,""
"Virtual Care Prior to and During COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Rural and Urban Adults","To reduce person-to-person contact, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven a massive shift to virtual care. Defined as the use of technology (synchronous or asynchronous) to support communication between healthcare providers and patients, rural-urban differences in virtual are relatively unexplored. The two-fold purpose of the present study was to examine rural and urban virtual care access, use, and satisfaction during the pandemic and to identify any unmet needs. A cross-sectional online survey exploring virtual care among rural and urban adults in summer 2021 using a combination of fixed and open-ended response options. Quantitative data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using inductive thematic content analysis.

Virtual care use was high among both rural (171/237, 72.2%) and urban (188/264, 71.2%) participants, with over half reporting having only started to use virtual care since the pandemic. The self-reported need for mental health programs and services increased during the pandemic compared to prior for both rural and urban participants. Among virtual care users, interest in its continuation was high. Our analysis also shows that internet quality (all Ps&lt;.05) and eHealth literacy (all Ps&lt;.001) were positively associated with participants' perceptions of virtual care usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction with no rural/urban differences. Rural participants were less likely to have used video in communicating with doctors/healthcare providers, compared to urban participants (P&lt;.001). When describing unmet needs, participants described: 1) lack of access to care; 2) limited health promotion and prevention options; and 3) lack of mental health service options. The increased demand for and use of virtual care may reflect increased availability and a lack of alternatives due to limited in-person services during the COVID-19 pandemic, so a balance between virtual care and in-person care is important to consider post-pandemic. Further, ensuring availability of high-speed internet and education to support patients will be important for providing accessible and effective virtual care, especially for rural residents.","Rush, Seaton, Corman, Hawe, Li, Dow-Fleisner, Hasan, Oelke, Currie, Pesut","https://doi.org/10.2196/37059","20220718","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34574,""

"Predicting Multiple Sclerosis Outcomes during the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Period: Observational Study Using Passively Sensed Behaviors and Digital Phenotyping","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has broad negative impact on physical and mental health of people with chronic neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We present a machine learning approach leveraging passive sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers of people with MS to predict their health outcomes in a natural experiment during a state-mandated ""stay-at-home"" period due to a global pandemic. First, we extract features that capture behavioral changes due to the ""stay-at-home"" order. Then, we adapt and apply an existing algorithm to these behavioral change features to predict the presence of depression, high global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality during the ""stay-at-home"" period. Using data collected between November 2019 and May 2020, algorithm detects depression with an accuracy of 82.5% (65% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.84), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 90% (39% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.93), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 75.5% (22% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.80), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 84% (28% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.84). Our approach could help clinicians better triage patients with MS and potentially other chronic neurological disorders for interventions and aid patient self-monitoring in their own environment, particularly during extraordinarily stressful circumstances such as pandemics that would cause drastic behavioral changes.

"Indirect COVID-19 health effects and potential mitigating interventions: Cost-effectiveness framework","The COVID-19 pandemic led to important indirect health and social harms in addition to deaths and morbidity due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These indirect impacts, such as increased depression and substance abuse, can have persistent effects over the life course. Estimated health and cost outcomes of such conditions and mitigation strategies may guide public health responses. We developed a cost-effectiveness framework to evaluate societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to six health-related indirect effects of COVID-19 in California. Short- and long-term outcomes were evaluated for the adult population. We identified one evidence-based mitigation strategy for each condition and estimated QALYs gained, intervention costs, and savings from averted health-related harms. Model data were derived from literature review, public data, and expert opinion. Pandemic-associated increases in prevalence across these six conditions were estimated to lead to over 192,000 QALYs lost and to approach $7 billion in societal costs per million population over the life course of adults. The greatest costs and QALYs lost per million adults were due to adult depression. All mitigation strategies assessed saved both QALYs and costs, with five strategies achieving savings within one year. The greatest net savings over 10 years would be achieved by addressing depression ($242 million) and excessive alcohol use ($107 million). The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to significant human suffering and societal costs due to its indirect effects. Policymakers have an opportunity to reduce societal costs and health harms by implementing mitigation strategies.","Maya, Kahn, Lin, Jacobs, Schmidt, Burrough, Ghasemzadeh, Mousli, Allan, Donovan, Barker, Horvath, Spetz, Brindis, Malekinejad","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271523","20220719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34577,""
"Who is seeking help for psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic? Characterization of risk factors in 1269 participants accessing low-threshold psychological help","The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying restrictions are associated with substantial psychological distress. However, it is unclear how this increased strain translates into help-seeking behavior. Here, we aim to characterize those individuals who seek help for COVID-19 related psychological distress, and examine which factors are associated with their levels of distress in order to better characterize vulnerable groups. We report data from 1269 help-seeking participants subscribing to a stepped-care program targeted at mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sample characteristics were compared to population data, and linear regression analyses were used to examine which risk factors and stressors were associated with current symptom levels. Seeking for help for COVID-19 related psychological distress was characterized by female gender, younger age, and better education compared to the general population. The majority reported mental health problems already before the pandemic. 74.5% of this help-seeking sample also exceeded clinical thresholds for depression, anxiety, or somatization. Higher individual symptom levels were associated with higher overall levels of pandemic stress, younger age, and pre-existing mental health problems, but were buffered by functional emotion regulation strategies. Results suggest a considerable increase in demand for mental-healthcare in the pandemic aftermath. Comparisons with the general population indicate diverging patterns in help-seeking behavior: while some individuals seek help themselves, others should be addressed directly. Individuals that are young, have pre-existing mental health problems and experience a high level of pandemic stress are particularly at-risk for considerable symptom load. Mental-healthcare providers should use these results to prepare for the significant increase in demand during the broader aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as allocate limited resources more effectively.","Hilbert, Boeken, Asbrand, Seemann, Langhammer, Praxl, HorvÃƒÂ¡th, Ertle, Lueken","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271468","20220719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34578,""
"Virtual Reality in Treatment for Psychological Problems in First-Line Health care Professionals Fighting COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Series","Virtual reality therapy (VRT) is a new psychotherapeutic approach integrating virtual reality technology and psychotherapy. This case series aimed to study effectiveness of VRT in treating psychological problems. We described four cases of first-line health care professionals with emerging clinically significant early psychological problems during the COVID-19 outbreak, and specifically received the VRT treatment. We compared the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 items (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), PHQ-15, and Athens Insomnia Scale to evaluate psychological symptoms and sleep quality before and after sessions. All four cases showed a reduction in scale comparison. General scores of the PHQ-9 reduced 65%, GAD-7 reduced 52.17%, PHQ-15 decreased 38.17%, and scores of the Athens Insomnia Scale reduced 67.44%. Meanwhile, a reduction in depression, anxiety, psychosomatic, and sleeping symptoms was also found, which decreased 76.92% in general. These results are highly significant statistically. This case series demonstrated the effectiveness of VRT on psychological problems as a promising approach to apply on various psychological distress and disorders.","Pan, Zhang, Ren, Lu, Wang, Li, Xiao, Zhou, Bai","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001531","20220718","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34579,""
"Childcare Stress, Burnout, and Intent to Reduce Hours or Leave the Job During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among US Health Care Workers","Childcare stress (CCS) is high during the COVID-19 pandemic because of remote learning and fear of illness transmission in health care workers (HCWs). Associations between CCS and burnout, intent to reduce (ITR) hours, and intent to leave (ITL) are not known. To determine associations between CCS, anxiety and depression, burnout, ITR in 1 year, and ITL in 2 years. This survey study, Coping with COVID, a brief work-life and wellness survey of US HCWs, was conducted between April and December 2020, assessing CCS, burnout, anxiety, depression, workload, and work intentions. The survey was distributed to clinicians and staff in participating health care organizations with more than 100 physicians. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to May 2022. The survey asked, ""due toÃ¢â‚¬Â¦COVID-19, I am experiencing concerns about childcare,"" and the presence of CCS was considered as a score of 3 or 4 on a scale from 1, not at all, to 4, a great extent. The survey also asked about fear of exposure or transmission, anxiety, depression, workload, and single-item measures of burnout, ITR, and ITL. In 208 organizations, 58Ã¢â‚¬Â¯408 HCWs (15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯766 physicians [26.9%], 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯409 nurses [19.5%], 39Ã¢â‚¬Â¯218 women [67.1%], and 33Ã¢â‚¬Â¯817 White participants [57.9%]) responded with a median organizational response rate of 32%. CCS was present in 21% (12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯197 respondents) of HCWs. CCS was more frequent among racial and ethnic minority individuals and those not identifying race or ethnicity vs White respondents (5028 respondents [25.2%] vs 6356 respondents [18.8%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; proportional difference, -7.1; 95% CI, -7.8 to -6.3) and among women vs men (8281 respondents [21.1%] vs 2573 respondents [17.9%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29). Those with CCS had 115% greater odds of anxiety or depression (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 2.04-2.26; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and 80% greater odds of burnout (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.70-1.90; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) vs indidivuals without CCS. High CCS was associated with 91% greater odds of ITR (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.76 to 2.08; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and 28% greater odds of ITL (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.40; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In this survey study, CCS was disproportionately described across different subgroups of HCWs and was associated with anxiety, depression, burnout, ITR, and ITL.

"Examining the role of material and social assets on mental health in the context of COVID-19 among an urban public university sample","Material and social stressors are both well-documented contributors to the onset of psychiatric symptoms. This relationship has not yet been investigated within the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and within low-income and racially/ethnically diverse urban student populations, who are facing increased stress.

"Stress, anxiety, emotion regulation and social support in parent-child dyads prior to and during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","In March 2020, and in order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress and mental health in parent-child dyads using pre-pandemic measures, we recontacted participants from a 2019 study. A total of 136 dyads of Canadian parents (77% mothers, mean age = 44.48 y/o) and children (63% girls, 77% aged 10-12 y/o and 23% aged 15-17 y/o) completed self-report measures of perceived stress, anxiety (state/sensitivity) and emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal/expressive suppression). Children additionally completed measures of co-rumination and perceived social support from friends, parents, and teachers. Results revealed a significant increase in parents' stress and state anxiety during the pandemic compared to before, but not in their children. Dyads' anxiety sensitivity remained unchanged, as well as parents' use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Children showed similar use of cognitive reappraisal, but less expressive suppression and co-rumination during the pandemic compared to before. Children reported similar perceived social support from all sources over time. Finally, parental and children scores were not significantly correlated at either time. These results suggest that during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents and children responded differently in terms of stress, anxiety, and emotion regulation strategies.

"COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the elderly: the relationship between PPPD and prefrontal alpha rhythm","<b>Background:</b> In the COVID-19 epidemic more patients presented with persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD), but it has received little attention by the doctors in China and many patients reject psychological measurements or scales. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an objective method to diagnose and evaluate PPPD.<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 epidemic on elderly PPPD patients and define the relationship between prefrontal alpha rhythm asymmetry (FAA) by Electroencephalography (EEG) and PPPD.<b>Methods:</b> This case-control study was conducted to discuss the differences of elderly outpatients (&gt;60 years) with PPPD during the peak period of COVID-19 in 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019, and collect the prefrontal FAA value in PPPD during COVID-19 outbreak, which were compared to its FAA in healthy control.<b>Results:</b> Compared with the same period in 2019, the number of elderly PPPD patients during the epidemic period in 2020 increased significantly (16.4%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000, <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> =31.802) .

"Frontline, Essential, and Invisible: The Needs of Low-Wage Workers in Hospital Settings During COVID-19","Frontline health care workers are particularly vulnerable to burnout and diminished well-being as they endure COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors. While physicians and nurses are the public face of those experiencing burnout in hospitals, these stressors also affect low-wage workers such as food and housekeeping/janitorial service workers whose roles largely remain ""invisible"" when conceptualizing the essential health workforce and understanding their needs. This study sought to understand the experiences of frontline essential workers to better support them and prevent burnout. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we conducted 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with workers in three U.S. states. Thematic content analysis was conducted to code and analyze interviews. Workers had an average of 5.8 years in their jobs, which included food services, housekeeping/janitorial, and patient transport roles. Analysis revealed four prominent stressors contributing to worker burnout: changes in duties and staff shortages, fear of contracting or transmitting COVID-19, desire for recognition of their job-related risk, and unclear communication on safety precautions and resources. Protective factors included paid time-off, mental health supports, sense of workplace pride, and self-coping strategies. As health systems continue to grapple with care delivery in the context of COVID-19, identifying best practices to support <i>all</i> workers and prevent burnout is vital to the functioning and safety of hospitals. Further consideration is warranted to create policies and multipronged interventions to meet workers' tangible needs while shifting the culture, so all members of the health workforce are seen and valued.","Zerden, Richman, Lombardi, Forte","https://doi.org/10.1177/21650799221108490","20220718","COVID-19; behavioral/mental health/stress/anxiety/depression; health care worker/homecare worker; low-wage worker; qualitative research methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34584,""

We sought to examine psychological outcomes among individuals with preexisting traumatic experiences during COVID-19. : We sampled 1Ã‚Â 242 adults in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States under a state-issued Phase 1 stay-at-home mandate to examine associations between pre-pandemic trauma exposure as measured by the Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ) and anxiety and depression, as measured by the Patient Reported Outcome Scale Anxiety and Depression (PROMIS-A and PROMIS-D). : Pre-pandemic trauma exposure among the sample was reported, with 281 (22.6%) participants identifying as experiencing one trauma, 209 (16.8%) reporting two, and 468 (37.7%) reporting three or more. As reported experiences of trauma increased, so did participant anxiety and depressive symptomatology. One-way Analysis of Variance indicated that reported trauma was significantly positively correlated with anxiety (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and depressive symptomatology (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). : Findings highlight the immense psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically with individuals who were previously exposed to trauma. Public health officials can encourage physicians, employers, and universities to screen patients, employees, and students to assess previous trauma, psychological functioning, and risk factors. Collaboration between physicians and mental health providers including psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and social workers to provide evidence informed rapid coordination of care can better meet the global mental health crisis that is arising as a result of this unprecedented global trauma.","Parker, Dailey, Emmanuel, Campbell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.glohj.2022.07.008","20220719","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Mental health; Psychological distress; Risk factors; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34586,""
"The correlates of physical activity during COVID-19 pandemic among Indonesian young adults: A longitudinal study","Social distancing policy during the COVID-19 pandemic may affect physical activity levels. This study aimed to compare physical activity levels before and during the pandemic and to explore physical activity correlates among Indonesian young adults. This longitudinal study was conducted before the pandemic (n = 141) in September 2019 and was followed by an online follow-up survey during the pandemic (79% response rate) in September 2020. Physical activity was measured using the global physical activity questionnaire and was classified into ""sufficient"" and ""insufficient."" The potential correlates of physical activity were constructs from social-cognitive theory and health belief model. Those were measured using a validated questionnaire in the follow-up survey. Physical activity levels before and during pandemics were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Simple logistic regressions were used to assess the relationships between each potential correlate and physical activity status during the pandemic. Physical activity levels decreased significantly during the pandemic, mostly in the work-related domain. Participants with favorable physical activity-related constructs were more likely to be physically active. The odds ratio ranged from 3.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-10.11) in participants with higher self-efficacy to 4.50 (95% CI = 1.44-14.06) in those with higher outcome expectations of physical activity. A significant decline in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic among Indonesian young adults was confirmed. The application of behavioral change theories for explaining physical activity status during the pandemic in this population is also supported. It is recommended to incorporate these constructs to develop physical activity interventions in this target population.","Arovah","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_720_21","20220719","Association; COVID-19; exercise; health belief model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34587,""
"Impact of internet addiction during COVID-19 on anxiety and sleep quality among college students of Bhubaneswar city","COVID-19 initiated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and over a period of time, the infection outspread across the world in a rapid pace. To protect the people and to further limit the spread of infection, lockdown was declared in most parts of the world including India. As all people were forced to stay indoors during this pandemic, internet was the only source of entertainment whose overuse has side effects on anxiety and sleep quality. This study is aimed to know the impact of Internet addiction during COVID-19 on anxiety and sleep quality among college students of Bhubaneswar city. This was a web-based cross-sectional, questionnaire study. It administered 475 students from six colleges. The students were assessed by a proforma containing demographic details, patterns of internet use, Youngs Internet Addiction Test, Generalised Anxiety disorder score, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 21.0 using Chi-square test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The mean age of the study group was 18.81 Ã‚Â± 1.189. Out of 475 students, 60.6% were female and 39.4% were male. 23.6% and 13.4% of recruited students had severe internet addiction and anxiety disorder, respectively. The mean global PSQI score in the study was 6.356 Ã‚Â± 1.88. About 84.6% of the students had poor global sleep quality score. All components of sleep quality were significantly associated (<i>P</i> = 0.000) with different degrees of internet addiction except sleep duration (<i>P</i> = 0.589) and efficiency (<i>P</i> = 0.767). Females were highly addicted than males. The study findings specified that students' excessive internet usage leads to anxiety, and affects mental health. Monitoring and controlling students' internet addiction through informative sessions on how to use the Internet adequately is useful.","Kumar, Dash, Jnaneswar, Suresan, Jha, Ghosal","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_396_21","20220719","Anxiety; COVID-19; internet; sleep; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34588,""
"Music to decrease anxiety in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world in a multiplicity of ways. For college students, considered emerging adults in a time of transition between adolescence and adulthood, the stressors were multiplied by severe disruptions in education, social activities, family distress, and job losses. Significant impact on mental health in college students has been reported during this period. We investigated the effect of a previously researched music experience on the anxiety levels of 36 performing arts college students. Results showed a high level of anxiety pre-intervention, but a significant decrease and normative levels at posttest. Although a small sample size warrants caution in generalization, these results show the feasibility of theoretically sound, brief music experiences to address significant distress in vulnerable populations.","Hernandez-Ruiz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2022.101953","20220719","Anxiety; COVID-19; College; Intervention; Pandemic; Receptive music experience; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34589,""
"Review on the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control system based on AI","As a new technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has recently received increasing attention from researchers and has been successfully applied to many domains. Currently, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has not only put people's lives in jeopardy but has also interrupted social activities and stifled economic growth. Artificial intelligence, as the most cutting-edge science field, is critical in the fight against the pandemic. To respond scientifically to major emergencies like COVID-19, this article reviews the use of artificial intelligence in the combat against the pandemic from COVID-19 large data, intelligent devices and systems, and intelligent robots. This article's primary contributions are in two aspects: (1) we summarized the applications of AI in the pandemic, including virus spreading prediction, patient diagnosis, vaccine development, excluding potential virus carriers, telemedicine service, economic recovery, material distribution, disinfection, and health care. (2) We concluded the faced challenges during the AI-based pandemic prevention process, including multidimensional data, sub-intelligent algorithms, and unsystematic, and discussed corresponding solutions, such as 5G, cloud computing, and unsupervised learning algorithms. This article systematically surveyed the applications and challenges of AI technology during the pandemic, which is of great significance to promote the development of AI technology and can serve as a new reference for future emergencies.","Yi, Zhang, Mao, Chen, Zhong, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105184","20220719","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19 big data; Intelligent equipment and systems; Intelligent robots","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34590,""
"COVID-19-Related Trajectories of Psychological Health of Acute Care Healthcare Professionals: A 12-Month Longitudinal Observational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic hit healthcare professionals (HCPs) hard, potentially leading to mental health deterioration. This longitudinal study investigated the 1-year evolution of psychological health of acute care HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored possible differences between high and low resilient HCPs. From April 2020 to April 2021, a convenience sample of 520 multinational HCPs completed an online survey every 3 months, up to five times. We used mixed linear models to examine the association between resilience and the variation of COVID-19-related anxiety, depressiveness, perceived vulnerability, and psychological trauma symptomatology. We demonstrated ""u-shaped"" trajectories for all mental health symptoms. We also explored differences in the abovementioned variables between front-line and second-line acute care HCPs. In contrast to HCP.s with lower levels of resilience (-1SD), those with higher levels of resilience (+1SD) showed increased COVID-19 anxiety and perceived vulnerability over time. Front-line and second-line HCPs differed in their depressiveness and psychological trauma variation during the 1-year analysis. High and average resilient second-line HCPs showed steeper depressiveness increases with time than high and average resilient front-line HCPs. Acute care HCPs reported their most elevated clinical symptoms of depressiveness (5-7%) and psychological trauma symptomatology (26-46%) in April 2020. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, second-line HCPs with more resilience showed a steeper worsening of their depressiveness than more resilient front-line HCPs. HCPs with low resilience may benefit from interventions at the beginning of a pandemic, whereas HCPs with high resilience might benefit from resilience-enhancing interventions at later phases. The study protocol was pre-registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN13694948) published (Fuchs et al., 2020).","Abegglen, Greif, Fuchs, Berger-Estilita","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.900303","20220719","COVID-19; acute care; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34591,""
"Depression and Insomnia of Front-Line Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: An On-Line Cross-Sectional Study","During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical staff working in high-risk workplaces had a higher rate of epidemic infection. They also faced heavy workloads and pressure, which means they are more likely to suffer from psychological problems than others. To understand the mental health of medical staff during the epidemic, we explore the characteristics of medical staff susceptible to negative psychological emotions during the outbreak of public safety and health events. At the same time, we provide corresponding prevention and intervention measures to help them relieve negative emotions, this study compared the psychological symptoms of front-line and non-front-line medical staff, then explored its influencing factors. This research investigated 5,924 medical staff in Guangdong, Beijing, Hubei, Hainan, Jiangxi, and Henan in China. The questionnaires were released online by Questionnaire Star, and levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and social support were measured by Patients' Health Questionnaire Depression Scale-9 item (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). The depressive, anxious, and insomniac scores of front-line medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic period were higher than those of non-front-line with significant differences (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, front-line nurses went through the most serious psychological problems. Age, education, and anxiety level were the influencing factors of depression and insomnia in front-line medical staff. Among them, age was a protective factor for depression (OR = 0.71 &lt;1, <i>P</i> = 0.001 &lt;0.05, Beta = -0.34), while educational level was a risk factor for insomnia (OR = 1.27, <i>P</i> = 0.02 &lt;0.05, Beta = 0.24). During the epidemic, front-line medical staff would experience more serious psychological problems, especially those who were younger, less experienced, and insufficiently educated.

"The Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health Status of Adolescent and Young Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer and the Development of a Knowledge Translation Tool to Support Their Information Needs","Adolescent and young adult (AYA; 13 to 39Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) survivors of childhood cancer may be especially vulnerable to physical health and mental health concerns during the pandemic. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health status of AYA survivors (Aim 1) and shared tailored, evidence-based health-related information on COVID-19 (Aim 2). Between May and June 2020, participants completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing their cancer history, current mental health status, and their COVID-19 information needs. Ninety-four participants (78 females, 13 males, 2 non-binary) with a mean age of 26.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.2) were included in the final sample. Participants reported residing from 10 countries and 94% identified as White. Nearly half of the participants (49%) described their mental health status as worse now than before the pandemic. Thirty-nine participants (41%) that indicated their current mental health status was tied to fears/worries about their past cancer and treatment experienced a higher level of anxiety and PTSS than those who did not report the same. Most participants (77%) had not received any information related to the potential risks of COVID-19 and expressed an interest in receiving this information. In response, an infographic detailing recommended strategies for coping with mental health problems in the pandemic, along with preliminary study findings, was developed. AYA survivors reporting their mental health status was linked to their past cancer experienced poorer mental health. There is a value to educating survivors on their potential health risks, but accounting for their perceived mental health vulnerabilities should be considered when disseminating knowledge. The use of an infographic is a unique contribution towards the development of innovative and personalized means of sharing health education to this vulnerable yet resilient group. This research on the mental health status of AYA survivors very early in the pandemic informs continued initiatives investigating the rapidly changing nature of how COVID-19 may impact AYA survivors today and in the future.","Hou, Tran, Cho, Forbes, Forster, Stokoe, Allapitan, Wakefield, Wiener, Heathcote, Michel, Patterson, Reynolds, Schulte","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.867151","20220719","COVID-19; adolescent and young adult cancer; mental health; pediatric oncology; psychosocial oncology; survivors of childhood cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34593,""

"Rethinking the Multidimensionality of Growth Mindset Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Framework Proposal","Students, staff, and faculty in higher education are facing unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data revealed that a good number of academic activities and opportunities were disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. While much uncertainty remains for the next academic year, how higher education institutions and their students might improve responses to the rapidly changing situation matters. This systematic review and framework proposal aim to update previous empirical work and examine the current evidence for the effectiveness of growth mindset interventions in young adults. To this end, a systematic search identified 20 empirical studies involving 5, 805 young adults. These studies examined growth mindset within ecologically valid educational contexts and various content areas. Generally, these findings showed that brief messages of growth mindset can improve underrepresented students' academic performance and facilitate other relevant psychological constructs. In addition, we argue, although growth mindset has been identified as a unitary concept, it is comprised of multiple interdependent skills, such as self-control, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. Understanding the nature of growth mindset may contribute to successful mindset implementation. Therefore, this article presents a practical framework to help educators in higher education rethink the multidimensionality of growth mindset and to provide their students with alternative routes to achieve their goals. Finally, additional articles were discussed to help evaluate growth mindset interventions in higher education.","Ku, Stager","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.572220","20220719","emotion regulation; growth mindset; higher education; mental health; resilience; self-efficacy; self-regulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34595,""
"Can a Brief Interaction With Online, Digital Art Improve Wellbeing? A Comparative Study of the Impact of Online Art and Culture Presentations on Mood, State-Anxiety, Subjective Wellbeing, and Loneliness","When experienced in-person, engagement with art has been associated-in a growing body of evidence-with positive outcomes in wellbeing and mental health. This represents an exciting new field for psychology, curation, and health interventions, suggesting a widely-accessible, cost-effective, and non-pharmaceutical means of regulating factors such as mood or anxiety. However, can similar impacts be found with online presentations? If so, this would open up positive outcomes to an even-wider population-a trend accelerating due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its promise, this question, and the underlying mechanisms of art interventions and impacts, has largely not been explored. Participants (<i>N</i> = 84) were asked to engage with one of two online exhibitions from Google Arts and Culture (a Monet painting or a similarly-formatted display of Japanese culinary traditions). With just 1-2 min exposure, both improved negative mood, state-anxiety, loneliness, and wellbeing. Stepdown analysis suggested the changes can be explained primarily via negative mood, while improvements in mood correlated with aesthetic appraisals and cognitive-emotional experience of the exhibition. However, no difference was found between exhibitions. We discuss the findings in terms of applications and targets for future research.","Trupp, Bignardi, Chana, Specker, Pelowski","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.782033","20220719","art viewing; cultural engagement; digital art; mental health; receptive art engagement; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34596,""
"Acute and delayed psychiatric sequelae among patients hospitalised with COVID-19: a cohort study using LIFE study data","Characterising the psychiatric sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can inform the development of long-term treatment strategies. However, few studies have examined these sequelae at different time points after COVID-19 infection. The study aimed to investigate the incidences and risks of acute and delayed psychiatric sequelae in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Japan. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using a database comprising healthcare claims data from public health insurance enrollees residing in a Japanese city. We analysed a primary cohort comprising patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between March 2020 and July 2021 and two control cohorts comprising patients hospitalised with influenza or other respiratory tract infections (RTI) during the same period. We calculated the incidences of acute (1-3 months after infection) and delayed (4-6 months after infection) psychiatric sequelae. These sequelae were identified using diagnosis codes and categorised as mood/anxiety/psychotic disorder, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder or insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of psychiatric sequelae occurrence after COVID-19 infection compared with influenza and other RTI. The study population with acute psychiatric sequela consisted of 662 patients with COVID-19, 644 patients with influenza, and 7369 patients with RTI who could be followed for 3 months; the study population with delayed psychiatric sequelae consisted of 371 patients with COVID-19, 546 patients with influenza, and 5397 patients with RTI who could be followed for 6 months. In the analysis of acute psychiatric sequelae, COVID-19 had significantly higher odds of mood/anxiety/psychotic disorder (OR: 1.39, p=0.026), psychotic disorder (OR: 2.13, p&lt;0.001), and insomnia (OR: 2.59, p&lt;0.001) than influenza, and significantly higher odds of insomnia (OR: 1.44, p=0.002) and significantly lower odds of anxiety disorder (OR: 0.56, p&lt;0.001) than other RTI. In the analysis of delayed psychiatric sequelae, COVID-19 had significantly higher odds of psychotic disorder (OR: 2.25, p=0.007) than influenza, but significantly lower odds of anxiety disorder (OR: 0.55, p=0.011) than other RTI. COVID-19 was generally associated with an increased risk of psychiatric sequelae occurring within 3 months after infection, but had a lower risk of new psychiatric sequelae developing 4-6 months after infection.","Murata, Maeda, Ishiguro, Fukuda","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2022-100802","20220719","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychiatry; Psychotic Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34597,""

"Latent profiles of multi-dimensionality of self-compassion predict youth psychological adjustment outcomes during the COVID-19: A longitudinal mixture regression analysis","The multi-dimensionality of self-compassion and its influence on college students' adjustments have not been widely examined during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aims to explore profiles of self-compassion dimensions in Chinese college students and examine the predictive effects of different profiles on students' adjustment outcomes. A longitudinal online survey of college students was conducted in mainland China. In May of 2020, college students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1361) completed Neff's Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form during the home quarantine period. Six months after the baseline assessment, students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°717) reported their level of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, insomnia symptoms, complex post-traumatic stress (CPTSD) symptoms, post-traumatic growth (PTG), and positive youth development (PYD). A latent profile analysis was adopted to identify profiles of self-compassion dimensions. A longitudinal regression mixture model was used to examine the predictive effects of different self-compassion profiles on college students' adjustment outcomes. Three classes best characterized the self-compassion dimensions of college students: the compassionate group (54.1%), the uncompassionate group (38.6%), and the extremely uncompassionate group (7.3%). College students in the compassionate group scored significantly higher on positive adjustment indicators (PTG and PYD), and significantly lower on negative adjustment indicators (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and CPTSD symptoms) than students in the other two groups. College students in the uncompassionate group scored significantly lower on negative indicators, and higher on PYD scores than students in the extremely uncompassionate group, but did not differ in PTG levels from students in the extremely uncompassionate group. College students in the compassionate group adjusted best across groups. The limitations that using a composite score to represent the relative balance of self-compassion dimensions were highlighted.

Based on the message data of ""Tree Hole"" named ""Zou Fan"", this paper used a deep learning model and sentiment scoring algorithm to analyze the fluctuation characteristics sentiment of user's message in different time dimensions. Through detailed investigation of the research results, we found that the number of ""Tree Hole"" messages in multiple time dimensions is positively correlated to emotion. The longer the ""Tree Hole"" is formed, the more negative the emotion is, and the outbreak of COVID-19 and other major events have obvious effects on the emotion of the messages. In order to improve the efficiency of ""Tree Hole"" rescue, volunteers should focus on the long-formed ""Tree Hole"" and the user groups that are active in the early morning.

"Modeling the impact of the vaccine on the COVID-19 epidemic transmission via fractional derivative","To achieve the goal of ceasing the spread of COVID-19 entirely it is essential to understand the dynamical behavior of the proliferation of the virus at an intense level. Studying this disease simply based on experimental analysis is very time consuming and expensive. Mathematical modeling might play a worthy role in this regard. By incorporating the mathematical frameworks with the available disease data it will be beneficial and economical to understand the key factors involved in the spread of COVID-19. As there are many vaccines available globally at present, henceforth, by including the effect of vaccination into the model will also support to understand the visible influence of the vaccine on the spread of COVID-19 virus. There are several ways to mathematically formulate the effect of disease on the population like deterministic modeling, stochastic modeling or fractional order modeling etc. Fractional order derivative modeling is one of the fundamental methods to understand real-world problems and evaluate accurate situations.

Finally, numerical results and illustrative graphic simulation are given. Our results suggest that to reduce the number of cases of COVID-19 we should reduce the contact rate of the people if the population is not fully vaccinated. However, to tackle the issue of reducing the social distancing and lock down, which have very negative impact on the economy as well as on the mental health of the people, it is much better to increase the vaccine rate and get the whole nation to be fully vaccinated.","Arshad, Khalid, Javed, Amin, Nawaz","https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-02988-x","20220719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34602,""

"Psychological Fragility in an Italian Cohort of Systemic Sclerosis Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic Category: Short Communication","This work aims to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and COVID-19-related fear in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients during the second and third waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy and their possible associated factors. A cohort study was carried out on 114 SSc patients referred to our Scleroderma Clinic, matched for sex and age. Twenty-eight of them had missed scheduled examinations during the October 2020-March 2021 period and 86 has attended regular outpatient visits during the same period. Both groups were administered (by telephone for cases and in-person for controls) the <i>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7</i> (GAD-7) questionnaire and the validated on SSc patients <i>COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions</i> (COVID-19 Fears). Concurrent factors related to higher scores were investigated in patients who did not have an outpatient follow-up. The missing group had significantly more patients scoring Ã¢â€°Â¥8 on the GAD-7 questionnaire [22 (78.6%) vs 16 (18.6%), p &lt; 0.0001] and significantly higher scores on the COVID-19 Fears questionnaire (median [quartiles] 31.5 [26.25;37.25] vs 20 [13.75;28], p &lt; 0.0001) than the attending group. Multivariate analysis performed on the missing patients group showed a significant association of the lack of work and ongoing therapy for anxiety/depression with GAD-7 (p = 0.0275 and p = 0.0188) and COVID-19 Fears score (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0099). Anxiety disorder and COVID-19-related fear were greater in SSc patients who missed regular follow-ups and are associated with a lack of work activity. These findings aim to identify a subgroup deserving attention regarding risk factors for missed periodic controls.","Mohammad Reza Beigi, Pellegrino, Cadar, Bisconti, Di Ciommo, Stefanantoni, Conti, Riccieri","https://doi.org/10.2147/OARRR.S367424","20220719","COVID-19 fear; anxiety; systemic sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34604,""
"Moderating Role of Resilience Between Depression and Stress Response of Vocational Middle School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this study, we aimed to explore the influences of stress responses and psychological resilience on depression of vocational middle school students during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China. An online questionnaire survey on the students of a medical school in Jiangxi Province, China, and obtained 3,532 valid questionnaires. A self-compiled general situation questionnaire, Stress Response of COVID-19 Questionnaire, the Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were used. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore the regulatory role of psychological resilience between stress response and depression. (1) There were significant differences in gender between vocational middle school students' evaluation (t = 3.07, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and defense (t = 3.28, <i>P</i> = 0.001) of the pandemic. Males had higher cognitive evaluation of the pandemic than females, and females had more defense against the pandemic than males. (2) There is a significant difference between vocational middle school students from different grades in depression level (F = 3.62, <i>P</i> = 0.03), pneumonia defense (F = 13.65, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and pneumonia panic (F = 3.10, <i>P</i> = 0.045). (3) Depression level (F = 7.17, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), pneumonia evaluation (F = 2.78, <i>P</i> = 0.04) and pneumonia panic (F = 3.32, <i>P</i> = 0.02) of the students concerning the spatial distance of the pandemic. (4) The severity of urban pandemic affects the evaluation of pneumonia among vocational middle school students. (5) Depression was negatively correlated with psychological resilience and pneumonia evaluation, and positively correlated with pneumonia panic. Psychological resilience was positively correlated with pneumonia evaluation and pneumonia defense, and negatively correlated with pneumonia panic. (6) Psychological resilience could reduce the level of depression caused by pneumonia evaluation and pneumonia panic. There were significant differences in depression level and stress responses in grades, gender and spatial distance of pandemic. Resilience has a significant negative moderator effect on the relationship between pandemic panic and depression. Resilience has a significant positive moderator effect on the relationship between pandemic evaluation and depression.","Jin, Ding, Fan, Sheng, Luo, Hang, Feng, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904592","20220719","depression; resilience; stress response; the COVID-19 pandemic; vocational middle school students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34605,""
"Multifarious Linkages Between Personality Traits and Psychological Distress During and After COVID-19 Campus Lockdown: A Psychological Network Analysis","The novel coronavirus disease pandemic is still proliferating and is not expected to end any time soon. Several lockdowns and social distancing measures might be implemented in the future. A growing body of research has explored the effect of personality on individuals' psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. However, most prior studies have not discussed the dynamic and reciprocal transactions between personality and psychological distress in various situations. Therefore, this study aims to explore the internal mechanisms of the ways in which certain personality traits triggered specific symptoms during and after college lockdown, by using network analysis. Based on survey data from 525 university students in China, the study detected the connection between individual personality and psychological distress through network analysis. Of the participants, 70.1% were female, and 20.9% were male. The mean age of the participants was 19.701 (SD = 1.319) years. We estimated networks <i>via</i> two steps: First, two networks that only contain the Big Five personality traits and the six symptoms of psychological distress during and after the lockdown measure were estimated. Second, we add control variables and re-estimated the networks to check whether the linkages among the Big Five personality traits and the six symptoms of psychological distress observed in the first step were stable. Moreover, we employed strength centrality as the key indicator to present the potential significance of diverse variables within a network. The findings demonstrate that, first, ""depress"" was the central symptom in the network during the college lockdown, while ""efforts"" was the central symptom after the lockdown. Second, the symptoms of ""restless"" and ""worthless"" significantly declined after the lockdown. Third, we found that there is an internal mechanism through which personality affected certain psychological symptoms during and after lockdowns. Specifically, neuroticism triggered certain symptoms during and after the lockdown, while extraversion and conscientiousness suppressed certain symptoms. Substantial evidence on internal linkages is imperative to develop effective interventions. This study explores the internal mechanisms of the ways in which certain personality traits trigger specific symptoms. Overall, our results provide empirical evidence that personality traits play a key role in how individuals with certain traits respond to college lockdown during a pandemic. The study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it is among the first few studies which explores the effects of personality traits on individual psychological distress using network analysis during the pandemic.","Liu, Xia, Ma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.816298","20220719","Big Five personality; COVID-19; lockdown; network analysis; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34606,""
"Suicide, Stigma and COVID-19: A Call for Action From Low and Middle Income Countries","Suicide is a global health issue that needs to be addressed.

"Prevalence and Correlates of Mental Health of University Students in Hong Kong: What Happened One Year After the Occurrence of COVID-19?","In this study, we studied the prevalence and correlates of mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and stress) in Hong Kong university students after one year of the occurrence of COVID-19. We examined the relationships between mental health problems and socio-demographic factors (including age, gender, local/international students, living status, and economic strain), need satisfaction, and difficulties encountered. A cross-sectional online survey involving 1,648 university students (Mean age = 20.09 years Ã‚Â± 1.37) was conducted. They responded to a questionnaire assessing their mental health (including the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-DASS), psychosocial resources, social support, need satisfaction, difficulties and challenges, and evaluation of services they received. Based on DASS cutoff scores, prevalence rates of moderate or above levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were 40.0, 50.7, and 22.2%, respectively. While age and gender were not related to the DASS measures, economic strain and living alone were positively related to negative emotional states based on the results of MANOVAs. Multiple regression and PROCESS analyses showed that need satisfaction and difficulties contributed to depression and anxiety, with stress as a mediating factor. The proportions of students who experienced moderate and above levels of depression (40.0%), anxiety (50.7%), and stress (22.2%) indexed by DASS deserve attention. Living alone and experienced economic disadvantage are risk factors for negative emotional states. Need satisfaction and life challenges are related to negative emotional states. Need satisfaction and difficulties contributed to stress, which further influenced anxiety and depression.","Shek, Dou, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.857147","20220719","DASS; University students; anxiety; depression; economic strain; living alone; stress; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Hong Kong; Humans; Mental Health; Prevalence; Stress, Psychological; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34608,""

"The role of psychological self-care on worry of vaccination against COVID-19 in Iranian pregnant women: A cross-sectional study","Although previous studies have reported some psychological factors to prevent the worry of vaccination against COVID-19 in pregnant women, the role of psychological self-care is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of psychological self-care in pregnant women on the depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and worry of vaccination against COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study was conducted during the peak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in Babol city (North, Iran) from August to November 2021. Two hundred pregnant women referring to three prenatal clinics completed five questionnaires including; demographic characteristics, Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, psychological self-care, brief symptom inventory 18, corona disease anxiety scale, and acceptance of vaccination-3 inventory. Pregnant women were in relatively good condition based on psychological self-care but were not significantly associated with demographic characteristics, such as age, gestational age, educational background, pregnancy, and risk of parity. It was psychological self-care of pregnant women which negatively predicted the depressive symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.311, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), anxiety symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.269, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), psychological distress (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.269, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and worry of vaccination against COVID-19 (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.214, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Women's psychological self-care plays a protective role against the depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, and worry of vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy. Clinicians need to pay more attention to the role of psychological self-care as an important factor in preventing the symptoms of anxiety and depression during regular pregnancy visits.","Mirtabar, Kheirkhah, Basirat, Barat, Pahlavan, Ghadimi, Gholinia, Fateri, ZarinKamar, Faramarzi","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.711","20220719","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; anxiety; depression; psychological distress; psychological selfÃ¢â‚¬Âcare; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34610,""

"Depression and Self-Efficacy Among Iranian Children During the Prevalence of COVID-19 Disease","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has quickly endangered the physical and mental health of people in the community, particularly vulnerable people such as children. This study was carried out to investigate the depression and self-efficacy of Iranian children during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional research was conducted on 321 students aged 8 to 17 in southeast Iran. A social media-based online questionnaire was used to collect data. The information was gathered using demographic and COVID-related items, the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C). No significant correlation was observed between depression and self-efficacy of children (<i>P</i> = 0.23). However, in subscale of CDI, negative mood, ineffectiveness and negative self-esteem had a significant correlation with self-efficacy (&lt;0.001). Depression had a significant correlation with family income (<i>p</i> = 0.017), being at risk of coronavirus infection (<i>p</i> = 0.036), effectiveness of preventive measures (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and how information about the coronavirus disease was obtained (<i>p</i> = 0.018). According to the results, the mean score of depression was higher than the midpoint of the questionnaire in Iranian children, therefore, it is needed to take the necessary measures and treatment plans to reduce the rate of depression in children.

"Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Long COVID Syndrome","Background Long COVID syndrome originated as a patient phrased terminology which was initially used to describe a group of vague symptoms that persisted after recovering from COVID-19. However, it has moved from a patient <i>lingo</i> to a recognized pathological entity which refers to a group of symptoms that lasts weeks or months after the COVID-19 illness. The novelty of this condition, the inadequacy of research on long COVID syndrome, and its origin as a patient-coined terminology necessitated exploring the disease's sentiments and conversations by analyzing publicly available tweets. Method Tweets were extracted using the Twarc2 tool for tweets in the English language with the keywords (<i>long COVID syndrome, long COVID, post-COVID syndrome, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, long-term COVID, long haulers, and chronic COVID syndrome</i>)Ã‚Â between March 25, 2022, and April 1, 2022. The analyses included frequency of the keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to determine the most shared tweet topics, categorize clusters, and identify themes based on keyword analysis. Results The search yielded 62,232 tweets. The tweets were reduced to 10,670 tweets after removing the duplicates. The vast majority of the tweets originated from the United States of America (38%), United Kingdom (30%), and Canada (13%), with the most common hashtags being #longcovid (36%) and #covid (6.36%), and the most frequently used word being people (1.05%). The top three emotions detected by our analysis were trust (11.68%), fear (11.26%), and sadness (9.76%). The sentiment analysis results showed that people have comparable levels of positivity (19.90%) and negativity (18.39%) towards long COVID. Conclusions Our analysis revealed comparable sentiments about long COVID syndrome, albeit slightly positive. Most tweets connoted trust (positive), fear (negative), and sadness (negative). These emotions were linked with concerns about the <i>infection, pandemic, chronic disability</i>, and <i>governmental policies</i>.Ã‚Â We believe this study would be important in guiding information dissemination and governmental policy implementation necessary in tackling long COVID syndrome.","Awoyemi, Ebili, Olusanya, Ogunniyi, Adejumo","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.25901","20220719","health informatics; long covid syndrome; long haulers; sentiment analysis; twitter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34613,""
"Young People and Covid-19 Pandemic in Our Country","The current COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant mental health consequences across the world. Even though healthcare workers provide psychological services, the mental health of the overall population often is cause for concern. Psychosocial stressors of the population play a critical role in impacting both the spread of the disease and the occurrence of emotional distress and psychological disorder, during and after an infectious disease outbreak. The inability to plan, to anticipate future events, and to exert control, at least partially, over external variables inevitably generate stress and tension. Subsequently, this condition can generate more or less discomfort depending on the subjective evaluation of the individual, an evaluation which is influenced by the individual's stable personality traits. In fact, subjective experiences are never unique: stimuli endowed with the same stressful power do not necessarily cause these reactions in different individuals, while stressful conditions of varying degrees can induce the same response in different people. The aim of this research was to evaluate some aspects of mental health using answers related to this pandemic of a group young people, selected by chance. Results showed important changes in quality of life, insecurity, changes in mood and behaviour as well as not optimistic view for the future life. Discussion confirmed similar finding about young people opinions from other counties.

A random sample of Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology members (6,000) were emailed a survey assessing mental and physical well-being, lifestyle behaviors, and perceived worksite wellness support. A total of 926 IPs responded (15% response rate). Few met guidelines for sleep (34.1%), physical activity (18.8%), and fruit and vegetable consumption (7.3%). Rates of depression, anxiety, and burnout were 21.5%, 29.8%, and 65%. Front line and practicing IPs and IP administrators and directors had more negative mental health impacts than IPs in other roles. IPs with organizational wellness support were less likely to report negative COVID-19 impacts. IPs working 9-11+ hours/day were more likely to report worsening physical and mental health due to COVID-19. There were no significant differences in odds of negative COVID-19 impacts on lifestyle behaviors between white and racial and ethnically diverse IPs.

"Spotlight on non-motor symptoms and Covid-19","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has profoundly affected the quality of life (QoL) and health of the general population globally over the past 2 years, with a clear impact on people with Parkinson's Disease (PwP, PD). Non-motor symptoms have been widely acknowledged to hold a vital part in the clinical spectrum of PD, and, although often underrecognized, they significantly contribute to patients' and their caregivers' QoL. Up to now, there have been numerous reports of newly emerging or acutely deteriorating non-motor symptoms in PwP who had been infected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), while some of these symptoms, like fatigue, pain, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment, have also been identified as part of the long-COVID syndrome due to their persistent nature. The subjacent mechanisms, mediating the appearance or progression of non-motor symptoms in the context of Covid-19, although probably multifactorial in origin, remain largely unknown. Such mechanisms might be, at least partly, related solely to the viral infection per se or the lifestyle changes imposed during the pandemic, as many of the non-motor symptoms seem to be prevalent even among Covid-19 patients without PD. Here, we summarize the available evidence and implications of Covid-19 in non-motor PD symptoms in the acute and chronic, if applicable, phase of the infection, with a special reference on studies of PwP.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.irn.2022.04.001","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34624,""
"Co-production to understand on-line help-seeking for young people experiencing emotional abuse and neglect: building capabilities, adapting research methodology, evaluating involvement and impact","Background: Involving young people (YP) as co-researchers (YCoR) in mental health research is important for both ethical and epistemological reasons. However, approaches to involve and evaluate â€˜meaningful involvementâ€™ in complex qualitative mental health research, and how to evaluate impacts (or change) for both the co-researcher and the research is less well defined. Objectives: The co-produced research explored the experiences of YP seeking help for emotional abuse and neglect via an on-line, peer-peer message board. This practical case study aims to evidence the meaningful role and evaluate impacts associated with involvement of YCoR in sensitive and complex mental health research using flexible co-production. Methods: During the Covid-19 pandemic, we explored different on- and off-line approaches and adapted research methodology to build relationships, knowledge, skills, and confidence of YCoR. The virtual involvement was evaluated against the five principles of co-production. Anonymous, continuous digital feedback, reflective practices and multiple dissemination outputs are used to evaluate the impact of the study on those involved and the research. Results: Ten members of the NeurOX Young Peopleâ€™s Advisory Group (YPAG) were involved in the core project. Additional members were invited to be involved at later stages and in dissemination of outputs. We describe a supportive, scaffolded learning approach to build capabilities and embed the lived experience of YCoR as YP in complex qualitative research. A digital blended approach was acceptable to YCoR, principles of co-production were met and the impact/benefits of involvement are described. To demonstrate the epistemological value of involving YP following principles of co-production we evidence YPs capabilities for involvement and the â€˜changeâ€™ or contribution YCoR made to the research through reflective practices. Conclusions: This case study demonstrates how flexible co-production with YCoR can be robust and responsive to balance ethical and epistemological impact in complex mental health research. Supportive, scaffolded practices and safe environments helped build the confidence and capacity of YCoRs to demonstrate valuable phenomenological insights in the analysis. YPâ€™s perspectives on how they describe â€˜meaningfulâ€™ and impactful involvement illustrate the reciprocal benefits gained through working together to produce a range of impacts. Public contribution: This case study details co-production with young co-researchers (YCoR) from NeurOX YPAG.","Vanessa Bennett et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0084-958-9AF","20220719","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; qualitative methodology; peer support; impact evaluation; young people's advisory group; emotional abuse and neglect; online communities; children and young people; mental health; help seeking; involvement methodology; co-production","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","",34625,""
