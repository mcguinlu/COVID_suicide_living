"COVID-19 Infection in an Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Setting: Demographics, Outcomes, and Impact on Well-being","<AbstractText><b><i>Objective:</i></b> The mental health community expected that seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients would be especially vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to a higher medical comorbidity rate than the general population and disparities in access to medical care. Concern was voiced as to the impact on the psychiatric stability of this population due to anxiety about the pandemic, recommended isolation, and limited in-person interactions with treatment providers and support systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on a cohort of involuntarily hospitalized SMI patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The electronic medical records from March 28 through December 31, 2020 of all COVID-positive psychiatric inpatients were retrospectively reviewed. No outpatients or readmissions were included in the sample. <b><i>Results:</i></b> During the study period 238, COVID-positive inpatients were identified out of approximately 12,859 discreet admissions. The sample consisted of 158 men (66%) and 80 women (34%). The mean age of positive patients was 41 years. Eight patients (3%) required medical hospitalizations related to COVID-19, with 1 death. Ninety-seven patients (41%) had at least 1 or more of the known medical comorbidities related to increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Seclusion, restraints, and administration of as-needed medications (PRN) for anxiety or psychotic agitation occurred less frequently in the COVID-positive patients compared to those without infection. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Medical hospitalizations were infrequent in the study sample. Medical comorbidities were much higher in this group relative to statewide data. Seclusion, restraint, and PRN administration were lower in the COVID-positive cohort compared to COVID-negative inpatients. Overall, the sample group did not experience significant negative outcomes as might have been expected for this population.","Levitt","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21m03003","20210910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17830,""
"An examination of racial and ethnic disparities in mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic in the US South","The mental health of racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States may be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to greater experience of peri-pandemic stressors. Yet, few studies have systematically examined racial/ethnic differences in mental health outcomes in this context. Data came from the COVID-19 Southern Cities Study, a probability-based, cross-sectional study conducted in May/June 2020 among adults living in the metropolitan statistical areas of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, and New Orleans. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between racial/ethnic identity and past-week depression and/or anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3), trouble sleeping, physical reactions when thinking about COVID-19, and self-rated worsened mental health due to the pandemic were estimated in separate logistic regression models. Over 30% of respondents reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms, 21% reported physical reactions, 25% had trouble sleeping, and 33% worsened mental health since the pandemic began. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and pandemic-related stressors, odds of anxiety symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.95) and worsened mental health (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.94) were lower among non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic white respondents. No diagnostic assessments were used, and results may not be generalizable to later phases of the pandemic and the entire U.S. South. Despite greater pandemic-related stressor experience, poor mental health outcomes were not more common among racial/ethnic minority individuals. However, interventions to reduce disparities in stressor experience and promote mental health are needed.","Goldmann, Hagen, Khoury, Owens, Misra, Thrul","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.047","20210910","COVID-19; Ethnicity; Mental health, Race; Stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17831,""
"Role of access to personal protective equipment, treatment prioritization decisions, and changes in job functions on health workers' mental health outcomes during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic","During the initial COVID-19 outbreak, organizational changes were required to ensure adequate staffing in healthcare facilities. The extent to which organizational changes impacted the mental wellbeing of healthcare workers (HCWs) remains unexplored. Here we analyzed the association between three work-related stressors (reported access to protective equipment, change in job functions, and patient prioritization decision-making) and mental health outcomes (depression symptoms, psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, and fear of infection) in a large sample of Spanish HCWs during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted a cross-sectional study including HCWs from three regions of Spain between April 24th and June 22nd, 2020. An online survey measured sociodemographic characteristics, work-related stressors, fear of infection, and mental health outcomes (depression [PHQ-9], psychological distress [GHQ-12], death wishes [C-SSRS]). We conducted mixed-effects regression models to adjust all associations for relevant individual- and region-level sources of confounding. We recruited 2,370 HCWs. Twenty-seven percent screened positive for depression and 74% for psychological distress. Seven percent reported death wishes. Respondents were more afraid of infecting their loved ones than of getting infected themselves. All work-related stressors were associated with depression symptoms and psychological distress in adjusted models. Non-probabilistic sampling, potential reverse causation. Modifiable work-related stressors are associated with worse mental health among HCWs. Our results suggest that workplace prevention strategies for HCWs should provide sufficient protective equipment, minimize changes in job functions, favor the implementation of criteria for patient triage and on-call bioethics committees, and facilitate access to stepped-care, evidence-based mental health treatment.","Mediavilla, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-JimÃƒÂ©nez, MartÃƒÂ­nez-AlÃƒÂ©s, Moreno-KÃƒÂ¼stner, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Morata, Jaramillo, MorÃƒÂ¡n-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, MinuÃƒÂ©, Torres-Cantero, Alvarado, Ayuso-Mateos, Mascayano, Susser, Bravo-Ortiz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.059","20210910","Covid-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Protective equipment; Triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17832,""
"State lockdown policies, mental health symptoms, and using substances","Previous literature finds an increase in depressive symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation following the COVID-19 pandemic in the US - suicides do not appear to increase. We examine whether 1) state lockdown policies in the US precede an increase in mental health symptoms; and 2) the extent to which using substances amplifies or attenuates the relation. We specified, as our exposure variable, the timing of state-level lockdown orders. We used, as the outcome variable, the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) that measures anxiety and depression symptoms. We utilized the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative sample of 7,597 adults across 50 states in the US, surveyed biweekly between March 10, 2020 and November 11, 2020. Linear fixed effect analyses controlled for time-invariant individual factors, as well as employment status, household income, and previous mental health diagnosis. Regression results indicate an increase in PHQ-4 scores of approximately 1.70 during lockdown, relative to no lockdown (p &lt; 0.05). Relative to no lockdown, an increase in alcohol use corresponds with a 0.08 unit decrease in PHQ-4 scores during lockdown (p &lt; 0.05). State lockdown policies precede greater mental health symptoms. Increases in consuming alcohol attenuates the relation between state lockdown policies and mental health symptoms. Results may portend greater addiction following the pandemic warranting further investigation into utilization of substance use treatment.","Das, Singh, Bruckner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107084","20210910","Alcohol; Anxiety; COVID; Depression; Lockdown; Substance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17833,""
"A randomized controlled trial of a therapeutic relational agent for reducing substance misuse during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), while alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution, Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse. In a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N = 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID&gt;1) were enrolled June-August 2020. The primary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores, adjusting for baseline differences and attrition. At baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (M = -9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. M = -3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value&lt;.05). W-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in substance use occasions was associated with better outcomes, including improved mental health. W-SUDs satisfaction was high.","Prochaska, Vogel, Chieng, Baiocchi, Maglalang, Pajarito, Weingardt, Darcy, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108986","20210910","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19 pandemic; Randomized controlled trial; Relational conversational agent; Substance-related disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17834,""

"Social, economic, and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents retained in or recently disengaged from HIV care in Kenya","Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV, ages 10-19) experience complex challenges to adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and remain in care, and may be vulnerable to wide-scale disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed for a range of effects of the pandemic on ALHIV in western Kenya, and whether effects were greater for ALHIV with recent histories of being lost to program (LTP). ALHIV were recruited from an ongoing prospective study at 3 sites in western Kenya. The parent study enrolled participants from February 2019-September 2020, into groups of ALHIV either 1) retained in care or 2) LTP and traced in the community. Phone interviews from July 2020-January 2021 assessed effects of the pandemic on financial and food security, healthcare access and behaviors, and mental health. Responses were compared among the parent study groups. Phone surveys were completed with 334 ALHIV or their caregivers, including 275/308 (89.3%) in the retained group and 59/70 (84.3%) among those LTP at initial enrollment. During the pandemic, a greater proportion of LTP adolescents were no longer engaged in school (45.8% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.017). Over a third (120, 35.9%) of adolescents reported lost income for someone they relied on. In total, 135 (40.4%) did not have enough food either some (121, 36.2%) or most (14, 4.2%) of the time. More LTP adolescents (4/59, 6.8% vs. 2/275, 0.7%, p = 0.010) reported increased difficulties refilling ART. Adolescent PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were Ã¢â€°Â¥3 for 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating socioeconomic effects for Kenyan ALHIV and their households. ALHIV with recent care disengagement may be especially vulnerable. Meanwhile, sustained ART access and adherence potentially signal resilience and strengths of ALHIV and their care programs. Findings from this survey indicate the critical need for support to ALHIV during this crisis.","Enane, Apondi, Aluoch, Bakoyannis, Lewis Kulzer, Kwena, Kantor, Chory, Gardner, Scanlon, Goodrich, Wools-Kaloustian, Elul, Vreeman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257210","20210910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17836,""
"Widespread closure of HIV prevention and care services places youth at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic","Central to measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV is understanding the role of loss of access to essential HIV prevention and care services created by clinic and community-based organization closures. In this paper, we use a comprehensive list of HIV prevention services in four corridors of the US heavily impacted by HIV, developed as part of a large RCT, to illustrate the potential impact of service closure on LGBTQ+ youth. We identified and mapped LGBTQ+ friendly services offering at least one of the following HIV-related services: HIV testing; STI testing; PrEP/PEP; HIV treatment and care; and other HIV-related services in 109 counties across four major interstate corridors heavily affected by HIV US Census regions: Pacific (San Francisco, CA to San Diego, CA); South-Atlantic (Washington, DC to Atlanta, GA); East-North-Central (Chicago, IL to Detroit, MI); and East-South-Central (Memphis, TN to New Orleans, LA). There were a total of 831 LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers across the 109 counties. There was a range of LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV-service provider availability across counties (range: 0-14.33 per 10,000 youth aged 13-24 (IQR: 2.13), median: 1.09); 9 (8.26%) analyzed counties did not have any LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the correlation between county HIV prevalence and LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service provider density was 0.16 (p = 0.09), suggesting only a small, non-statistically significant linear relationship between a county's available LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers and their HIV burden. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we must find novel, affordable ways to continue to provide sexual health, mental health and other support services to LGBTQ+ youth.","Stephenson, Walsh, Chavanduka, Sallabank, Horvath, Castel, Bonar, Hightow-Weidman, Bauermeister, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249740","20210910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17837,""
"Anxiety among Pregnant Women about Corona Virus Infections during COVID-19 Pandemic at a Tertiary Care Center in Nepal: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","COVID-19 is a beta coronavirus that is transmitted by physical interaction or close contact. This Coronavirus Pandemic has also created stress and anxiety among pregnant women all over the world. The disease was first identified in Wuhan city, China, in late December 2019 and was declared pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March 2020. Concern and stress in pregnancy are associated with pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labour, depression etc. Pregnancy is an immune-compromised state and poses a high risk to this risk. This study aims to identify anxiety about the coronavirus infection among pregnant women visiting a tertiary care centre in Kathmandu, Nepal, during this COVID-19 pandemic. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at Kathmandu Medical College and Teaching Hospital from 15th July 2020 to 30th July 2020 after taking the ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee of Kathmandu Medical College (reference no. 207202002). Convenient sampling method was used. All the data were entered in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences data 20.0 and analyzed. Data was presented in frequencies, charts and percentage. Among the total 273 cases, only 2 (0.73%) cases had a score between 25-30 corresponding to moderate to severe anxiety, 21 (7.69%) had a score between 18-24, which corresponds to mild to moderate anxiety and 250 (91.57%) had score 0-17 which corresponds mild status. Most of the participants in the study reported a mild status of anxiety.

"Prevalence and Workplace Drivers of Burnout in Cancer Care Physicians in Ontario, Canada","Provider well-being has become the fourth pillar of the quadruple aim for providing quality care. Exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, provider well-being has become a critical issue for health care systems worldwide. We describe the prevalence and key system-level drivers of burnout in oncologists in Ontario, Canada. This is a cross-sectional survey study conducted in November-December 2019 of practicing cancer care physicians (surgical, medical, radiation, gynecologic oncology, and hematology) in Ontario, Canada. Ontario is Canada's largest province (with a population of 14.5 million), and has a single-payer publicly funded cancer system. The primary outcome was burnout experience assessed through the Maslach Burnout Inventory. A total of 418 physicians completed the questionnaire (response rate was 44% among confirmed oncologists). Seventy-three percent (n = 264 of 362) of oncologists had symptoms of burnout (high emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization scores). Significant drivers of burnout identified in multivariable regression modeling included working in a hectic or chaotic atmosphere (odds ratio [OR] = 15.5; 95% CI, 3.4 to 71.5; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), feeling unappreciated on the job (OR = 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9 to 21.3; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), reporting poor or marginal control over workload (OR = 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9 to 21.3; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and not being comfortable talking to peers about workplace stress (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.9; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Older age (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 56 years) was associated with lower odds of burnout (OR = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Nearly three quarters of participants met predefined standardized criteria for burnout. This number is striking, given the known impact of burnout on provider mental health, patient safety, and quality of care, and suggests Oncologists in Ontario may be a vulnerable group that warrants attention. Health care changes being driven by the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to rebuild new systems that address drivers of burnout. Creating richer peer-to-peer and leadership engagement opportunities among early- to mid-career individuals may be a worthwhile organizational strategy.","Singh, Farrelly, Chan, Nicholls, Nazeri-Rad, Bellicoso, Eisen, Falkson, Fox, Holloway, Kennedy, McLeod, Rothenberger, Trudeau, Shanafelt, Bauman","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.21.00170","20210910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17841,""
"A trauma informed response to COVID 19 and the deteriorating mental health refugees and asylum seekers with insecure status in Australia","COVID-19 brings increased risk to the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia on temporary visas. Rapid government changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic are resulting in significant and sustained hardship on this already vulnerable group. This discursive paper is both an explainer and a resource for mental health nurses and health professionals with scope of practice in primary care and emergency departments responding to this population. The aim of this paper is to alert clinicians to the drivers of mental and suicide related distress and to provide recommendations as to how to therapeutically engage and support this group. Drivers include complex intersections between legal uncertainty, economic, social and mental health stress as drivers of entrapment, acute mental distress and suicidal ideation. Information about the COVID-19 related factors as drivers contributing to worsening states of distress may help guide clinicians to consider protective factors designed to mitigate the onset or worsening of mental distress, plus aid in the development of health policy and service-delivery arrangements of support and therapeutic engagement.","Kenny, Grech, Procter","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12932","20210910","COVID-19; asylum seeker; mental health; refugee; visa status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17842,""
"Lifestyle Adjustments in Long-COVID Management: Potential Benefits of Plant-Based Diets","The SARS-CoV-2-pandemic has caused mortality and morbidity at an unprecedented global scale. Many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 continue to experience symptoms after the acute phase of infection and report fatigue, sleep difficulties, anxiety, and depression as well as arthralgia and muscle weakness. Summarized under the umbrella term ""long-COVID,"" these symptoms may last weeks to months and impose a substantial burden on affected individuals. Dietary approaches to tackle these complications have received comparably little attention. Although plant-based diets in particular were shown to exert benefits on underlying conditions linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes, their role with regard to COVID-19 sequelae is yet largely unknown. Thus, this review sought to investigate whether a plant-based diet could reduce the burden of long-COVID. The number of clinical trials investigating the role of plant-based nutrition in COVID-19 prevention and management is currently limited. Yet, there is evidence from pre-pandemic observational and clinical studies that a plant-based diet may be of general benefit with regard to several clinical conditions that can also be found in individuals with COVID-19. These include anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and musculoskeletal pain.

"Evaluation of a novel concentrated interdisciplinary group rehabilitation for patients with chronic illnesses: Protocol for a non-randomized clinical intervention study","An ageing population with a growing burden of chronic, complex illnesses will seriously challenge the public health care system. Consequently, novel and efficacious treatment approaches are highly warranted. Based on our experiences with concentrated treatment formats for other health challenges, we have developed a highly concentrated interdisciplinary group rehabilitation for chronic illnesses. To explore the acceptability of the intervention and describe potential changes in functional impairment at follow-up. The cornerstones of the intervention are a) prepare the patient for change prior to treatment, b) focus on health promoting micro-choices instead of symptoms, and c) expect the patient to integrate the changes in everyday living with limited hands-on follow-up. The intervention will be delivered to patients with highly diverse primary symptoms, namely patients with low-back pain, post-COVID-19 symptoms, anxiety and depression and diabetes type 2. Recruitment started between August 2020 and January 2021 (according to illness category). For initial 3-month results, recruitment is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. If successful, this study may have a substantial impact on the treatment of these four chronic illnesses that together constitute a major socioeconomic cost. Further, the study may widen the evidence-base for the use of the concentrated treatment format in a diverse group of medical conditions.","Kvale, Frisk, JÃƒÂ¼rgensen, BÃƒÂ¸rtveit, ÃƒËœdegaard-Olsen, Wilhelmsen-Langeland, Aarli, Sandnes, Rykken, Haugstvedt, Hystad, SÃƒÂ¸fteland","https://doi.org/10.2196/32216","20210910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17844,""
"Wounded healers during the COVID-19 syndemic: Compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction among nursing care providers in Greece","The aim of this study was to investigate compassion fatigue (CF) and compassion satisfactionÃ‚Â (CS) in nursing care providers in COVID-19 units. A mixed-method study with 105 nurses. 23% of participants reported high CF risk while 77% expressed high to moderate potential for CS. Adequate preparation/education, clear and accountable leadership, and team sharing of feelings, experiences, and responsibilities during the transition in the COVID-19 unit helped participants to deal with overwhelming anxiety which if unattended could bring about frustration and long-lasting feelings of powerlessness. In the face of the present and future pandemics, there is a clear need to prepare healthcare organizations and nursing care providers to cope with the emotional content of public health emergencies while protecting themselves and avoid absorbing unmanageable emotions.","Missouridou, Mangoulia, Pavlou, Kritsotakis, Stefanou, Bibou, Kelesi, Fradelos","https://doi.org/10.1111/ppc.12946","20210910","burnout; compassion fatigue; compassion satisfaction; emotional work; nursing; secondary posttraumatic stress; spirituality; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17845,""

"The growing field of digital psychiatry: current evidence and the future of apps, social media, chatbots, and virtual reality","As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies - such as smartphone apps,Ã‚Â vir-tual reality, chatbots, and social media - have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for ""digital phenotyping"" and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions - including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders - as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.","Torous, Bucci, Bell, Kessing, Faurholt-Jepsen, Whelan, Carvalho, Keshavan, Linardon, Firth","https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20883","20210910","chatbots; digital health; digital phenotyping; implementation; mHealth; mental health; psychiatry; smartphone apps; social media; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17847,""
"Frequency of contact with friends and relatives via internet and psychosocial factors in middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic Findings from the German Ageing Survey","Previous studies have examined the association between frequency of contact with friends and relatives via internet and psychosocial factors (in terms of loneliness, life satisfaction and depressive symptoms). However, far less is known about such a link during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly based on nationally representative samples. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine this association among middle-aged/older adults. Data were taken from the short survey of the German Ageing Survey (June/July 2020, 3,134 individuals in the analytical sample). The De Jong Gierveld scale was used to quantify loneliness, the Satisfaction with Life Scale was used to quantify life satisfaction and the 15-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression was used to quantify depressive symptoms. Regressions showed that - compared to daily users - less frequent users of the internet for contact with friends and relatives reported increased loneliness, lower life satisfaction and more depressive symptoms. With regard to covariates, better psychosocial factors were associated with medium education (compared to low education), living with partner in the same household (compared to singles), better self-rated health, and favorable COVID-19 factors (in terms of decreased feeling that the Corona crisis is a threat for oneself, not having an infection with the coronavirus and an increased feeling that you can influence an infection with the coronavirus yourself). Data suggest that individuals with a high frequency of contact with friends and relatives via internet reported better psychosocial factors. Future research in other cultural settings are required.

"A Microbiome-Driven Approach to Combating Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The significant stressors brought about and exacerbated by COVID-19 are associated with startling surges in mental health illnesses, specifically those related to depressive disorders. Given the huge impact of depression on society, and an incomplete understanding of impactful therapeutics, we have examined the current literature surrounding the microbiome and gut-brain axis to advance a potential complementary approach to address depression and depressive disorders that have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. While we understand that the impact of the human gut microbiome on emotional health is a newly emerging field and more research needs to be conducted, the current evidence is extremely promising and suggests at least part of the answer to understanding depression in more depth may lie within the microbiome. As a result of these findings, we propose that a microbiome-based holistic approach, which involves carefully annotating the microbiome and potential modification through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle changes, may address depression. This paper's primary purpose is to shed light on the link between the gut microbiome and depression, including the gut-brain axis and propose a holistic approach to microbiome modification, with the ultimate goal of assisting individuals to manage their battle with depression through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle changes, in addition to offering a semblance of hope during these challenging times.","Ghannoum, Ford, Bonomo, Gamal, McCormick","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.672390","20210910","depression; diet; exercise; gut microbiome; holistic approach; probiotics; sleep; stress management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17849,""
"Older Adults in the United States and COVID-19: A Qualitative Study of Perceptions, Finances, Coping, and Emotions","<b>Introduction:</b> Older adults have the poorest coronavirus (COVID-19) prognosis with the highest risk of death due to complications, making their COVID-19 experiences particularly important. Guided by the stress-appraisal-coping theoretical model, we sought to understand COVID-related perceptions and behaviors of older adults residing in the United States. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We used convenience sampling to recruit persons with the following inclusion criteria: Aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years, English fluency, and U.S. residency. Semi structured in-depth interviews were conducted remotely and audio recorded between April 25, 2020 and May 7, 2020. Interviews were professionally transcribed with a final study sample of 43. A low-inference qualitative descriptive design was used to provide a situated understanding of participants' life experiences using their naturalistic expressions. <b>Results:</b> The mean age of participants was 72.4 Ã‚Â± 6.7. Slightly over half were female (55.8%), 90.6% were White, and 18.6% lived alone. The largest percentages of participants resided in a rural area (27.9%) or small city (25.6%). We identified four themes, including (1) risk perception, (2) financial impact, (3) coping, and (4) emotions. Most participants were aware of their greater risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes but many did not believe in their increased risk. Financial circumstances because of the pandemic varied with largely no financial impacts, while others reported negative impacts and a few reported positive impacts. Coping was problem- and emotion-focused. Problem-focused coping included precautionary efforts and emotion-focused coping included creating daily structure, pursuing new and/or creative activities, connecting with others in new ways, and minimizing news media exposure. Overall, emotional health was negatively affected by the pandemic although some participants reported positive emotional experiences. <b>Conclusions:</b> Perceiving themselves as high risk for COVID-19 complications, older adults used precautionary measures to protect themselves from contracting the virus. The precautionary measures included social isolation, which can negatively affect mental health. Older adults will need to be resourceful and draw on existing resources to cope, such as engaging in creative activities and new strategies to connect with others. Our findings underscore the importance of the preservation of mental health during extended periods of isolation by taking advantage of low-to-no-cost existing resources.","Goins, Anderson, Minick, Daniels","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.660536","20210910","COVID-19; coping; emotions; finances; older adults; perceptions; qualitative methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17850,""
"Eating habits and mental health among rugby players of the Peruvian pre-selection during the second quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic","Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the mental health and diet of populations. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the eating habits and mental health status of the rugby players of the Peruvian pre-selection were affected by the second quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress disorder: The perfect 'storm' for mental health (Review)","Since its outbreak, in December, 2019, in the Chinese city of Wuhan, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into an ongoing global pandemic. Due to the novel antigenic properties of this virus, the world population could not develop immunity effectively and this led to the subsequent spread of COVID-19. This caused an unprecedented emergency situation with significant negative effects on health and well-being both on an individual and societal level. Apart from health, economic and social consequences, the impact of this pandemic on mental health is increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. The present review aimed to provide a comprehensive discussion of the possible neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, together with the related underlying molecular pathways. In addition, the present review focused on populations which are at a higher risk of developing psychiatric disturbances due to the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed possible routes of clinical management and therapeutics to minimize the burden associated with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, research findings exploring the prevalence of COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms across vulnerable groups, including children, adolescents and COVID-19 survivors are presented, with particular emphasis on those with severe disease who required hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admission. Based on the available literature, the identification of potential determinants associated with PTSD across the different populations is underlined. Lessons learnt from the pandemics across the globe together with the ongoing research on COVID-19 and its impact on mental health, highlight the utmost importance for evidence-based, proactive and targeted interventions in high-risk groups aiming to mitigate the risks and manage vulnerabilities.","Giannopoulou, Galinaki, Kollintza, Adamaki, Kympouropoulos, Alevyzakis, Tsamakis, Tsangaris, Spandidos, Siafakas, Zoumpourlis, Rizos","https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10596","20210910","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 neurobiology; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17852,""
"Factors Related to Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain","The COVID-19 disease has forced governments to adopt exceptional measures. The lockdown decreed in Spain in 2020 required citizens to stay confined at home, which might have affected their mental health. The objective is to identify factors that influenced adults' mental health during this period. A sample of 3,508 adults from the Spanish general population completed an online survey that collected sociodemographic data and information about daily planning and activities, healthy habits, loneliness, coping humor and mental health. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. According to the results, the proposed model showed good fit values, and latent variables explained 30% of the variance in mental health. Loneliness, coping humor, healthy habits, age and gender had a significant weight in the prediction of mental health during lockdown. Area of residence, number of days of confinement and number of people in the household were not related to mental health. This study addresses the effect of COVID-19 and social distancing measures by identifying risk and protective factors for the development of mental health difficulties.

Columbia University School of Nursing adapted guidelines and conducted Circles of Care to share, listen, and acknowledge the new challenges for nurses via Zoom. Analysis of these sessions produced major themes of concern for nurses. Between March 31 and May 31, 2020, we facilitated 77 sessions with 636 attendees. Eight major themes emerged: coping mechanisms, patients suffering and dying, feelings of helplessness, frustration with COVID-19 response, silver lining, disconnection from the world, the thread that holds nurses together, and exhaustion.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migraine management in the United States: insights from migraine tracking app users","The nature of COVID-19 pandemic measures has altered the clinical management of migraine, and has also created barriers to evaluate the impact of such measures of migraine patients. Using the Migraine Buddy smartphone application, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migraine in users residing in the United States. Migraine Buddy is a smartphone application by individuals to record their migraine headache episodes, characteristics, and coping mechanisms. For this study, anonymized self-reported data from 163,176 adult Migraine Buddy users in the United States between January 2020 and May 2020, were analyzed for migraines associated with stress. A stress-related migraine is defined as one in which stress or anxiety was reported as a trigger or symptom. A questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on migraine and its management was also completed by 923 users from the United States in the app between April 2020 and May 2020. 88% of the Migraine Buddy database extract and 84% of the respondents are female, with a mean age of 36.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The proportion of stress-related migraine attacks peaked at 53% on March 21 to 23, although the number of migraine attacks decreased. This followed the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency on March 13 and a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Questionnaire respondents felt that the following added more stress: social isolation (22.6%), information overdose (21.2%), access to essentials (food, medication, etc.) (18.7%), and financial concerns (17.8%). To help manage migraine during COVID-19, respondents suggested stress and diet coaching programs and resources (medical articles, etc.) (34.0%), having the option for home delivery of medication (30.6%) and tele-consulting (25.5%). Here, we report the change in the proportion of self-reported stress-related migraine in relation to evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact of migraine management. Our data will help increase the understanding of patients' needs and help with planning and execution of mitigating strategies.","Kato, Poh, Horvath, Cadiou, Shimazu, Maruki","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-021-02378-3","20210910","COVID-19; Migraine; Pandemic; Real world; Smartphone application","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17858,""

Popular scientific databases-PubMed, Scopus, and Embase-were systematically searched from the beginning of the pandemic until 12 July 2021. According to the adopted criteria, 14 articles were included in the review. Ten of the qualified studies determined the impact of the pandemic on the physical activity of athletes. The authors of 11 papers assessed the mental state and quality of life of athletes during the pandemic. The studies showed negative effects of the pandemic: a decrease in overall physical fitness and number of days and hours of training, as well as an increase in the occurrence of negative emotions (stress, fatigue, and depression) and a decrease in sleep quality. Changes in physical activity had an impact on overall well-being ratings, which depended on the sex of the subjects. Women were more likely to experience negative emotions compared to men. The mental state of the athletes affected the quality of sleep. This review summarises the negative effects of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic on the physical and mental health of professional athletes.","Jurecka, SkuciÃ…â€žska, GÃ„â€¦dek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179423","20210910","COVID-19; exercise; health-related quality of life; mental condition; sportsmen; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17860,""
"Emotional Control among Nurses against Work Conditions and the Support Received during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","Working in the state of a pandemic is a huge mental load for the medical environment. Evaluation of emotional control among nurses against work conditions and the support received during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The research was performed among nurses (<i>n</i> = 577) working during the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in infectious (<i>n</i> = 201) and non-infectious (<i>n</i> = 376) wards in 11 Polish hospitals. To evaluate work conditions, the questionnaire prepared by the authors and the Emotional Control Scale (Courtauld Emotional Control Scale-CECS), which rates the control of anger, depression, and fear were used. In the entire research group, fear had the highest rate of suppression among the negative emotions-18.25 points, 17.91 points in infectious wards and 18.44 points among nurses working in non-infectious wards; <i>p</i> &gt; 0.05. The nurses fear was significantly repressed when there was no possibility of the nurses having to perform a COVID-19 test in the workplace; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. A larger emotional supressed occurred in nurses who simultaneously declared the perception of increased stress level; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. A high level of emotion suppression, especially regarding fear, combined with higher stress levels, occurring irrespective of the ward, points at the need for mental support for the researched nurses.","Malinowska-LipieÃ…â€ž, Wadas, SuÃ…â€škowska, Suder, GabryÃ…â€º, KÃƒÂ³zka, Gniadek, Brzostek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179415","20210910","COVID-19; anger; depression; emotional control; fear; nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17861,""
"Association of Visual Display Terminal Usage with Self-Rated Health and Psychological Distress among Japanese Office Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to examine the association of the duration of visual display terminal (VDT) usage for work and non-work activities with self-rated health (SRH) and psychological distress among office workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. A cross-sectional data of 7088 office workers from a web-based, self-administered survey conducted from 25 August 2020, to 30 September 2020, was used. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied. Compared to those who used a VDT for 4-9 h for work, office workers who used a VDT for Ã¢â€°Â¥10 h for work had poor SRH (odds ratio (OR): 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 2.41) and severe psychological distress (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.52, 3.28). VDT usage for less than 1 h (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.67) and 1-3 h (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.80) for work were also associated with severe psychological distress. Stratification analysis by age showed a significant association of VDT usage for work with poor SRH among 30-64-year-olds, while a U-shape association was found between VDT usage for work and psychological distress with the younger age group (15-29 years old). During the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the prolonged usage of VDT for work can deteriorate both general and psychological health, while moderate usage of VDT for work can reduce psychological distress.","Khin, Matsuyama, Tabuchi, Fujiwara","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179406","20210910","mental health; occupational health; physical health; screen time; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17862,""
"The German Translation of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9) Scale: Results from Healthcare Workers during the Second Wave of COVID-19","Healthcare workers (HCW) are among those most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most research with this group has used ad hoc measures, which limits comparability across samples. The Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 scale (SAVE-9) is a nine-item scale first developed in Korea, and has since been translated into several languages. We report on data collected from 484 German HCW between November 2020 and March 2021, during the ""second wave"" of coronavirus infections. We conducted item analysis, confirmatory factor analysis on the previously found factor solutions of the SAVE-9, examined correlations with established measures of depression, generalized anxiety, and insomnia, and compared scores between different groups of HCW. The psychometric properties of the German SAVE-9 were satisfactory and comparable to previous findings from Korea and Russia. Correlations with mental health measures were positive, as expected. We found some significant differences between groups of HCW on the SAVE-9 which were consistent with the literature but did not appear on the other mental health measures. This suggests that the SAVE-9 taps into specifically work-related stress, which may make it a helpful instrument in this research area.","KÃƒÂ¶nig, Chung, Ertl, Doering, Comtesse, Unterhitzenberger, Barke","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179377","20210910","COVID-19; Germany; SAVE-9; anxiety; healthcare workers; work stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17863,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Students' Mental Health and Sleep in Saudi Arabia","Mental health problems are prevalent among university students in Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students' mental health and sleep in Saudi Arabia. A total of 582 undergraduate students from Saudi Arabia aged between 18 and 45 years old (M = 20.91, SD = 3.17) completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire measuring depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Analysis included an independent samples <i>t</i>-test, one-way ANOVA, and Hierarchical regression analysis. Undergraduate students reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress and low levels of resilience (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) during the pandemic. In addition, students reported experiencing insomnia. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that lower resilience, high levels of insomnia, having a pre-existing mental health condition, and learning difficulties (such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, or dyscalculia) were significantly associated with high levels of depression and stress. In addition, lower resilience, a high level of insomnia, and pre-existing mental health conditions were significantly associated with high levels of anxiety. Finally, a lower level of psychological resilience and a high level of insomnia were significantly associated with increased levels of depression, anxiety and stress within university students. This study has provided evidence that a lower level of psychological resilience and insomnia were associated with mental health problems among undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia, thus enhancing psychological resilience and interventions to support sleep and mental health are vital to support student well-being outcomes throughout the pandemic.","Alyoubi, Halstead, Zambelli, Dimitriou","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179344","20210910","anxiety; depression; pandemic; resilience; sleep; stress; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17864,""
"Variations in the Mood States during the Different Phases of COVID-19's Lockdown in Young Athletes","The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 led to a situation of home lockdown. Competitions, training, and sports activities were canceled for much of this period. This situation could have affected the physical and mental health and the mood states of young athletes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the variations in the mood states of young athletes of a highly competitive level during the different phases of lockdown in. The mood states of 45 Spanish youth athletes confined during the 10-week lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic -19 were assessed, using the Spanish-translated version of the POMS questionnaire, at the start of the home lockdown and at the start and at the end of the partial lockdown. The Total Mood Disturbance scores at week 10 were lower than those obtained in week 1 (<i>p<sub>Bonferroni</sub></i> = 0.031). The depression scores at week 6 (<i>p<sub>Bonferroni</sub></i> = 0.048) and at week 10 (<i>p<sub>Bonferroni</sub></i> &lt; 0.001) were lower than those obtained in week 1. The confusion scores at week 10 were lower than those obtained in week 1 (<i>p<sub>Bonferroni</sub></i> = 0.002). These variations differed between team and individual sports. In conclusion, the lockdown produced changes in the young athletes' mood states that should be considered when trying to optimize their physical and mental performance.","Batalla-Gavalda, Cecilia-Gallego, Revillas-Ortega, Beltran-Garrido","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179326","20210910","COVID-19; POMS; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17865,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on ICU Healthcare Professionals: A Mixed Methods Study","The large numbers of patients admitted to intensive care units due to COVID-19 has had a major impact on healthcare professionals. The incidence of mental health disorders among these professionals has increased considerably and their professional quality of life has suffered during the pandemic. This study aims to explore the impact of the provision of COVID-19 patient care on ICU healthcare professionals. A mixed methods study with an exploratory concurrent design was conducted between June and November 2020 in the Balearic Islands, Spain. Data were collected using a self-report online survey (<i>n</i> = 122) based on three validated questionnaires, and individual semi-structured in-depth online interviews (<i>n</i> = 11). Respondents scored 2.5 out of 5 on the moral distress scale, moderate/high on the compassion satisfaction scale, and moderate on the burnout and compassion fatigue subscales. Age was significantly and negatively related to professional quality of life but was positively related to workload and unavailability of protective equipment. Three main groups of themes relating to the impact of the pandemic emerged from the in-depth interviews: (a) clinical, (b) professional, and (c) personal and family impacts in the two waves. ICU healthcare professionals should be viewed as second victims of the COVID-19 pandemic as they have suffered significant psychological, professional, and moral harm.","Moreno-Mulet, SansÃƒÂ³, Carrero-Planells, LÃƒÂ³pez-Deflory, Galiana, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Pazo, BorrÃƒÂ s-Mateu, MirÃƒÂ³-Bonet","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179243","20210910","COVID-19; ICU healthcare professionals; mixed methods; moral distress; professional quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17866,""
"School Parks as a Community Health Resource: Use of Joint-Use Parks by Children before and during COVID-19 Pandemic","Parks are settings for physical activity that can support the physical and mental health of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined the impact of the pandemic on the use of joint-use parks outside of school hours by children in Austin, TX, United States. In autumn of 2019 and autumn of 2020 (i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic), we used an adapted version of the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities to observe whether children aged 1-12 participated in physical activity (i.e., sedentary, light and moderate, vigorous) at three parks located at schools serving mostly economically disadvantaged Latinx families. In 2020, we also observed whether children maintained social distance and wore face coverings. Results of negative binomial regression modeling revealed the pandemic was associated with a 46% [95% CI: 20-63%] and 62% [95% CI: 39-76%] decrease in the number of girls and boys at parks, respectively, and a 42% [95% CI: 16-59%] and 60% [95% CI: 36-75%] decrease in the number of girls and boys engaging in physical activity, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

"Associations between Depression, Anxiety, Fatigue, and Learning Motivating Factors in e-Learning-Based Computer Programming Education","Quarantines imposed due to COVID-19 have forced the rapid implementation of e-learning, but also increased the rates of anxiety, depression, and fatigue, which relate to dramatically diminished e-learning motivation. Thus, it was deemed significant to identify e-learning motivating factors related to mental health. Furthermore, because computer programming skills are among the core competencies that professionals are expected to possess in the era of rapid technology development, it was also considered important to identify the factors relating to computer programming learning. Thus, this study applied the Learning Motivating Factors Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) instruments. The sample consisted of 444 e-learners, including 189 computer programming e-learners. The results revealed that higher scores of individual attitude and expectation, challenging goals, clear direction, social pressure, and competition significantly varied across depression categories. The scores of challenging goals, and social pressure and competition, significantly varied across anxiety categories. The scores of individual attitude and expectation, challenging goals, and social pressure and competition significantly varied across general fatigue categories. In the group of computer programming e-learners: challenging goals predicted decreased anxiety; clear direction and challenging goals predicted decreased depression; individual attitude and expectation predicted diminished general fatigue; and challenging goals and punishment predicted diminished mental fatigue. Challenging goals statistically significantly predicted lower mental fatigue, and mental fatigue statistically significantly predicted depression and anxiety in both sample groups.","Dirzyte, Vijaikis, Perminas, Rimasiute-Knabikiene","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179158","20210910","anxiety; depression; fatigue; learning; motivating factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17868,""
"Prevalence of Psychological Impacts on Healthcare Providers during COVID-19 Pandemic in Asia","COVID-19 has impacted people psychologically globally, including healthcare providers. Anxiety, depression, and stress are the most common impacts that have affected these people. Thus, this study was aimed to ascertain the estimated prevalence of psychological impacts among healthcare providers in the Asian region. A systematic search was performed in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for original research articles published between 2020 and April 2021. Only studies published in English were included. The quality of data was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis, and the analysis was performed using generic inverse variance with a random-effects model by Review Manager software. A total of 80 studies across 18 countries in Asia region were pooled to assess the data prevalence on anxiety (34.81% (95% CI: 30.80%, 38.83%)), depression (34.61% (95% CI: 30.87%, 38.36%)), stress (31.72% (95% CI: 21.25%, 42.18%)), insomnia (37.89% (95% CI: 25.43%, 50.35%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (15.29% (95% CI: 11.43%, 19.15%)). Subgroup analyses were conducted across regions, type of healthcare providers, sex, and occupation. This review has identified a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia but a low prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among healthcare providers in Asia regions. Effective intervention support programs are urgently needed to improve psychological health of healthcare providers and maintaining the health system.","Norhayati, Che Yusof, Azman","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179157","20210910","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; depression; insomnia; prevalence; psychological impacts; stress; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17869,""
"Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 Trauma on Developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder among Emergency Medical Workers in Spain","The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic presented the characteristics of a traumatic event that could trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. Emergency Medical Services workers are already a high-risk group due to their professional development. The research project aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS professionals in terms of their mental health. For this purpose, we present a descriptive crosssectional study with survey methodology. A total of 317 EMS workers (doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians) were recruited voluntarily. Psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and insomnia were assessed. The instruments were the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-8), and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS-8). We found that 36% of respondents had psychological distress, 30.9% potentially had PTSD, and 60.9% experienced insomnia. Years of work experience were found to be positively correlated, albeit with low effect, with the PTSD score (<i>r</i> = 0.133). Finally, it can be stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a traumatic event for EMS workers. The number of professionals presenting psychological distress, possible PTSD, or insomnia increased dramatically during the early phases of the pandemic.

"Increased Use of Porch or Backyard Nature during COVID-19 Associated with Lower Stress and Better Symptom Experience among Breast Cancer Patients","Contact with nature has been used to promote both physical and mental health, and is increasingly used among cancer patients. However, the COVID-19 pandemic created new challenges in both access to nature in public spaces and in cancer care. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the change in active and passive use of nature, places of engaging with nature and associations of nature contact with respect to improvements to perceived stress and symptom experience among breast cancer patients during the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of people diagnosed with breast cancer using ResearchMatch (<i>n</i> = 56) in July 2020 (the first wave of COVID-19). In this US-based, predominantly white, affluent, highly educated, female sample, we found that, on average, participants were first diagnosed with breast cancer at 54 years old and at stage 2 or 3. Eighteen percent of participants experienced disruptions in their cancer care due to the pandemic. As expected, activities in public places significantly decreased as well, including use of parks/trails and botanical gardens. In contrast, spending time near home, on the porch or in the backyard significantly increased. Also observed were significant increases in indoor activities involving passive nature contact, such as watching birds through a window, listening to birdsong, and smelling rain or plants. Decreased usage of parks/trails was significantly associated with higher stress (Coef = -2.30, <i>p</i> = 0.030) and increased usage of the backyard/porch was significantly associated with lower stress (Coef = -2.69, <i>p</i> = 0.032), lower symptom distress (Coef = -0.80, <i>p</i> = 0.063) and lower symptom severity (Coef = -0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.009). The most commonly reported alternatives to outdoor engagement with nature were watching nature through a window (84%), followed by looking at images of nature (71%), and listening to nature through a window (66%). The least commonly enjoyed alternative was virtual reality of nature scenes (25%). While outdoor contact with nature away from home decreased, participants still found ways to experience the restorative benefits of nature in and around their home. Of special interest in planning interventions was the fact that actual or real nature was preferred over that experienced through technology. This could be an artifact of our sample, or could represent a desire to be in touch with the ""real world"" during a health crisis. Nature contact may represent a flexible strategy to decrease stress and improve symptom experience among patients with cancer, particularly during public health crises or disruptions to cancer care.","Pearson, Breeze, Reuben, Wyatt","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179102","20210910","cancer symptoms; green space; indoor nature; nature-watching; parks; passive nature; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17872,""
"""We Thought We Were Prepared, but We Were Not"": Experiences from the Management of the Psychosocial Support Response during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sweden A Mixed-Methods Study","This study aimed to describe experiences of managing mental health and psychosocial activities during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. A national survey was answered by a non-probability sample of 340 involved in the psychosocial response. The psychosocial response operations met several challenges, mainly related to the diverse actors involved, lack of competence, and lack of preparations. Less than 20% of the participants had received specific training in the provision of psychosocial support during major incidents. The interventions used varied, and no large-scale interventions were used. The psychosocial response organizations were overwhelmed by the needs of health care staff and failed to meet the needs of patients and family members. An efficient and durable psychosocial response in a long-term crisis requires to be structured, planned and well-integrated into the overall pandemic response. All personnel involved need adequate and specific competence in evidence-based individual and large-scale interventions to provide psychosocial support in significant incidents. By increasing general awareness of mental wellbeing and psychosocial support amongst health professionals and their first-line managers, a more resilient health care system, both in everyday life and during major incidents and disasters, could be facilitated.","Hugelius, Johansson, SjÃƒÂ¶lin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179079","20210910","COVID-19; crisis management; mental health; psychosocial response; psychosocial support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17873,""
"Grief Reactions and Grief Counseling among Bereaved Chinese Individuals during COVID-19 Pandemic: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial Combined with a Longitudinal Study","COVID-19 has caused nearly 4.3 million deaths all around the world. People who have experienced loss during this special period may find it difficult to adapt to life after loss, and may even suffer from prolonged grief disorder or other mental health problems. However, there is a huge gap of grief research in China, with almost no comprehensive grief intervention training system or very few professional grief consultants. Considering the large number of bereaved individuals who are suffering from grief and other mental health problems, it is significant to develop a suitable and effective intervention protocol immediately. This article illustrates a study protocol initiated by a Chinese university to investigate the mental health of bereaved individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and train grief counselors to provide grief counseling to the bereaved, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the grief counseling. The method is as follows: (1) 300 psychological counselors will be recruited to attend the grief counseling training. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: baseline (T0), after the basic training (T1), and after the advanced training (T2); (2) 500 bereaved Chinese will be recruit to join the online survey and will be assessed at two time points with a six-month interval; and (3) a two-armed (grief counseling versus wait-list controls) RCT (random control trials) will be conducted with 160 bereaved individuals. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: before randomization (baseline, T0), at the post-counseling (T1), and three months after the post-counseling (T2). Primary outcomes will be assessed by the Prolonged Grief Questionnaire (PG-13), the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI).

This study aims to explore public perspective on health systems' response towards COVID-19, and to identify gaps for health systems strengthening by leveraging on WHO health systems' building blocks. A qualitative study was conducted using open-ended questions survey among public followed by in-depth interviews with key informants. Opinions on Malaysia's health systems response towards COVID-19 were gathered. Data were exported to NVIVO version 12 and analysed using content analysis approach. The study identified various issues on health systems' response towards COVID-19, which were then mapped into health systems' building blocks. The study showed the gaps were embedded among complex interactions between the health systems building blocks. The leadership and governance building block had cross-cutting effects, and all building blocks influenced service deliveries. Understanding the complexities in fostering whole-systems strengthening through a holistic measure in facing an outbreak was paramount. Applying systems thinking in addressing gaps could help addressing the complexity at a macro level, including consideration of how an action implicates other building blocks and approaching the governance effort in a more adaptive manner to develop resilient systems.","Balqis-Ali, Fun, Ismail, Ng, Jaaffar, Low","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179047","20210910","COVID-19; Malaysia; epidemic; health systems building blocks; health systems strengthening; outbreak; systems thinking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17875,""
"Effectiveness of a Three-Week Inpatient Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program for Patients after COVID-19: A Prospective Observational Study","For COVID-19 patients who remain symptomatic after the acute phase, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended. However, only a few studies have investigated the effectiveness of PR, especially considering the duration between the acute phase of COVID-19 and the onset of rehabilitation, as well as the initial severity. This prospective observational study evaluated the efficacy of PR in patients after COVID-19. A total of 120 still-symptomatic patients referred for PR after overcoming acute COVID-19 were asked to participate, of whom 108 (mean age 55.6 Ã‚Â± 10.1 years, 45.4% female) consented. The patients were assigned to three groups according to the time of referral and initial disease severity (severe acute; severe after interval; mild after interval). The primary outcome was dyspnea. Secondary outcomes included other respiratory disease symptoms, physical capacity, lung function, fatigue, quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, patients rated the overall effectiveness of PR and their subjective change in health status. At the end of PR, we detected improvements with large effect sizes in exertional dyspnea, physical capacity, QoL, fatigue, and depression in the overall group. Other parameters changed with small to medium effect sizes. PR was effective after acute COVID-19 in all three groups analyzed.","Hayden, Limbach, Schuler, Merkl, Schwarzl, Jakab, Nowak, Schultz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179001","20210910","COVID-19; course of recovery; inpatient rehabilitation; pulmonary rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17876,""
"Factors Associated with Insomnia Symptoms in a Longitudinal Study among New York City Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Few studies have examined the longer-term psychological impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers (HCWs). We examined the 10-week trajectory of insomnia symptoms in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs completed a web-based survey at baseline (9 April-11 May 2020) and every 2 weeks for 10 weeks. The main outcome was the severity of insomnia symptoms in the past week. Multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equation analyses examined factors associated with insomnia symptoms. <i>n</i> = 230 completed surveys at baseline. <i>n</i> = 155, <i>n</i> = 130, <i>n</i> = 118, <i>n</i> = 95, and <i>n</i> = 89 completed follow-ups at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Prevalence of insomnia symptoms of at least moderate severity was 72.6% at baseline, and 63.2%, 44.6%, 40.7%, 34.7%, and 39.3% at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. In multivariable analyses, factors significantly associated with increased odds of insomnia symptoms were younger age (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-1.00), working in a COVID-facing environment (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.15-2.67) and hours worked (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.06-1.27). The initial high rates of insomnia symptoms improved as time passed from the peak of local COVID-19 cases but four out of ten HCWs still had moderate-to-severe insomnia symptoms ten weeks after baseline.","Abdalla, Chiuzan, Shang, Ko, Diaz, Shaw, McMurry, Cannone, Sullivan, Lee, Venner, Shechter","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178970","20210910","COVID-19; healthcare worker; insomnia; mental health; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17877,""
"Migrants and Service Providers' Perspectives of Barriers to Accessing Mental Health Services in South Australia: A Case of African Migrants with a Refugee Background in South Australia","International mobility has increased steadily in recent times, bringing along a myriad of health, social and health system challenges to migrants themselves and the host nations. Mental health issues have been identified as a significant problem among migrants, with poor accessibility and underutilisation of the available mental health services (MHSs) repeatedly reported, including in Australia. Using a qualitative inquiry and one-on-one in-depth interviews, this study explored perspectives of African migrants and service providers on barriers to accessing MHSs among African migrants in South Australia. The data collection took place during the COVID-19 pandemic with lockdown and other measures to combat the pandemic restricting face to face meetings with potential participants. Online platforms including Zoom and/or WhatsApp video calls were used to interview 20 African migrants and 10 service providers. Participants were recruited from community groups and/or associations, and organisations providing services for migrants and/or refugees in South Australia using the snowball sampling technique. Thematic framework analysis was used to guide the data analysis. Key themes centred on personal factors (health literacy including knowledge and the understanding of the health system, and poor financial condition), structural factors related to difficulties in navigating the complexity of the health system and a lack of culturally aware service provision, sociocultural and religious factors, mental health stigma and discrimination. The findings provide an insight into the experiences of African migrants of service provision to them and offer suggestions on how to improve these migrants' mental health outcomes in Australia. Overcoming barriers to accessing mental health services would need a wide range of strategies including education on mental health, recognising variations in cultures for effective service provision, and addressing mental health stigma and discrimination which strongly deter service access by these migrants. These strategies will facilitate help-seeking behaviours as well as effective provision of culturally safe MHSs and improvement in access to MHSs among African migrants.","Fauk, Ziersch, Gesesew, Ward, Green, Oudih, Tahir, Mwanri","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178906","20210910","African migrants; Australia; barriers; mental health problems; mental healthcare services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17878,""
"Assessment of Anxiety, Depression, Attitude, and Coping Strategies of the Egyptian Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed several challenges on different populations all around the world, with stress being identified as one of the major challenges. This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19-induced stress on the prevalence and severity of anxiety and/or depression, factors that predict the development of anxiety and/or depression, and coping strategies in the Egyptian population during the COVID 19 outbreak. This is an observational cross-sectional online study. The questionnaire of our study included five sections: demographic and clinical data, attitude towards COVID-19, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and a specifically prepared and standardized Arabic version of a coping strategies scale. The questionnaire was uploaded on 20 May 2020 at 1 p.m. and closed on 7 July 2020 at 8 a.m. The study questionnaire was completed by 283 Egyptians, with mean age 34.81 Ã‚Â± 11.36 years, of which 17% had been infected with COVID-19. The responses showed that 62.9% had moderate anxiety, whereas 12.4% had severe anxiety. Moreover, 13.8% had moderate depression, and 14.1% had severe depression. Our study demonstrated that age, mental status, and being infected with COVID-19 correlated with depression, whereas only age correlated with anxiety. Interestingly, our data showed that anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with some coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, imposes stress on individuals, which leads to the development of anxiety and/or depression. Several factors, which could be population-dependent, may help predict the development of anxiety or depression. We show the factors correlated with depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Egyptian population. Furthermore, certain personal coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic are negatively correlated with anxiety and depression. Therefore, our study sheds light on the importance of studying factors in each population that can lead to pandemic-induced psychological complications and those that can relieve such complications.","Shehata, Gabra, Eltellawy, Elsayed, Gaber, Elshabrawy","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173989","20210910","BDI-II; COVID-19; Egyptian; SARS-CoV-2; STAI; anxiety; coping strategies; coronavirus; depression; emotions; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17879,""
"A Standardized Prospective Memory Evaluation of the Effects of COVID-19 Confinement on Young Students","The restriction imposed worldwide for limiting the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally impacted our lives, decreasing people's wellbeing, causing increased anxiety, depression, and stress and affecting cognitive functions, such as memory. Recent studies reported decreased working memory (WM) and prospective memory (PM), which are pivotal for the ability to plan and perform future activities. Although the number of studies documenting the COVID-19 effects has recently blossomed, most of them employed self-reported questionnaires as the assessment method. The main aim of our study was to use standardized tests to evaluate WM and PM in a population of young students. A sample of 150 female psychology students was recruited online for the administration of two self-reported questionnaires that investigated psychological wellbeing (DASS-21), prospective, and retrospective memory (PRMQ). Subjects were also administered two standardized tests for WM (PASAT) and PM (MIST). We found increased anxiety, depression, and stress and decreased PM as measured by self-reports. The perceived memory failures agreed with the results from the standardized tests, which demonstrated a decrease in both WM and PM. Thus, COVID-19 restriction has strongly impacted on students' mental health and memory abilities, leaving an urgent need for psychological and cognitive recovery plans.","Pisano, Torromino, Brachi, Quadrini, Incoccia, Marangolo","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173919","20210910","COVID-19 confinement; prospective memory; psychological wellbeing; working memory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17880,""
"Post-Intensive Care Syndrome and Its New Challenges in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Review of Recent Advances and Perspectives","Intensive care unit survivors experience prolonged physical impairments, cognitive impairments, and mental health problems, commonly referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Previous studies reported the prevalence, assessment, and prevention of PICS, including the ABCDEF bundle approach. Although the management of PICS has been advanced, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed an additional challenge to PICS. The prevalence of PICS after COVID-19 extensively varied with 28-87% of cases pertaining to physical impairments, 20-57% pertaining to cognitive impairments, and 6-60% pertaining to mental health problems after 1-6 months after discharge. Each component of the ABCDEF bundle is not sufficiently provided from 16% to 52% owing to the highly transmissible nature of the virus. However, new data are emerging about analgesia, sedation, delirium care, nursing care, early mobilization, nutrition, and family support. In this review, we summarize the recent data on PICS and its new challenge in PICS after COVID-19 infection.","Nakanishi, Liu, Kawakami, Kawai, Morisawa, Nishida, Sumita, Unoki, Hifumi, Iida, Katsukawa, Nakamura, Ohshimo, Hatakeyama, Inoue, Nishida","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173870","20210910","ABCDEF bundle; COVID-19; PICS; cognitive impairments; delirium; family; mental health problems; nutrition; physical impairments; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","",17881,""
