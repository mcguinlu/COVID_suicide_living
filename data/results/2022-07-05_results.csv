"DiÃ¡logo deliberativo con universidades iberoamericanas sobre intervenciones en salud mental estudiantil durante la pandemia de COVID-19 Deliberative dialogue with Ibero-American universities on interventions in student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic DiÃ¡logo deliberativo com universidades ibero-americanas sobre intervenÃ§Ãµes em saÃºde mental dos estudantes na pandemia de COVID-19","RESUMEN Objetivo. Contextualizar una sÃ­ntesis de evidencia sobre intervenciones en salud mental estudiantil durante la pandemia de la enfermedad por el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19, por su sigla en inglÃ©s) por medio de un diÃ¡logo deliberativo con universidades iberoamericanas. MÃ©todos. Se realizÃ³ previamente una sÃ­ntesis de evidencia y un diÃ¡logo sincrÃ³nico, que consistiÃ³ en la discusiÃ³n en subgrupos acerca del diseÃ±o y aplicaciÃ³n de las intervenciones en salud mental. Se realizÃ³ un anÃ¡lisis de datos dialÃ³gicos y se sintetizÃ³ por temas. Resultados. Cincuenta y siete miembros de 17 universidades iberoamericanas pÃºblicas y privadas participaron en el encuentro. En el diseÃ±o de las intervenciones, se percibe la salud mental como desatendida, y visibilizada con la pandemia. La detecciÃ³n de necesidades es la que orienta las intervenciones y rara vez se utiliza evidencia cientÃ­fica para diseÃ±arlas. Se considera importante conformar un equipo interdisciplinario con capacitaciÃ³n continua para diseÃ±ar un programa especÃ­fico, que cubra tambiÃ©n familias y personal docente y administrativo. En la aplicaciÃ³n, existen problemas como la saturaciÃ³n de los servicios por la alta demanda y la falta de recursos bÃ¡sicos de los estudiantes. Es innegable la influencia del contexto macro e institucional por la disposiciÃ³n de recursos. El diÃ¡logo fue percibido como oportunidad para construir un consolidado nuevo de intervenciones. Conclusiones. Este diÃ¡logo permitiÃ³ enriquecer la descripciÃ³n de intervenciones en salud mental estudiantil durante la pandemia de COVID-19 ya descritas en la literatura, aunque llevarlas a la prÃ¡ctica en nuestro contexto supone hacer frente a la deuda por la desatenciÃ³n previa y las altas necesidades bÃ¡sicas insatisfechas.","Zapata-Ospina, Juan Pablo, PatiÃ±o-Lugo, Daniel Felipe, RamÃ­rez-PÃ©rez, Paola Andrea, MarÃ­n-Orozco, Isabel Cristina, VelÃ¡squez-Salazar, Pamela, VÃ©lez-MarÃ­n, Viviana MarÃ­a, GarcÃ­a-Arias, David","https://www.google.com/search?q=DiÃ¡logo+deliberativo+con+universidades+iberoamericanas+sobre+intervenciones+en+salud+mental+estudiantil+durante+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19+Deliberative+dialogue+with+Ibero-American+universities+on+interventions+in+student+mental+health+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+DiÃ¡logo+deliberativo+com+universidades+ibero-americanas+sobre+intervenÃ§Ãµes+em+saÃºde+mental+dos+estudantes+na+pandemia+de+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health; 46, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33711,""

Event centrality is thought to play a key role in the development of PTSS, but it is not yet clear by what mechanism. Theoretically, event centrality may affect the retrieval of traumatic memories and further prompt post-traumatic cognitions to understand events, and so may in turn be associated with PTSS in college students. However, few empirical studies have examined the mediating role of post-traumatic cognitions in the relationship between event centrality and PTSS, especially among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the mediating roles of post-traumatic cognitive factors (e.g. attention to negative information, catastrophizing, and rumination) in the relationship between event centrality and PTSS among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We recruited 1153 college students who completed the pandemic experiences scale, the centrality of event scale, the attention to positive and negative information scale, the cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire, and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Results: In this sample of college students, event centrality directly predicted PTSS, and PTSS was also indirectly predicted by event centrality through attention to negative information, catastrophizing, and rumination. Conclusions: These findings support the existing literature on the relationship between event centrality, proposed cognitive variables, and PTSS, and shed light on the mechanisms underlying PTSS. Our findings also highlight the importance and applicability of targeted cognitive interventions for PTSS in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. HIGHLIGHTS The COVID-19 pandemic has caused post-traumatic stress symptoms among college students. Event centrality is a risk factor of post-traumatic stress symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Attention to negative information, catastrophizing and rumination mediate the relationship between event centrality and post-traumatic stress symptoms.","Yang, Xima, Xu, Yongyong, Tan, Ruyue, Zhou, Xiao","https://www.google.com/search?q=Event+centrality+and+post-traumatic+stress+symptoms+among+college+students+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+the+roles+of+attention+to+negative+information,+catastrophizing,+and+rumination+Centralidad+del+evento+y+sÃ­ntomas+de+estrÃ©s+postraumÃ¡tico+entre+estudiantes+universitarios+durante+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19:+Los+roles+de+la+atenciÃ³n+a+la+informaciÃ³n+negativa,+catastrofizaciÃ³n+y+rumiaciÃ³n+COVID-19<U+75AB><U+60C5><U+671F><U+95F4><U+5927><U+5B66><U+751F><U+7684><U+4E8B><U+4EF6><U+4E2D><U+5FC3><U+5316><U+548C><U+521B><U+4F24><U+540E><U+5E94><U+6FC0><U+75C7><U+72B6>:<U+6D88><U+6781><U+6CE8><U+610F><U+504F><U+5411><U+3001><U+707E><U+96BE><U+5316><U+548C><U+53CD><U+520D><U+7684><U+4F5C><U+7528>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33712,""

(The following  of the original article appeared in record 2021-00510-022.) The COVID-19 pandemic likely will have profound impacts on the mental health of older adults by increasing their demand for services while disrupting the supply of high-quality and timely care. Understanding the extent and duration of the mental health impacts and identification of best practices will require carefully planned observational studies and experimentations. In the meantime, social workers across care settings can contribute to knowledge building by documenting the measures taken to prevent and address the mental health needs of older adults and families in their practices and, as permitted, collect data for evaluation.

"Stay home, stay safe, stay green: The role of gardening activities on mental health during the Covid-19 home confinement","Social distancing and home confinement during the first wave of Covid-19 have been essential to helping governments to flatten the infection curve but raised concerns on possible negative consequences such as prolonged isolation or sedentary lifestyles. In this scenario, gardening activities have been identified as a plausible tool to buffer the mental health consequences of forced home confinement. In this paper, we investigate the relation between gardening and psychopathological distress during the lockdown of the first wave of Covid-19 in Italy. It is hypothesized that engagement in gardening activities promotes psychological health, through a reduction of Covid-related stress. An online survey was administered through sharing using social media to N = 303 participants during the March-May 2020 lockdown in Italy, measuring Covid-19 related distress, psychopathological distress, engagement in gardening activities plus a series of socio-demographic and residential covariates. As expected, a mediation model tested using a bootstrapping procedure showed that gardening is related to lower psychopathological distress through decreased Covid-19 related distress. Interestingly, results also showed that psychopathological distress was higher for women and unmarried respondents, and negatively associated with age and square meters per person at home. The theoretical and practical implications for social policies contrasting the Covid-19 pandemic are discussed.","Theodorou, Annalisa, Panno, Angelo, Carrus, Giuseppe, Carbone, Giuseppe Alessio, Massullo, Chiara, Imperatori, Claudio","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stay+home,+stay+safe,+stay+green:+The+role+of+gardening+activities+on+mental+health+during+the+Covid-19+home+confinement","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Urban forestry & urban greening; 61:127091-127091, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33714,""
"Adaptation of Threat Responses Within the Negative Valence Framework","External threats are a major source of our experience of negatively valanced emotion. As a threat becomes closer and more real, our specific behavior patterns and our experiences of negative affect change in response to the perceived imminence of threat. Recognizing this, the National Institute of Mental Healthâ€™s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Negative Valence system is largely based around different levels of threat imminence. This perspective describes the correspondence between the RDoC Negative Valence System and a particular neurobiological/neuroecological model of reactions to threat, the Predatory Imminence Continuum (PIC) Theory. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an illustration, we describe both adaptive and maladaptive behavior patterns from this perspective to illustrate how behavior in response to a crisis may get shaped. We end with suggestions on how further consideration of the PIC suggests potential modifications of the negative valence systems RDoC.","Smith, Nancy J.; Markowitz, Sara Y.; Hoffman, Ann N.; Fanselow, Michael S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adaptation+of+Threat+Responses+Within+the+Negative+Valence+Framework","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in systems neuroscience; 16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33715,""

"The gift of positive solitude: An exploration of the phenomenon in old age","The goal of this work is to offer a new perspective on the old concept of solitude. It aims to bring to light the beneficial aspects of solitude, called here positive solitude. Yet the term positive solitude is unfamiliar in the empirical literature;instead, positive aspects of solitude are examined in the context of solitude, loneliness, or social isolation, for example. Solitude is mentioned as a double-edged sword, meaning it may have negative outcomes such as ill-health or depression, according to Peplau and Perlman (1982) and to Coplan et al. (2019), but it may also be beneficial (Long & Averill, 2003;Nguyen et al., 2018).When referring to solitude, some gaps in the empirical literature are easily noticeable: A clear definition differentiating solitude from loneliness and social isolation cannot be found. This despite the fact that solitude is sometimes used to describe a positive and freely chosen situation of being with/by oneself (Long et al., 2003). Also, the literature does not contain a consensual distinction between solitude and positive solitude. Furthermore, solitude was hardly examined in the context of older adults, although it may have meaningful implications for this population. Yet, another aspect is that older adults may occasionally depend on caregivers. However, there is hardly any evidence about how older adults' positive solitude is perceived by their caregivers. In addition to these gaps in the empirical literature, there is a scarcity of research about older adults' positive solitude during the COVID-19 crisis.This thesis addresses the positive aspects of solitude, mainly among older adults. It aims to relate to the positive aspects of solitude and distinguish it as a stand-alone phenomenon, which is referred to as positive solitude throughout the dissertation. It also aims at differentiating positive solitude from loneliness and social isolation. Furthermore, we wish to understand the differences in younger and older adults' perceptions of positive solitude and to explore the differences in older adults' and their caregivers' perceptions of older adults' positive solitude. Finally, another goal is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults' positive solitude during this global health crisis.Solitude is a vague term, often used as a synonym for loneliness or social isolation (Coplan & Bowker, 2013;Larson, 1990). Loneliness, which is the gap between the desired social relationship and the actual one (Hawkley & Caccioppo, 2010), and social isolation, which is the objective state of being alone (De Jong & Van Tilburg, 2010) are painful, undesired states, and may result in cognitive, mental, and health deterioration (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). Yet, unlike loneliness and social isolation, solitude is potentially enjoyable (Detrixhe et al., 2014;Long & Averill, 2003). Solitude, which is generally defined as a state of being alone (Meriam-Webster, n.d.), may have a positive impact on the quality of life: It enables the individual to experience a sense of serenity and connectedness with oneself (Long & Averill, 2003) and emotional self-regulation (Nguyen et al., 2018, 2019), as well as freedom from daily burdens (Larson, 1990).

"VA provider perceptions of pandemic motivated telemental health: A SWOT analysis","The purpose of the present study was to evaluate psychologist and social worker perceptions regarding the current state of pandemic motivated telemental health care in a rural Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). This study utilized an anonymous survey to evaluate provider perceptions of telemental health's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities for improving practice, threats to implementation and overall perceived efficacy of telemental health as a means of providing mental health care. Of the 47 total respondents, three responses could not be used as they failed to accurately answer the validity question. The final sample of 44 respondents was comprised of 16 psychologists (36.4% of the total sample) and 28 social workers (63.6% of the total sample). Respondents were from the Manchester VAMC and surrounding New Hampshire Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Descriptive statistics in the form of central tendency were computed to identify trends in provider responses. Veteran convenience and increased access to mental health care were among the most reported strengths of telemental health. Perceived weaknesses included unreliable technology and lack of available technical support. Opportunities for improvement included increased efficacy of the technology, increased technical support, and increased need for applied research on the efficacy of telemental health in this and other settings. Threats to successful delivery of quality care via telemental health included a perceived decline in therapeutic rapport when compared to face to face therapy. Most respondents agreed that telemental health was an effective way to deliver health care to veterans. The results of this study were intended to provide a current snapshot of provider perceptions of telemental health within the VA.

"Challenges faced by people affected with leprosy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a questionnaire based study","This study aims to assess the continuity of medical care, the impact on disease condition and to highlight the major challenges faced by people affected by leprosy during the pandemic. Telephonic questionnaire-based survey was conducted among previously registered patients of leprosy at referral hospitals in India. Leprosy affected people aged &gt;18 years, either on treatment or who had completed treatment with access to phone and willingness to participate were included. The questions were asked pertaining to demographic details, baseline disease characteristics and various problems faced during lockdown relating to livelihood, finances, treatment, and mental status. A total of 196 patients consented to participate in the study. Mean age of study participants was 37.31 (13.86) years, male participants (n=123, 62.7%) were more than females (n=73, 37.2%). Overall, 101 patients (51.5%) experienced exacerbation, 21 patients (10.7%) reported improvement and 74 patients (37.8%) reported no change in disease status during the pandemic. Most common difficulty faced was the procurement of medicines (115 patients, 58.6%) followed by difficulty in diagnostic testing (61 patients, 31.1%). Course of treatment was interrupted in 16 patients. Most of the patients (n=147, 75%), agreed that teleconsultation services would aid in management of their disease. The majority of patients (88.2%) were able to continue some form of treatment. Two patients (1%) tested positive for COVID-19. Nearly all patients (n=189, 96.4%) were informed regarding the risks and preventive measures related to COVID-19. Fifty percent of the patients reported deterioration in mental health due to the pandemic. The present study highlights the gaps in healthcare delivery and social inequalities along with their impact on the health, livelihood and mental status of people affected by leprosy during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Narang, T.; Mehta, H.; Rathod, S.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on the Healthy Eating and Movement Behaviors of 0â€“12-Year-Old Children in Western Sydney, Australia","This study examined effects of COVID-19 restrictions in early 2020 on movement (physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep) and healthy eating behaviors in families with 0â€“12-year-old children in western Sydney, Australia. A total of 1,371 parents completed an online survey about changes in children's and families' food intake and movement behaviors. There was an increase in sedentary screen use by children (4.18/5.00) and families (3.91/5.00) and a slight increase in reported physical activity (3.56/5.00), amount of food consumed (3.58/5.00) and meals and snacks eaten (3.69/5.00) during the height of the COVID-19 restrictions compared to before. There was little change in reported sleep (3.17/5.00). Lower socioeconomic families were disproportionately affected, with greater increases in unhealthy eating (t = 2.739, P = 0.06), lower levels of improvement in physical activity, such as walking and cycling (t = -7.521, P &lt; 0.001) and outdoor activity (t = 5.415, p &lt; 0.001), and higher increases in family sedentary behavior (t = 2.313, P = 0.021). Therefore, even short periods of restrictions can result in detrimental health behavior changes. Such changes could become entrenched leading to increased risk of lifestyle diseases. Programmatic and policy strategies should be geared toward promoting healthy movement behaviors, focusing on families of lower socioeconomic status to ensure the pandemic does not widen an existing gap.","McNicholas, Janelle, Hammersley, Megan L.; Hopkins, Stacey, McDermott, Sarah, Plaskett, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+Restrictions+on+the+Healthy+Eating+and+Movement+Behaviors+of+0â€“12-Year-Old+Children+in+Western+Sydney,+Australia","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in public health; 10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33723,""
"Experiences of same-sex attracted consensually nonmonogamous parents and their partners","Although cultural expectations in the United States prescribe that parents should be monogamous, data suggest that many parents, including and perhaps especially same-sex attracted parents, navigate consensual nonmonogamy (CNM) in their relationships. This dissertation used online surveys and phone interviews to expand our understanding of same-sex attracted parents and their partners in CNM relationships. In Article 1, I examine intersections between CNM relationships and parenting practices among 86 parents and their partners, attending to the ways that participants produce parental and familial identities, structure their families, organize care responsibilities, and negotiate stigma. Article 2 focuses on experiences with mental health care providers, as reported by 65 parents in CNM relationships and their partners. In Article 3, I explore the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on 70 parents in CNM relationships - a demographic who may have been uniquely impacted by public health guidelines to physically distance from those outside of their household. In each article, participants invested in projects of care (e.g., for themselves, their children, and partners) within mononormative social contexts. Participants resisted stigmatizing power structures through integrating parenthood with CNM relationship practices, transforming what it means to be a ""good parent,"" being open with or challenging mental health care providers, and connecting in innovative ways with non-cohabiting partners to ""keep CNM alive."" This dissertation communicates several strengths and needs of CNM families, providing further insights into how service providers and mental health care professionals can best support these parents and their interpersonal networks.

"Expanding bilingual social workers for the East Asian older adults beyond the ""COVID-19 racism""","This reprinted chapter originally appeared in Journal of Gerontological Social Work, 2020, 63[6-7], 589-591. (The following  of the original article appeared in record 2021-00510-009.) Considering East Asian older adults are in dire need of both social and mental health services in the face of COVID-19 and COVID racism, Asian bilingual social workers are needed now more than ever. These social workers can communicate with them, help them, and advocate for them with professional knowledge and ethical obligation to promote their wellbeing. So far, no attention has been made to promote bilingual social workers from any reasonable parties such as community-based organizations or social work program institutions. As an East Asian bilingual social worker who has been providing services to older adults in the one of the metropolitan cities in the U.S., I would like to encourage these responsible parties to collaborate to build future social workers. By supporting bilingual volunteers in the community to attend social work programs, the community will gain more bilingual social workers in the Asian community when social work professionals are more diverse. In this way, East Asian older adults can take active and affirmative action on their existing issues and COVID racism with help from Asian bilingual social workers.

(The following  of the original article appeared in record 2021-00510-008.) Here in the U.S., and across the globe, humans are practicing ""social distancing"" to protect themselves and others from the effects of the COVID19 pandemic. However, social distancing has brought adverse side effects such as social isolation. Particularly, older adults are more vulnerable to this pandemic because they are experiencing extreme loss of physical, social, and psychological interaction, which is essential for their health and well-being, as well as they are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. To make matters worse, older adults are witnessing family members suffer due to job loss and financial difficulties, which may increase the risk of mental health concerns. Fear and anxiety, stress and depression may result in maladaptive coping mechanisms where turning to alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs while staying at home becomes habitual. During this time, the direct impact and secondary consequences of COVID-19 disproportionately impacts older adults marginalized by sexual orientation, racial, economic inequalities, and/or disability.

"Cardiopulmonary predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19: What are the findings? prÃ©dicteurs cardio-pulmonaire de la mortalitÃ© chez les patients ayant la COVID-19 : quel Ã©clairage?","Background. â€“ Since 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Aims. â€“ To determine independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19, and identify any associations between pulmonary disease severity and cardiac involvement. Methods. â€“ Clinical, laboratory, electrocardiography and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were collected from 389 consecutive patients with COVID-19. Patients were divided into alive and deceased groups. Independent predictors of mortality were identified. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed, based on patients having a troponin concentration &gt; 99th percentile (cardiac injury) and a CT severity score = 18. Results. â€“ The mortality rate was 29.3%. Cardiac injury (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14â€“4.18;P = 0.018), CT score = 18 (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.15â€“4.34;P = 0.017), localized ST depression (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.33â€“10.67;P = 0.012), hemiblocks (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.47â€“6.48;P = 0.003) and history of leukaemia/lymphoma (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.37â€“10.29;P = 0.010) were identified as independent predictors of mortality. Additionally, patients with cardiac injury and CT score = 18 were identified to have a significantly shorter survival time (mean 14.21 days, 95% CI 10.45â€“17.98 days) than all other subgroups. There were no associations between CT severity score and electrocardiogram or cardiac injury in our results. Conclusions. â€“ Our findings suggest that using CT imaging and electrocardiogram characteristics together can provide a better means of predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. We identified cardiac injury, CT score = 18, presence of left or right hemiblocks on initial electrocardiogram, localized ST depression and history of haematological malignancies as independent predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Kavosi, Hoda, Rad, Sepehr Nayebi, Yekta, Reza Atef, Tamartash, Zahra, Dini, Mahboubeh, Nejad, Zahra Javadi, Aghaghazvini, Leila, Javinani, Ali, Mohammadzadegan, Amir Mohammad, Kiaei, Seyedeh Zahra Fotook","https://www.google.com/search?q=Cardiopulmonary+predictors+of+mortality+in+patients+with+COVID-19:+What+are+the+findings?+prÃ©dicteurs+cardio-pulmonaire+de+la+mortalitÃ©+chez+les+patients+ayant+la+COVID-19 :+quel+Ã©clairage?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of cardiovascular diseases;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33727,""

A questionnaire was administered to 209 college students in South Korea. Frequency analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and t-test were conducted to analyze the collected data using the JAMOVI program. The results revealed that nearly 20% participants reported experiencing severe stress, anxiety, and depression due to COVID-19. Further, female students scored higher at all levels. The level of psychological distress of the students who get support for their living expenses was significantly higher than that of students making money through part-time jobs. The depression level of students attending face-to-face classes was significantly higher than those who did not. The grade and housing type were not significant aspects. Based on these results, a discussion was then presented. This study thereby provided foundational data for identifying the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on South Korean college students.

"Measuring Intellectual and Emotional Health during COVID-19 Pandemic: Scale Development and Validation","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has proven itself a deadly pandemic and has not spared a single life on this planet. Every individual is bearing the brunt of this pandemic to a great extent in every possible way. The world is entering into the new normal where people have started living with the precautions. However, several stressors that emerged during COVID-19 are leaving not just a short term but also a long-term impact on the intellect and emotions of every single person. Measurement of intellectual and emotional health has become the need of the hour and will be very useful for analysing the effect of stress due to COVID-19, which will eventually help everyone identify and practice their coping strategies. The current study aims to develop and validate a scale for measuring the intellectual and emotional health of people. The data was collected from 364 respondents using convenience sampling. The validated scale has a total of 21 items, of which five items are for measuring intellectual health and 16 items for measuring emotional health. In addition, behaviour indicators identified during the research for both health types were categorised into eustress and distress. The developed scale can be useful for working and non-working individuals to understand their level of emotional and intellectual health and be proactive in protecting themselves from the continuous pain of depression, anxiety, or the tendency to engage in self-harm behaviours even after the COVID-19 era gets over.","Joshi, Parikshit, Singh, Anshu, Kumar, Shailendra, Agarwal, Priyanka, Joshi, Garima","https://www.google.com/search?q=Measuring+Intellectual+and+Emotional+Health+during+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Scale+Development+and+Validation","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: SCMS Journal of Indian Management; 19(1):5-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33729,""
"THE DISPARATE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ACROSS SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES","Hussain et al asserts that across watershed moments of crisis--like September 11, the 2016 presidential election, and now this Covid-19 pandemic--South Asian American communities have deeply divided experiences. The populations in our community who were primarily targeted after September 11, most impacted by this Administration's racist policies, and most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the same populations marginalized by immigration status, class, caste, religion, and LGBT+ identity. While developing a shared narrative across these differences is valuable for building collective power, only by centering the experiences of these populations can we understand the magnitude and range of these crises. South Asian Americans who were already vulnerable, whether due to immigration status (refugees, undocumented, H-1B, J-1), domestic violence, living with underlying health conditions, or unsafe working environments, have been most directly impacted by the pandemic.

"Rural perspectives on healing after a family member's suicide: A grounded theory model","The purpose of this study was to investigate the process of healing after a family member's suicide. To do so, a qualitative study with a grounded theory design was utilized to glean information from a rural population about personal experiences healing from a family member's suicide. Data was collected from eight participants using a one-on-one semi-structured interview style to understand behavior, thoughts, relationships, and perspectives connected to the healing process from a family member's suicide. Telecommunication was utilized as a means of data collection due to social distancing requirements because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data analysis was conducted using common grounded theory coding techniques to identify common themes. Comparative analysis between themes (i.e., codes) and the researcher's memos was repeated until the data was saturated, at which time a theoretical framework based on data, the researcher's perspective, and a relevant literature review was generated. Perspective, Connectedness, Emotion, Action, and Time were the five refocused codes that emerged from the data. The resulting theoretical framework is based on the juxtaposition of these constructed codes, the researcher's perspective, and relevant literature. Findings illustrate the essential aspects to a lifetime of healing, such as a new perspective, connectedness with others, emotional intelligence, healing action, and time.

"Exploring culturally competent mental health outreach to Black churches","Black individuals and communities have held distrust toward mental health services and experience barriers in seeking services. Although the church is a significant support system in the Black community, it can also pose a barrier to congregation members seeking mental health services, as the Black church community has often stigmatized those seeking mental health services as weak. Ways to reach the Black community with trauma-informed, culturally competent, and spiritually sensitive mental health services through establishing connections with Black churches and church leaders were explored in this study. Previous research indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic increased depression and anxiety in the Black community because of disproportionate illnesses and deaths. This study explored ways Black churches can provide access to trustworthy, culturally competent, and spiritually sensitive mental health services. The Baldrige Framework of Excellence was the conceptual framework. Data were collected through six semistructured interviews with the senior leaders of the behavioral health organization who agreed to participate in the study. Secondary data were also collected and included meeting minutes, strategic plans, the organizational website, and information from the organization's library of resources. Findings showed that Black women were able to seek counseling comfortably because of increases in teletherapy and preparedness to handle increased demand during the coronavirus pandemic. This study's findings contribute to positive social change by providing behavioral health leaders with insights on how to establish trust and normalization of mental health services through effective outreach to local Black churches.

"Social workers' perspectives of depression in baby boomers born between 1946 and 1955","As the leading-edge baby boomer (L-E boomer) cohort continues to age, demands of mental health services in treating diagnosed depression in this cohort are increasing. Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) are the most likely social workers to provide services to L-E boomers diagnosed with depression. LCSWs were the chosen participants for this generic qualitative study to gain knowledge of their perspectives of working with L-E boomers diagnosed with depression. Grounded in generational theory, this study used a generic qualitative approach allowing for nonrestrictive measures for capturing the data. NVIVO assisted in coding the data and identification of common themes, words, and patterns. The five themes which emerged from the results are as follows: (a) obstacles to successful client therapy, (b) emergence of COVID 19, (c) rewarding experiences that derived from working with L-E boomers, (d) the role that the use of drugs and alcohol played with L-E boomers, and (e) cultural aspects of L-E boomers that surfaced during therapy sessions Positive social change was recognized in providing a better understanding of the changes needed to improve services for depression for this cohort as it is an illness commonly found with L-E boomers. This study also addressed a shortage of LCSWs interested in specializing in careers that provide treatment for depression of L-E boomers. A better understanding of some of the misconceptions that prevail in working as a LCSW for this cohort may entice potential LCSWs to choose gerontological social work. This may help meet the demands for mental health services with treatment for depression for L-E boomers.

"Nautical sports tourism: Improving people's wellbeing and recovering tourism destinations","While positive news on COVID-19 vaccines has boosted the hopes of the travel and tourism sector (T&T), the pandemic scenario has brought new concerns to tourists and different motivations to travel. For instance, safety, health, and hygiene are paramount. Moreover, as the pandemic impacted not only the physical, but also the mental health, wellness has been acknowledged as a key ingredient for the T&T recovery. The appreciation of nature surroundings and the practice of outdoor activities are the new trend in the post-COVID-19 world. As such, the nautical tourism with special interest in sports has the potential to become very popular. Thus, with the purpose to identify managerial, governmental, and academic opportunities for this sector, a literature review on nautical sports tourism was developed. The analysis revealed that there is still a long way for this literature research to reach maturity. Nevertheless, it was observed that the combination of sports and tourism in nautical environments opens a myriad of possibilities for places to enhance their public welfare.

(The following  of the original article appeared in record 2021-00510-032.) In September 2019, we initiated a study in Puerto Rico to assess the mental health status and needs of community-dwelling older adults two years after Hurricane Maria. Informed by interviews with community leaders, academics, NGO's, clergy and government officials there, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 154 adults aged 60+ and in-depth narrative interviews with a subsample of 8.

"State of Emotional Health Disorders of Undergraduate Students in the United Arab Emirates: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Introduction The emotional health disorders are a significant burden to the health of the residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, there is a paucity of evidence on the prevalence of mental health disorders throughout the Middle East in general. The prevalence of mental health problems among students and the associated impact on UAE society requires more exploration. Building an understanding of these factors is essential to inform the development of interventions in the UAE context. Aim This study aimed to establish the prevalence of three main mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and stress disorders) among undergraduate students in the UAE. Methods This study used a descriptive, cross-sectional mixed methods design. Data were collected 2018 using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) just before the Mental Health problems associated with Corona Pandemic and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Results The results were reported using descriptive statistics. This study received ethical approval. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students in one Emirates in UAE were 38% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.04â€“2.33), 55% (95% CI: 2.52â€“2.87), and 29% (95% CI: 1.76â€“2.02), respectively. Conclusion Anxiety disorders are the predominant mental health problem among UAE students. There is a need for increased research in this area and on mental health problems in general in the UAE.","Al Marzouqi, Amina M.; Otim, Michael Ekubu, Alblooshi, Ahmed, Al Marzooqi, Suad, Talal, Marah, Wassim, Farah","https://www.google.com/search?q=State+of+Emotional+Health+Disorders+of+Undergraduate+Students+in+the+United+Arab+Emirates:+A+Cross-Sectional+Survey","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology research and behavior management; 15:1423-1433, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33738,""

"Psychological consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic A study carried out on the psychiatric medical staff","Motivation for the choice of topic: The covid-19 pandemic has restructured the entire health care system. As systems of care were overwhelmed, many health professionals in related professional areas became increasingly involved in providing medical aid. The present paper aims to highlight a comparative analysis between two psychiatric wards of the same hospital, with qualified medical staff, with similar levels of competence, one of the wards caring for patients exclusively with major psychiatric pathologies, and the other patients with associated SARS-COV2 infection. The objective is to highlight links between different variables, such as motivation versus amotivation, anxiety and/or burnout, work experience, and resilience, all of which also relate to decisions to accept and provide quality medical care to this particular category of patients. Methodology Application of specific questionnaires and scales on a group of 60 medical workers in two psychiatric wards, one of which was declared a ward working with psychiatric patients with covid. Results: Resident doctors, then nurses, followed by hospital attendants, attending physicians and lastly psychologists, cope in descending order with professional stress related to covid-19 anxiety. This is high and correlates positively with depression and burn-out - which, in the case of young people, risks demotivating them to the point of destroying their future plans and the hope of successful professional self-esteem. Conclusions: The covid-19 pandemic in a psychiatric hospital has raised anxieties even among medical staff, who have moved from somatic to psychiatric care over the years, and the comorbidity of mental illness and SARS-COV2 infection has raised particular problems. Among staff, anxiety, risk of depression, burnout, with depletion of compensatory resources have increased. Resilience calls for the use of mature defence mechanisms and professional experience protects against anxiety and burnout.","Trifu, A.

"Workplace isolation amongst home-based teleworkers: Can psychological capital make a difference?","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: With the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, home-based teleworking has become the new normal. Researchers have suggested workplace isolation as the most frequently reported employee concern of teleworkers. Workplace isolation is reported to have many undesirable outcomes. However, limited studies have examined the influence of workplace isolation on mental health and its underlying mechanisms. Drawing from the emotion-centered model of occupational stress and conservation of resources theory, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between workplace isolation and mental ill-health with negative emotions as a mediator and psychological capital as a moderator. METHODS: The data was collected from 322 home-based teleworkers working in Information Technology companies in India using a survey method. The data was analyzed using SmartPLS, SPSS and PROCESS macro. RESULTS: The results suggest the following. First, workplace isolation was associated with mental ill-health and negative emotions mediated this relationship. Second, psychological capital was found to buffer the effects of workplace isolation on negative emotions. Third, the conditional indirect effect of workplace isolation on mental ill-health through negative emotions was weaker in the presence of high psychological capital. CONCLUSION: The current study is the first one to examine the mediating role of negative emotions and the moderating role of psychological capital in the relationship between workplace isolation and mental ill-health among home-based teleworkers. This study demonstrates the importance of psychological capital as a personal resource that can help in coping with the negative effects of workplace isolation.","Sahai, S.; Ciby, M.

"All the lonely people: Effects of social isolation on self-disclosure of loneliness on Twitter","This study explores the effect of unprecedented mass isolation during COVID-19 lockdowns through the lens of self-disclosure of loneliness on Twitter. Using a dataset of 30 million public tweets, we use machine learning to identify tweets that contain self-disclosure of loneliness. We find that thousands more people turned to Twitter to express their loneliness during the lockdowns;however, this effect normalized within a month, demonstrating the ?ordinization? effect on a collective level. Furthermore, lockdown brought a marked shift in the weekly timings of posting and a change in the accompanying emotions, which were more positive and other-focused. Finally, based on a qualitative analysis, we propose an updated typology of loneliness that captures the possibilities offered by the affordances of social media. Our findings illustrate the profound effect lockdowns had on the societal psychological state and emphasize the importance of mental health resources during extreme and isolating events.","Hommadova Lu, Anya, Mejova, Yelena","https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448221099900","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: New Media & Society;: 14614448221099900, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33744,""

"How the COVID-19 Pandemic has Affected Transgender Community People: Findings From a Telephonic Survey in Odisha","Alike any other marginalized groups of people, the unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 virus has also catastrophically damaged the lifestyle of the transgender persons in Odisha. In order to understand the life struggle of transgender people during the world pandemic, this study is an attempt to examine their life experience throughout the pandemic and their strategic plans to deal with such tragic crisis. To materialize the above cited objectives, we have conducted 30 telephonic interviews from two cities (Cuttack and Bhubaneswar) of Odisha. We asked some open-ended questions regarding their struggle to survive, family support, availability of government assistances and accessibility of basic services and their mental conditions during the pandemic time. Our finding from the survey depicts that there was much fear and insecurity among the transgender people during the pandemic time. Because of the loss of basic earnings, shortage of foods and unavailability of other basic essentials, with the sense of group solidarity, they managed to survive with meagre substances. However, lack of family support during the pandemic, exclusion from government benefits, restrictions in social mobility and the fear of COVID-19 virus infection led to increase their mental distress and made their life more miserable.","Barik, Rajesh, Pattayat, Shiba Shankar","https://doi.org/10.1177/2455328X221103664","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Contemporary Voice of Dalit;: 2455328X221103664, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33746,""
"â€˜You people have brought the virus hereâ€™: Othering experience of northeastern people amid COVID-19 in Delhi, India","Racial discrimination is a common phenomenon against the northeastern people of India on the mainland. They are prejudiced and othered mainly because of their very identity?mongoloid features?and by assuming their Chinese affiliations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has exacerbated discrimination, violence, and othering across the globe. The case of northeasterners living in the mainland of India is not different either. Racial discrimination and the othering experienced by northeasterners have not yet been studied extensively, especially in the context of the pandemic. Against this backdrop, the present paper examines the othering experiences of northeasterners living in Delhi by analysing nineteen qualitative interviews. We also have attempted to unveil their experiences of being othered before the pandemic. The participants were recruited based on inclusion criteria. The findings of the paper underline othering as the everyday experience of northeasterners living in Delhi. The worst forms of othering and discrimination amid the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in stigmatisation and bullying, insecurity and helplessness, and mental and emotional strains are evident in the participants' experiences. The instances of growing racism in India against northeasterners evidence the stereotypical attitude of the mainstream population towards them and urges legal measures to prevent it.","Abdul Azeez, E.

"Supporting ultra-poor children with cerebral palsy and their families with integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation: A cluster randomized controlled trial","Objective: This study aimed to test the effectiveness of an 'integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (CBR)' (IMCBR) program in improving quality of life and physical ability of children with cerebral palsy (CP), mental health of primary caregivers and social/economic capital of ultra-poor families of children with CP in rural Bangladesh. Design: Open-label pragmatic randomized controlled trial (registration: ACTRN12619001750178). Method: Children with CP aged =5 years were recruited in three arms: Arm-A: IMCBR, Arm-B: CBR, and Arm-C: control (i.e. care as usual). Each arm had eight clusters of 10-14 child-caregiver dyads. Caregivers recruited in the Arm-A received livelihood support (e.g., goat/lamb/poultry) and their children with CP received CBR once a week. The child-caregiver dyads in Arm-B received CBR only. The control Arm did not receive any intervention. However, CBR was stopped at 2.5 months of intervention due to COVID-19 pandemic and weekly phone follow-up was completed for home-based CBR. TNO-AZL Preschool children Quality of Life (TAPQoL), Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) were used to assess quality of life, motor function and communication of children, respectively. Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-Short Form-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess depression, anxiety and stress of primary caregivers. Results: Out of 251 children with CP and their caregivers recruited at baseline, 233 children and primary caregivers (Arm-A: n = 74, Arm-B: n = 77, and Arm-C: n = 82 dyads) completed the 12 month trial. The mean values of livelihood items given per family in Arm A increased from ~USD66 to ~USD79 between 0month(m) and 12m (p = 0.066), respectively. The mean TAPQoL score for physical functioning significantly increased between 0m and 12m in all three Arms (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.017 and p &lt; 0.001 in Arm A, Arm B and Arm C, respectively), however, the improvement in the score was highest in Arm A. Similarly, significant improvement in the GMFCS level was observed between 0m and 12m in all three Arms with the highest improvement in Arm A (p &lt; 0.001). Children's CFCS levels deteriorated slightly at 12m follow up in all three Arms. The depression, anxiety and stress levels among primary caregivers of children reduced significantly between the 0m and 12m in all three Arms (p = 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the IMCBR is effective in enhancing quality of life and motor functions of children with CP, mental health of primary caregivers and economic status of ultra-poor families.","Al Imam, M.; Jahan, I.; Das, M.; Power, R.; Khan, A.; Akbar, D.; Muhit, M.; Badawi, N.; Khandaker, G.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15161","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; 64(SUPPL 2):100-101, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33748,""
"Leveraging anthropological expertise to respond to the COVID-19 global mental health syndemic","This commentary asks anthropologists to work within communities to actively address the global mental health impact of COVID-19 and contribute to the pandemic response. Multiple social and physical losses, worsened by numerous factors, have produced syndemic traumatic stress and suffering across populations, highlighting persistent inequalities further amplified by the effects of COVID-19. Specifically, anthropologists can work to contribute to the development of mental health programs;confront the racialization of COVID-19 alongside marginalized communities;support real-time policy making with community responses;and innovate transparent collaborative research methods through open science. This pandemic can serve as an opportunity to prioritize research endeavors, public service, and teaching to better align with societal needs while providing new opportunities for synergy and collaborations between anthropologists in and outside the academy. Anthropologists collaborating directly with mental health clinicians and the public can contribute to knowledge specifically through direct program development and implementation of interventions designed to improve mental well-being. Innovating to find impactful solutions in response to the unprecedented mental health challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to promote more equitable recovery around the world.","Azevedo, Kathryn J.; Kalvesmaki, Andrea F.; Riendeau, Rachel P.; Sweet, Philip A.; Holmes, Seth M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/aman.13747","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Anthropologist; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33749,""
"Risk governance during the COVID-19 pandemric: A quantitative content analysis of governors' narratives on twitter","The current study addresses the communication aspect of risk governance during the COVID-19 pandemic by examining whether governors' tweets differ by political party, genderÂ and crisis phase. Drawing on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'sÂ Crisis Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model and framing literature, we examined the salience of five CERC's communication objectives, namely acknowledge crisis with empathy, promote protective actions, describe preparedness/response efforts, address rumours and misunderstandingÂ and segment audience. Using a deductive and inductive approach, we analysed 7000 Twitter messages sent by the 50 US state governors during the period of 13 March 2020 to 17 August 2020. Our findings suggest that governors' tweets aligned with CERC's communication objectives to a varying degree. We found main and interaction effects of political party, genderÂ and crisis phase on governors' communication objectives. New emergent communication objectives included attention to mental health, call for social influencersÂ and promoting hope.

"The efficacy of mHealth for stress and burnout in clinical settings and supervisions","Purpose Stress and burnout are continuous concerns in clinical settings. This has been exacerbated due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted health-care professionals globally. Supervision can support staff in clinical setting and help prevent stress and burnout. The purpose of this review is to consider the efficacy of mobile apps for reducing stress and burnout in clinical settings and supervisions. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature search was carried out using online databases such as Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, MEDLINE and SAGE. From the searches, nine studies were included in the review after meeting the inclusion criteria. Findings Of the nine studies, eight related to stress and/or burnout and one related to work engagement. There were no specific studies which related directly to the use of mobile health (mHealth) for clinical supervision. Research limitations/implications Through a focus on the efficacy of mHealth for stress and burnout in clinical settings and supervisions, the review highlights the efficacy of mHealth apps used in for stress and burnout in clinical settings and the importance of engagement of clinical staff. This will not only provide a higher quality of empirical evidence, but it will also lead to more positive outcomes for the mental health of clinical staff. Originality/value This review focussed upon the efficacy of mHealth for stress and burnout in clinical settings and supervisions.

"The impact of leadership on perceived work-related stress in healthcare facilities organisations","Purpose Employees in the private, public, and third sectors have experienced an increase in stress over the years. Amongst the sectors, people working in hospitals and other healthcare facilities were put under severe stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the World Health Organisation has clearly stated that defending people's mental health at this particular time of restless pandemic growth is an absolute necessity. The purpose of this article is to assess the perceived work-related stress (WRS) of healthcare workers (HCWs) as a result of the spread of COVID-19, as well as how a leadership role can help to reduce WRS. Design/methodology/approach Based on a multiple case study approach applied to two Italian health-care facilities, the questionnaire results were subjected to a regression analysis. Findings The results show an association in HCWs between the perception of supportive leadership and the perception of negative psychosocial risks whose exposure can lead to manifestation of WRS during COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value The study addresses the role that the perception of supportive leadership can play in reducing exposure to occupational psychosocial risks in a sample of healthcare professionals.","Greco, E.; Graziano, E.

"Factors associated with depression during lockdown in college students who sought psychological consultation","Purpose This paper aims to identify the risk factors that affect depression in students who sought psychological consultation during lockdown period in the health department at a university in Colombia. Design/methodology/approach The sample consisted of 33 students (12 men and 21 women) with a mean age of 21 +/- 2.5 years during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Convenience sampling was used. The beck depression inventory-II instrument and a sociodemographic questionnaire were used to determine levels of depression and associated risk factors. A Google Form was designed with the respective instruments and sent along with the informed consent by email. Findings The results indicated that the population is characterized by presenting a level of mild (24.2%), moderate (15.2%) and severe (21.2%) depression. Concerning the levels of depression and risk factors, a significant difference was found with a history of violence (p-value = 0.000), mainly during childhood and adolescence, as well as objection to psychological therapy, belonging to a medium-high socioeconomic stratum, lack of family support and recent significant losses coupled with the lockdown because of the pandemic, which increased symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted using Google Forms, which meant that some questionnaires were incomplete. In addition, this study did not count with the full participation of patients who attended psychological consultation. Practical implications Universities should generate programs for early detection of risk factors and prevention of depression in students, which could affect academic performance, school dropout, interpersonal relationships and trigger suicidal ideation. These results can also be applied to reducing family violence, which has increased since the pandemic, by improving students' family dynamics. Originality/value Because of the scarce research on this topic in Latin America, this study contributes to mental health in this population. The university becomes a fundamental scenario in which the ability to help students develop an adequate expression of emotions, positive coping strategies and sense of life as protective factors against depression can be enhanced.","Morales, J.

"Crisis and mental health of working women: risk factors and integrated care interventions based on organizational, individual, and institutional partnership","Purpose Crises can weigh heavily on individuals' mental health. COVID-19 is a crisis that has shaken humanity, plunging it into a great wave of fear, ambiguity and uncertainty, due to its novelty and rapid spread, as well as lethality. Mental health disparities between women and men have widened as a result of this pandemic. Stress factors have multiplied, especially among working women, making them more psychologically vulnerable than they were before this pandemic and easy prey to psychological distress. This emphasized the importance of having integrated care interventions that take into consideration the organizational context, with gendered lenses. This paper discusses the relationship between COVID-19 and psychological distress among women in the workforce. It presents the main sources of stress and addresses integrated care interventions that can help to prevent psychological distress among women. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a viewpoint and critique of the recent literature. Findings Interventions based on a partnership between employers, employees, and government, including health and social services are needed to prevent mental health problems among women in the workplace that can result from crises. In this case, a gendered approach as well as an optimization of the use of new technologies should be favored. Originality/value There is little focus on the development of integrated care approaches to address psychological distress among working women in times of crisis and beyond. This paper helps to expand the scope of integrated care to work-related mental health research by exploring the impact of an unprecedented health crisis on a vulnerable group that suffers from disparities in mental health. It also provides insights into preventive interventions, built upon an integrated care approach, based on a tripartite partnership between working women, employing organizations, and governmental institutions, facilitated by the integration of new technologies. By doing this, the author aims to contribute to the prevention of mental health issues that can result from this crisis.","Hamouche, S.","https://doi.org/10.1108/jica-02-2022-0014","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Integrated Care;: 9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33754,""
"Food literacy as a resilience factor in response to health-related uncertainty","Purpose During the Covid-19 pandemic, people were deprived of their freedom, unable to engage in physical and social activities, and worried about their health. Uncertainty, insecurity, and confinement are all factors that may induce stress, uneasiness, fear, and depression. In this context, this study aims to identify possible relationships of emotions caused by health risks and restrictions to outdoor activities with well-informed decisions about food consumption. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical framework of this research draws on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm yielding six research hypotheses. An online survey was designated to test these hypotheses. A total of 1,298 responses were gathered from Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. Data analyses include demographic group comparisons, moderation, and multiple regression tests. Findings The results showed that when people miss their usual activities (including freedom of movement, social contact, travelling, personal care services, leisure activities, and eating at restaurants) and worry about their health and the health of their families, they turn to safer food choices of higher quality, dedicating more of their time and resources to cooking and eating. Research limitations/implications The findings showcase how risk-based thinking is critical for management and marketing strategies. Academics and practitioners may rely on these findings to include extreme conditions within their scope, understanding food literacy as a resilience factor to cope with health risks and stimulated emotions. Originality/value This study identified food behavioural patterns under risk-laden conditions. A health risk acted as an opportunity to look at food consumption as a means of resilience.","Gianni, M.; Reitano, A.; Fazio, M.; Gkimperiti, A.; Karanasios, N.; Taylor, D.

"Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT): the impact of service changes due to COVID-19 on people with learning disabilities","Purpose Primary care psychological interventions for people with common mental health problems in England are primarily delivered through Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. People with learning disabilities within IAPT have poorer key clinical outcomes than people who do not identify as having a learning disability. During the global COVID-19 pandemic remote consultations have accounted for nearly 90% of all contacts in IAPT services;this paper aims to report the effects of these on outcomes for people with learning disabilities. Design/methodology/approach Publicly available national data from the COVID-affected period are compared to the most recent available comparison periods that are not during the COVID pandemic. Data are presented graphically. Findings People with learning disabilities differ little from those with no disabilities on several key process and outcome variables, although their clinical recovery is very much lower than those without disabilities. People with learning disabilities appear to have been affected by the changes in service delivery in a similar way to those without learning disabilities. Originality/value Despite the shift to predominantly remote therapy delivery, outcomes for people with learning disabilities have not been differentially affected compared to those who have no recorded disability. The potential to learn what has worked and not worked in the delivery of remote interventions for people with learning disabilities is highlighted.","Rodhouse, C.; Dagnan, D.; Thwaites, R.; Hatton, C.","https://doi.org/10.1108/amhid-01-2022-0002","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Advances in Mental Health and Intellectual Disabilities;: 12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33756,""
"COVID-19 AND SEX","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The novel Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) began by some estimates in December 2019 in Wuhan, China with rapid spread globally. The response to this global pandemic was an almost universal shut-down of most social activities outside of the home which in turn, has led to rise in depression, suicide and drug utilization. What about sexual activity which is strongly linked to these same societal norms? METHODS: All published writings on or about the sexual activity of diverse groups was searched for throughout the world during the COVID-19 pandemic specifically. There is a massive amount of media output on these aspects, but relatively little actual studies, though they are expected to lag behind the pandemic as it takes time to collect and process data from these studies. RESULTS: There are now well over a dozen peer reviewed articles upon the sexually-related effects of COVID-19 pandemic. The famed Kinsey Institute at the University of Indiana has begun a threewave longitudinal study called â€œSex and Relationships in the Time of COVID-19â€ and preliminarily they noted less sex, but more sexual diversity. PORNHUBÂ® gave free 'Premium Access' to Italians for the month of March 2020 and it proved so popular they expanded it to the entire world until the end of April 2020. They also publish their data on-line. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence that four sexuallyrelated aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic are having upon the population. These are partnered sex issues associated with more diversity, that is exploration of newer sexual practices. Increased solo-sexual aspects including the advent of technologically advanced practices including robotic sex, telephone sex (sexting) and on-line sex (setting records). There are sexual and reproductive issues such as anger and abuse to sexual partners as noted above and an anticipated rise in separations as well as divorce. And finally, there are fewer childbirths (just the opposite of what was hypothesized from isolation). Perhaps many of our well-established social norms could be blasted away by this pandemic- masturbation becoming accepted, methods of accessing electronic sex activities being promoted and the rise of advanced sexual technologies such as robotics replacing prostitution. But be cautious, preliminary results from The Kinsey Institute suggests this may be the result of â€œmarket hypeâ€ behind the boom in SexTech. Don't switch to oatmeal (or cornflakes) just yet.","Seymour, Z.; Moran, M.","https://doi.org/10.1097/JU.0000000000002540.01","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Urology; 207(SUPPL 5):e206, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33757,""
"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in neuro-oncology: A pilot study of feasibility and utility in telehealth and in-person clinical assessments","Background Cognitive impairments are a common burden for patients with primary CNS tumors. Neuropsychological assessment batteries can be too lengthy, which limits their use as an objective measure of cognition during routine care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and utility of the brief Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in routine in-person and telehealth visits (as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic) with neuro-oncology patients. Methods Seventy-one adults with primary CNS tumors completed MoCA testing in person (n = 47) and via telehealth (n = 24). Correlation analysis and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including symptom burden and interference, perceived cognition, general health status, and anxiety and depression, were included in this study. Feasibility was assessed through a provider satisfaction questionnaire. Results Patients were primarily White (83%), college-educated (71%) males (54%) with high-grade tumors (66%). The average total score on the MoCA administered in person was 25 (range: 6-30), with 34% classified as abnormal, and the average total score via telehealth was 26 (range: 12-30), with 29% classified as abnormal. Providers reported satisfaction in using the MoCA during routine clinical care, both in person and via telehealth. Lower MoCA scores correlated with worse symptom severity, KPS, age, education, and previous treatment. Conclusions The MoCA was feasible in clinical and telehealth settings, and its relationship to clinical characteristics and PROs highlights the need for both objective and patient-reported measures of cognition to understand the overall cognitive profile of a patient with a CNS tumor.","Jammula, V.; Rogers, J.

"Influence of landscape outside the window on the anxiety level of self-separation people during COVID-19","Windows are the communication medium between indoor and outdoor, but their influence and the corresponding landscape outside the window are often ignored due to the outdoor frequent activities of people. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a better choice to show the window performance, especially for the anxiety level alleviation of people isolated at home. A national survey was conducted on the anxiety of self-separation people and the window influence. The results showed that the average anxiety level was 1.54, between a little anxious and anxious, due to the COVID-19. The best satisfaction with the landscape outside the window was waterscape (2.98), followed by green plants (2.33) and buildings (0.83). During the COVID-19, the average number of overlook times increased by 1.49 times/day, which is higher 0.42 ties/day than the normal condition. The landscape types had the certain influence on the overlook frequency, the window opening times and even the anxiety level. The average anxiety levels are 1.36 and 1.68 with natural landscapes and human landscapes, respectively. Optimizing the landscapes outside the window plays an important role in alleviating the anxiety of residents and improving their mental health.","Liu, C.; Li, Z. R.; Jing, X. T.; Gao, W.

"Conformity to Masculine Norms and Men's Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic","Public Significance Statement The study examined men's conformity to specific masculinity norms to predict their adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for combatting COVID-19 and their attitudes toward mask wearing. The findings can aid in public health efforts to improve men's participation in combatting the pandemic and future public health crises. The study examined men's conformity to masculine norms as related to adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 as well as men's attitudes toward mask wearing. Five hundred eighty nine participant men, predominantly White and heterosexual, completed the 10-15 min anonymous online survey through Prolific. After controlling for demographics, results indicated that the masculine norms of emotional control and power over women were related to less adherence to CDC recommendations;and that self-reliance, power over women, and heterosexual self-presentation were related to more negative attitudes toward mask wearing. Limitations and future research such as improving men's participation in combatting COVID-19, and other public health crises, by addressing men's specific salient masculine norms when developing and implementing public health outreach and prevention are discussed.","Mahalik, J.

Esta investigaciÃ³n surge por la necesidad de explorar cuÃ¡l ha sido la situaciÃ³n vivida durante la pandemia y profundizar en las experiencias tal y como son narradas por los profesionales que trabajan en las residencias para personas mayores. El objetivo del Estudio RESICOVID ha sido analizar los efectos en los profesionales de las medidas que se tomaron en las residencias frente a la pandemia por COVID-19. Material y mÃ©todos. Se realizaron entrevistas a 31 profesionales del cuidado (media edad: 34,31 aÃ±os, DS: 9,56;83,8% mujeres). El 71% de los participantes tuvieron diagnÃ³stico de COVID-19. El anÃ¡lisis fue realizado con el programa Atlas-ti v8. Resultados: Del anÃ¡lisis de las entrevistas se extrajeron 128 citas que fueron codificadas en las siguientes dimensiones: 1. Vivencia del confinamiento;2. PercepciÃ³n de cambios;3. Problemas de salud;4. Cambios en el Ã¡rea cognitiva y funcional;5. Soledad. Conclusiones: La sobrecarga, la falta de recursos y la incertidumbre causada por la pandemia por COVID-19 ha generado sentimientos de miedo, desgaste, ansiedad, frustraciÃ³n y tristeza en los profesionales que continÃºan a dÃ­a de hoy sin recursos suficientes para encarar la situaciÃ³n.

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major changes in the day-to-day operations of residential care facilities. Little is known about the impact it has had on professionals working in nursing homes in Spain. This research arose from the need to explore the situation experienced during the pandemic and to delve into the experiences as narrated by professionals working in nursing homes. The aim of the RESICOVID study was to analyze the effects on professionals of the measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing homes. Material and Method. 31 professionals (mean age: 32.9 years;83.8% women, in various areas of care) were interviewed. Seventy-one percent of the sample presented a diagnosis of COVID-19. The analysis was performed with the Atlas-ti v8 program. Results: From the analysis of the interviews, 128 quotations were extracted, coded in the following dimensions: 1. Experience of confinement;2. Perception of changes;3. Health problems;4. Cognitive and functional changes;5. Loneliness. Conclusions: Burnout, overload, lack of resources and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have generated feelings of fear, exhaustion, anxiety, frustration and sadness in professionals who continue to this day without sufficient resources to face the situation. The design of contingency plans for future health crises should take into account this impact on care professionals.","Pinazo-Hernandis, S.; GalvaÃ±, A.; Dosil, C.; Pinazo-ClapÃ©s, C.; Nieto-Vieites, A.; Facal, D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2022.06.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista EspaÃ±ola de GeriatrÃ­a y GerontologÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33763,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in USA: Two years later","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has posed an unprecedented public health challenge for most countries, and the repeated outbreaks of this disease have created a largest disruption of education systems. The intent of this work was to examine the intersection of COVID-19 fear and mental health consequences among college students in Northern Michigan, a region of the U.S. severely affected by the pandemic. This study was conducted from January 17 to February 25, 2022, two years later since the outbreak of the pandemic, and 151 college students (female, 76) were involved. Participants' potential psychological symptoms, anxiety, happiness, learning difficulty, and demographic information were surveyed. We have three main findings. First, 60.3% of students had tested positive for COVID-19, and more female than male students were affected (female, 69.7%;male, 50.7%). Second, there was a high prevalence of mental problems among college students, with 95.7% of the sample experiencing moderate or severe mood disorders. Third, respondents' education was severely affected by the pandemic, averaging a score of 7.6 on a scale of 10 when asked how much their learning quality was affected. They showed increased fear, stress, and decreased happiness, and these were associated with their learning quality change. Given the impact would be far-reaching, not only college studentsâ€™ mental health but also their learning difficulties should be monitored during epidemics. These findings are alarming and timely, and their implications are discussed.","Hu, K.; Godfrey, K.; Li, Q.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114685","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114685, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33764,""
"GÃ©rer le risquÃ© en contexte de prÃ©caritÃ©: l'exemple de la COVID-19","RÃ©sumÃ© Lâ€™article vise Ã  analyser le rapport au risque des personnes en situation de prÃ©caritÃ© dans le cadre de lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie de COVID-19, sous le prisme de lâ€™incertitude. Les rÃ©sultats sont issus de lâ€™analyse de confÃ©rences tÃ©lÃ©phoniques hebdomadaires dâ€™avril 2020 Ã  juillet 2020 et dâ€™entretiens individuels (15) de personnes en situation de prÃ©caritÃ©, militants dâ€™ATD Quart-Monde. Les attitudes face au risque sont avant tout plurielles, Ã  rapporter Ã  la diversitÃ© des dimensions de la prÃ©caritÃ© et des reprÃ©sentations du risque mais aussi Ã  dâ€™autres dÃ©terminants qui orientent les conduites. Les reprÃ©sentations du risque sont, Ã  cette pÃ©riode, relativement indÃ©terminÃ©es mais marquÃ©es par la peur, liÃ©e en partie Ã  la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© du groupe face Ã  la maladie (comorbiditÃ©s). Les personnes organisent leur maniÃ¨re de penser le monde en pÃ©riode de pandÃ©mie autour de reprÃ©sentations dâ€™espaces protÃ©gÃ©s et non protÃ©gÃ©s, espaces symboliques (le foyer) ou sociaux. Cela permet de rÃ©duire lâ€™incertitude, le sentiment dâ€™impuissance et de pouvoir continuer Ã  vivre au quotidien. De mÃªme, des discours fatalistes occupent cette fonction face Ã  lâ€™incertitude et au manque de maitrise qui marquent leurs existences prÃ©caires. Les donnÃ©es recueillies, saisies dans lâ€™immÃ©diatetÃ© de lâ€™expÃ©rience et analysÃ©es dans un cadre thÃ©orique socio-anthropologique permettent dâ€™Ã©clairer la maniÃ¨re dont ces personnes sâ€™approprient les mesures prÃ©conisÃ©es par les instances de santÃ© publique. This article will analyze the risk of individuals living in precarious conditions, under the perspective of uncertainty. Results came from the analysis of weekly phone conferences and individual interviews (15) during the period from April to July 2020. Attitudes toward risk are above all plural, and can be related to the diversity of dimensions of precariousness and risk representation, but also to others determinants that shape behaviour. Risk representations in those times are uncertain yet steeped by fear, partially because of this group vulnerability to the disease (comorbidity). People organize their way of seeing the world in time of pandemic through the perception of protected and unprotected spaces, symbolic (the home) or social spaces. It allows them to reduce the uncertainty and the feeling of powerlessness, and also to continue to overcome the day to day life. Equally, fatalistic discourses hold this function against the uncertainty and lack of control that constitute their lifeâ€™s. The data, captured in the immediacy of experience and analyzed within sociological and anthropological frameworks, informs the way those people appropriate the measures recommended by public health authorities.","Caroline, DesprÃ¨s, Boissonnat-Pelsy, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medpal.2022.06.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: MÃ©decine Palliative;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33765,""
"Health information seeking behaviour during exceptional times: A case study of Persian-speaking minorities in Finland","Literature on minorities' health-related information seeking shows that minorities, like non-minorities, require access to accurate and timely information, but they also need information in a range of languages and from a variety of sources. Health-related information seeking behaviour of Persian-speaking minorities living in Finland, explicitly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic situation, was investigated. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the extended Longo Health Information Model was used as a theoretical lens for analysing the data. The results point to several factors that can improve the outcome of minorities' health-related information seeking behaviours and activities, such as providing information related to their personal health, a deeper understanding of factors influencing the quality of health conditions at the individual or household level and broadcasting the latest health-related information in different languages and emphasize the needs for mental health-related information and services. The findings suggest that not only healthcare providers, immigration officials, and policymakers should be aware of the specific health-related information that minorities require, seek, and use during times of adversity, but also the extent to which how the identified factors influence the process of minorities' seeking health-related information.","Ahmadinia, H.; Eriksson-Backa, K.; Nikou, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2022.101156","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Library & Information Science Research; 44(2):11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33766,""
"Outcomes of Acute Limb Ischemia in COVID-19","Introduction/Objective: The inflammatory cascade caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may result in arterial thrombosis and acute limb ischemia (ALI) with devastating consequences. The aims of this study were to compare outcomes of ALI in the lower extremities in patients with and without COVID-19, and to determine if ALI development in the context of COVID-19 portends a worse prognosis compared to COVID-19 without ALI. Methods Queries were built on TriNetX, a federated network of healthcare organizations (HCOs) across the United States that provides de-identified patient data. ICD-10 diagnostic codes were used to identify patients with acute limb ischemia of the lower extremities and COVID-19. The study timeframe was defined as January 20, 2020-May 20, 2021. Statistical analyses, including propensity score matching, were done through TriNetXâ€™s internal software. Outcomes looked at are rates of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, major adverse limb events, re-intervention, respiratory failure, sepsis, mental health complications, and acute renal failure. Baseline cohort characteristics were also collected. Results ALI patients with COVID-19 (ALI C19+;n=526) were significantly less likely than ALI patients without COVID-19 (ALI;n=14131) to have baseline comorbidities, including nicotine dependence (18% vs 33%;p&lt;0.0001). In contrast, ALI C19+ patients had significantly more comorbidities than hospitalized COVID-19 patients without ALI (n=275903), including nicotine dependence (18% vs 10%;p&lt;0.0001). After propensity matching was performed, ALI C19+ patients had significantly higher rates of mortality (24.9% vs 9.2%;p&lt;0.0001), major adverse limb events (5.8% vs 2.9%;p=0.0223), and acute renal failure (22.2% vs 14.9%%;p=0.0025) than ALI patients. Compared to hospitalized COVID-19 patients without ALI, ALI C19+ patients had higher propensity-matched rates of respiratory failure and being placed on assisted ventilation (32.9% vs 27%;p=0.0369), sepsis (16.9% vs 12.2%;p=0.0288), acute renal failure (22.1% vs 14.6%;p=0.0019), and mortality (24.7% vs 14.4%;p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions Patients who developed ALI following COVID-19 present with significantly different demographics and comorbidities from those who develop ALI without COVID-19. After controlling for these variables, higher rates of major adverse limb events, acute renal failure, and mortality in ALI patients with COVID-19 suggest that not only may COVID-19 precipitate ALI, but it may also exacerbate ALI sequelae. Furthermore, development of ALI in COVID-19 portends worse prognosis compared to COVID-19 patients without ALI.","Pham, Antoine, Heib, Adele, Goodman, Emily, Lipsitz, Evan, Indes, Jeffrey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2022.04.038","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Vascular Surgery;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33767,""

"Change in physical activity behavior due to the first two coronavirus waves in spring and winter 2020 Difference between sport enthusiasts and non-sport enthusiasts","Background As physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases worldwide, it is of particular interest how the coronavirus pandemic affects physical activity behavior. Objectives This study examines coronavirus-related changes in physical activity among German adults and associations of activity change with mental health. Emphasis will be placed on differences between sports enthusiasts and non-sports enthusiasts. Methods As part of a quantitative cross-sectional study, data on the activity levels of 329 German adults were collected before and during the first two coronavirus waves using an online questionnaire. Results On average, the coronavirus pandemic led to a significant decrease in the physical activity level by 56.81 min/week. However, this trend was only seen in sports enthusiasts, whereas the non-sports enthusiast group increased their activity level by approximately 100 min/week. Furthermore, reduced physical activity levels were significantly positively correlated with poorer mental health. Conclusions The coronavirus-related decline in physical activity combined with poorer mental health is of concern because of potential long-term public health consequences. However, the increased activity level in the non-sports enthusiast group represents a promising development and should be considered in relation to future health promotion interventions.","Muller, M.; Tittlbach, S.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11553-022-00953-1","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pravention Und Gesundheitsforderung;: 6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33769,""
"The role of classroom engagement on academic grit, intolerance to uncertainty and well-being among school students during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India","The forced changes and disruptions in educational systems and learning experiences due to the pandemic has impacted students' mental health and well-being. The present study aims to understand the effects of the determinants of well-being on students in India during the second wave (April to August 2021) of the COVID-19 pandemic. The determinants of well-being in this study areÂ academic grit, intolerance to uncertainty and students' engagement in an online learning environment. In this study, well-being is characterized as students' confidence and satisfaction in an online learning and pandemic environment. The data collected from 1174 students (12?19 years) from various states, using standardized tools, were analyzed to find out about the mediating effect of students' engagement on the relationship between academic grit and well-being, and between intolerance to uncertainty and well-being. Further, the model fit analysis of the determinants of well-being is explored.Â The paper reports that students' classroom engagement does mediate in the path of academic grit and well-being, and in the path of intolerance to uncertainty and well-being. It also evidence the model fit of the influence of the determinants of well-being on that of school students during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also draws implications and suggestions for educators using the current model of students' well-being.","Kareem, Jacqueline, Thomas, Shinto, Kumar P, Aneesh, Neelakantan, Meera","https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22758","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology in the Schools; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33770,""
"Maternal depressive symptoms and early childhood temperament before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unexpected and major global event, with the potential to have many and varied impacts on child development. However, the implications of the pandemic for maternal depressive symptoms, early childhood temperament dimensions, and their associations, remain largely unknown. To investigate this, questionnaires were completed by mothers (NÂ =Â 175) before and during the pandemic when their child was 10- and 16-months old (Study 1), and by an extended group of mothers with young children (6?48?months;66 additional mothers) during the first and second national lockdowns in the United Kingdom in 2020 (Study 2). Results indicated that while maternal pandemic-related stress decreased over the first 6 months of the pandemic, there was an increase in mothers who reported feeling some level of pandemic-specific depression. Despite this, we did not observe an increase in the severity of global maternal depressive symptoms, or any negative impact of the pandemic on the development of temperament in infancy and early childhood.","Fiske, Abigail, Scerif, Gaia, Holmboe, Karla","https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.2354","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Infant and Child Development; n/a(n/a):e2354, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33771,""
"Use interactive process to determine if accommodations for long COVID create fundamental alterations","Although the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be over, its impact on higher education administrators will continue through the effects of long COVID-19 and through continued fear of illness. Recent guidance from the Office for Civil Rights and the Department of Justice (bit.ly/3IPSbYh) notes that long COVID, an occasional consequence of even mild COVID infections, can be a disability if it substantially limits a major life activity, and therefore can be expected to trigger requests for academic adjustments and reasonable accommodations. The guidance notes that common symptoms associated with long COVID include, but are not limited to, fatigue;difficulty thinking or concentrating, sometimes referred to as brain fog;depression;anxiety;and heart palpitations, all of which may directly interfere with the ability to think and learn.","Masinter, Michael R.","https://doi.org/10.1002/cala.40838","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Campus Legal Advisor; 22(11):6-6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33772,""
"Quality of life of teachers from Chile and Colombia during the Covid-19 pandemic","It is important to consider the educational process and the status of the teaching staff in order to create a suitable environment in the classroom. Although there are numerous evidences on quality of life in university teachers, there are few studies that investigate the teacher at the basic and intermediate level. The study is of a quantitative, non-experimental and cross-sectional approach with a descriptive-comparative design. The sample was selected under a non-probabilistic criterion, including 117 teachers (66 from Chile and 51 from Colombia) from public and private institutions. In both countries, Emotional Role was the most affected dimension, followed by Vitality and Physical Role, while the dimension with the best score was Physical Function. When comparing both countries, Colombia showed better scores in 6 of the 8 dimensions, with Chile only obtaining a better score in Physical Role and General Health, but these differences were not statistically significant. In both genders, only in Mental Health statistically significant differences were obtained. The results suggest that in terms of quality of life, the confinement experienced during the pandemic together with the rapid adaptations teachers had to make in digital skills during the school closures would have had an impact on the emotional well-being of teachers and especially on the mental health of female teachers.","Zambrano, V.

"Prevalence of depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Medical students frequently have depressive symptoms. Thus, the psychological impact of COVID-19 on them should be high. Aim: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of depression in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of depression in medical students, published from December 1, 2019 to December 27, 2020. Results: Eleven studies were included, most of them from Asia. The estimated overall prevalence of depression in medical students was 31% (95% CI: 23%-40%), with lower prevalence rates reported in studies from Asia in general, and China in particular. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the proportion of medical students with depression during the pandemic was high, and comparable with that reported in other university students.","Santabarbara, J.; Olaya, B.; Bueno-Notivol, J.; Perez-Moreno, M.; Gracia-Garcia, P.; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, N.; Idoiaga-Mondragon, N.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+of+depression+among+medical+students+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic.+A+systematic+review+and+meta-analysis","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Medica De Chile; 149(11):1579-1588, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-05","",33774,""
"SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS AMONG RECOVERED PATIENTS OF COVID-19: AN CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATION STUDY VIA TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION","As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception following the PRISMA guidelines. Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, and stress are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic . Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group, presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance.
