"Post-Acute Sequelae of Sars-Cov-2 Infection in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients","Purpose: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon manifested by long lasting cognitive, mental, and physical symptoms. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of PASC symptoms in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) in the short (1- 6 months) and long-term (&gt; 6 months) periods after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also compared the prevalence of these symptoms between those with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization and those not requiring hospitalization. Method(s): We surveyed 111 SOTRs with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed more than 4 weeks prior to survey administration. The survey consisted of 7 validated questionnaires (""Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS)"", ""Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9)"", ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)"", ""Impact of Events Scale (IES-6)"", ""EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)"", ""PROMIS global physical health scale (GHS) ""and ""Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS)""). Result(s): Of the 111 survey participants, 32 (33%) had been hospitalized and 35 (36%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection &gt;6 months ago. Median (IQR) age was 58 years (46, 65). Median time from SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 167 days (138, 221). Cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, insomnia, feeling of trauma, fatigue, pain, breathing problems, cough, abnormal smell, abnormal taste, and diarrhea were reported by 40%, 23%, 36%, 55%, 53%, 41%, 19%, 33%, 33%, 21%, 22%, and 32% of patients respectively. Hospitalized patients had poorer scores in cognition (QDRS survey score of 2 versus 0.75, p=0.048) (Figure 1), quality of life (EQ-5D survey score of 2 versus 1, p=0.043), physical health (PROMIS GHS survey score of 10 versus 11, p=0.013), respiratory status (BCSS survey score of 1 versus 0, p=0.056), and pain (Pain score of 3 versus 0, p 0.006). Among patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infection &gt;6 months ago, abnormal breathing, cough, abnormal smell, abnormal taste, and diarrhea continued to be reported by 31%, 31%, 29%, 32%, and 32% of patients respectively. Conclusion(s): After SARS-CoV-2 infection, SOTRs had a high prevalence of PASC symptoms. Some of the symptoms are more severe in patients who had required hospitalization and persist beyond 6 months. Further studies are needed to understand the long term sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SOTRs and to develop an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach for caring for these patients beyond the acute phase.

"Hospital-based ambulatory clinic adoption of video and telephone visits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a convergent mixed-methods study: Managing Community Care","Purpose&gt;The purpose of this study is to understand virtual care use (e.g. telephone and video visits) during the COVID-19 pandemic across three hospital-based ambulatory clinics (i.e. mental health, renal and respiratory care) and to describe associated patient and provider experiences.Design/methodology/approach&gt;A mixed-methods convergent study was conducted including quantitative electronic medical records data on virtual care use, electronic surveys assessing domainsÂ of experience (e.g. satisfaction, acceptance and technology use) among patient and providers and semi-structured interviews exploring the associated barriers and facilitators of virtual care adoption.Findings&gt;Virtual care adoption rates and relative modality use (telephone vs video) varied across specialty clinics. Mental health clinics) showed the greatest use of virtual care and greater use of video over telephone, as compared to renal and respiratory care, where telephone was used almost exclusively. Patients and providers reported an overall good satisfaction and acceptance of virtual care (60â€“72%) across clinics, but commonly observed barriers (technical problems, behavioral adaptations needed and inequity) persisted. Good value propositions, tech support and the presence of early adopters who can support others in workflow re-design and highlight value propositions of virtual care were listed as adoption facilitators.Originality/value&gt;The study provides a unique opportunity to compare the rate of virtual care adoption before and during the COVID-19 pandemic across distinct specialties that operate within the same organizational and political setting. This study showed that the nature of the condition (e.g. mental health conditions) and the characteristics of the users (e.g. younger patients) may drive models of care with higher rate of video use. Focusing on removing common barriers, like providing tech support and ensuring equitable access to patients, continues to be important even in the context of high virtual care adoption rates during the pandemic.","Vess, Stamenova, Budhwani, Suman, Soobiah, Charlene, Fujioka, Jamie, Khan, Rumaisa, Liu, Rebecca, Halperin, Ilana, Bhatia, R.

"An assessment of tendencies toward teleworking using TAMs: lessons from Covid-19 era for post-pandemic days","Purpose: During the Covid-19 period, when human beings are socially isolated, telework is a viable solution to safeguard employees' health. Because many employees have never experienced such a working system and organizations have not planned for it before the pandemic, imposing employees to telework has adversely affected their productivity and efficiency. This study aims to identify factors affecting individuals' tendency toward teleworking during the pandemic, which can lead to practical solutions for the post-pandemic era. Design/methodology/approach: Through the use of technology acceptance models, a conceptual model was designed. Data used to assess the model were cross-sectional and derived from 229 questionnaires filled out by employees in Tehran. The AMOS24 software processed the corresponding structural equation model. Findings: The results from the cross-sectional data indicated that attitude toward telework and perceived behavioral control over the system were significantly correlated directly with the intention to telework, while perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of telework were correlated indirectly. Therefore, the integrated model predicts behavioral intentions better than single models performed separately. Originality/value: Psychological and mental health research describing adoption intentions of telework, particularly those focusing on employees, is still lacking. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in this regard that has used a conceptual model derived from two technology acceptance models during the Covid-19 outbreak. An era in which the extent of the pandemic has forced employees to experience such working systems and thus the importance and practicality of teleworking have been more evident to nearly every individual.","Nosratzadeh, H.; Edrisi, A.","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJWHM-10-2021-0198","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Workplace Health Management;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39876,""
"Leaderâ€“member exchange, workâ€“family enrichment and their effects on mental health: theÂ moderating role of remoteÂ e-work","Purpose&gt;This paper aims to examine the effect of leaderâ€“member exchange (LMX) and workâ€“family enrichment (WFE) on anxiety and depression, social functioning and loss of confidence as three dimensions of mental health. Furthermore, the paper aims to investigate telework and information and communication technology-based mobile work (TICTM) as a moderator of the effects of LMX and WFE on mental health.Design/methodology/approach&gt;Data were collected from 214 Bangladeshi employees in the public and private sectors via an online survey. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and multi-group analysis were performed to gauge the abovementioned linkages.Findings&gt;The findings reveal that LMX fosters employees' social functioning while it mitigates their losing confidence. The findings further indicate that WFE enhances social functioning while alleviating anxiety and depression. However, TICTM did not act as a moderator of the effects of LMX and WFE on three dimensions of mental health.Originality/value&gt;Despite a plethora of empirical studies on LMX and WFE, no empirical studies have examined the effect on employee mental health as well as TICTM as a moderator in these linkages in the extant service literature so far.

"Influence Of Cardiac And Pulmonary Rehabilitation On Psychosocial Scores In Individuals Affected By Covid-19","Introduction: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) are multidisciplinary supervised programs that aim to return individuals to normal physical and psychosocial functioning. CR and PR take a comprehensive approach with a goal of individualizing the exercise, education, and behavioral modification. Research has shown Individuals with cardiac and pulmonary diseases are predisposed to several psychosocial disorders. However, there has been limited research on the psychosocial impact of individuals with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease AND post-COVID-19 infection referred to CR or PR. Purpose(s): This study investigates the impact CR and PR have on psychosocial scores in individuals post-COVID-19 infection who were referred to PR or CR following COVID-19 and with non-COVID qualifying diagnoses. Design(s): Retrospective chart review of 48 individuals with eligible diagnoses for CR (N = 25) or PR (N = 23) and with a history of COVID 19 enrolled at The Miriam Hospital's programs from 2021-2022. Method(s): CR and PR includes one hour of exercise and thirty minutes of education 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Education topics include nutrition, stress and psychosocial management, and strategies to improve cardiovascular or pulmonary risk factors. Also included in PR are oxygen supplementation, breathing techniques and energy conservation to improve activities of daily living. Patients were referred to individual appointment on-site with the clinical psychologist if they had abnormal anxiety, stress, or depression scores at entry. Patients were evaluated to determine if one or both programs demonstrated improved psychosocial outcomes after completing the program. Entry and discharge psychosocial scores for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ9) and perceived stress (PSS) were compared using a paired t-test for parametric data and Wilcoxon matched pairs (Wilcoxon signed rank) for non-parametric data within groups of patients enrolled in PR and CR respectively. Result(s): A total of 48 individuals after COVID-19 diagnosis met study criteria. The median age was 63yo in PR similar to 66yo in CR. There were 39% women, and 8.3% non-white. There were no significant differences in anxiety, depression, or perceived stress at rehab entry between groups (p = .54-.93). 24% of CR patients and 26% PR patients met with the psychologist. At completion of PR, there was no significant difference in anxiety, depression, or perceived stress scores (all p values &gt; .112). Conversely, significant improvement in psychosocial scores were found in the CR group (p value &lt; = 0.037 or less). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial scores significantly improved after CR but not after PR for patients after COVID-19 infection with CR and PR qualifying diagnoses. There may be a need for more intensive intervention for psychosocial factors in PR for COVID-19 patients with future research on the impact warranted. This research was limited by small sample sizes as well as lack of control of the timing of the COVID-19 infection prior to enrollment.","Antoine, R.; Baig, M.; DeAngelis, J.; Pierce, J.; Wu, W.

"Maintenance of Health Benefits After an Exercise Intervention in Individuals With Prediabetes and Diabetes: Six-Month Follow-Up","Background: The Diabetes College Brazil Study (NCT03914924) is a pioneer randomized clinical trial designed to promote behavioral changes in adults living with prediabetes and diabetes. Method(s): A single-center randomized pilot study involving a 12-week exercise intervention aiming the participants accumulate at least 150 min of aerobic exercise and two sessions of resistance exercise per week with a 6-month follow-up after the intervention. The follow-up objective was to support the participants in maintaining the health benefits arising from the intervention through monthly structured phone calls. Physical activity (PA) level (seven days using a pedometer), exercise self-efficacy (Bandura's Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale), and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) were assessed at pre, post-intervention (PI), and post-follow-up (PF). Variables measured in the PI and PF were compared by unpaired t-test. The aerobic exercise time in minutes/week was collected during monthly phone calls and compared by ANOVA. The weekly frequency of resistance exercise sessions was also collected and analyzed by absolute frequencies. The association between the interest variables was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test. Result(s): Of 21 participants who were assessed at PF, 12 answered all phone calls along with follow-up (75% male, 57.4 +/- 10.7 years, 8.3% prediabetes, 41.6% Type 1 diabetes, and 50% Type 2 diabetes) and were included in this study. There was no significant difference between the values obtained in the PI and PF for PA level (41947+/-28868 vs. 49915+/-33054 total steps/week, 5992+/-4124 vs. 7131+/-4722 average steps/day;P=0.09), exercise self-efficacy (65.6+/-13.1 vs. 71.8+/-22.3;P=0.31), physical health (82.7+/-22,84.1 vs. 81.4+/-20.5;P=0.64) and mental health (65.9+/-40.7 vs. 70,5+/-38,4;P=0.70) components of quality of life, revealing maintenance of the exercise intervention benefits after six months. Most participants aerobically exercised above 150 min/week in moderate-intensity during the follow-up, with no change in average exercise time over the six months (225.0+/-154.8, 197.0+/-133.9, 235.0+/-143.9, 142.0+/-102.6, 174.0+/-177.5 minutes/week;P=0.12). The proportion of participants who maintained resistance exercise were 41%, 58%, 66%, 50%, and 50%, and the average weekly frequency was more than three times a week during the follow-up. The average minutes of aerobic exercise/week during the follow-up was moderately correlated with total steps/week (r=0.59, P=0.06) and with mental (r=0.49, P=0.12) and physical (r=0.49, P=0.12) health components of quality of life, and strongly correlated with exercise self-efficacy (r=0.63, P=0.04). Conclusion(s): Participants maintained the health benefits of the intervention at the six-month follow-up, despite the social restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Batalha, A. P. D.

"Safety and feasibility of distraction procedure in growing rods for Early Onset Scoliosis as day care procedure - A retrospective observational study of 653 procedures","Purpose: To investigate the safety and feasibility of growth rod distraction procedure as 'daycare surgery' in early-onset scoliosis (EOS). EOS is an 'enigma' in spine surgery as early fusion and deformity correction will negatively affect truncal growth and pulmonary development. Likewise, delaying the treatment would lead to grotesque deformity with severe systemic implications. Therefore, worldwide we use 'Growth rods' for EOS and periodically distract it to allow for spinal growth in a 'controlled' manner. However, regular distraction every 6 months until definitive fusion would incur huge financial challenges and resource utilization . Our hypothesis is that the growth rod distraction procedure can be routinely used as a daycare procedure, thereby, cutting down the cost and resource utilization, especially in these pandemic times. Method(s): Hospital records and operation notes were retrospectively reviewed of 119 patients with a focus on details of neurological events/ complications during their index surgeries/lengthening procedures. Multimodality IONM was used as a mandatory protocol in all our index cases . However, for growth rod lengthening procedures we had well-defined indications-i) patients in whom intraoperative drop in signals were present during index case ii)patients who had intraspinal abnormality and had synchronous neurosurgical procedure iii) patients who underwent rod exchange/revision surgery concurrent with lengthening procedure. Except for these indications, none of our patients had IONM during the routine lengthening procedure.An amplitude drop of greater than 50% in trans cranial MEP or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) was considered a neuromonitoring 'alert'. Result(s): 653 procedures involving primary growing rod surgeries (119 / 653) and lengthening procedures (534/653) were performed in 119 patients with EOS with a mean age of 7.3+/-2.3 years. Traditional growing rods (TGR-454/534) or magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR-80/534) were implanted and subsequent lengthening procedures (Average -4.7 (range 2-9)) were done at stipulated intervals (TGR- 6.5 months, MCGR -3.8 mo). The mean anesthesia to surgical time for TGR (96.6+/-23 min vs 41.3 +/- 12 min) and MCGR was done as an outpatient procedure with mean average time of 26.2+/-9 minutes, respectively. The mean average blood loss in TGR vs MCGR was reported as 108+/-38 mL vs 0 mL.None of the patients with rod lengthening procedures required blood transfusion or experienced a neuromonitoring alert. On the morning of surgery these patients were admitted on short admission to Operating theatres and were not administered any pre-medication drugs. Induction was done using propofol (calm patients) or sevoflurane (restless patients) and BIS monitoring was done throughout the procedure. Intraoperative pain management was done using a fentanyl bolus. Furthermore, In the immediate post-operative period these patients were managed on fentanyl single bolus dose (0.5 microgram/kg) and later administered paracetamol injection (15 mg/kg - &lt;30 kg) or ketorolac injection (0.1 mg/kg). At discharge, patients were managed on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory oral medications. Average reporting pain control (VAS-1.3+/-0.78) was satisfactory and mobilization was initiated within 4 hours, postoperatively. All our patients were discharged on the same evening with oral analgesics. Our 30-day readmission was noted in 2/119 secondary to superficial wound infection, which was managed on oral antibiotics. Conclusion(s): Growth rods (TGR, MCGR ) lengthening procedures can be safely undertaken as 'daycare surgery' under standardized anaesthesia and pain protocol. Secondly, intraoperative neuromonitoring can also be avoided in distraction procedures, thereby, helping in cost-cutting. This is especially relevant in changing paradigms of resource limitation in the COVID pandemic situation worldwide.","Mb, S.; Khanna, P.; Garg, B.","https://doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0000000000000863","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology; 34(4):499, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39880,""
"A new clinical challenge: supporting patients coping with the long-term effects of COVID-19","Mental Health Practitioners (MHPs) have a unique opportunity to provide resources and support to those suffering from Long COVID (LC), the post infectious illness that often follows an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. In working with these individuals, MHPs can learn from the experiences of patients with another post-infectious disease known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS was once thought to be a psychologically mediated disorder caused by deconditioning and the fear of exertion following a precipitating event such as a viral infection. Research now shows that LC and ME/CFS are biomedical, multisystem, complex physiologic diseases. This article provides a framework to MHPs for the treatment of LC patients using knowledge derived from three decades of research on ME/CFS.

"Impact of an education module on the knowledge and attitudes of emergency physicians towards prescribing buprenorphine for opioiduse disorder","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the existing opioid epidemic, contributing to an increase in overdoserelated deaths. Buprenorphine is an important treatment for patients with opioid-use disorder (OUD) and initiation in the Emergency Department (ED) has been shown to improve outcomes for these patients. Our objective was to assess the impact of a three-pronged education module on the knowledge and attitudes of emergency medicine (EM) physicians towards using buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD. Method(s): We developed a three-pronged educational module including rationale for OUD treatment with buprenorphine, an evidence-based ED buprenorphine induction pathway and electronic medical record tools (documentation templates, order sets and discharge instructions) that were deployed to providers in an urban academic ED. A voluntary anonymous pre-post survey was administered. Using a 6-point Likert Scale, participants were asked about their understanding, experience, and confidence with prescribing buprenorphine for patients with OUD. Descriptive statistics were applied. Result(s): Forty-nine subjects participated, including approximately two-thirds faculty physicians and one-third residents. A minority of respondents were female (37%). Most (80%) had no direct experience in prescribing buprenorphine. When asked if buprenorphine reduces the likelihood of death from opioid overdose, 22% of pre-education respondents disagreed compared to zero post-education respondents. When asked if they were open to prescribing buprenorphine, pre and post responses with ""Highly Agree"" increased from 39% to 57% respectively. When asked about whether they felt confident in their ability to treat OUD with buprenorphine, 36% of pre-education respondents disagreed compared to 3% of post-education respondents. Conclusion(s): A 1-hour three-pronged educational module (rationale for OUD treatment with buprenorphine, evidencebased ED buprenorphine induction pathway and electronic medical record tools), changed the attitudes of EM physicians towards buprenorphine treatment and demonstrated an increase in willingness and confidence to prescribe it for patients with OUD.","Zosel, A.; Hernandez-Meier, J.; Owen, J.; Birdsall, J.; Jasti, J.; Liu, J.","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2022.2107776","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Toxicology; 60(Supplement 2):46-47, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39882,""

"Increases in health problems during the first pandemic wave - An analysis of occupational differences based on the German National Cohort (NAKO)","Einleitung The pandemic poses a variety of health-related challenges for workers in different occupations. Employees in essential jobs experienced higher demands and workloads while many office workers transitioned into home office and had to cope with several new demands (e.g. developing new daily routines, managing childcare, mastering digital technologies). In addition, shifts into short-time work or unemployment elevated job insecurity and financial strains in the working population. Thus, the pandemic exposes workers to a number of stressors possibly influencing their health. Our research takes a closer look at occupational differences in health-related changes. With the goal to analyse intra-individual changes in mental health by occupation, the current analysis investigates differences between occupational groups in self-reported changes in general health during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in Germany. Methoden We use prospective cohort data of the German National Cohort (NAKO), which combines pre-pandemic baseline measures of health indicators of more than 100,000 workers with data collected during the first wave of the pandemic (February to August 2020). The classification of workers into different occupational groups is based on the German Classification of Occupations 2010 (Klassifikation der Berufe, KldB 2010). We distinguish between horizontal (occupational sectors and segments) and vertical occupational differences (skill level and personnel responsibility). Health is measured by self-rated health ('Compared to the time before the Corona pandemic, how would you describe your current state of health?') and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety disorder symptoms). Multivariable analysis linking deterioration in general health (yes/no) to occupational characteristics were carried out. Ergebnisse On average, 10.1 % of employees reported a deterioration in self-rated health during the first pandemic wave. The decline was the most pronounced in elderly care (adj. prevalence of 12.3%), education and social work (11.8%), administration (11.7%), and in pharmacy (11.3%). Employees in office jobs (11.1%), and in the segments of hospitality and cultural services (10.8%) also experienced a larger deterioration in general health than the average. Schlussfolgerung Our study fills an important gap in research by focusing on health-related changes due to pandemic in different occupational groups. Our analysis can highlight important adversities by occupation which might not be directly related to infection risk. Addressing them and improving working conditions in those occupations could be an important policy task. Our further research plan includes the analyses of intra-individual changes in mental health by occupation. We plan to have a specific focus on how pandemic-related work changes (such as home office, job insecurity or increased workload) contributed to changes in mental health.","RigÃ³, M.; Dragano, N.; Formazin, M.; Liebers, F.; Latza, U.; Reuter, M.","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1753735","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Gesundheitswesen, Supplement; 84(8-9):773-774, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39884,""
"Engineering the next generation of cell-based therapeutics","Cell-based therapeutics are an emerging modality with the potential to treat many currently intractable diseases through uniquely powerful modes of action. Despite notable recent clinical and commercial successes, cell-based therapies continue to face numerous challenges that limit their widespread translation and commercialization, including identification of the appropriate cell source, generation of a sufficiently viable, potent and safe product that meets patient- and disease-specific needs, and the development of scalable manufacturing processes. These hurdles are being addressed through the use of cutting-edge basic research driven by next-generation engineering approaches, including genome and epigenome editing, synthetic biology and the use of biomaterials.","Bashor, C.

"The covid 19 pandemic and the challenge of growing up in children with congenital heart defects and adolescents","Background and Aim: The WHO recommends physical activity (PA-60 min/day) for children and adolescents, also having chronic diseases (CCD). Studies have shown that children and adolescents with congenital heart defects (CHD) exercise regularly and PA can be influenced by health programs (e.g. kidsTUMove). Children and adolescents with/without CCD, are willing to achieve the guidelines recommended by the WHO. Likewise, studies show that life quality (HrQl) in CHD has equally good values than healthy controls. However, the covid 19 pandemic has an impact on children's, adolescents and young adults lives. The aim is to summarize the impact and its measures on healthy children as well as in CHD/CDD and point out possible solutions improving the health of the affected subjects. Method(s): A systematic review regarding HrQl, mental health and PA in children with/without CHD/CDD was conducted. In addition, data was collected at different times of the pandemic using questionnaires (kindl, Kidsscreen, WHO 5) regarding HrQl in children with/without CHD (age: 3-6, 8-16). A second survey was conducted in spring 2021 (age: 3-14) before and after a virtual sports camp (VIC). To have a glimps into adulthood HrQl data in student was evaluated in Dec 2020/Jan 2021. Result(s): The review shows a decrease in PA of children in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health (stress, anxiety and depression) was also affected as well as increasing concerns and fears. Result first survey: summer-fall 2020: Age 3-6: HrQLsum20 79% +/- 8.89 vs. HrQLfall20 78.98% +/- 11.21;p gt;0.05;age 8-16 kidsscreen: HrQLsum20 51,63% +/- 7,64 vs. HrQLfall20 51,12% +/- 7,50. HrQl in healthy children remained constant, but HRQoLsum/fall20 in children with CHD was sig-nificant lower (plt;0.005). HrQLspring21 after VIC increased (HrQLpre21 74.50% +/- 11.34 vs HrQLpost21 80.13 % +/- 9.57;plt;0.05). Student WHO5 survey showed that 51.8% felt more burdened by second lockdown 2021. There was a significant worsening of study life balance since the onset of the pan-demic (plt;0.001). Conclusion(s): It is important to provide suitable offers to increase PA, HRQoL, and mental health to minimize adverse health outcomes and prevent future health problems in adulthood in CHD/CDD.","Stocker, N.; Gaser, D.; Fritz, R.

"Physical and mental health problems of Chinese front-line healthcare workers before, during and after the COVID-19 rescue mission: a qualitative study","To explore the physical and mental health problems of front-line healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 across the three phases of the epidemic rescue mission (before, during and after) in China. A qualitative study was adopted using face to face, in-depth semistructured interviews. Phenomenological research methods and Colaizzi's seven-step analysis method were used in the study. The setting of the study was the offices of healthcare workers in 12 tertiary hospitals. Thirty-one front-line healthcare workers from 16 provinces in China, who carried out rescue missions in Hubei Province, were interviewed from October to November 2020. Physical and mental health problems existed before, during and after the COVID-19 rescue mission. Eleven themes emerged during the three phases. Two themes appeared before rescue mission: basic diseases, anxiety before rescue mission. Five themes appeared during rescue mission: basic physical function disorder, physical exhaustion, negative cognition, negative emotions and negative behaviour. Four themes appeared after rescue mission: physical dysfunction, negative emotions, stigmatisation and hypochondriasis. Both physical and mental health problems occurred throughout the three phases. The study results pointed that a comprehensive prevention and control system that addresses both physical and mental health problems of front-line healthcare workers throughout the three phases of epidemic rescue mission (before, during and after), and that involves themselves, their families, hospitals, the government and social organisations is needed.","Sun, Wang, Liu, Ren, Feng","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059879","20221027","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39891,""

An online survey was sent to the 385 consultant orthopaedic surgeons and registrars in New Zealand registered with the New Zealand Orthopaedic Association (NZOA). The survey consisted of 27 questions relating to demographics, the effects of COVID-19 on orthopaedic departments, on training, on mental health and the utilisation of telehealth and online teaching. In total, 189 of 385 NZOA members (49%) completed the survey. Of the 51 orthopaedic registrars surveyed, 55% felt that their training had been moderately affected, while 17% felt it had been significantly affected. Of those surveyed, 65% felt the pandemic had at least a mild effect on their mental health. Seven percent of registrars described a significant impact on their mental health compared to 2% of consultants (p=0.029). Overall, 46.5% felt they were more burnt out because of the pandemic, which was significantly higher in registrars compared to consultants (51% vs 44%, respectively; p=0.029).

"Coronavirus disease 2019 aftermath: psychological trauma in ICU healthcare workers","We aim to describe the extent of psychological trauma and moral distress in healthcare workers (HCW) working in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Specifically, we review reports on prevalence of mental health symptoms, highlight vulnerable populations and summarize modifiable risk factors associated with mental health symptoms in ICU HCW. The pandemic has resulted in a multitude of closely intertwined professional and personal challenges for ICU HCW. High rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (14-47%), burnout (45-85%), anxiety (31-60%), and depression (16-65%) have been reported, and these mental health symptoms are often interrelated. Most studies suggest that nurses and female HCW are at highest risk for developing mental health symptoms. The main personal concerns associated with reporting mental health symptoms among ICU HCW were worries about transmitting COVID-19 to their families, worries about their own health, witnessing colleagues contract the disease, and experiencing stigma from their communities. Major modifiable work-related risk factors were experiencing poor communication from supervisors, perceived lack of support from administrative leadership, and concerns about insufficient access to personal protective equipment, inability to rest, witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions, and restriction of family visitation policies. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted ICU HCW worldwide. The psychological trauma, manifesting as posttraumatic stress disorder, burnout, anxiety, and depression, is substantial and concerning. Urgent action by lawmakers and healthcare administrators is required to protect ICU HCW and sustain a healthy workforce.","Wahlster, Hartog","https://doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0000000000000994","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39893,""
"Self-Injury During COVID-19: Views From University Students With Lived Experience","Concerns have been raised about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with lived experience of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Yet, few efforts have explored this. Accordingly, using a mixed-methods approach, we sought to examine whether emerging adults who have self-injured experienced changes in NSSI urges and behavior during the pandemic and what may have accounted for these changes. To do so, university students with lived experience of NSSI completed online questions asking about NSSI and self-reported changes in urges and behavior since the onset of COVID-19. They then answered open-ended questions asking what contributed to these changes and how they have coped during this timeframe. Approximately 80% of participants reported no change or a decrease in NSSI urges and behavior. Participants discussed removal from stressors (e.g., social stress) that previously evoked NSSI, as well as having time for self-care and to develop resilience as accounting for this. Nevertheless, some participants reported challenges amid the pandemic (i.e., exacerbated stress, isolation); approximately one fifth of participants reported increases in NSSI urges and behavior. Our findings add to recent evidence that many individuals with prior mental health difficulties, including NSSI, can demonstrate resilience in the face of collective adversity. Research and clinician implications are discussed.","Lewis, Kenny, Pritchard, Labonte, Heath, Whitley","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001541","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39894,""
"Healthcare utilization in children across the care continuum during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare utilization decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to reduced transmission of infections and healthcare avoidance. Though various investigations have described these changing patterns in children, most have analyzed specific care settings. We compared healthcare utilization, prescriptions, and diagnosis patterns in children across the care continuum during the first year of the pandemic with preceding years. Using national claims data, we compared enrollees under 18 years during the pre-pandemic (January 2016 -mid-March 2020) and pandemic (mid-March 2020 through March 2021) periods. The pandemic was further divided into early (mid-March through mid-June 2020) and middle (mid-June 2020 through March 2021) periods. Utilization was compared using interrupted time series. The mean number of pediatric enrollees/month was 2,519,755 in the pre-pandemic and 2,428,912 in the pandemic period. Utilization decreased across all settings in the early pandemic, with the greatest decrease (76.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.6-80.5%) seen for urgent care visits. Only well visits returned to pre-pandemic rates during the mid-pandemic. Hospitalizations decreased by 43% (95% CI 37.4-48.1) during the early pandemic and were still 26.6% (17.7-34.6) lower mid-pandemic. However, hospitalizations in non-psychiatric facilities for various mental health disorders increased substantially mid-pandemic. Healthcare utilization in children dropped substantially during the first year of the pandemic, with a shift away from infectious diseases and a spike in mental health hospitalizations. These findings are important to characterize as we monitor the health of children, can be used to inform healthcare strategies during subsequent COVID-19 surges and/or future pandemics, and may help identify training gaps for pediatric trainees. Subsequent investigations should examine how changes in healthcare utilization impacted the incidence and outcomes of specific diseases.","Schroeder, Dahlen, Purington, Alvarez, Brooks, Destino, Madduri, Wang, Coon","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276461","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39895,""
"Intra-individual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep in young adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique academic, social, financial, and health-related challenges for young adults. While numerous studies have documented average increases in reported mental health issues in the general population, few have measured the magnitude of changes in mental health symptoms and sleep difficulties within individuals. Here, we measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep of university students pre- and mid-pandemic. Prior to the pandemic (Fall 2019), individuals (n = 23) were recruited to participate in an eight-day, comprehensive sleep study using FitbitÃ‚Â® actigraphy. Participants also completed detailed mental health and sleep surveys, including depression (BDI-II), anxiety (STAI), and sleep disturbance (PROMIS) surveys. One year later, these individuals repeated the study during the pandemic (Fall 2020); participants completed the original surveys and sleep study, in addition to a targeted survey on mental and sleep health due to the pandemic. Self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and sleep parameters, measured by actigraphy, were compared within the same individuals pre- and mid-pandemic. Self-report survey data revealed that three-quarters of participants experienced an increase in stress and anxiety due to the pandemic. In addition, intra-individual depression and anxiety symptoms increased to clinically significant levels within individuals from pre- to mid-pandemic. Over two-thirds of participants reported sleeping less, and more than half reported that their sleep health had worsened during the pandemic. Changes in sleep disturbance were positively associated with changes in depression and anxiety, reinforcing the robust relationship between poor sleep quality and mental health. Furthermore, individuals who reported greater sleep disturbance during the pandemic experienced lower relative proportions of both REM and deep sleep. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students is multi-faceted-mental health, sleep quality, and the amount of restorative sleep are negatively affected by the pandemic environment. These compounded effects exacerbate the health consequences of the pandemic and highlight a need for increased attention to the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders, particularly in vulnerable populations of young adults.","Knickerbocker, Cox, Dhawka, Woods, Ingram","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276165","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39896,""
"The Big Five personality traits and the fear of COVID-19 in predicting depression and anxiety among Japanese nurses caring for COVID-19 patients: A cross-sectional study in Wakayama prefecture","Recent studies have found a relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Medical workers caring for COVID-19 patients tend to suffer from mental health problems; however, the impact of their personality traits, in the form of mental problems like depression and anxiety in Japan is unclear. In this study, we investigated the risk of nurses' depression and anxiety, predicted by the fear of COVID-19 and the Big Five personality traits. A total of 417 nurses working in hospitals providing care to COVID-19 patients in Wakayama prefecture of the Kansai region participated in this study. The questionnaires comprised items on nurses' basic characteristics and three scales: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale 2020, the Big-Five Scale, and the Japanese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Depression and anxiety in the HADS were set as dependent variables, and basic attributes, fear, and personality traits as independent variables; multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. The questionnaire, with no missing items was distributed from February to March 2021. Neuroticism (OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.03-1.09) was the only significant factor associated with the depression symptom, and both FCV-19S scores (OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.09-1.23) and neuroticism (OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.06-1.13) were the significant factors associated with anxiety. The Nagelkerke's R squared was 0.171 in the depression model and 0.366 in the anxiety model. Thus, it was found that it is necessary to support nurses' mental health by developing methods suitable to their personalities.","Odachi, Takahashi, Sugawara, Tabata, Kajiwara, Hironishi, Buyo","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276803","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39897,""
"US adolescents' attitudes toward school, social connection, media use, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences as a function of gender identity and school context","The COVID-19 pandemic changed school contexts and social opportunities dramatically for adolescents around the world. Thus, certain adolescents may have been more susceptible to the stress of the pandemic as a function of differences in schooling. We present data from 1256 United States adolescents (ages 14-16) to examine how the 2020-2021 school context (in-person, hybrid, or virtual) related to feelings of school satisfaction and success, social connection, mental health, and media use. We also examine differences as a function of gender identity. Results demonstrate that school context, particularly in-person compared to virtual schooling, was related to higher school satisfaction and academic success, stronger feelings of social connection and inclusion, lower levels of anxiety and depression, and less problematic media use. Interestingly, adolescents did seem to use media as a tool to support social connection when in hybrid or virtual school contexts, but they also reported higher rates of problematic media use, thus suggesting that media use needs to be examined more carefully to understand its role as a potential protective mechanism for adolescents' social connection and mental health. These findings provide baseline information about how schools' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic may have created disparities among youth. These findings have implications for current school interventions.","Cingel, Lauricella, Taylor, Stevens, Coyne, Wartella","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276737","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39898,""

"Factors Associated With Burnout Among Nurses Providing Direct Patient Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to identify factors associated with burnout in nurses and nurses' opinions regarding interventions to promote well-being during crisis conditions such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout among nurses is prevalent under usual conditions and may increase during crises such as COVID-19. Researchers conducted a survey of 1103 frontline nurses in a single New York City hospital during the first (spring 2020) and second (fall 2020/winter 2021) local waves of COVID-19. Burnout prevalence increased from 45% to 52% between the first and second wave. Younger age, female gender, posttraumatic stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms, history of burnout, feeling less valued by hospital leadership, less informed of responsibilities, less certain about duration of enhanced workload, and prepared by prepandemic experience were predictive of burnout in multivariable analyses. Although some identified risk factors for burnout were nonmodifiable, others may be modifiable by hospital leadership.","Cohen, DePierro, Chan, Tolan, Deshpande, Feder, Feingold, Peccoralo, Pietrzak, Ripp","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNA.0000000000001216","20221027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39900,""

"Effect of Portable Rent Subsidies and Mentorship on Socioeconomic Inclusion for Young People Exiting Homelessness: A Community-Based Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial","There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness. To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies. This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022. Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years. Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem-proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -5.0 to 1.0; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.3; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03). In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes-potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies-are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation. This small pilot study was designed with the intention of generating data and hypotheses for a full-scale study; findings should be interpreted with caution.

"Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms: finding from the International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) study","While there has been concern over the perinatal mental health implications of the COVID-19 outbreak, evidence on the risk of postpartum depression and anxiety following SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. We studied this question using the International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy, which included both a prospective and retrospective cohort. Study participants were required to have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 between the date of last menstrual period and delivery. The exposure of interest was SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, as well as COVID-19 severity (severe, moderate, mild, and asymptomatic). The outcome was postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms, assessed by the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire. The final analytic cohort consisted of 3819 participants (COVID-19 positive: 771; COVID-19 negative: 3048). After adjusting for confounding by socio-demographics, prior obstetric and maternal health comorbidities, mothers with severe COVID-19 had an increased risk of depressive (aRR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.18-2.52) and anxiety (aRR: 1.40; 0.98-2.00) symptoms. The strength of the association was attenuated for women with moderate COVID-19 (aRRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.12; 0.86-1.44 for depressive symptoms; aRRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.18; 0.96-1.44 for anxiety symptoms).

"Looking to the VA for a roadmap on how to sustain tele-mental health care","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid increase in tele-mental health care availability in the United States. Although this change has the potential to help alleviate unmet need for mental health care in underserved areas, there are system and policy challenges to sustain tele-mental health models beyond the pandemic. The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) has long been a national leader in offering tele-mental health care. Using data from the National Mental Health Services Survey from 2010 to 2020, this brief report describes growth in tele-mental health care in VA and non-VA mental health facilities over a decade. The study used a sample of approximately 12,000 VA and non-VA mental health facilities in the United States and examined the availability of tele-mental health among facilities. Tele-mental health offerings increased dramatically in 2020, growing from 12% to 35% of facilities across 2010-2019 and then to 69% of facilities in 2020. Nearly, 90% of VA facilities offered tele-mental health during the same time period, and this percentage increased to 98% in 2020. Adapting tele-mental health innovations in the VA for other underserved populations and building a national infrastructure for tele-mental health may promote ongoing use of virtual care models to meet mental health care access challenges.

Barriers to accessing treatment prevent women from receiving mental health care, a situation that has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. mHealth interventions hold the potential to support women during the transition to parenthood despite these barriers and to promote the use of preventive interventions. This study uses a mixed methods design to assess the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a psychoeducational, guided mHealth intervention to prevent postpartum mental health difficulties in women who receive care in primary health centers in Chile. The study will contribute to evidence-based research on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for new mothers from an understudied cultural background.

"Measuring Asian hate: Discordant reporting of race-based hate incidents and unfair treatment and association with measures of wellbeing","During COVID-19, anti-Asian discrimination increased in attention. Hate and unfair treatment are related but do not completely overlap. We expect those who report a hate incident would also report race-based unfair treatment, yet feelings of social desirability or self-blame may lead to under-reporting of unfair treatment. To describe reporting of an experience of race-based hate but not an experience of race-based unfair treatment among Asians in California and explore the association between this reporting discordance with (1) serious psychological distress, (2) forgoing needed medical care, (3) increased household interpersonal conflict, and (4) feeling unsafe in their neighborhood. We used the 2020 California Health Interview Survey's AANHPI COVID Module, conducted weighted descriptive and multivariate analyses, and computed adjusted relative risks (RR). The multivariate models controlled for Asian subgroup, age, gender, immigrant status, education level, poverty, and English proficiency. Among Asians who reported race-based hate (6.9% overall), 62.4% reported not experiencing race-based unfair treatment. Compared to Asians not reporting a hate incident, this ""discordant"" group was more likely to experience serious psychological distress (RR = 6.9), forgo necessary medical care (RR = 2.4), increased household interpersonal conflicts (RR = 2.7), and feel unsafe in their neighborhoods (RR = 3.0). The ""concordant"" group did not post significant effects for severe psychological distress nor forgoing necessary medical care.

"Measurement invariance of the GAD-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale in a Mexican general population sample","The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the measurement of invariance by sex, age, and educational level of an online version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale in a five-item version (GAD-5). Configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance were evaluated using data from 79,473 respondents who answered a mental health questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. The sex variable was classified as male or female; age was categorized as minors, youth, young adults, adults, and older adults; and educational level was divided into basic, upper secondary, higher, and graduate education. To test for configural invariance, confirmatory factor models were constructed. For metric invariance, equality restrictions were established for the factor loadings between the construct and its items; for scalar invariance, equality restrictions were established between the intercepts; strict variance implied the additional restriction of the residuals. Statistical analysis was performed in R software with the lavaan package. The results show that with respect to sex, age, and educational level, configural and metric measurement invariance was confirmed (ÃŽâ€CFI &lt; 0.002; ÃŽâ€RMSEA &lt; 0.015). However, with respect to scalar and strict invariance, the results showed significant differences regarding the fit model (ÃŽâ€CFI &gt; 0.002; ÃŽâ€RMSEA &gt; 0.015). We conclude that the GAD-5 presents configural and metric invariance for sex, age, and educational level, and scalar invariance for sex and age groups.

Binary regression analysis was used to study the factors that influence the vaccination behaviors of people with different media use frequencies; (3) Results: All respondents were classified into the following three groups: media use low frequency (9.7%), media use general (67.1%), and media use high frequency (23.2%). Media use low frequency (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.608, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) was negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccination behavior. In the media use low frequency, analysis showed that ""aged 41 years or older"" <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.784, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), had religious belief (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.075, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), were ethnic minorities (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.936, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and had friends support (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.923, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) were associated with a preference to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. In the media use general, those who aged 41 years old and older (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.682, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), had major depression (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.951, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), had friends support (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.048, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) would be more likely to receive COVID-19 vaccination. However, respondents who live in towns (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.300, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) had lower behaviors to receive vaccination for COVID-19. In the media use high frequency, the respondents who aged 41 or older (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.010, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), were ethnic minorities (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.741, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), had moderate depression (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.003, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) would receive the vaccination for COVID-19 positively; (4) Conclusions: The more occluded the media use is, the less likely the respondents are to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination behavior is influenced by different factors in groups with different frequencies of media use. Therefore, the government and appropriate departments should make individualized and targeted strategies about COVID-19 vaccination and disseminate the vaccination information to different media use groups.","Gong, Gong, Li, Min, Zhang, Li, Fu, Fu, He, Wang, Wang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10101737","20221027","COVID-19 vaccination; latent profile analysis; media use; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39915,""
"The Association between Socio-Demographics and Mental Distress Following COVID-19 Vaccination-Mediation of Vaccine Hesitancy","The COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to over 200 countries and regions. With the unprecedented vaccination scale and speed, vaccination correlated mental health issues should be paid precise attention to. This study aims to assess the association between socio-demographic factors and mental health following vaccination and to analyze the mediation effect of vaccine hesitancy. This study recruited 2112 individuals who took two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Shanghai. Structural equation modeling was performed to assess factors associated with anxiety and depression of the vaccinated individuals and the underlying mechanism. The results yielded that vaccine hesitancy partially mediated/suppressed the effect from gender and employment status to anxiety/depression and fully mediated the effects from education to anxiety/depression. This study advanced the understanding of mental health disparity among different socio-demographic groups after vaccination and the impact of vaccine hesitancy on the vaccinated population's mental health. The finding offered insights into the possible mental vulnerability of people holding a hesitant attitude before vaccination and suggested that vaccine hesitancy played a crucial role in people's mental health after vaccination. Health promotion programs can target vaccine hesitancy to prevent unfavorable mental health consequences among specific populations.","Zhang, Shen, Li, Shi, Wang, Chen, Qin, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10101697","20221027","COVID-19; anxiety; depressive symptoms; mediation analysis; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39916,""
"Exploring the Association between Negative Emotions and COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Unvaccinated Adults in Sweden","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals' mental health. This study aimed to investigate how negative emotions toward the COVID-19 pandemic, including feeling anxious, depressed, upset, and stressed, were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Sweden. The study is a cross-sectional online survey conducted between 21-28 May 2021, using three nested hierarchical logistic regression models to assess the association. The study included 965 unvaccinated individuals, 51.2% (n = 494) of whom reported their intention to get vaccinated. We observed graded positive associations between reported negative emotions and vaccine acceptance. Individuals who experienced economic stress had lower odds of vaccine acceptance while having a positive opinion of the government's response to COVID-19 was associated with higher odds of being vaccine-acceptant. In conclusion, unvaccinated individuals experiencing negative emotions about the pandemic were more willing to get the vaccine. On the contrary, those with a negative opinion about the government's response, and those that had experienced economic stress were less likely to accept the immunization.","Wei, Harriman, Piltch-Loeb, Testa, Savoia","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10101695","20221027","COVID-19; emotions; financial stress; government; psychology; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39917,""
"Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation Improves Inflammation but Does Not Interfere with Cardiac Modulation and Clinical Symptoms of Individuals with COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial","Transcranial auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown effectiveness in reducing inflammation and depression. Thus, this study evaluated its effect on inflammation, cardiac autonomic modulation, and clinical symptoms in individuals affected by COVID-19. <b>Methods</b>: There were 52 randomized participants hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis who were to receive active (a-taVNS) or sham taVNS (s-taVNS) for 90 min twice a day for seven consecutive days. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), 10 (IL-10), cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), heart rate variability (HRV), and clinical symptoms were assessed before and after seven days of treatment. There were also seven- and fourteen-day follow-ups for clinical symptoms, including anxiety and depression levels, as well as a six-month follow-up for memory and attention levels. <b>Results</b>: There was significant reduction in CRP -23.9%, (95% CI -46.3 to -1.4) and IL-6 -37.7%, (95% CI -57.6 to -17.7) for the a-taVNS group.

"Evaluation of Tele-Dentistry and Face-to-Face Appointments during the Provision of Dental Services in Poland","Tele-dentistry is a rapidly growing field, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, remote services are of increasing interest to both patients and dental personnel. They allow for reduced person-to-person contact and thus a reduced risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV2 virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the functioning of all areas of life, including dental treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the possibility of using tele-dentistry for dental services and analyse the attitudes of patients and dentists towards this solution. The period analysed was between March 2019 and February 2021 in five healthcare entities in Cracow in Central Europe. The study's retrospective analysis shows a positive attitude of patients towards tele-dentistry at every stage of treatment, from diagnosis through postoperative care, and a significant reluctance of dentists in the majority of dental specialties towards tele-dentistry. Consequently, a significant percentage of patients were invited to dental offices for a face-to-face appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative attitude of dental personnel towards tele-dentistry compared with the positive attitude of patients towards tele-dentistry is somewhat worrying in view of the possibility of a further pandemic. At the same time, it provides important information about the need to educate and support dental personnel in tele-dental solutions and improve solutions for the future. Taking into account the potential reduction in dental care costs for patients and countries after the implementation of tele-dentistry solutions, this is an important topic, while current studies do not comprehensively address the attitudes of patients and dental personnel towards tele-dentistry. In other parts of the world, a similar approach to tele-dentistry is used by patients and dentists.","Migas, KozÃ…â€šowski, Sierocka, Marczak","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12101640","20221027","COVID-19; dentistry; remote consultation; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39919,""
"Implication of COVID-19 Pandemic on Adolescent Mental Health: An Analysis of the Psychiatric Counseling from the Emergency Room of an Italian University Hospital in the Years 2019-2021","Although the COVID-19 pandemic had profound consequences on youths' mental health, few data are available about its longitudinal implications. In this study, from 655 counseling requests by the Emergency Room (ER) of the University Hospital of Bari, we retrospectively examined 380 requests for psychiatric counseling of pediatric subjects, during the pre-pandemic, the first pandemic, and the second pandemic wave of COVID-19. We found a significant upward trend between 2019 and 2021 for the counseling requests for acute psychopathological symptoms (<i>p</i> = 1.469 Ãƒâ€” 10<sup>-5</sup>), patients in adolescent age (<i>p</i> = 0.022), females (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and those taking psychotropic medications (<i>p</i> = 2.28 Ãƒâ€” 10<sup>-5</sup>).

The proportion of counseling for psychotic symptoms (<i>p</i> = 0.014) and self-injuring behaviors (<i>p</i> = 0.035) also showed an increasing trend over time, with self-harming behaviors becoming more severe and diversified in modalities. The pandemic's persistence over time may have had an impact on youth's psychopathology, influencing the frequency, type, and complexity of mental health problems; as a result, it is vital to implement timely integrated interventions and find strategies to prevent self-harm, in particular with the identification of vulnerable categories of patients.","Petruzzelli, Furente, Colacicco, Annecchini, Margari, Gabellone, Margari, Matera","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11206177","20221027","COVID-19 pandemic; adolescentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mental health; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39920,""
"Is SARS-CoV-2 a Risk Factor of Bipolar Disorder?-A Narrative Review","For 2.5 years we have been facing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its health, social and economic effects. One of its known consequences is the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression. However, reports of manic episodes related to COVID-19 have emerged. Mania is an integral part of the debilitating illness-bipolar disorder (BD). Due to its devastating effects, it is therefore important to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is a causative agent of this severe mental disorder. In this narrative review, we discuss the similarities between the disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2 and those found in patients with BD, and we also try to answer the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a risk factor for the development of this affective disorder. Our observation shows that disorders in COVID-19 showing the greatest similarity to those in BD are cytokine disorders, tryptophan metabolism, sleep disorders and structural changes in the central nervous system (CNS). These changes, especially intensified in severe infections, may be a trigger for the development of BD in particularly vulnerable people, e.g., with family history, or cause an acute episode in patients with a pre-existing BD.","Lorkiewicz, Waszkiewicz","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11206060","20221027","COVID-19; bipolar; corticosteroids; cytokines; depression; kynurenine; mania; oxidative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39921,""

"Prevalence of Psychopathological Symptoms and Their Determinants in Four Healthcare Workers' Categories during the Second Year of COVID-19 Pandemic","Highly stressful situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, induce constant changes in the mental state of people who experience them. In the present study, we analyzed the prevalence of some psychological symptoms and their determinants in four different categories of healthcare workers during the second year of the pandemic. A total of 265 physicians, 176 nurses, 184 other healthcare professionals, and 48 administrative employees, working in different Italian healthcare contexts, answered a questionnaire including variables about their mental status and experience with the pandemic. The mean scores for anxiety and depressive symptoms measured more than one year after the onset of the pandemic did not reach the pathological threshold. In contrast, post-traumatic and burnout symptoms tended toward the critical threshold, especially in physicians. The main determinant of psychological distress was perceived stress, followed by job satisfaction, the impact of COVID-19 on daily work, and a lack of recreational activities. These results increase the knowledge of which determinants of mental distress would be important to act on when particularly stressful conditions exist in the workplace that persist over time. If well-implemented, specific interventions focused on these determinants could lead to an improvement in employee well-being and in the quality of care provided.","Gorini, Giuliani, Fiabane, Bonomi, Gabanelli, Pierobon, Moretta, Pagliarulo, Spaccavento, Vaudo, Pirro, Mannarino, Milani, Caruso, Baiardi, Dalla Vecchia, La Rovere, Pistarini, Baldassarre","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013712","20221028","burnout; healthcare workers; impact of COVID-19; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychopathological symptoms; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Prevalence; Health Personnel; Mental Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39923,""

"Self-Reported Alcohol Abuse and the Desire to Receive Mental Health Counselling Predict Suicidal Thoughts/Thoughts of Self-Harm among Female Residents of Fort McMurray","Suicidal ideation and thoughts of self-harm continue to be challenging public health problems. It is presently unknown what the prevalence and correlates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm are in female residents of Fort McMurray, a city that has endured wildfires, flooding, and the COVID-19 pandemic in the last five years. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation and thoughts of self-harm among female residents of Fort McMurray. A cross-sectional study using an online survey questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and clinical information from the residents of Fort McMurray between 24 April and 2 June 2021. Suicidal ideation and thoughts of self-harm among females were assessed using the ninth question of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, a validated screening tool used to assess depression symptoms. Likely generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and low resilience were measured using standardized rating scales. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 25 using chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Among Fort McMurray residents, 249 accessed the online survey, while 186 ultimately completed it, yielding a survey completion rate of 74.7%. Of these, 159 (85%) were females. After controlling for other variables in the regression model, respondents who expressed a desire to receive mental health counselling were more than seven times more likely to report suicidal ideation and thoughts of self-harm compared to the respondents who did not desire to receive mental health counselling (OR: 7.29; 95% CI: 1.19-44.58). Similarly, respondents who reported having abused alcohol in the past year were nearly four times more likely to report suicidal ideation or thoughts of self-harm compared to the respondents who said they had not abused alcohol in the past year (OR: 3.91; 95% CI: 1.05-14.57). A high prevalence of suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm were reported among female residents of Fort McMurray. Timely access to adequate mental health support should be offered to female residents of communities impacted by multiple natural disasters, particularly residents who self-report alcohol abuse or desire to receive mental health counselling.","Agyapong, Shalaby, Eboreime, Wei, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013620","20221028","Fort McMurray; female; mental health; multiple traumas; suicidal ideation; Humans; Female; Male; Suicidal Ideation; Self Report; Alcoholism; Mental Health; Depressive Disorder, Major; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; COVID-19; Self-Injurious Behavior; Counseling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39926,""
"Positive Affect Moderates the Influence of Perceived Stress on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a profound psychological impact on healthcare workers. However, the role of positive affect in moderating the effect of perceived stress on the psychological states of healthcare workers remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the moderating effect of positive affect on the association between stress and the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationships between perceived stress (the Perceived Stress Scale), positive affect (the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule), depression (the Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and anxiety (the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 644 Chinese healthcare workers who completed online self-reports. The results revealed a significant negative association between positive affect and psychological problems, including stress, depression, and anxiety. At the total group level, multiple regression analysis showed that positive affect alleviated the influence of perceived stress on depression, but no significant moderating effect was found for anxiety. In the subgroups divided by perceived stress, the moderating effect of positive affect on depression was only significant in healthcare workers with a high level of perceived stress. These results suggested that positive affect played a moderative role in alleviating the effect of stress on depression among healthcare workers, particularly those with a high level of stress, thus emphasizing the importance of positive affect as an intervention strategy for promoting the mental health of healthcare workers in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Luo, Guo, Shang, Zheng, Cai, Mo, Lau, Zhang, Li, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013600","20221028","COVID-19; healthcare workers; mental health; perceived stress; positive affect; Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Mental Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Depression; Health Personnel; Anxiety; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39927,""
"Latent Classes of Adverse and Benevolent Childhood Experiences in a Multinational Sample of Parents and Their Relation to Parent, Child, and Family Functioning during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are known to contribute to later mental health. Conversely, Benevolent Childhood Experiences (BCEs) may buffer against mental health difficulties. The importance of ACEs and BCEs for mental health of both parents and children may be most obvious during periods of stress, with potential consequences for functioning of the family. Subgroups of ACEs and BCEs in parents during the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated and validated in relation to indices of parent, child, and family well-being. In May 2020, ACEs/BCEs were assessed in 547 parents of 5-18-year-old children from the U.K., U.S., Canada, and Australia. Subgroups of parents with varying levels of ACEs and BCEs were identified via latent class analysis. The subgroups were validated by examining associations between class membership and indices of parent and child mental health and family well-being. Four latent classes were identified: low-ACEs/high-BCEs, moderate-ACEs/high-BCEs, moderate-ACEs/low-BCEs, and high-ACEs/moderate-BCEs. Regardless of the extent of BCEs, there was an increased risk of parent and child mental health difficulties and family dysfunction among those reporting moderate-to-high levels of ACEs. Parents' history of adversity may influence the mental health of their family. These findings highlight the importance of public health interventions for preventing early-life adversity.","Johnson, Browne, Meade, Prime, Wade","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013581","20221028","ACEs; BCEs; COVID-19; adversity; benevolence; parental mental health; Child; Humans; Child, Preschool; Adolescent; COVID-19; Pandemics; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Mental Health; Family","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39928,""

A structured questionnaire was used to monitor the number of alcoholic beverages consumed during the pandemic, compared to the time before the pandemic. The majority of the population did not change the number of alcoholic beverages consumed, and among those with changes, there were significantly more of those who drank less than those who drank more. Among respondents who drank a greater number of alcoholic beverages, statistically significantly higher proportions were found in younger age groups, people with post-secondary vocational education or higher, and people with a higher probability of mental health problems. During the pandemic crisis, we need to pay special attention to vulnerable groups that are at higher risk of increasing alcohol use.","RadoÃ…Â¡ Krnel, RoÃ…Â¡kar, Hovnik KerÃ…Â¡manc, Rehberger, LeviÃ„Ânik, HoÃ„Âevar Grom","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013576","20221028","SARS-CoV-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2); alcohol (ethanol); alcohol consumption (alcohol drinking); pandemic (pandemics); vulnerable groups (vulnerable populations); Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Groups; COVID-19; Alcohol Drinking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39929,""
"Mental Health and Substance Use of Farmers in Canada during COVID-19","Farmers in Canada faced higher levels of mental distress than the general public prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and are generally less likely than the public to seek help. However, the mental health impacts of COVID-19 on farmers in Canada remain unexplored. Our objective was to investigate mental health outcomes among farmers in Canada by gender and within the context of COVID-19. We conducted a national, online, cross-sectional survey of farmers in Canada (February-May 2021). The survey included validated scales of anxiety, depression, perceived stress, burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, professional efficacy), alcohol use, resilience, and questions regarding participants' perceived changes in these outcomes during the pandemic. Data were also collected on the impact of COVID-19 specific social and economic factors on mental health, help-seeking, and sense of community belonging through the pandemic. Descriptive statistics were summarized, and Chi-square analyses and t-tests were conducted to compare survey results between genders and to data collected in our similar 2016 survey and normative population data. A total of 1167 farmers participated in the survey. Participants scored more severely across scales than scale norms and the general Canadian population during COVID-19. Scale means were consistent between the 2016 and 2021 samples. Most participants with moderate to severe scores for any outcome reported worsening symptoms since the pandemic began. Women fared significantly worse than men across measures. Over twice as many women reported seeking mental health or substance use support during the pandemic than men. Participants rated the mental health impacts of all social and economic factors related to COVID-19 examined significantly (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) differently than the Canadian public. The pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of farmers in Canada and in ways that differ from the general population. National level and gender-specific mental health supports are needed to help improve the mental health of farmers in Canada.","Thompson, Hagen, Lumley, Winder, Gohar, Jones-Bitton","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013566","20221028","agriculture; anxiety; burnout; depression; one health; perceived stress; resilience; Female; Humans; Male; COVID-19; Mental Health; Farmers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Canada; Anxiety; Substance-Related Disorders; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39930,""
"Effect of Green Plants on Individuals' Mental Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Preliminary Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has not only jeopardized people's physical health, but also put additional strain on their mental health. This study explored the role of indoor natural elements (i.e., green plants) in relieving individuals' mental stress during a prolonged stressful period. A pilot and three formal studies examined the effect of indoor green plants placed in living and working environments on people's perceived stress during the pandemic and further uncovered its underlying mechanism emphasizing a mediating role of emotion. The pilot study confirmed that the severity of the pandemic positively correlated with individuals' level of stress. Study 1 then demonstrated that indoor green plants in people's living environments might reduce their perceived stress during the pandemic, which is referred to as the ""plant effect"". Study 2 repeated the plant effect in a field experiment conducted in a working environment and Study 3 revealed a mediating role of positive emotion. This study provides preliminary evidence for the mitigating effect of indoor green plants on individuals' mental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The indoor green plants placed in living and working environments may elicit positive emotion, which in turn reduce people's mental stress. In addition, our results reveal that growth status of the indoor green plants affected the plant effect as well.","Liu, He, Yu, Freudenreich, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013541","20221028","COVID-19 pandemic; green plants; growth status; mental stress; positive emotion; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Stress, Psychological; Plants; Viridiplantae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39931,""
"Exploring Depression among the Elderly during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Effects of the Big Five, Media Use, and Perceived Social Support","The mental health of the elderly is vulnerable during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the risks of depression is increased. The study aimed to explore the effects of physical health, the Big Five personality traits, media use, and different kinds of perceived social support as predictors of levels of depression among the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in more than 120 cities in China with a sample of 1147 older adults, and hierarchical regression was established to examine the predictors of the level of depression. The results showed that almost half of the elderly (48%) had a status of mild or much more severe depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The level of depression was negatively associated with physical health, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and family support, while it was positively associated with neuroticism and media use. The study emphasized the effects of physical health, the Big Five personality traits, media use, and perceived social support from family as the predictors of levels of depression, providing further measures to help the elderly better react to a public health emergency.","Li, Lin, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013534","20221028","Big Five; depression; media use; perceived social support; physical health; the elderly; Humans; Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Depression; Cross-Sectional Studies; Personality; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39932,""
"Suicide Risk in Military Personnel during the COVID-19 Health Emergency in a Peruvian Region: A Cross-Sectional Study","Military personnel represent a frontline group exposed to multiple stressors. These factors have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, predisposing to the development of suicidal risk (SR). Given the few studies conducted in this population, we evaluated the prevalence of SR and its associated factors during the health emergency. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in person among 514 participants in Lambayeque, Peru in 2021. The outcome was SR, and the exposures were depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), PTSD (PCL-C), and other sociodemographic variables. The prevalence of SR was 14.0% (95% CI: 11.12-17.31%) and was significantly higher in people with a family history of mental health (PR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.13-4.15) and in those with moderate clinical insomnia (PR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.19-4.12). Military personnel with high resilience had a lower prevalence of SR (PR: 0.54, CI: 0.31-0.95). Anxiety was associated with a higher prevalence of SR (PR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.76-6.10). Our findings show that at least 1 out of 10 military personnel are at risk of suicide. Special attention should be paid to the associated factors to develop interventions and reverse their consequences. These results may be useful in policy implementation and general statistics of SR in the local and regional context.","Valladares-Garrido, PicÃƒÂ³n-ReÃƒÂ¡tegui, Zila-Velasque, Grados-Espinoza, Hinostroza-Zarate, Failoc-Rojas, Pereira-Victorio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013502","20221028","COVID-19; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder; public health; sleep quality; suicide risk; Humans; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Military Personnel; Pandemics; Peru; Anxiety; Suicide; Depression; Health Personnel; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39933,""
"Exploring Public Discussions Regarding COVID-19 Vaccinations on Microblogs in China: Findings from Machine Learning Algorithms","Large-scale, widespread COVID-19 vaccination is the most effective means of cutting off the spread of the novel coronavirus and establishing an immune barrier. Due to the large population base in China, it has been a very difficult task to establish such an immune barrier. Therefore, this study aims to explore the public's discussions related to COVID-19 vaccinations on microblogs and to detect their sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination so as to improve the vaccination rate in China. This study employed machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze mass data obtained from SinaWeibo. A total of 1,478,875 valid microblog texts were collected between December 2020 and June 2022, the results of which indicated that: (1) overall, negative texts (38.7%) slightly outweighed positive texts (36.1%); ""Good"" (63%) dominated positive texts, while ""disgust"" (44.6%) and ""fear"" (35.8%) dominated negative texts; (2) six overarching themes related to COVID-19 vaccination were identified: public trust in the Chinese government, changes in daily work and study, vaccine economy, international COVID-19 vaccination, the COVID-19 vaccine's R&amp;D, and COVID-19 vaccination for special groups. These themes and sentiments can clarify the public's reactions to COVID-19 vaccination and help Chinese officials' response to vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, this study seeks to make up for the lack of focus on big data in public health and epidemiology research, and to provide novel insights for future studies.","Dang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013476","20221028","COVID-19 vaccination; China; microblogs; sentiment analysis; the public; topic analysis; Humans; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Vaccination; China; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39934,""
"COVID-19 and Mental Health of Minority Arab Higher-Education Students in Israel: Social, Economic, and Academic Factors","The mental health and well-being of higher-education students is a topic of growing interest. COVID-19 impacted higher education in many ways and the challenges were especially pronounced for minority students. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Arab minority students in Israel in relation to social, academic, and financial factors. We recruited 420 Arab higher-education students enrolled in academic colleges or universities in Israel who completed a battery of online questionnaires. Mental health status was measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21). Moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were reported by 49.3%, 45.2%, and 54% of Arab students, respectively. Analyses indicate that low quality of online learning, academic difficulties, and negative economic effects of COVID-19 predicted stress, anxiety, and depression. Women reported higher levels of depression and stress; job loss predicted depression and anxiety; low income predicted depression; and COVID-19-related health concerns predicted anxiety. This study highlights the unique and multiple challenges faced by minority students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Campus programs are needed to address the emotional needs of students. Longitudinal research is needed to more fully understand the impact of COVID-19 on higher-education students.","Alfayumi-Zeadna, Gnaim-Abu Touma, Weinreich, O'Rourke","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013466","20221028","Arab students; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; ethnic minorities; higher-education students; mental health; stress; Humans; Female; Mental Health; COVID-19; Arabs; Israel; Depression; Students; Anxiety; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39935,""
"Longitudinal Shifts in Movement Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Relations to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder among University Students","This study examined the longitudinal changes of movement behaviors and their relationships with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among university students during the coronavirus disease 2019 in China. A total of 569 university students completed online surveys twice (Time 1: between December 2020 and January 2021; Time 2: between November and December 2021). Physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep duration and quality, as well as PTSD were self-reported. According to Canadian 24-h movement guidelines, the longitudinal shifts in each movement behavior from Time 1 to Time 2 were divided into four categories (consistently meeting the guidelines, from meeting to not meeting the guidelines, from not meeting to meeting the guidelines, and consistently not meeting the guidelines). Generalized linear mixed models were conducted using 410 valid responses (20.2 Ã‚Â± 1.0 years old at Time 2, 41.2% males). From Time 1 to Time 2, 22.2%, 2.0%, and 45.6% of the students consistently met the physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep guidelines, respectively. Compared to those who consistently met the sedentary behavior guideline, students who consistently failed to meet or changed from meeting to not meeting the guidelines had higher levels of PTSD. Students who had poor sleep quality at both time points or changed from good to bad sleep quality had higher levels of PTSD than those who maintained good sleep quality over time. Compared to those who consistently failed to meet the guideline, students who consistently met the PA guideline had higher levels of PTSD. These findings highlight the needs to improve and maintain healthy behaviors for mental health.","Feng, Lau, Shi, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013449","20221028","COVID-19; physical activity; posttraumatic stress disorder; sedentary behavior; sleep; undergraduate; Male; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Female; COVID-19; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Universities; Pandemics; Canada; Sleep; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39936,""
"Meeting the Needs of Rural Veterans: A Qualitative Evaluation of Whole Health Coaches' Expanded Services and Support during COVID-19","The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore perspectives of Whole Health (WH) coaches at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) on meeting the needs of rural Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluation design employed a qualitative description approach, employing focus groups and in-depth interviews with a convenience sample of WH coaches across the VHA system. Fourteen coaches who work with rural Veterans participated in either one of three focus groups, individual interviews, or both. The focus group data and in-depth interviews were analyzed separately using thematic analysis, and findings were then merged to compare themes across both datasets. Four primary themes were identified: bridging social risk factors for rural Veterans, leveraging technology to stay connected with Veterans at-a-distance, redirecting Veterans to alternate modes of self-care, and maintaining flexibility in coaching role during COVID-19. One overarching theme was also identified following a post-hoc analysis driven by interdisciplinary team discussion: increased concerns for Veteran mental health during COVID-19. Coaches reported using a variety of strategies to respond to the wide-ranging needs of rural Veterans during the pandemic.

"Classroom Digital Teaching and College Students' Academic Burnout in the Post COVID-19 Era: A Cross-Sectional Study","The continued development of digital technology and its overuse in teaching and learning in the post-epidemic era have brought about digital health risks, which are associated with academic burnout among college students. This study focused on the relationship between classroom digital teaching and students' academic burnout and designed the Classroom Burnout Inventory (CBI) and the Classroom Burnout Causes Inventory (CBCI) to conduct a cross-sectional survey of 206 Chinese university students. Correlations and regression analyses were conducted between key factors and burnout values through a path model of ""Digital teaching-Teaching &amp; learning process-Causes subjects-Burnout"". The results of the study show that an inappropriate and excessive use of unintegrated digital teaching and learning technologies in the classroom was positively correlated with academic burnout among college students. Burnout levels and the three manifestations were not correlated with students' gender, grade, and major. In terms of causes, the academic burnout of college students was more correlated with their own personal reasons than with external factors such as teachers, universities, and environments. Integrating digital technology platforms, enhancing teacher leadership in the digital classroom, and strengthening peer support and students' psychological resilience are all meaningful explorations of academic burnout prevention strategies.","Song, Wang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013403","20221028","academic burnout; digital health; digital teaching and learning; educational psychology; mental health; post COVID-19 era; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Students; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39938,""
"Associations between Lifestyle Changes, Risk Perception and Anxiety during COVID-19 Lockdowns: A Case Study in Xi'an","The outbreak of COVID-19 dramatically changed individuals' lifestyles, which in turn triggered psychological stress and anxiety. Many previous studies have discussed the relationships between lifestyle changes and anxiety and risk perception and anxiety independently. However, few papers have discussed these factors in a comprehensive and systematic manner. We established a six-dimensional system to assess changes in individuals' lifestyles, which include dietary habits, physical activity (PA), sleep, screen time, smoking and alcohol consumption, and interaction with neighbors. Then, we collected information relating to socio-demographics, lifestyle changes, risk perception, and anxiety, and discussed their associations using multilinear and stepwise logistic regressions. The results show that not all lifestyle changes had an influence on anxiety. Changes in PA and interaction with neighbors were not significantly associated with anxiety. Risk perception was found to be inversely related to anxiety. Changes in dietary habits, family harmony, and net income were negatively related to anxiety among the group with higher risk perception. As individuals perceived a higher severity of COVID-19, the impact of their financial status on anxiety increased. These findings provide a valuable resource for local governments seeking to refine their pandemic strategies by including approaches such as advocating healthy lifestyles and stabilizing the job market to improve individuals' mental health during lockdowns.","Yang, Zhao, Zhang, Jia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013379","20221028","COVID-19; XiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an; anxiety; lifestyle changes; risk perception; Humans; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Anxiety; Life Style; Perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39939,""
"Fatigue and Cognitive Dysfunction Are Associated with Occupational Status in Post-COVID Syndrome","Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is a medical condition characterized by the persistence of a wide range of symptoms after acute infection by SARS-CoV-2.

This cross-sectional study involved 77 patients with PCS on active work before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were evaluated 20.71 Ã‚Â± 6.50 months after clinical onset. We conducted a survey on occupational activity and cognitive and clinical symptoms. The association between occupational activity and fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and cognitive testing was analyzed. Thirty-eight (49.4%) patients were working, and thirty-nine (50.6%) patients were not. Of those not working at the moment of the assessment, 36 (92.3%) patients were on sick leave. In 63 patients (81.8% of the sample), sick leave was needed at some point due to PCS. The mean duration of sick leave was 12.07 Ã‚Â± 8.07 months. According to the patient's perspective, the most disabling symptoms were cognitive complaints (46.8%) and fatigue (31.2%). Not working at the moment of the assessment was associated with higher levels of fatigue and lower cognitive performance in the Stroop test. No association was found between occupational status with depression and anxiety questionnaires. Our study found an influence of PCS on work capacity.

"Transfer of Mental Health Services for Medical Students to Cyberspace during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Service Use and Students' Preferences for Psychological Self-Help Techniques","The high risk of mental health problems among medical students has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, which greatly reduced social contact. The mental health support service of the medical school of one Hungarian university was transferred to the online learning management system and was expanded by self-help materials in three domains: Improving study skills, stress management techniques, and reducing stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We wanted to understand the preferences of medical students for psychological self-help techniques by investigating the pattern of access to online self-help materials and the characteristics of the users. Access to the online materials between April 2020 and April 2021 among Hungarian and international medical students was analyzed using the logging data of the system. Of all the students who logged in during the examination period (<i>n</i> = 458), 36.6-40.4% viewed materials to improve study skills and 23-29% viewed stress management materials, of which short-duration audio format techniques were preferred. The access rate of content targeting coping with the mental health effects of COVID-19 was 9.5-24%. Support to improve study skills is significantly more preferred than interventions targeting distress-reduction.

"Predictors and Consequences of Not Seeking Healthcare during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from the HEAF Cohort","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction of routine healthcare availability in many European countries. Among a cohort of English middle-aged adults, we explored pre-pandemic and pandemic factors associated with not seeking healthcare during lockdown, and their effect on subsequent self-reported health measures. Longitudinal data from the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) cohort were used. Pre-pandemic data came from the 5th annual follow-up (2019), when participants were aged 56-71 years, and pandemic data were collected by e-survey in February 2021 and November 2021. Response rates of the two e-surveys were 53% and 79%, respectively. Pre-pandemic predictors of not seeking healthcare were: female gender, higher BMI, higher comorbidity, poorer self-rated health and depression; non-care seekers were also more likely to report that family or friends were affected by COVID-19 and to have been advised to shield. Not seeking healthcare during lockdown was associated with a higher risk of reporting worsening of physical, but not mental, health during the later phase of the pandemic. In this cohort, those with generally poorer health were disproportionately more likely to not seek healthcare during lockdown, which may potentially exacerbate pre-existing inequalities and lead to longer-term health consequences.","D'Angelo, Bevilacqua, Bloom, Ntani, Walker-Bone","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013271","20221028","COVID-19; health seeking behaviour; healthcare utilisation; mental health; middle-aged people; physical health; Adult; Middle Aged; Female; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Communicable Disease Control; Health Services Accessibility; Employment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39942,""
"Validation of the Brief Perceived Positive Lockdown Impact Scale PPLIS-4","Although research showed that positive aspects of the lockdown were perceived during the pandemic, there are no tools to test the positive impact of mandatory social isolation on life. The present study aims to validate a newly developed, brief, four-item perceived positive lockdown impact scale (PPLIS-4). A cross-sectional online survey study was formed among 4370 adults in three samples: Sample 1 consisted of university students from Poland and Ukraine, Sample 2 consisted of Polish university students under 26 (emerging adults), and Sample 3 consisted of Polish and Ukrainian adults above 25 (non-emerging adults). The standardized questionnaire was used for criterion validity to measure life satisfaction (SWLS), perceived stress (PSS-10), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed a one-factor solution in Sample 1 in Polish and Ukrainian university students. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and confirmatory composite analysis (CCA) showed the one-factor structure appropriate for the PPLIS-4 among emerging and non-emerging adults. Criterion validity was also confirmed since the PPLIS-4 was positively related to the SWLS and negatively related to stress, anxiety, and depression. The PPLIS-4 is a short but valid questionnaire to assess the positive aspects of lockdown. The PPLIS-4 can be used during the COVID-19 pandemic to measure some positive effects of changes in lifestyle as an aspect of resilience.","Rogowska, Ochnik, Chilicka, Pavlova, KuÃ…â€ºnierz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013198","20221028","cross-cultural validation study; emerging adults; factor analysis; the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; university students; well-being; Adult; Humans; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39943,""
"The Protective Role of Resilience in the Development of Social Media Addiction in Tertiary Students and Psychometric Properties of the Slovenian Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS)","With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media became one of the most utilized sources of information relating to the disease. With the increased reliance on social media, the risk of excessive use and the development of social media addiction emerges. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Slovenian version of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and to explore how psychological resilience affects social media addiction symptoms directly and indirectly through symptoms of depression, anxiety and mental distress. A large online cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2021 among Slovenian tertiary students (<i>N</i> = 4868). The results showed the high reliability, unidimensionality and criterion validity of the Slovenian Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale. The proposed structural model fit the data well and showed a significant direct positive effect of depression and stress on social media addiction. Moreover, the majority of the negative effects of psychological resilience on social media addiction (87.2%) were indirect, through depression and stress symptoms, whereas resilience had a significantly smaller impact on social media addiction by reducing anxiety symptoms.

"Is This All COVID-19's Fault? A Study on Trainees in One of the Most Affected Italian Cities","Many studies have investigated the state of the health of healthcare workers during the acute period of the pandemic. Yet, few studies have assessed the health of such professionals after the pandemic and in a less dramatic period. This study involved a particular sample represented by residents in anaesthesia-resuscitation and psychiatry at a university in northern Italy particularly affected by the pandemic. The objectives were to investigate some indicators of health and well-being and compare the two groups of trainees. Using Google Forms, the following tests were proposed: the General Health Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory, Subjective Happiness Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, Brief Resilience Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, as well as an ad hoc questionnaire. A qualifying element of the work was the discussion of the results with the trainees. Various strengths have emerged, such as high values of resilience and job satisfaction; a positive assessment of the support received from the work team; an articulate use of coping strategies; and good levels of happiness and satisfaction with life, in both specialities. However, a widespread anxiety also emerged, which appears to be more attributable to concerns about professional evaluation, rather than the pandemic itself. In summary, the trainees seem to have found a fair amount of personal balance, whereas the relationship with the patient seems to be more compromised. In the comparison between specialities, the only significant differences are the levels of depersonalisation and resilience, both of which are higher in anaesthetists.","Manfredi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013136","20221028","COVID-19; anaesthesiaÃ¢â‚¬â€œresuscitation residents; burnout; coping strategies; mental health; psychiatry residents; well-being; Humans; COVID-19; Cities; Burnout, Professional; Pandemics; Health Personnel; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39946,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on the Activity and Mental Health of Older People in Indonesia: A Qualitative Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused detrimental impacts on different population groups throughout the world. This study aimed to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic's mandatory lockdown protocols on individual and social activities and mental health conditions of community-dwelling older people in Jakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative design using one-on-one in-depth interviews was employed to collect data from the participants (<i>n</i> = 24) who were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. Data analysis was guided by the five steps proposed in a qualitative data analysis framework, including familiarisation with the data, identification of a thematic framework, indexing the data, charting the data and mapping and interpreting the data. The findings showed that before the COVID-19 outbreak participants engaged in different kinds of regular individual and social activities. However, the COVID-19 outbreak and its mandatory lockdown protocols significantly influenced both their activities and social life, which led to social disconnection and financial difficulties for them. COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory lockdown protocols, and the disruption of individual and social activities of the participants also caused mental health challenges to them, including feelings of loneliness, loss, sadness, stress, and anger. The findings suggest that there is a need for intervention programs addressing the socio-economic and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on older populations to help them cope with these challenges. Future studies involving large-scale older populations to comprehensively understand COVID-19 impacts on them are recommended.","Fauk, Ernawati, Dent, Asa, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013115","20221028","COVID-19 outbreak; Indonesia; individual and social activities; lockdown protocols; mental health challenges; older people; Humans; Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Indonesia; Communicable Disease Control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39947,""
"The ABC-X's of Stress among US Emerging Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Relationship Quality, Financial Distress, and Mental Health","Many emerging adults have experienced increased financial distress and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and isolation may have amplified the importance of close relationships (especially as parents' influence diminishes during this developmental stage). Using the ABC-X Model to frame our model, we tested whether financial distress (C) mediates the associations between COVID-19 impact (A) and anxiety and depressive symptoms (X), and whether or not romantic relationship quality (B) moderates these indirect associations. Our sample comprised of 1950 U.S. emerging adults in a romantic relationship. Mediation and first-stage moderated mediation were tested using structural equation modeling. Financial distress partially mediated the association between COVID-19 impact and anxiety symptoms and fully mediated the association between COVID-19 impact and depressive symptoms. Strong evidence of moderated mediation was found but in the opposite direction expected: the indirect associations of COVID-19 impact with anxiety and depressive symptoms (through financial distress) were stronger for those in high-quality romantic relationships. The findings may inform policy and practice aimed at optimizing the mental health of emerging adults, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: specifically, alleviating financial distress may improve the mental health of emerging adults, while focusing on the quality of their romantic relationships may not.","LeBaron-Black, Yorgason, Curran, Saxey, Okamoto","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013125","20221028","ABC-X Model; COVID-19 pandemic; emerging adults; financial distress; mental health; moderated mediation; relationship quality; structural equation modeling (SEM); Adult; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Depression; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39948,""

The aim of this study was to assess the mental health of Austrian adolescents in spring 2022, a time during which COVID-19-related restrictions had been significantly lifted. A total of N = 616 students aged between 14 and 20 participated in a cross-sectional survey between April and May 2022 (t2). The prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms was 73% among girls and 44% among boys for depression (PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 11), 57% in girls and 35% in boys for anxiety (GAD-7 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 11), 34% in girls and 21% in boys for sleeping problems (ISI score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 15), and 95% in girls and 81% in boys for experiencing at least moderate stress (PSS-10 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 14). Frequent suicidal ideations were reported by 24% of girls and 12% of boys. These results were compared with the results from a cross-sectional study from February 2021 (t1). To account for differences in covariates between samples, data were propensity score matched before the analysis. Compared with t1, we found an increase among girls regarding clinically relevant symptoms of depression (OR = 1.78), anxiety (OR = 1.34), insomnia (OR = 1.63), and suicidal ideations (OR = 1.96; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05 for all measures).

"Tourism as a Tool in Nature-Based Mental Health: Progress and Prospects Post-Pandemic","The healthcare sector recognises the role of nature in mental health. The tourism sector is equipped to take people to national parks. The conservation sector gains support from visitors. Theoretical frameworks for mental health benefits from nature tourism include: tourism destinations and activities; tourist personalities and life histories; sensory and emotional components of tourist experiences; and intensity and duration of memories. Mental health deteriorated worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recovery of global economic productivity requires immediate, accessible, affordable mental health measures at national scales, and nature-based approaches provide the best option. Different countries have adopted a variety of public, private, or voluntary mechanisms. Some focus on design of activities, others on provision of facilities. Costs and implementation depend on key research questions: marginal benefits of nature tour guides or psychologists compared to self-guided nature experiences; comparisons between repeated brief visits and one-off nature holidays; effects of biodiversity, flagship species, and scenic or wilderness quality; and differences between individuals, depending on personalities, life histories, and mental health status and symptoms.","Buckley, Cooper","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013112","20221028","COVID-19; economics; parks; psychology; tour guide; wellbeing; Humans; Pandemics; Tourism; Mental Health; COVID-19; Travel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39950,""

"Prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Healthcare Workers following the First SARS-CoV Epidemic of 2003: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The world is still in the grip of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, with putative psychological consequences for healthcare workers (HCWs). Exploring the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the first SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003 may inform us of the long-term effects of the actual pandemic, as well as putative influencing factors such as contact with the virus, time effects, or the importance of some sociodemographic data. This information may help us develop efficient preventive strategies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of PTSD in HCWs following the SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Psychinfo, and Web of Science were searched until September 2022. Random-effects meta-analyses were stratified by the time of follow-up. We included 14 studies: 4842 HCWs (32.0 years old, 84% women). The overall prevalence of PTSD was 14% (95CI 10 to 17%). The prevalence of PTSD was 16% (8 to 24%) during the epidemic, 19% (16 to 22%) within 6 months after the epidemic, and 8% (4 to 13%) more than one year after the end of the epidemic. The longest follow-up was three years after the epidemic, with 10% of HCWs with PTSD. Nevertheless, the prevalence of PTSD was significantly lower more than one year after the end of the epidemic than the first six months after the epidemic (Coefficient -10.4, 95CI -17.6 to -3.2, <i>p</i> = 0.007). In conclusion, the prevalence of PTSD in HCWs was high during the first epidemic of SARS-CoV in 2003 and remained high in the long term. The lessons from the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic may help prevent a wave of PTSD following the latest COVID-19 pandemic.","Alberque, Laporte, Mondillon, Baker, Mermillod, Brousse, Ugbolube, Bagheri, Bouillon-Minois, Dutheil","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192013069","20221028","infection; mental health; occupation; predictive strategy; public health; Female; Humans; Adult; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; COVID-19; Prevalence; Health Personnel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39952,""
"Psychological Resilience and Adverse Mental Health Issues in the Thai Population during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the enormous amount of uncertainty caused by it, mental health issues have become a great concern. Evidence regarding the effects of psychological resilience on the Thai population is scarce. We evaluated psychological resilience during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with the risk of mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and health-related well-being. This cross-sectional study was a part of the HOME-COVID-19 project, which conducted an online survey of 4004 members of the general population in Thailand using the Brief Resilience Coping Scale. Logistic regression was performed to identify the association between psychological resilience and mental health issues and well-being. Groups with prevalence rates of 43.9%, 39.2%, and 16.9% were classified as low, moderate, and high resilient copers, respectively. Using high resilient copers as a reference group, the low resilient copers had a higher chance of having mental health adversities. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-2.56; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) for depression, 2.13 (95% CI, 1.45-3.14; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) for anxiety, 4.61 (95% CI, 3.30-6.45; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) for perceived stress, and 3.18 (95% CI, 2.31-4.38; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) for low well-being. For the medium resilient copers, only low well-being was found to be statistically significant (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.16-2.20; <i>p</i> = 0.004).

"Social Stigma and Depression among Asymptomatic COVID-19 Carriers in Shanghai, China: The Mediating Role of Entrapment and Decadence","Since the advent of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the coexistence between social stigma and depression symptoms (depression hereafter) in COVID-19 patients has been mentioned, but the mechanisms involved remains unclear. This study aimed to explore how the stigma affects depression during the mid-pandemic period. A cross-sectional survey using non-probability sampling was conducted among asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in Shanghai, China (April 2022). An online questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographic characteristics and psychological traits. Logistic regression and path analysis were performed to analyze the depression risk factors and examine the mediation model, respectively. A total of 1283 participants (59.6% men) were involved in this study, in which 44.7% of carriers reported having depression. Univariate analyses found that education level (OR 0.575; 95% CI 0.448-0.737) and doses of vaccine (OR 1.693; 95% CI 1.042-2.750), were significantly associated with depression among asymptomatic carriers.

"Analysis of Strategies for Managing Stress by Polish Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is having a negative impact on the mental health of nurses around the world. The aim of the study was to assess the sense of fear and the degree of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to estimate the influence of various factors on the fear of SARS-CoV-2. We analysed methods and strategies for coping with stress used by Polish nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using a diagnostic survey, which included a self-constructed questionnaire and a standardized psychological questionnaire: Brief-Cope. A total of 361 nurses confirmed their participation in the study. Most of the nurses were ages 31 to 50 (48.2%), lived in a city (83.7%), and had a master's degree in nursing (45.7%). Nurses Ã¢â€°Â¥ 51 years of age, with Ã¢â€°Â¥ 21 years of work experience and with secondary education in nursing and master of nursing were more likely than other nurses to agree with the statement, <i>I am afraid of contracting the SARS-CoV-2</i> (appropriately <i>p</i> = 0.009, <i>p</i> = 0.007, <i>p</i> = 0.014). During the outbreak of COVID-19, nurses most often took action to improve the situation, reflecting on and planning what to do. The most frequent means of coping with stress by Polish nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak were problem-focused strategies.

"Enhanced Patient-Centricity: How the Biopharmaceutical Industry Is Optimizing Patient Care through AI/ML/DL","Technologies utilizing cutting-edge methodologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), present powerful opportunities to help evaluate, predict, and improve patient outcomes by drawing insights from real-world data (RWD) generated during medical care. They played a role during and following the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by helping protect healthcare providers, prioritize care for vulnerable populations, predict disease trends, and find optimal therapies. Potential applications across therapeutic areas include diagnosis, disease management and patient journey mapping. Use of fit-for-purpose datasets for ML models is seeing growth and may potentially help additional enterprises develop AI strategies. However, biopharmaceutical companies often face specific challenges, including multi-setting data, system interoperability, data governance, and patient privacy requirements. There remains a need for evolving regulatory frameworks, operating models, and data governance to enable further developments and additional research. We explore recent literature and examine the hurdles faced by researchers in the biopharmaceutical industry to fully realize the promise of AI/ML/DL for patient-centric purposes.","Zou, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101997","20221027","Coronavirus Disease 2019; artificial intelligence; biopharmaceutical industry; data science; deep learning; digital innovation; machine learning; patient-centricity; randomized controlled trials; real-world data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39959,""
"""Pandemic Fatigue! It's Been Going On since March 2020"": A Photovoice Study of the Experiences of BIPOC Older Adults and Frontline Healthcare Workers during the Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic intensified the stressful and already difficult circumstances of communities of color. Yet, there is no current photovoice research highlighting the lived experiences of these communities from two perspectives-the older adults (OAs) and the frontline healthcare workers (FLHWs). This qualitative study used photovoice to visually portray the struggles of Black, Indigenous, and persons of color (BIPOC) OAs (<i>n</i> = 7) and younger FLHWs (<i>n</i> = 5) who worked with older adults during the pandemic and how they coped and recovered from the challenges of the pandemic. The investigators conducted a three-day training of ten research assistants (RAs) who were paired with either an OA or an FLHW for the photovoice sessions conducted in four stages. Upon examination of the narratives, focus group transcriptions, and photo stories, it became clear that participants faced different challenges during the pandemic, such as the fear of COVID-19 exposure, struggles to adopt COVID-19 mitigation strategies, workplace challenges, and social isolation. Amid this crisis of suffering, isolation, and sadness, participants employed two major strategies to deal with the challenges of the pandemic: positive reappraisal and self-care practices. The findings have implications for clinical social workers, mental health counselors, faith communities, nurse managers and administrators, and policymakers.","Ekwonye, Malek, Chonyi, Nguyen, Ponce-Diaz, Lau Haller, Farah, Hearst","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101967","20221027","BIPOC frontline healthcare workers; BIPOC older adults; challenges; pandemic fatigue; self-care practices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39960,""
"Depression, Anxiety, Stress and Anger of the Cabin Crew during the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea","This study examines the levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and state and trait anger of cabin crews, as well as the differences in the main variables and general characteristics between the depression and anxiety groups, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive cross-sectional study used data from 161 Korean cabin crew members. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-tests, and chi-square tests. Of the participants, 62.7% were women, and 52.2% and 46.6% were classified into the depression and anxiety groups, respectively. No differences in the general characteristics between the non-depression and depression groups were found. However, in the anxiety group, there were significant differences in age, marital status, position, and work type during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the anxiety group showed a higher anger state (approximately 6.76 times higher than the normal group) than the depression group (approximately 4.90 times higher than the normal group). In a pandemic, airlines should screen cabin crews for depression and anxiety. The development and applications of mental health education for high-risk groups should include anger intervention.","Jeong, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101952","20221027","anger; anxiety; depression; flight attendant; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39961,""
"Decision Conflicts in Clinical Care during COVID-19: A Multi-Perspective Inquiry","<b>Background:</b> The early COVID-19-pandemic was characterized by changes in decision making, decision-relevant value systems and the related perception of decisional uncertainties and conflicts resulting in decisional burden and stress. The vulnerability of clinical care professionals to these decisional dilemmas has not been characterized yet. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional questionnaire study (540 patients, 322 physicians and 369 nurses in 11 institutions throughout Germany) was carried out. The inclusion criterion was active involvement in clinical treatment or decision making in oncology or psychiatry during the first year of COVID-19. The questionnaires covered five decision dimensions (conflicts and uncertainty, resources, risk perception, perception of consequences for clinical processes, and the perception of consequences for patients). Data analysis was performed using ANOVA, Pearson rank correlations, and the ChiÃ‚Â²-test, and for inferential analysis, nominal logistic regression and tree classification were conducted. <b>Results:</b> Professionals reported changes in clinical management (27.5%) and a higher workload (29.2%), resulting in decisional uncertainty (19.2%) and decisional conflicts (22.7%), with significant differences between professional groups (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.005), including anxiety, depression, loneliness and stress in professional subgroups (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Nominal regression analysis targeting ""Decisional Uncertainty"" provided a highly significant prediction model (LQ <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) containing eight variables, and the analysis for ""Decisional Conflicts"" included six items. The classification rates were 64.4% and 92.7%, respectively. Tree analysis confirmed three levels of determinants. <b>Conclusions:</b> Decisional uncertainty and conflicts during the COVID-19 pandemic were independent of the actual pandemic load. Vulnerable professional groups for the perception of a high number of decisional dilemmas were characterized by individual perception and the psychological framework. Coping and management strategies should target vulnerability, enable the handling of the individual perception of decisional dilemmas and ensure information availability and specific support for younger professionals.","Haier, Beller, Adorjan, Bleich, de Greck, Griesinger, Heppt, Hurlemann, Mees, Philipsen, Rohde, Schilling, Trautmann, Combs, Geyer, Schaefers","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101914","20221027","COVID-19; decision conflicts; moral distress; oncology; psychiatry; uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39962,""
"Association between Mental Health and Hand Hygiene Practices in Adults with Hypertension and Diabetes during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The 2020 Korea Community Health Survey","The preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 have negatively impacted the mental health of people with chronic diseases. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between mental health and hand hygiene practices in patients with hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (n = 74,296) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their anxiety about contracting COVID-19 and death, depression, and hand hygiene practices were compared to that of controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the patients had higher anxiety and depression and poorer hand hygiene practices than controls. Anxiety about contracting COVID-19 was associated with increased handwashing before eating (aOR = 1.59), after using the restroom (aOR = 1.61), after returning from outdoors (aOR = 1.69), for at least 30 s (aOR = 1.45), and with soap or hand sanitizer (aOR = 1.43). However, depression was associated with decreased handwashing before eating (aOR = 0.50), after using the restroom (aOR = 0.51), after returning from outdoors (aOR = 0.51), for at least 30 s (aOR = 0.73), and with soap or hand sanitizer (aOR = 0.63).

The purpose of our study was to examine the presence and frequency of psycho-emotional disorders and cognitive deficits in students who recovered from mild form of COVID-19. A total of 40 COVID-19 survivors and 25 healthy controls participated in our study. We assessed three core cognitive functions (inhibition, working memory, task-switching), reaction time and motor speed.

"The Effectiveness of Physical Activity Interventions on Depression in Korea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Korea has ranked first in the OECD, with a prevalence of 36.8% of depression. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the effect size of physical activity as an alternative tool for depression symptoms using meta-analysis. A meta-analysis on depressive symptoms was performed on 18 studies published in Korean domestic journals. The moderating variables hypothesized in this study included age groups of participants; depressive symptoms; and frequency, intensity, time, type, and duration of the intervention. The overall effect size of physical activity on depression was moderate (0.56 [95% CI: 0.39 to 0.91]). Specifically, physical activity was slightly more effective in reducing depression in participants with an 18-64 age group compared to older people over 65 years old, while it was most effective for participants without depressive symptoms compared to participants with mild and severe symptoms. Further, the subgroup analysis revealed that performing two times a week for 30 to 60 min with progressive intensity for 1-8 weeks may be the most effective for Koreans. The results of this study can provide guidelines for the most effective physical activity program for Koreans.","Lee, Kim, Cho","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101886","20221027","depression; exercise; mental health; physical activity; quality of life; randomized controlled trials","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39965,""
"Pregnancy, Mental Well-Being and Lockdown: A Nationwide Online Survey in France","The objective of this study was to compare the mental well-being of French women who were and were not pregnant during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We performed a nationwide online quantitative survey including all women between 18 and 45 years of age during the second and third weeks of global lockdown (25 March-7 April 2020). The main outcome measure was mental well-being measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). This study analysed 275 responses from pregnant women and compared them with those from a propensity score-matched sample of 825 non-pregnant women. In this French sample, the median WEMWBS score was 49.0 and did not differ by pregnancy status. Women living in urban areas reported better well-being, while those with sleep disorders or who spent more than an hour a day watching the news reported poorer well-being. During the first lockdown in France, women had relatively low mental well-being scores, with no significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women. More than ever, health-care workers need to find a way to maintain their support for women's well-being. Minor daily annoyances of pregnancy, such as insomnia, should not be trivialised because they are a potential sign of poor well-being.","Gaucher, Barasinski, Dupont, Razurel, Pichon, Leavy, Viaux-Savelon, Cortet, Franck, Haesebaert, Haesebaert","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101855","20221027","mental health; pandemic; pregnant women; quarantine; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39966,""
"Implementing the STEADY Wellness Program to Support Healthcare Workers throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an ongoing threat to the mental wellbeing of countless individuals worldwide, with healthcare workers at particularly high risk. We developed the STEADY staff wellness program prior to the pandemic based on the available literature and input from stakeholders, guided by the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Implementation Science Framework. We quickly adapted the STEADY program for implementation in selected high-need units within Canada's largest trauma hospital during the pandemic's first wave. This brief report describes implementation of the STEADY program, retroactively applying the structure of the Knowledge-to-Action Implementation Science Framework to the practical steps taken. We identified the importance of more frequent, shorter contact with HCWs that occurred in-person, with an emphasis on peer support. A flexible approach with strong support from hospital leadership were key facilitators. Our findings suggest that a flexible approach to practical program implementation, theoretically underpinned in best-practices, can result in an acceptable program that promotes increased HCW wellbeing during a pandemic.","Korman, Steinberg, Gagliardi, Stewart, Acero, Davies, Maunder, Walker, DasGupta, DiProspero, Sinyor, Ellis","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101830","20221027","COVID-19; healthcare worker; implementation science; mental health; occupational stress; staff wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39967,""
"Alzheimer's Disease and SARS-CoV-2: Pathophysiological Analysis and Social Context","The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a challenge for healthcare systems, especially in terms of the care of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Age is one of the major risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19, most probably due to the presence of comorbidities and inflammations. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 invades nerve endings and olfactory nerves through the binding of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This interaction triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in cognitive impairment. In turn, the isoform of apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE-4ÃŽÂµ) in AD is a risk factor for increased neuroinflammation through microglia activation, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. AD and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with increases in levels of inflammatory markers, as well as increases in levels of APOE-4ÃŽÂµ, ACE2 and oxidative stress. Thus, there is a synergistic relationship between AD and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the social isolation and other health measures resulting from the pandemic have led to a higher level of anxiety and depression among AD patients, a situation which may lead to a decline in cognitive function. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies for keeping the patient calm but active.","Ortiz, VelÃƒÂ¡zquez-Brizuela, Ortiz-VelÃƒÂ¡zquez, Ocampo-Alfaro, Salazar-Flores, Delgado-Lara, Torres-Sanchez","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12101405","20221027","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; inflammation; neurodegeneration; social behavior; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39968,""
"Sleep Quality Mediates the Effect of Sensitization-Associated Symptoms, Anxiety, and Depression on Quality of Life in Individuals with Post-COVID-19 Pain","A better understanding of biological and emotional variables associated with health-related quality of life in people with long-COVID is needed. Our aim was to identify potential direct and indirect effects on the relationships between sensitization-associated symptoms, mood disorders such as anxiety/depressive levels, and sleep quality on health-related quality of life in people suffering from post-COVID-19 pain. One hundred and forty-six individuals who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic and suffering from long-term post-COVID-19 pain completed different patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including clinical features, symptoms associated with sensitization of the central nervous system (Central Sensitization Inventory), mood disorders (Hospital Anxiety and Depressive Scale), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and health-related quality of life (paper-based five-level version of EuroQol-5D) in a face-to-face interview conducted at 18.8 (SD 1.8) months after hospitalization. Different mediation models were conducted to assess the direct and indirect effects of the associations among the different variables. The mediation models revealed that sensitization-associated symptoms and depressive levels directly affected health-related quality of life; however, these effects were not statistically significant when sleep quality was included. In fact, the effect of sensitization-associated symptomatology on quality of life (ÃŽÂ² = -0.10, 95% CI -0.1736, -0.0373), the effect of depressive levels on quality of life (ÃŽÂ²= -0.09, 95% CI -0.1789, -0.0314), and the effect of anxiety levels on quality of life (ÃŽÂ² = -0.09, 95% CI -0.1648, -0.0337) were all indirectly mediated by sleep quality. This study revealed that sleep quality mediates the relationship between sensitization-associated symptoms and mood disorders (depressive/anxiety levels) with health-related quality of life in individuals who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at the first wave of the pandemic and reporting post-COVID-19 pain. Longitudinal studies will help to determine the clinical implications of these findings.","Pacho-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃƒÂ±as, Fuensalida-Novo, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Antona, Ortega-Santiago, CigarÃƒÂ¡n-Mendez","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12101363","20221027","anxiety; depression; post-COVID-19; quality of life; sensitization; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39969,""
"Neuroticism and Conscientiousness Moderate the Effect of Oral Medication Beliefs on Adherence of People with Mental Illness during the Pandemic","After the declaration of the pandemic status in several countries, the continuity of face-to-face visits in psychiatric facilities has been delayed or even interrupted to reduce viral spread. Little is known about the personality factors associated with medication beliefs and adherence amongst individuals with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This brief report describes a preliminary naturalistic longitudinal study that explored whether the Big Five personality traits prospectively moderate the effects of medication beliefs on changes in adherence during the pandemic for a group of outpatients with psychosis or bipolar disorder. Thirteen outpatients undergoing routine face-to-face follow-up assessments during the pandemic were included (41 observations overall) and completed the Revised Italian Version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8-item and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Participants had stronger concerns about their psychiatric medications rather than beliefs about their necessity, and adherence to medications was generally low. Participants who had more necessity beliefs than concerns had better adherence to medications. People scoring higher in Conscientiousness and Neuroticism traits and more concerned about the medication side effects had poorer adherence. These preliminary data suggest the importance of a careful assessment of the adherence to medications amongst people with psychosis/bipolar disorder during the pandemic. Interventions aimed to improve adherence might focus on patients' medication beliefs and their Conscientiousness and Neuroticism personality traits.","Ferretti, Goracci, Laurenzi, Centola, Crecchi, De Luca, Monzillo, Guidi, Sinigaglia, Gualtieri, Lorenzi, Cuomo, Bolognesi, Travagli, Coluccia, Fagiolini, Pozza","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12101315","20221027","Big Five personality; COVID-19 pandemic; adherence; beliefs about medications; mental disorders; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39970,""
"Eccentric Training in Pulmonary Rehabilitation of Post-COVID-19 Patients: An Alternative for Improving the Functional Capacity, Inflammation, and Oxidative Stress","The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight the oxidative stress induced in COVID-19 patients (SARS-CoV-2 infection), describe longstanding functional impairments, and provide the pathophysiologic rationale that supports aerobic eccentric (ECC) exercise as a novel alternative to conventional concentric (CONC) exercise for post-COVID-19 patients. Patients who recovered from moderate-to-severe COVID-19 respiratory distress demonstrate long-term functional impairment. During the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 induces the generation of reactive oxygen species that can be amplified to a ""cytokine storm"". The resultant inflammatory and oxidative stress process causes organ damage, particularly in the respiratory system, with the lungs as the tissues most susceptible to injury. The acute illness often requires a long-term hospital stay and consequent sarcopenia. Upon discharge, muscle weakness compounded by limited lung and cardiac function is often accompanied by dyspnea, myalgia, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Consequently, these patients could benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), with exercise as a critical intervention (including sessions of strength and endurance or aerobic exercises). Unfortunately, conventional CONC exercises induce significant cardiopulmonary stress and increase inflammatory and oxidative stress (OS) when performed at moderate/high intensity, which can exacerbate debilitating dyspnoea and muscle fatigue post-COVID-19. Eccentric training (ECC) is a well-tolerated alternative that improves muscle mass while mitigating cardiopulmonary stress in patients with COPD and other chronic diseases. Similar benefits could be realized in post-COVID-19 patients. Consequently, these patients could benefit from PR with exercise as a critical intervention.","Contreras-BriceÃƒÂ±o, Espinosa-RamÃƒÂ­rez, Rozenberg, Reid","https://doi.org/10.3390/biology11101446","20221027","exercise; physical activity; post-COVID-19; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39971,""
"COVID-19 vaccination coverage among patients with psychiatric disorders in China during the pandemic: a cross-sectional study","To investigate the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination coverage and the influential factors of vaccination among patients with mental disorders, we conducted a cross-sectional study in China. The anonymous questionnaires including demographic data, vaccination status, intention to be vaccinated and its reasons were collected in the Second Xiangya Hospital, one of the biggest four psychiatric centers in China. Mental health of these participants were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7). The influential factors associated with vaccination status were analyzed by Fisher exact tests and binary logistical analysis. 1328 patients and 922 family members completed the survey. The vaccination rate of patients included was 69.4%, whereas 85.5% patients were willing to be vaccinated. Being hospitalized (aOR 0.41, 95% CI:0.27-0.60), suffering from schizophrenia (aOR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.19-0.75) and secondary school educational background (aOR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.93) were significantly associated with less likelihood to get vaccinated. Uptaking vaccines could reduce depressive (aOR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.98) or anxious symptoms (aOR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25-0.63) in these patients for a short period.

"Psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy assessed in a four-waves survey","COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health and well-being (WB) of citizens. This cross-sectional study included 4 waves of data collection aimed at identifying profiles of individuals with different levels of WB. The study included a representative stratified sample of 10,013 respondents in Italy. The WHO 5-item well-being scale (WHO-5) was used for the assessment of WB. Different supervised machine learning approaches (multinomial logistic regression, partial least-square discriminant analysis-PLS-DA-, classification tree-CT-) were applied to identify individual characteristics with different WB scores, first in waves 1-2 and, subsequently, in waves 3 and 4. Forty-one percent of participants reported ""Good WB"", 30% ""Poor WB"", and 28% ""Depression"". Findings carried out using multinomial logistic regression show that Resilience was the most important variable able for discriminating the WB across all waves. Through the PLS-DA, Increased Unhealthy Behaviours proved to be the more important feature in the first two waves, while Financial Situation gained most relevance in the last two. COVID-19 Perceived Risk was relevant, but less than the other variables, across all waves. Interestingly, using the CT we were able to establish a cut-off for Resilience (equal to 4.5) that discriminated good WB with a probability of 65% in wave 4. Concluding, we found thatÃ‚Â COVID-19 had negative implications for WB.

In wave 7 (wave 8; wave 9), 23.8% (22.0%; 24.3%) of all respondents had probable depression and 22.6% (22.1%; 23.7%) had probable anxiety. These prevalence rates substantially differed between the European countries. Regressions showed that emerging difficulties with the income were associated with both increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. An increase in one's own perceived risk of getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2, the birth of a child and an increase in the Covid-19 stringency index were associated with increases in depressive symptoms. The significance of probable depression and anxiety during later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in eight European countries was highlighted. Avoiding income difficulties may also contribute to mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114902","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39974,""
"A mixed-methods study on psychodrama treatment for PTSD and depression in inpatient substance use treatment: A comparison of outcomes pre-pandemic and during Covid-19","This mixed-methods research study (nÂ =Â 68) examines the effectiveness of psychodrama as a treatment for depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at an inpatient drug and alcohol treatment center. The primary goal of this study was to examine treatment effectiveness, however the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic occurred during data collection which provided us with an opportunity to compare psychodramaâ€™s effectiveness pre-pandemic and during-pandemic with masks and social distancing. Results suggest psychodrama psychotherapy effectively decreases depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms while supporting participants recovery from addiction. Treatment effects were similar between the pre-pandemic cohort and the cohort during the pandemic. Participants in the psychodrama groups experienced more significant decreases in depression than patients in the inpatient program who did not participate in the psychodrama group. Findings also demonstrate clinically meaningful changes in PTSD which is also supported by qualitative survey responses. Furthermore, this study appears to be the first supporting the effectiveness of psychodrama implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic with masks, social distancing, and other limitations. The overall findings of this study contribute to the growing psychodrama literature base while supporting evidence of psychodramaâ€™s effectiveness in reducing depression and PTSD.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2022.101971","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-28","",39975,""
