"THE IMPACT OF ROUTINES ON EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFICULTIES IN CHILDREN AND ON PARENTAL ANXIETY DURING COVID-19","Aims and hypothesis. We hypothesised that there would be an association between maintaining a routine during lockdown and both lower emotional and behavioural difficulties in children and lower parental anxiety. We also hypothesised that children of keyworker parents would have fewer emotional and behavioural symptoms due to having maintained more normal routines. Background. The Covid-19 pandemic and related public health measures have impacted on mental health of children. Methods. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to explore associations between maintaining a routine, and emotional and behavioural difficulties in children, using linear regression models. We included measures of parental anxiety. We separately explored associations with having a keyworker parent. We used the Carey Infant Temperament Questionnaire and the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children to establish levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Results. 289 parents completed questionnaires about their 411 children. Keeping a routine was associated with emotional and behavioural difficulty scores 5.0 points lower (95% CI -10.0 to -0.1), p=0.045 than not keeping a routine. Parents who reported keeping a routine had anxiety scores 4.3 points lower (95% CI -7.5 to -1.1), p=0.009 than those who did not. Children of keyworkers tended to have lower emotional and behavioural difficulty scores (-3.1 (95%CI -6.26 to 0.08), p=0.056) than children of non-keyworkers. All models were adjusted for relevant potential confounders. Conclusion. Maintaining a routine may be beneficial for both child emotional wellbeing and parental anxiety, although it is also possible that lower parental anxiety levels made maintaining a routine easier. Being the child of a keyworker parent during lockdown may have been protective for child emotional wellbeing.","Vera Lees; Rosie Hay; Helen Bould; Alex Siu Fung Kwong; Daniel Smith; Daphne Kounali; Rebecca Pearson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.25.22272950","20220325","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28970,""
"Risk factors and preventive interventions for post Covid-19 condition: systematic reviews","Background: The Covid-19 outbreak has presented many challenges to governments and healthcare systems, including observations of symptoms that persist beyond acute infection labelled as post Covid-19 condition. Objectives: To systematically identify and synthesize evidence around pre-existing and clinical risk factors for post Covid-19 condition (occurring [&ge;]12 weeks after positive test/symptom onset) (KQ1), and interventions during the acute and post-acute phases of the illness that could potentially prevent post Covid-19 condition (KQ2). Methods: We searched Medline and Embase (Jan 2021-Aug 12 2021 [KQ1], and Jan 2020-Jul 28, 2021 [KQ2]), Clinicaltrials.gov, organizational websites, and reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles against a priori inclusion criteria, and disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. One investigator abstracted data and assessed risk of bias using design-specific criteria, and a second investigator checked data abstraction and assessments for completeness and accuracy. Meta-analysis was performed when there was sufficient clinical and methodological similarity in an exposure-outcome comparison, based on prespecified variables. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE). A relative effect/association of 0.75-1.49 was considered as little-to-no, whereas 0.50-0.74/1.5-1.99 was small-to-moderate and <0.50/[&ge;]2.00 was large for fewer/benefit or more/harm, respectively Results: From 4,672 (KQ1) and 3,781 (KQ2) citations we included 17 and 18 studies, though 4 studies were included for both KQs. We found small-to-moderate associations between female sex and higher non-recovery, fatigue, and dyspnea (moderate certainty). Severe or critical acute-phase Covid-19 severity (versus not) has probably (moderate certainty) a large association with increased cognitive impairment, a small-to-moderate association with more non-recovery, and a little-to-no association with dyspnea. There may be (low certainty) large associations between hospitalization during the acute illness and increased non-recovery, increased dyspnea, and reduced return to work. There may be small-to-moderate associations between several other risk factors and post Covid-19 condition outcomes, including age [&ge;]60 versus <60 (functional incapacity), non-White people (lower return to work), children age >6 versus <2 years (non-recovery), having [&ge;]1 versus no comorbidities (non-recovery), chronic pulmonary disease (fatigue), rheumatologic disorder (depression/anxiety), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypertension (cognitive impairment). Several other risk factors had low certainty for little-to-no association with one or more outcomes (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease) or very low certainty. Interventions to prevent post Covid-19 condition included medications (standard and traditional/ayurvedic), stem cell therapy, rehabilitation or similar therapies, and screening/referrals at either acute phase (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or early post-acute phase (4-8 week), with short (12-16 weeks) or longer (>16 weeks) follow-up for outcomes. We are very uncertain about the effects of preventive interventions, mainly due to risk of bias, inconsistency/lack of consistency (single studies), and in some cases imprecision. Conclusions: Guidelines in relation to surveillance, screening services, and other services such as access to sickness and disability benefits, might need to focus on females and those with previously severe Covid-19 illness. Interventions targeting fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive impairment (especially in those who had severe Covid-19) may be good to prioritize for development and evaluation to provide evidence on their effects. Inputs from patients and primary care providers should be taken into account when developing new care pathways and some tailoring to individual needs will likely be paramount. Continuous assessment of the rapidly emerging evidence is important to better shape our understanding as the body of evidence grows. Sufficiently powered prospective trials of preventive interventions are warranted.

"Tracking population mental health before and across stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in young adults","The SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with worsening mental health. Longitudinal studies have monitored changes in mental health from pre-pandemic levels, identifying critical points for mental health as COVID-19 restrictions evolve. Here we highlight changes in depression and anxiety in the UK from pre-pandemic across four pandemic occasions: April and June 2020, January, and July 2021 - corresponding to changes in COVID-19 restrictions. Data were from >5,000 27-29 year olds from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We found that anxiety almost doubled throughout the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels and remained high until July 2021 when COVID-19 restrictions were fully lifted. Depression was lower than pre-pandemic levels in April 2020 but increased as the pandemic evolved until July 2021. Women, those with existing mental/physical health conditions and those with economic hardship were most at risk of sustained poorer mental health across the pandemic. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal studies for tracking mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and across virus suppression policy changes.","Alex Siu Fung Kwong; Kate Northstone; Rebecca M Pearson; Andrew M McIntosh; Nicholas J Timpson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.24.22272899","20220325","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28972,""
"PROTOCOL: Mobile apps to reduce depressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth: A systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundDepressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth doubled in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created sustained disruption in society, schools, and universities, including increasing poverty and discrimination. Public health restrictions have caused isolation and reduced social and emotional support. Together, these factors make depressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth a global public health emergency. Mobile applications (apps) have emerged as potentially scalable intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth that could meet increased demands for mental health resources. Mobile apps may potentially reduce psychological distress with accessible technology-based mental health resources.ObjectivesThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effect of mobile apps on depressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth.Search MethodsWe will develop a systematic search strategy in collaboration with an experienced librarian. We will search a series of databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL) from January 2008 to July 2021.Selection CriteriaFollowing the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent reviewers will identify eligible studies: randomized controlled trials on mobile apps for the management of depressive disorders (depression and anxiety) and alcohol use in youth aged 15â€“24 years of age.Data Collection and AnalysisEligible studies will be assessed for risk of bias, and outcomes pooled, when appropriate, for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity, if present, will be examined for gender. ethnicity, and socioeconomic status contributions. A narrative synthesis will highlight similarities and differences between the included studies.

"Behavioral problems of pediatric patients recovered from COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting lives around the globe. Previous studies on COVID-19 mainly focused on epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of patients with confirmed infection. Little attention has been paid to the follow-up of recovered patients. As a vulnerable population to adverse events, the health status of the COVID-19 recovered pediatric patients is of great concern. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral problems among pediatric patients recovered from the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Methods A total of 122 children who were suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospitalized for treatment were enrolled in the study between April 2020 and May 2020 in Wuhan, China. We collected related information about hospitalization and discharge of the children and emotional symptoms of their parents through electronic medical records and questionnaire. The behavioral problems of children were examined by applying the parent-reported the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results The participant children were discharged from hospital after about two months. Among them, 76 (62%) were boys, and the mean age was 6.71Â years old. The highest prevalence of behavioral problems among pediatric children with COVID-19 was for prosocial behavior (15%), followed by total difficulties (13%), emotional symptoms (11%), hyperactivity (10%), conduct problems (9%), and peer problems (1%). With regarding to their parents, 26% reported having symptoms of anxiety and 23% as having symptoms of depression. The scores of SDQ were higher in those children whose parents have emotional problems compared to parents without. Conclusion Long-term follow up studies on the psychological and behavioral problems of COVID-19 recovered children and their parents are warranted.","Xiao, Han, Liu, Qi, Mei, Hong, Xue, Qi, Cai, Xiaonan, Xie, Xinyan, Xia, Zhiguo, Zhou, Yu, Li, Hui, Zhu, Kaiheng, Wan, Zihao, Liu, Zhisheng, Song, Ranran","https://www.google.com/search?q=Behavioral+problems+of+pediatric+patients+recovered+from+COVID-19+in+Wuhan,+China","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta psychologica;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28976,""

"Binge drinking in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: prevalence, correlates and association with preventive behaviors","Background There is some evidence that alcohol use may have changed during the coronavirus pandemic. However, as yet, there has been comparatively little focus on heavy/excessive drinking. This study examined binge drinking (BD) in Japan during the coronavirus pandemic and its association with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Method Data were analyzed from an online sample of 1452 individuals aged 18 and above that were collected one year after the beginning of the pandemic. Self-reported information was obtained on current and pre-pandemic BD and a range of sociodemographic and health-related variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations. Results Just under one-third of the sample (29.3%) reported past-month BD. More individuals reduced rather than increased BD during the pandemic (11.5 &gt; 6.5%). Worsening household finances and depressive symptoms were associated with both current and increased BD, while young age (18-29) was linked to both increased and decreased BD. Individuals who binged reported significantly lower odds for engaging in several COVID-19 preventive behaviors including wearing a mask (odds ratio [OR]: 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.76), hand washing (OR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.44-0.76) and avoiding crowds/staying at home (OR:0.72, 95%CI: 0.55-0.93). Conclusion BD is prevalent in Japan during the coronavirus pandemic and associated with poorer adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Increasing public awareness of the potentially detrimental effects of heavy alcohol use during the ongoing pandemic is now a public health priority.","Stickley, Andrew, Shirama, Aya, Inagawa, Takamu, Sumiyoshi, Tomiki","https://www.google.com/search?q=Binge+drinking+in+Japan+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+prevalence,+correlates+and+association+with+preventive+behaviors","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug and alcohol dependence;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28980,""

"HOW TO TREAT: COVID-19 in primary care","Other key aspects of monitoring include: * A clinician who knows the patient and has access to their regular health records, evidence-based resources to guide monitoring, and a template for systematic monitoring and recording. * A systematic approach to ensure no one falls through the cracks, and a clinic-wide team approach so all staff understand the system and their roles in it. * Patient access to a pulse oximeter;where risk indicates need;and information for patients on illness course, red flags, safety net systems and self-management strategies. * Understanding of local access to support for basic needs (food, shelter, communication). Monitoring Beyond initial set-up and triage for current red flags, there are four main aspects to monitoring patients with COVID-19 in primary care: risk assessment and determining monitoring frequency;assessment of current symptoms and change from previous;assessment of current vital signs and oxygen saturation, and changes in these from recent;hydration and assessment for red flags indicating the patient should be transferred to hospital for further assessment. If not transferred, such patients should be monitored as high risk: * is socially isolated (lives alone, unable to connect with others through technology, little to no social network) * lacks caregiver support, if needed (including a safe environment for care of children) * is unable to maintain hydration (diarrhoea, vomiting, cognitive impairment, poor fluid intake) * has food or financial insecurity * receives home-care support * has challenges with health literacy or ability to understand treatment recommendations or isolation expectations * is unable to self-manage. Other important goals of monitoring are to reassure patients who do not need hospital-level care and to provide education on illness course, safety net instructions, advice on symptom management and attention to mental health impacts of a positive diagnosis (a positive diagnosis is anxiety-provoking for anyone, and particularly for those who are aware they are at greater risk).","Mangin, Dee","https://www.google.com/search?q=HOW+TO+TREAT:+COVID-19+in+primary+care","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Kai Tiaki : Nursing New Zealand;: 1-21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28986,""

Methods An online cross-sectional survey was administered from October to November 2020 involving people who were living in Seoul, aged 19 years or above, under a 2-week mandatory quarantine. Their mental health status was measured using the Patient Health Questionnares-9 (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Overall, 1,135 respondents were finally included, resulting in a 22.0% response rate. After controlling for potential confounders, variables, such as the â€œsecond half of quarantine periodâ€ (OR = 1.78 95% CI: 1.10â€“2.88), â€œfemaleâ€ (OR = 1.91 95% CI: 1.16â€“3.16), and â€œhaving pre-existing depressionâ€ (OR = 8.03 95% CI: 2.96â€“21.78) were significantly associated with depression while being quarantined. Those with correct knowledge about the rationale behind for the quarantine (OR = 0.39 95% CI: 0.21â€“0.72), an understanding of quarantine rules (OR = 0.68 95%CI: 0.52â€“0.91), and those who felt supported by others (OR = 0.74 95% CI: 0.55â€“0.99) were less likely to develop depression while quarantining. Similarly, anxiety was significantly associated with the second week (OR = 4.18 95% CI: 1.44â€“12.09), those with an unstable job status (OR = 3.95 95% CI: 1.60â€“9.79), perceived support (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45â€“0.96), and the fear of being infected (OR = 7.22 95% CI: 1.04â€“49.95). Conclusions This study highlights the need to develop precautionary measures to prevent depression and anxiety among people undergoing COVID-19 quarantine. In particular, individuals with depression prior to quarantine should be carefully monitored during the quarantine. Further studies with larger populations are needed.","Kwon, Hye-Young, Kim, Yongjoo, Lee, Seung-Young","https://www.google.com/search?q=What+Matters+for+Depression+and+Anxiety+During+the+COVID-19+Quarantine?:+Results+of+an+Online+Cross-Sectional+Survey+in+Seoul,+South+Korea","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in psychiatry; 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28988,""
"Prevalence of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Patients With Cognitive Decline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective Preventive measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 are essential, but often cause social isolation, affecting the physical and mental health of older adults. Patients with dementia are likely to have worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) owing to pandemic restrictions. To examine this, we described BPSD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We identified patients at a memory clinic in Japan between October 2018 and December 2019 (15 months before the pandemic began, n = 1,384) and between April 2020 and June 2021 (15 months after the State of Emergency was declared;n = 675 patients). A propensity score was used to match 576 patients from each group. The Mini-Mental State Exam was used to classify cognitive function into mild and moderate/severe. Dementia Behavioral Disturbance Scale was used to evaluate BPSD. The association between BPSD before and during the pandemic was evaluated using binomial logistic regression models. Results The levels of frequent night waking were higher in individuals before the pandemic than in those evaluated during the pandemic in both the mild group [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.82, 95% CI 1.02â€“3.23] and the moderate/severe group (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.19â€“3.23). During the pandemic, physical attacks were higher in the mild group (AOR = 4.25, 95% CI 1.12â€“16.07), while night wandering was higher in the moderate/severe group (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.03â€“4.81). Conclusion In patients with cognitive impairment, some BPSD were more prevalent during the pandemic, depending on dementia severity. The findings pertaining to the higher frequency of sleep disturbance and aggressiveness during COVID-19 should be used to guide BPSD screening in patients with dementia and to provide evidence-based interventions.","Kuroda, Yujiro, Sugimoto, Taiki, Matsumoto, Nanae, Uchida, Kazuaki, Kishino, Yoshinobu, Suemoto, Claudia Kimie, Sakurai, Takashi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+of+Behavioral+and+Psychological+Symptoms+in+Patients+With+Cognitive+Decline+Before+and+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in psychiatry; 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28989,""
"Data, Data, Data","Over the past several weeks, Kroeger reviewed grant applications for the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA)-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Retail Flexible Funding Model Grant Program. In many of these applications, he saw projects that dealt with data: the collection of data, the analysis of data, the sharing of data, and how agencies plan to use the information to improve food safety. Environmental health professionals need to think how much data their office has stored. How much information they have collected over decades of service to the community. Data on food safety, water quality, air quality, and so much more. They keep these data to refer back to when it is needed. How much sewage is this subdivision adding to the groundwater supply? Which risk factor violations are found most often? This information helps in making more informed decisions to improve public health in their communities.

"Features of life activity and the incidence rate of anxiety and depressive disorders among medical students studying remotely during the epidemic of a new coronavirus infection (Covid 19)","Aims. The aim is to study the features of life and the incidence rate of anxiety and depressive disorders among medical faculty students studying remotely during the epidemic of a new coronavirus infection (Covid 19) at the Kabardino-Balkarian State University named after H.M. Berbekov. Materials and methods. We examined 335 students (34% males, 66% females) at the Faculty of Medicine in November-December 2020. The average age of the students examined was 20.3Â±2.3 years. The study included an anonymous mail survey to examine educational conditions, lifestyle, levels of anxiety and depression. Results. 43.8% of the students had insufficient sleep duration, 58.5% had low physical activity, in 24.8% of them we recorded high levels of situational anxiety and in 82.1% of them personal anxiety, in 7.1% of the students we recorded clinically expressed anxiety and 1.8% had clinically expressed depression. During the transition to remote learning, students increased the time use to prepare for classes (51.2%) and the duration of sleep (61.5%), while their physical activity decreased (76.5%). Statistically significant linear correlations were identified between the level of anxiety and depression and the duration of sleep, low physical activity, preparation time for classes, academic performance, and academic debt. Conclusions. The results obtained by us can be used to optimize the educational process, as well as to preserve the mental health of students during the transition to distance learning.","Kardangusheva, Aksana M.; Kaskulova, Diana Z.; Kurdanova, Maryam H.; Budnik, Antonina F.; Voronova, Olga V.; Gelyakhova, Zukhra A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Features+of+life+activity+and+the+incidence+rate+of+anxiety+and+depressive+disorders+among+medical+students+studying+remotely+during+the+epidemic+of+a+new+coronavirus+infection+(Covid+19)","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cardiometry; - (21):130-137, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28991,""
"THE MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF PRECARIOUS PRACTICES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: SOCIETY, RELIGION, AND INDIVIDUAL","The article examines the phenomenon of precariousness and its development in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is postulated that precariousness is a process of instability, which primarily affects the working class and destabilizes social relations at all levels, including the level of personal relationships. The human way of life has been shifted as a result of the epidemiological situation in the world caused by the COVID-19 infection. This process can be observed in the spheres of employment, medicine, religion, family, leisure activities, etc. Against the background of social turbulence, the processes of precariousness began to develop, which worsen the already difficult situation of humanity. The danger is primarily that this phenomenon is hidden, and the average person is usually unable to identify it and to begin to resist. Challenges and changes usually force a person to look for a better way out of a crisis situation, but precariousness in society, especially in the field of employment, has created a phenomenon of hopelessness for a better financial situation, giving birth to the scheme, ""We must survive here and now."" Precariousness in the religious sphere cooled the feelings of the faith: some people were disappointed in the heavenly realities, focusing on earthly problems;and the others relied only on the heavenly realities, waiting for God to solve their current problems. Today's average person is usually lost in himself/herself because he /she cannot answer the question, ""How to better build the present and the future?"" The lack of individual planning of one's life for the year ahead due to lockdown, which constantly adjusts the life plan of the individual and society, has given rise to regressive individual and to social practices of precariousness, whereas timely identification of which would help to facilitate problem solving of present-day issues. As a result of the study, a visual model of the spread of precarious social practices during the COVID-19 pandemic was built.","Honcharova, O.; Kuryliak, V.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+MODEL+OF+DEVELOPMENT+OF+PRECARIOUS+PRACTICES+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC:+SOCIETY,+RELIGION,+AND+INDIVIDUAL","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Occasional Papers on Religion in Eastern Europe; 41(8):53-77, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",28992,""
"Far From a ""White Problem"": Responding to the Overdose Crisis as a Racial Justice Issue","The United States is in the midst of an overdose crisis of tremendous proportions. Even before overdose death rates spiked sharply during the COVID19 pandemic, the United States had twice the mortality rate of the second highest country, and 20 times the global average.1 Deaths from overdose have increased year after year-nearly uninterrupted-for the past four decades. During the pandemic, the United States crossed the grim milestone of 100 000 overdose deaths in a 12-month period. Although overdose deaths have increased for all racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, these increases have not been felt equally among all Americans. Overdose and addiction have long predominated among low-income communities,3 and during the ""first wave"" of the overdose crisis in the early 2000s, deaths were concentrated in low-income White communities.4However, the racial/ethnic profile of the US overdose crisis has changed sharply.5 In 2020, the overdose death rates of Black individuals overtook those of White individuals and now exceed them by nearly 20%. American Indians/Alaska Natives now have the highest overdose mortality rates of any group-30% higher than for White individuals. Far from a ""White problem,"" overdose prevention is now a key racial justice issue. In this issue of AJPH, an analysis of a national data set by Pro et al. (p. S66) considers the individual- and state-level factors that help explain racial disparities in addiction treatment. Economic and community distress-including low education, high unemployment, and housing vacancy-had the strongest negative relationship to treatment success across all racial/ethnic groups. Black and American Indian/Alaska Native patients disproportionately presented for treatment in mid- to high-distress communities. Black patients were also much more likely to experience poor treatment outcomes. In addition, patients in states that have not expanded Medicaid were less likely to experience successful treatment.","Friedman, Joseph M. P. H.; Hansen, Helena M. D.

Pre-pandemic health, stress, and support data were used to compare dual caregivers of MOA and MG;differences were minimal. Responses to interviews conducted during the pandemic highlighted the effects of social restrictions on MOA and MG caregivers, revealing five themes (1) Increased isolation, (2) Increased need for vigilance, (3) Negative impact on mental health, (4) Tendency to â€œdo it all,â€ and (5) Increased informal help. MOA and MG caregivers differed on managing care responsibilities and ensuring the health of care recipients.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Academic Performance and Personal Experience Among First-Year Medical Students","Background The COVID-19 pandemic forced medical education to rapidly transition from in-person learning to online learning. This change came with learning difficulties, social isolation, limited student/faculty relationships, and decreased academic performance. Objective The purpose of this study is to determine if academic performance, study habits, student/faculty relationships, and mental health were different in first-year medical students (class of 2024) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-COVID cohorts. Methods In April 2021, a survey was sent to first-year medical students at the Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at UNLV asking them to reflect on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic including study environment, mental health, and relationships with peers and faculty. A similar survey was sent to second- and third-year medical students (classes of 2023 and 2022) asking them to reflect on similar experiences during their first year of medical school. Exam scores for the first five exams were gathered and compared between first-, second-, and third-year medical students. Results One hundred twenty-five students responded to the survey (81% of first-year students, 75% of second-year students, and 55% of third-year students). During the COVID-19 pandemic, first semester students did not score above the national average as much as first semester students pre-COVID (55% vs. 77%). Students during the pandemic studied at home more than previous cohorts. Mental health and relationships were all rated significantly lower among first semester students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Severe osteoporosis: Pandemic pick ups","Objective: During COVID-19 pandemic, the access to skeleton investigations for osteoporosis was in many cases postponed, thus consequences on fracture risk (FR) might be expected in terms of not continuing the antiosteoporotic medication or not initiating it if needed. Reduced physical activity might reduce the risk of fall, on one hand, but associated sarcopenia and inhibition of bone formation due to lack of physical exercise increase the FR, on the other hand (1-5). This is a case report of a female with severe osteoporosis who delayed the presentation for diagnostic during first 15 months of pandemic. Case report: This is a 73-year-old female, known with a history of osteoporosis since 2005. She also associates FR: chronic therapy with different SSRIs for depression, multinodular goiter-related hyperthyroidism (which was treated with radioiodine therapy). She has chronic therapy for arteria hypertension, hyperlipemia and hiatal hernia. At diagnostic, after initial lumbar T-score=-3.5 SD, she refused therapy until 2015 (when T-score decreased to -4 SD), thus she began therapy with intravenous ibandronate until 2017 when she experienced a vertebral fracture and daily 20 Âµg of teriparatide was initiated, starting from a DXA-BMD of 0.783 g/cm2, T-score of 3.1 SD.

"The Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on Access to Care and Basic Necessities of Emergency Department Patients With Opioid Use Disorders Who Are Linked to Treatment","Study Objective: COVID-19 has immensely impacted access to medical care for marginalized people, including people with substance use disorders. A needs assessment survey was created to assess the needs of patients enrolled in our emergency departmentâ€™s (EDâ€™s) peer navigator care linkage program for patients with opioid use disorder during COVID-19. The navigator program is a team of peer and student navigators at our ED that coordinates care for patients with opioid use disorder, to provide them with social support and links them to medications for opioid use disorder. We retrospectively reviewed the responses to the needs assessment survey to better understand the implications of COVID-19 on access to medical care and basic necessities for this vulnerable population. Methods: This was an IRB-approved, retrospective review of survey responses collected from April 2020 until April 2021. Patients surveyed were enrolled in our departmental peer navigator program as they presented to the ED with opioid-related complications (such as opioid overdose);the program started within the last two years. The survey consisted of questions that addressed how the pandemic impacted their ability to access medical care, inclination to seek medical care, and access to basic necessities such as housing and food. Participation was voluntary and the survey was administered by phone by the peer navigators and student volunteers. All survey responses were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: A total 181 patients were contacted, 69 of whom responded (38.1%). During the pandemic, 27.5% of respondents did not feel comfortable going to the ED for medical or psychiatric care, 21.7% had no alternative care site, and 20.3% were unable to access other addiction treatment services. Although telehealth was an alternative, 39.1% of the subjects did not have access to an appropriate device (eg, smartphone) and 37.7% did not have reliable internet access. During the pandemic, 33.3% (23) of respondents lost employment, and of that population, only 47.8% (11) qualified for unemployment assistance. Meals were often skipped by 20.1% of respondents and 42.0% reported not living in stable housing. Conclusion: This survey illuminates the barriers to medical care and basic necessities for our substance using patient population, many of which may have been present before the COVID-19 pandemic. The results provide direction for resource allocation both currently and in the future. For example, to assist those who were unable to participate in a telehealth appointment, we are considering expansion of an existing program to provide patients with internet-capable cell phones. Future research should explore which interventions are most effective under similar circumstances.","Shamsie, I.; Gomez, B.; Khalid, S.; Boni, A.; Ramdin, C.; Nelson, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.045","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S16, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29001,""
"Continued Resident Depression, Anxiety and Stress Despite Declining Covid Numbers and Increasing Vaccination Rates","Study Objective: Resident wellness is a critical issue for residency programs and much discussion has determined that programs across all specialties have a responsibility to monitor their residents for signs of depression, anxiety, and stress. Despite its importance, programs have yet to determine a simple, objective way to measure these signs. We sought to establish an objective measure of emergency medicine (EM) resident wellness last year during the SARS- CoV- 2 pandemic, and then determine if wellness improved as the pandemic was waning. Methods: Using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS), all residents in a suburban EM residency in the state with the highest SARS- CoV- 2 deaths per capita were surveyed during the pandemic (â€œduringâ€) and then again six months later in the spring, as the CDC began to recommend lifting restrictions (â€œafterâ€). The DASS is a validated psychometric scale used across multiple industries and designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Survey results were anonymous. The percentage of residents with depression, anxiety and stress during and after the pandemic was measured, and differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Out of 27 residents, 26 (96%) completed the â€œduringâ€ survey and 23 (85%) completed the â€œafterâ€ survey. During the pandemic, 42% of residents were measured as having some degree of depression, ranging from mild to severe, compared to 33% noted on the â€œafterâ€ survey (Difference - 9%, CI: - 38, 20). Results showed that 31% of residents were measured as having some degree of anxiety during the pandemic, compared to 38% noted in the â€œafterâ€ survey (Difference 7%, CI: - 21, 36). 46% of residents were measured as having some degree of stress during the pandemic, compared to 48% noted in the â€œafterâ€ study (Difference 1%, CI: - 29, 32). There were no significant changes in the percentage of residents classified as having â€œsevereâ€ depression, anxiety or stress. Conclusion: Despite the waning pandemic and increased rates of vaccination, there was no significant improvement in the levels of depression, anxiety and stress as measured by the DASS among the residents. The reason for this is unclear but certainly requires more investigation.","Espinosa, C.; Walsh, B.; Mekaeil, V.; Walsh, K.; Fiesseler, F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.062","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S22, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29002,""
"Online Social Listening Surveillance for Earlier Insights About Loperamide Abuse/Misuse, 2015-2021","Study Objectives: Loperamide (LOP) is a safe, effective antidiarrheal medication available over-the-counter (OTC) for over 30 years with a maximum dose of 8 mg/day for adults. Intentional LOP abuse/misuse (ingesting 70-200 mg/day to self-treat opioid withdrawal symptoms or achieve euphoria) was first reported in online forums in 2005. Following a 2016 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Safety Communication on the potential risk of cardiovascular adverse events with high doses of LOP, the OTC industry initiated a communications campaign (www.LoperamideSafety.org) to educate health professionals, including emergency medicine specialists, about LOP abuse/misuse awareness and prevention. Retrospective surveillance (eg, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and National Poison Data System) has traditionally been employed to track reports of drug abuse/misuse. We utilized modern online social listening technology to observe and analyze comments/conversations (posts) about LOP abuse/misuse on various websites and online social media platforms to gain earlier insight into potential LOP abuse/misuse. Methods: Utilizing the software tools Crimson Hexagon and Synthesio, we scanned thousands of publicly accessible user posts in online blogs, forums, and social networks â€“ including major platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, and Forums â€“ from January 2015 to March 2021 to observe posts about LOP abuse/misuse. Listening consisted of keyword-based scrapes of user-generated content using search terms including loperamide, Imodium, overdose, OD, get high, getting high, withdrawal, and related terms/phrases. Findings were analyzed and reported quarterly. Results: From January 2015 to March 2021, there were 27,213 user posts regarding LOP abuse/misuse among all observed online platforms. Annual post volume peaked in 2016 before declining in 2019/2020, consistent with the pattern of annual intentional exposure cases reported by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Over 2015-2021, there was an average of 390 posts per month. Since May 2018, Reddit contained the majority of posts (70%), followed by Twitter (18%), YouTube (6%), Forums (4%), Facebook (&lt;1%), and other sites (&lt;1%). Reddit and Forums accounted for an increasing percentage of posts over time with a decrease for all other platforms. Posts primarily addressed the use of high-dose LOP for easing withdrawal symptoms (73%) or seeking euphoria (17%). Posts about risks and dangers of misuse/abuse were 16% of Reddit posts from Q2 2020 to Q1 2021, with a peak of 22% in Q2 2020. Spikes in posts coincided with key events, including journal article publications regarding effects of high doses (2,499 posts in May 2016 and 830 posts in January 2017) and FDA Drug Safety Communications regarding abuse/misuse of LOP (650 posts in June 2016 and 1,400 posts in January 2018). Post volume also appeared to increase in relation to US COVID-19 infection rates in 2020/2021 slightly. Conclusion: Online chatter about LOP abuse/misuse rose from 2015 to a peak in 2016 before declining in 2019/2020, consistent with the pattern of reported annual intentional exposure cases. While not a substitute for epidemiological surveillance, online social media listening is a useful adjunct surveillance strategy for earlier insight into potential LOP abuse/misuse by observing and analyzing online comments/conversations, sentiments and contexts.

"Changes in Emergency Department Visits for Opioid-Related Diagnosis, Opioid Overdose and Buprenorphine Use Across 14 US Emergency Departments During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","Study Objectives: To identify changes in emergency department (ED) visits for opioid-related diagnoses, opioid overdose, and the use of buprenorphine in EDs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: Electronic health data was collected from 14 geographically distinct emergency departments for ED visits between August 31, 2019 and August 30, 2020. Variables collected include age, sex, race, ICD-10 discharge codes, buprenorphine administrations, buprenorphine prescriptions and SARS-CoV-2 hospital admission rate. The category of opioid-related diagnoses included ED visits with ICD-10 codes for opioid use disorder, opioid dependence, opioid withdrawal, opioid overdose and/or opioid-related infection. Opioid-related infection visits were tabulated as ED visits with ICD-10 code for abscess, cellulitis, endocarditis or osteomyelitis and concurrent ICD-10 code of opioid-related diagnosis for the current ED visit or in the medical history. We used descriptive statistics and paired t-test to evaluate for differences in ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses, opioid overdose and rate of buprenorphine administrations and/or prescriptions between in visit with opioid-related diagnosis between August 31, 2019-February 29, 2020 and March 1, 2020-August 30, 2020. Spearman correlation was used to assess the association of outcomes with hospital SARS-CoV-2 burden from January 1, 2020 through August 30, 2020. Results: We collected information on a total of 911,738 ED visits between August 31, 2019- August 30, 2020 from 14 EDs Total ED visits with opioid-related diagnoses by ICD-10 code were 9,788, including 3,198 for opioid overdose, 1,745 for opioid withdrawal, and 431 for opioid-related infection (Figure 1). Between August 31, 2019-February 29, 2020 and March 1, 2020-August 30, 2020 (N = 13 sites), there was an increase in ED visits for OUD-related visits per 10,000 visits (130.8 (SE: 24.2) vs 101.8 (SE: 21.8);p=0.002) and an increase in ED visits for opioid overdose per 10,000 ED visits (40.8 (SE: 10.3) vs 27.4 (SE: 6.1);p=0.02). No change was detected in the rate of buprenorphine administration and/or prescriptions: 25.8 (SE: 5.3) vs 25.1 (5.5);p=0.80. From January to August 2020, significant correlations were observed between inpatient hospital SARS-CoV-2 rates and ED visits with a positive correlation between opioid-related diagnoses per 10,000 (Spearman r=0.92, p= &lt;0.0001) and opioid overdose per 10,000 visits (r=0.90, p=&lt;0.0001);a negative correlation was found for the rate of ED administration and/or prescription of buprenorphine (r=-0.37, p=0.03). Conclusions: ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses and opioid overdose per 10,000 ED visits increased in EDs between March 1, 2020 â€“ August 30, 2020 compared to the preceding 6 months and correlated with inpatient SARS-CoV-2 burden. Although the overall rate of buprenorphine administered and/or prescribed from the ED highlights a significant practice change in EDs over recent years, buprenorphine provision in EDs did not increase despite likely treatment service disruptions during this period of SARS-CoV-2.

"Comparing Moods Amongst Emergency Medicine Residents Based on Shift Times and Rotation","Study Objectives: Emergency medicine residents deal with shift work as an added stressor while trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Shift work results in many negative health effects including decreased sleep and an increased risk of mental health disorders and illness. EM residents must also rotate through different specialties, some of which are more intensive and time consuming than others and can negatively affect mood. The goal of this study was to evaluate the emotional wellbeing of EM residents during different shift times and rotations. Methods: This was an IRB-approved, prospective, observational study wherein EM residents logged information including mood (rated -10 to 10) and current rotation for up to 6 months. 25/34 eligible EM residents completed some of their logs and 14/34 completed their entire log with decreased participation attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. These logs were blinded to researchers. Emergency department shifts were 8-10 hours long and coded as either day (starting between 6a-10a), evening (starting between 11a-4p), night shift (starting between 9p-12a), post-night (day after night shift), or off. Rotations were grouped into ED, ICU/trauma, and elective/off-service. In order to isolate the effect of rotation on mood while at work, vacation and days off were excluded from analysis when comparing rotations. One way ANOVA test was used to compare moods. Afterwards, post hoc analysis using a Bonferroni Correction was performed to determine between group differences. Results: There were statistically significant differences found between the moods based on shift, F(4, 1888) = 39.1, p = 1.82E-31). Mood was highest during days off (M=5.19), and lowest on night shifts (M=2.36). There were statistically significant differences when comparing night (M=2.36, SD=4.11) vs post-night (M=4.24, SD=3.58), p=0.0007 and day (M=3.60, SD=4.09), p = 0.0015. There were also significant differences between off (M=5.19, SD=3.27), vs day (M=3.60, SD=4.09), p = 2.24E-10, evening (M=2.92, SD=4.46), p=3.01E-26), and night (M=2.36, SD=4.11), p=2.24E-23). There were also statistically significant differences between the moods based on rotation (F(2,1764) = 26.08, p = &lt;.001). Mood was highest on elective/off-service rotations (M=4.63, SD=3.00) and lowest on ICU/Trauma (M=2.36, SD=3.97). There were statistically significant differences comparing mood while in the ED (M=3.00, SD=4.32) vs ICU/trauma (p=.014) and elective/off-service (p=&lt;.001), and between ICU/trauma vs elective/off- service (p=&lt;.001). Conclusion: Night shift and ICU/trauma months resulted in the lowest moods reported by EM residents, while days off and elective/off-service rotations resulted in the highest mood. Shift work remains a significant stressor on EM residentsâ€™ work-life balance. Additionally, the more intensive rotations can negatively affect residentsâ€™ moods, further worsening work-life balance. Future studies can investigate methods to improve mood on night shifts and rotations associated with decreased moods.

"Fitbit Recorded Exercise and Activity in Emergency Medicine Residents","Study Objectives: Exercise and physical fitness have shown to decrease cardiovascular disease, numerous chronic medical conditions and improve mental health. Unfortunately, physical fitness declines during medical residency training. We sought to quantify and characterize the activity of emergency medicine (EM) residents. Methods: This study was an IRB approved, prospective, observational study that assessed EM residents' objective activity data obtained from a Fitbit. Thirty-four EM residents were asked to participate in the study and 33 (23 male, 10 female) gave verbal consent. A Fitbit (Charge 3 device) was given to each resident and they were asked to wear the Fitbit at all times. The study was conducted over a six-month period (December 2019-May 2020), but some residents stopped early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data from each Fitbit was automatically synced to a secure database, Fitabase. Each resident's identity was hidden from investigators. Data was interpreted using descriptive statistics, taking the mean steps, calories or logged activity time for the group. Mean times overall for various shifts were compared using one way ANOVA tests. Posttest two-way T tests using Bonferroni calculations were used to detect between groups differences. Data specifically collected included FitBit number of steps taken and calories measured and resident logged physical activity. Results: The mean number of steps taken was 8002-8522 over the various shifts. No significant differences were found between shifts. One-way ANOVA was not significant, F(4, 2550) =1.43, p=0.22. The mean number of calories burned in a day was 2661-2869. Residents used the most calories working day shift (M=2869) followed by evening shift (M=2827). One-way ANOVA was significant, F(4, 2550) =11.7, p=1.99E-09. Calories used working the day shift (M=2869, SD= 549) were significantly higher than the night shift (M=2716, SD= 598), p=0.0012 or having a shift off (M=2661, SD= 632), p=3.93E-08. A significant difference was also found in evening shift (M=2827, SD= 670) compared to a shift off (M=2661, SD= 632), p=5.91E-08. Logged physical activity was 13-26 minutes per day. One-way ANOVA was significant, F(4, 1696) =7.87, p=2.77E-06. We found a significantly higher amount of mean logged activity for residents having a shift off (M=26, SD= 39) compared to day shift (M=13, SD= 30), p=3.02E-06 and evening shift (M=19, SD= 31), p=0.0005. There was no significant difference between having a shift off and night shift (M=19, SD= 33), p=0.03 (Bonferroni correction &lt;0.005 for 10 comparisons) and post call (M=17, SD= 30), p=0.06. Conclusion: Although the number of steps did not significantly vary amount various shift, residents did use more calories working the day and evening shifts, which are both typically known to be the busier shifts. Residents who had no shift scheduled, logged more time for dedicated physical activity compared to residents working a shift. With physical activity declining during residency, it is imperative that residents receive education on how to include exercise in their daily routine, especially before or after shifts.

"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Department Adult Psychiatric Visits","Study Objective: In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached the New York tri-state area, which, at the time, was one of the regions in the United States (US) that the virus most severely affected. ED visits dramatically declined, likely due to social isolation mandates and fear of exposure to the virus. Quarantining at home, fear of becoming sick, and job disruptions caused the level of stress in the population to increase. In a previous US study, the proportion of ED visits for some psychiatric conditions increased. Our goal was to determine whether the proportion of ED visits for specific psychiatric conditions, namely anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm/suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders, changed after the arrival of COVID-19. Methods: Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: EDs of 28 hospitals within 150 miles of New York City. Hospitals were teaching and non-teaching in rural, suburban and urban areas. Total annual ED volumes were 12,000 to 122,000. Population: Consecutive ED patients = 21 years old from March 1 to November 30 in 2019 and 2020. Data analysis: We tallied the number of patients in 2019 and 2020 with anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm/suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders, identified using International Classification of Disease codes (version 10). We calculated the proportion of these visits to total ED visits in 2019 and 2020. We report the changes in these proportions from 2019 to 2020, along with 95% CIs. Results: Total ED visits decreased 27%, from 844,017 in 2019 to 618,195 in 2020. In 2019 and 2020 combined, the number of patients were: 13,151 with anxiety disorders, 6884 with depression, 8886 with suicidal ideation/self-harm, 3252 with bipolar disorder, and 7129 with psychotic disorders. The changes [with 95% CIs] in the proportion of visits from 2019 to 2020 were: anxiety disorders -1% [-4, +3%], depression -5% [-10, -1%], self-harm/suicidal thoughts +23% [+18, +29%], bipolar disorder +14% [+6, +22%], and psychotic disorders +23% [+18, +29%]. Conclusion: The proportion of adult ED visits for self-harm/suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders increased following the arrival of COVID-19, whereas the proportions for anxiety and depression changed minimally. These results are somewhat different from the findings in the previously reported study. Our study highlights the need for continued surveillance of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health.","Bauman, C.; Eskin, B.; Allegra, J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.299","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S116-S117, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29007,""
"Psychological distress and internet addiction following the COVID-19 outbreak: Fear of missing out and boredom proneness as mediators","COVID-19 has caused major changes in people's mental health and behavior. This study aimed to investigate whether boredom proneness and fear of missing out acted as mediators between psychological distress and Internet addiction (IA). A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2020, including 552 youths aged 17â€“28Â years. The recruited participants were asked to complete a series of self-reported questionnaires regarding psychological distress, fear of missing out, boredom proneness and IA. The results indicate that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reporting rate of IA in young adults was 28.1%, and fear of missing out and boredom proneness played multiple mediation roles in the relationship between psychological distress and IA. Governments and education departments should focus on young people with psychological deficits to prevent them from succumbing to IA.","Liang, Leilei, Li, Chuanen, Meng, Cuicui, Guo, Xinmeng, Lv, Jianping, Fei, Junsong, Mei, Songli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.03.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29008,""
"Associations between statin use and negative affective bias during COVID-19: an observational, longitudinal UK study investigating depression vulnerability","Background There is growing interest in the antidepressant potential of statins. We tested whether statin use is associated with cognitive markers previously found to indicate psychological vulnerability to depression, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Between April 2020 - February 2021, we conducted an observational online study of 2043 UK adults. Participants completed cognitive tasks assessing processes related to depression vulnerability, including affective bias and reward processing. We also measured working memory, medication use and current psychiatric symptoms. Using mixed ANCOVA and regression models, we compared participants on statins alone (n=81), anti-hypertensive medication alone (n=126), both medications (n=111), or neither medication (n=1725). Results Statin use was associated with reduced recognition of angry and fearful faces (F(1)=9.19, p=0.002;F(1)=6.9, p=0.009) and with increased misclassification of these expressions as positive. Increased recognition of angry faces at baseline predicted increased levels of depression and anxiety ten months later (ÃŸ=3.61, p=0.027;ÃŸ=2.37, p=0.002). Statin use was also associated with reduced learning about stimuli associated with loss (F(1, 1418)=9.90, p=0.002). These indicators of reduced negative bias were not seen in participants taking anti-hypertensive medication alone, suggesting that they were related to statin use in particular rather than non-specific demographic factors. Additionally, we found no evidence of an association between statin use and impairment in working memory. Conclusions Statin use was associated with cognitive markers indicative of reduced psychological vulnerability to depression, supporting their potential use as a prophylactic treatment for depression.","Gillespie, Amy L.; Wigg, Chloe, van Assche, Indra, Murphy, Susannah E.; Harmer, Catherine J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.03.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biological Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29009,""

"A cross-sectional survey of COVID-19: attitude and prevention practice among Syrians","Introduction Coronavirus disease of 2019 has overwhelmed public health systems worldwide and forced governments to impose draconian lockdowns on entire populations. With no vaccine or treatment during the early days of the pandemic, it is of paramount importance to assess the publicâ€™s awareness about COVID-19 so that prevention-focused educational campaigns can be sufficiently deployed. This study aimed to gauge the Syrian publicâ€™s adherence to infection control measures by assessing attitudes and practices during the pandemic which ravaged an already war-torn Syria. Methods The web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020, nearly 11 years into the Syrian crisis. The survey contained 3 sections: socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, and practice. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with good practices and negative attitudes. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0. Results Of the 3586 participants, 68.2% were females, 50.8% were unemployed, and 79.2% were college-educated. Only 1402 (39.1%) participants wore face masks when leaving their homes. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that female, age, and residence were factors associated with good practices such as avoiding mass gatherings, wearing face masks, and maintaining a 1-meter interpersonal distance. However, age and occupation were factors associated with negative attitudes towards the closure of universities and schools, travel bans, and quarantines for travellers. Conclusion This survey highlights the need to address specific populations using various measures;there should be a specialized method of prevention for each occupation, age group, and place of residence to contain further outbreaks of COVID-19. This can be achieved through targeted awareness campaigns.","Bakkar, Batoul, Mohsen, Fatema, Armashi, Humam, Marrawi, Marah, Aldaher, Nizar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09124","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09124, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29011,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on job satisfaction: A mediated moderation model using job stress and organizational resilience in the hotel industry of Taiwan","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected businesses worldwide, including the hotel industry in Taiwan. This study aims to explore the influence of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on job satisfaction. SPSS software was used for data analysis, and the PROCESS macro was used to test the mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation hypotheses. An online survey (n=681) was conducted on hotels in Taiwan in 2021, and the results indicate that job stress activation has a mediating effect on employeesâ€™ job satisfaction and the hotelsâ€™ business performances. Moreover, organizational resilience has a moderating effect on job stress. This study contributes theoretically to a better understanding of the factors that determine the impact of traumatic events such as a pandemic on people's mental health. This study suggests that interventions may be carried out to minimize the pandemic's negative psychological consequences. The implications of this study are also applicable to hoteliers in other affected countries.","Cheng, Shao-Cheng, Kao, Yu-Huan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09134","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09134, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29012,""
"Combination of breathing exercises, cold exposure, and meditation mitigate psoriasis â€“ open label, randomized, controlled trial","Psoriasis is a skin disease of an unknown origin. Current understanding of its pathophysiology focuses on an undefined imbalance between the immune system and the nervous system. In this study we assessed the effects of a training program which was proven to affect both. A group of psoriatic patients volunteered, and were randomized to either the intervention (n = 19), or control group (n = 19). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 weeks in breathing techniques, exposure to cold and meditation. The control group was not trained. After two weeks of the intervention, a full lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemics was introduced. Modified protocol included exercises possible to conduct at home only. Two study visits (before and after the intervention) took place. Based on an analysis of blood and saliva samples, skin condition, and questionnaire answers, a flare up of psoriasis occurred among members of the control group. It was confirmed by an increase in hsCRP concentration, and decrease of seral interleukin-10 levels. 55% of those subjects declared intensification of the topical treatment. In the intervention group, a slight improvement was observed. Psoriasis Area Severity Index decreased, as well as interleukin 17 levels in saliva. Dermatology Life Quality Index improved fourfold. 68% of the subjects declared reduction of the topical treatment. Sleep quality, depressive symptoms and mindfulness improved as well. In conclusion, we demonstrate that this specific training program can potentially be an easy, safe to apply add-on therapy for psoriasis and its comorbidities.","Czarnecki, J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2021.08.026","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Investigative Dermatology; 141(10):S153, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29013,""
"Sociodemographic and geographic disparities in excess fatal drug overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in California: A population-based study","Summary Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is co-occurring with a drug addiction and overdose crisis. Methods We fit overdispersed Poisson models, accounting for seasonality and secular trends, to estimate the excess fatal drug overdoses (i.e., deaths greater than expected), using data on all deaths in California from 2016 to 2020. Findings Between January 5, 2020 and December 26, 2020, there were 8605 fatal drug overdosesâ€”a 44% increase over the same period one year prior. We estimated 2084 (95% CI: 1925 to 2243) fatal drug overdoses were excess deaths, representing 5Â·28 (4Â·88 to 5Â·68) excess fatal drug overdoses per 100,000 population. Excess fatal drug overdoses were driven by opioids (4Â·48 [95% CI: 4Â·18 to 4Â·77] per 100,000), especially synthetic opioids (2Â·85 [95% CI: 2Â·56 to 3Â·13] per 100,000). The non-Hispanic Black and Other non-Hispanic populations were disproportionately affected with 10Â·1 (95% CI: 7Â·6 to 12Â·5) and 13Â·26 (95% CI: 11Â·0 to 15Â·5) excess fatal drug overdoses per 100,000 population, respectively, compared to 5Â·99 (95% CI: 5.2 to 6.8) per 100,000 population in the non-Hispanic white population. There was a steep, nonlinear educational gradient with the highest rate among those with only a high school degree. There was a strong spatial patterning with the highest levels of excess mortality in the southernmost region and consistently lower levels at progressively more northern latitudes (7Â·73 vs 1Â·96 per 100,000). Interpretation Fatal drug overdoses disproportionately increased in 2020 among structurally marginalized populations and showed a strong geographic gradient. Local, tailored public health interventions are urgently needed to reduce growing inequities in overdose deaths.

"Making sense of a pandemic: Mindsets influence emotions, behaviors, health, and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic","Rationale As the SARS-COV-2 virus spread across the world in the early months of 2020, people sought to make sense of the complex and rapidly evolving situation by adopting mindsets about what the pandemic was and what it meant for their lives. Objective We aimed to measure the mindsets of American adults over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand their relative stability over time and their relationship with emotions, behaviors, experiences, and wellbeing. Methods American adults (NÂ =Â 5365) were recruited in early March of 2020 to participate in a longitudinal survey with follow-up surveys at 6-weeks and 6-months. Three mindsets that people formed about the COVID-19 pandemic were measured: â€˜the pandemic is a catastropheâ€™, â€˜the pandemic is manageableâ€™ and â€˜the pandemic can be an opportunityâ€™. Results In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, these mindsets were associated with a unique and largely self-fulfilling pattern of emotions (positive, negative), behaviors (healthy, unhealthy, and compliance with CDC guidelines), experiences (connection/growth, isolation/meaninglessness) and wellbeing (physical health, mental health, quality of life). Moreover, mindsets formed in the first week of the pandemic were associated with quality of life 6 months later, an effect that was mediated by emotions and health behaviors. Conclusion The mindsets that people adopted about the COVID-19 pandemic - that it is â€˜a catastropheâ€™, â€˜manageableâ€™, or â€˜an opportunityâ€™ may explain some of the heterogeneity in the lived experiences of Americans through their self-fulfilling impact on peoples' emotions, health behaviors, and wellbeing.","Zion, Sean R.; Louis, Kengthsagn, Horii, Rina, Leibowitz, Kari, Heathcote, Lauren C.; Crum, Alia J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114889","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114889, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29015,""
"Delineating privacy aspects of COVID tracing applications embedded with proximity measurement technologies & digital technologies","As the COVID-19 pandemic expanded over the globe, governments implemented a series of technological measures to prevent the disease's spread. The development of the COVID Tracing Application (CTA) was one of these measures. In this study, we employed bibliometric and topic-based content analysis to determine the most significant entities and research topics. Additionally, we identified significant privacy concerns posed by CTAs, which gather, store, and analyze data in partnership with large technology corporations using proximity measurement technologies, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. We examined a series of key privacy threats identified in our study. These privacy risks include anti-democratic and discriminatory behaviors, politicization of care, derogation of human rights, techno governance, citizen distrust and refusal to adopt, citizen surveillance, and mandatory legislation of the apps' installation. Finally, sixteen research gaps were identified. Then, based on the identified theoretical gaps, we recommended fourteen prospective study strands. Theoretically, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge about the privacy of mobile health applications that are embedded with cutting-edge technologies and are employed during global pandemics.","Saheb, Tahereh, Sabour, Elham, Qanbary, Fatimah, Saheb, Tayebeh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101968","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Technology in Society;: 101968, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29016,""
"Cognitive Deficits in Patients with COVID-19 Infection during Their Hospital Stay: An Exploratory Study","Background The literature on presence of cognitive deficits in patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is emerging. However, the data on whether cognitive deficits have its onset during the acute phase of illness has not been evaluated extensively. Aim This article estimates the level of cognitive functioning of patients with COVID-19 while they were admitted to COVID-designated wards. Secondary objectives were to assess the influence of medical comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 infection, and depressive and anxiety symptoms on cognitive functioning in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods Sixty-six clinically stable patients with COVID-19 infection were evaluated during their inpatient stay on Hindi Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (H-MoCA), Hindi Mini-Mental State Examination (HMSE) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire -7. Results The mean age of the study participants was 39.85 (standard deviation [SDI 16.89) years and the participants were evaluated after 9.34 (SD 4.98;median 9.0) days of being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. About one-fourth (28.8%;n =19) of the participants had cognitive impairment on HMSE and about two-fifths (n = 26;39.39%) had cognitive impairment as per the cutoff used for H-MoCA. A higher level of cognitive deficits were seen among participants who were older, diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and those who required oxygen support during their hospital stay prior to assessment. Conclusion Low cognitive score was found in one-fourth (28.8%) to two-fifths (39.9%) of the persons, depending on the assessment scale among those with acute COVID-19 infection. Low cognitive score was more prevalent among the elderly, those with diabetes mellitus, and those who required oxygen support prior to the assessment.","Sahoo, S.; Suman, A.; Mehra, A.; Nehra, R.; Bhalla, A.; Puri, G.

"Alcohol Consumption and Smoking During Covid-19 Pandemic: Association with Sociodemographic, Behavioral, and Mental Health Characteristics","The Covid-19 pandemic is related to increased alcohol consumption and smoking. These behaviors may be related to several sociodemographic, behavioral and mental health factors. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the association between alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking with sociodemographic, behavioral and mental health characteristics. This study used data from two population-based studies conducted in two cities from Southern Brazil amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Individuals aged 18Ã‚Â years or older were included and selected using a multistage sampling procedure. Alcohol consumption and smoking and changes in such consumption during the Covid-19 pandemic were evaluated. Sociodemographic, behavioral, pandemic-related, and mental health variables were also included. A hierarchical model was used to conduct the adjusted analyses, and Poisson regression with robust adjustment was used for variance. A total of 2170 individuals were studied. The prevalence of alcohol consumption and smoking were 9.3% and 14.2%, respectively. The rates of increase in alcohol consumption and smoking during the Covid-pandemic were about 20% and 30%, respectively. They were higher among those with depressive symptoms, feeling of sadness and self-reported stress. Those with poor diet quality had higher prevalence of alcohol consumption (PR: 1.82) and were 1.58 times more likely to smoke. The findings may help stakeholders in health and political systems to better understand the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and develop strategies to mitigate these consequences in Brazil and elsewhere.","SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Santos, Quadra, Dumith, Meller","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-022-01085-5","20220325","Alcohol drinking; COVID-19; Cigarette smoking; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29018,""
"LeiP#netz 20: mapping COVID-19-related changes in mental health services in the German city of Leipzig","The purpose of the study was to investigate the changes in psychosocial and psychiatric services in the German city of Leipzig during the COVID-19-pandemic. A participatory, mixed-methods study was used involving a quantitative online survey and qualitative semi-structured interviews with professionals. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative data. Fifty professionals from various mental health services participated in the survey and eleven professionals were interviewed. Quantitative findings showed that some services were closed intermittently and thatÃ‚Â there was a stiff increase in use of digital/telephonic service and a decrease in face-to-face services. Staff or funding did not change considerably during the pandemic. Psychosocial groups were suspended or reduced, while access to services became more difficult and professional training for staff was stopped. Thematic analysis of the interviews showed that professionals experienced different phases and levels of change during the pandemic, including changes on a structural level, on the users' level, and on the staff' level. Professionals particularly criticised the equivocality of COVID-19 regulations, a defective flow of information and lack of attention for mental healthcare in public policies. They also saw positive aspects, such as the capacity of users and the outpatient care system to adapt to the new situation. This study suggests directions for policy and service development, such as communicating clearly in infection-control measures, fostering outpatient care and networks between services.","Duden, Gersdorf, Trautmann, Steinhart, Riedel-Heller, Stengler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02274-2","20220325","COVID-19; Community psychiatry; Coronavirus; Mental health services; Pandemic; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29019,""
"Identification of Depression Among Elderly During COVID-19","Elderly population is increasing, while the world has been facing the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which causes a greater adverse impact among older population in various aspects of their lives, such as depression, daily routine disruption, illness, and social and emotional issues. The purpose of this study was to assess the elderly's depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the risk factors including socio-demographic, physical and psychosocial conditions, as well as family support. The method used was cross-sectional design, with a total sampling of 457 participants. The measuring instruments used were ADL (Activities of Daily Living Scale) and IADL (Lowton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale) for physical activities assessment, APGAR (Adaptability, Participation, Growth, Affection, Resolution) for family support function assessment, and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for depression level measurement, with additional questions for psychosocial assessment. 212 elderlies (46.4%) were found with no depression tendency, 183 elderlies (40%) had a tendency of depression, and 62 elderlies (13.6%) had depression. These depression issues were significantly linked to retirement and income among elderly, dependency, fitness and health status, family and social support, and sources of funds. In the presence of depression, control measures for social, health, and psychosocial support must be implemented in order to minimize its impact among the elderly.","Kurniawidjaja, Susilowati, Erwandi, Kadir, Hasiholan, Al Ghiffari","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319221085380","20220325","COVID-19; Indonesian; depression; elderly; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29020,""
"The impact of COVID-19 restrictions and care home strategies on residents with dementia as experienced by family carers in Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures caused serious consequences for several population cohorts, including people with dementia in care homes and their families. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on care home residents with dementia as experienced by family carers in Italy. Specifically, strategies implemented to overcome the pandemic's constraints, their influence upon care, and consequences for everyday life of residents with dementia and carers were investigated. Semi-structured interviews explored participants' experiences of the pandemic, its restrictions and the services' status during lockdown. Transcripts were analysed via thematic analysis. 26 family carers were interviewed. Three themes emerged: (1) COVID-19 restrictions negatively affected both residents with dementia and family carers, (2) Changing policies in care homes during COVID-19, and (3) Technology use in care homes during COVID-19. COVID-19 restrictions severely affected care home residents with dementia, disrupted their daily living, and accelerated their cognitive decline. Consequently carers' emotional burdens increased. Care home response strategies (safe visiting and digital solutions) were critical, though they were not enough to compensate for the lack of close in-person contacts. Mixed evidence emerged about the feasibility of care home strategies and their associated benefits. To meet arising needs and possible future pandemic waves, there is a need for updated health strategies. These should prioritise a continuity of therapeutic activities and minimize negative effects on residents' quality of life, whilst incorporating feasible and accessible digital solutions to provide remote communication and psychological support for family carers.","Chirico, PappadÃƒÂ , Giebel, Ottoboni, Valente, Gabbay, Chattat","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2056137","20220325","COVID-19; care homes; caregivers; dementia; long-term care; mental health; physical distancing; public health; social isolation; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29021,""
"Differences in self-control, self-efficacy and depressive symptoms between active and inactive middle-aged and older adults after 1 year of COVID restrictions","The psychological impact of the prolonged lockdown measures in the UK as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear. Our aim was to determine if there are significant differences in self-control, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms and leisure motivation between UK older adults with differing levels of physical activity, and which of these variables can be used to predict activity level after 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year of lockdown restrictions. 521 adults aged 50-92Ã¢â‚¬â€°years completed an online survey consisting of several validated measures relating to physical activity, self-control, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and leisure motivation. Participant's responses were grouped into active (Ã¢â€°Â¥150minutes activity per week) and inactive (&lt;150minutes activity per week). Data was analysed using ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation and Multiple Regression (forward stepwise). We found significant differences in self-efficacy, self-control, and depressive symptoms between physically active vs inactive subjects. High levels of self-control and self-efficacy were associated with higher levels of activity and fewer depressive symptoms. Self-control, amotivation, depressive symptoms and self-efficacy were predictors of physical activity level.

We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scales to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. We adapted the U.S. Department of Agriculture six-question scale to assess household food insecurity. Nearly 20% of study participants reported symptoms of depression and 15% reported symptoms of anxiety. Six percent reported increasing their substance use and 37% experienced food insecurity during the pandemic. Depression and anxiety symptoms were more frequent among women or those who had experienced Ã¢â€°Â¥1 recent COVID-19 related symptom, but less frequent among those who were married and/or worked in the fields. Increased substance use was more common among farmworkers who had Ã¢â€°Â¥1 COVID-19 related symptom, but less common among women and those who spoke a language other than English at home, were born outside the U.S., or lived in crowded housing. Food insecurity was common among those who were born outside the U.S. or lived with children &lt;18 years, but less common among those with more education, a higher income, or who had lived longer in the U.S. The pandemic has exacerbated challenges affecting mental health and and food security among farmworkers. Interventions and prevention efforts, led by respected and trusted members of the community, should include on-the-spot supplemental income, increased mental health services, and food support services.","Mora, Lewnard, Rauch, Kogut, Jewell, Cuevas, Eskenazi","https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2022.2058664","20220325","COVID-19; Farmworker health; Latino; anxiety; depression; food insecurity; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29023,""
"Longitudinal associations between stress and sleep disturbances during COVID-19","The psychological consequences of COVID-19 pandemic may include the activation of stress systems, that involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which influences many physiological functions, including sleep. Despite epidemiological studies evidenced greater prevalence of stress symptoms and sleep disturbances during COVID-19, longitudinal evidence investigating the effects of stress on sleep disturbances during the pandemic is lacking. We collected measures of perceived stress and sleep disturbances during the first wave of COVID-19 (March 2020) and at 8-10 months follow up in a sample of 648 adults (M= 33.52, SD= 12.98 years). Results showed that 39.4% of participants reported moderate to extremely severe stress in March 2020. Prevalence of sleep disturbances was 54.8% in March 2020 and 57.4% at follow-up. Structural equation modelling highlighted that perceived stress in March 2020 significantly predicted sleep disturbances at follow up (ÃŽÂ²=0.203; p&lt;0.001), even after controlling for baseline sleep disturbances. Results remained significant even after controlling for the effects of covariates including age, sex, depression and anxiety symptoms, and referring to psychological services (ÃŽÂ²=0.179; p&lt;0.05). Findings confirm the high prevalence of stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide first longitudinal evidence for the effects of perceived stress on sleep disturbances during the pandemic.

"The work environment and well-being-a survey of emergency healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial number of emergency HCWs have screened positive for anxiety, depression, risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout. The purpose of this qualitative study is to describe the impact of COVID-19 on emergency care providers' health and well-being using personal perspectives. We conducted in-depth interviews with emergency medicine (EM) physicians, EM nurses and emergency medical service providers at ten collaborating sites across the United States between September 21, 2020, and October 26, 2020. We developed a conceptual framework that described the relationship between the work environment and employee health. We used qualitative content analysis to evaluate our interview transcripts classified the domains, themes and subthemes that emerged from the transcribed interviews. We interviewed 32 emergency HCWs. They described difficult working conditions, such as constrained physical space, inadequate personnel protective equipment and care protocols that kept changing. Organizational leadership was largely viewed as unprepared, distant, and unsupportive of employees. Providers expressed high moral distress caused by ethically challenging situations, such as the perception of not being able to provide the normal standard of care and emotional support to patients and their families at all times, being responsible for too many sick patients, relying on inexperienced staff to treat infected patients, and caring for patients that put their own health and the health of their families at risk. Moral distress was commonly experienced by emergency HCWs, exacerbated by an unsupportive organizational environment. Future preparedness efforts should include mechanisms to support frontline health care workers when faced with ethical challenges in addition to an adverse working environment caused by a pandemic such as COVID-19.","Blanchard, Li, Bentley, Lall, Messman, Liu, Diercks, Merritt-Recchia, Sorge, Warchol, Greene, Griffith, Manfredi, McCarthy","https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14490","20220325","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29025,""
"The effect of tele-yoga training in healthy women on menstrual symptoms, quality of life, anxiety-depression level, body awareness, and self-esteem during COVID-19 pandemic","This study was planned to examine the effects of tele-yoga training on menstrual symptoms, quality of life, anxiety-depression level, body awareness, and self-esteem in healthy women. Thirty-two healthy premenopausal women between the ages of 18 and 45 were included in the study. The women were randomly divided into two groups as tele-yoga training (n: 16) and the control group (n: 16). The tele-yoga training was performed on the Zoom software for 6Ã‚Â weeks, 2 times a week and 45Ã‚Â min a day. No intervention was made in the control group. Menstrual pain and symptoms by Menstrual Symptom Scale (MSS), quality of life by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), depression levels by Beck Depression Scale (BDS), anxiety levels by State and Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI), body awareness by Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ), and self-esteem by Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) were determined. In the tele-yoga training group, statistically significant improvements were observed in the MSS total (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), negative effects (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), menstrual pain symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), coping methods (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) sub-parameters, BDS score (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000), NHP sleep (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021), energy (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), emotional (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000), and isolation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.039) sub-parameters. In the control group, there was statistically significant worsening in the NHP total score (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000). As regards the differences in values between the two groups, there were statistically difference in favor of the training group in sub-parameters of MSS, NHP sleep, energy, emotional, and isolation sub-parameters, and BDS and BAQ scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

"Factors Associated with Body Weight Gain among Korean Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Obesity is of grave concern as a comorbidity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . We examined the factors associated with weight gain among Korean adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey of 1,000 adults (515 men and 485 women aged 20-59 years) in March 2021. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the factors associated with weight gain. The analysis was adjusted for sex, age, region, depressive mood, anxiety, eating out, late-night meals, alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep disturbance, meal pattern, subjective body image, comorbidities, marital status, living alone, and income. After adjusting for confounding variables, the odds for weight gain increased in the group aged 20-34 years compared with the group aged 50-59 years (1.82; 95% CI, 1.01-3.32). Women were more associated with the risk of weight gain compared with men. The odds for weight gain increased in the lack of exercise group compared with the exercise group (4.89; 95% CI, 3.09-7.88). The odds for weight gain increased in the eating-out and late-night meal groups compared with that in the groups not eating out and not having late-night meals. Individuals watching a screen for 3-6 hr/day were more associated with the risk of weight gain compared with those who rarely watched a screen. The odds for weight gain increased in participants who considered themselves obese compared with those who did not consider themselves obese. A healthy diet and regular physical activity tend to be the best approach to reduce obesity, a risk factor for COVID-19.","Hur, Huh, Lee, Lee, Kim, Yu, Kim, Kim, Kim, Lee, Hong, Choi, Bae, Lee, Kim","https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes21087","20220325","COVID-19; feeding behavior; sedentary behavior; weight gain; weight perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29027,""
"Perceived Social Support and Depression Among Occupational Therapists in Hong Kong During COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and the level of perceived social support among occupational therapists during the pandemic, and to identify any associations between depression and perceived social support. Using convenience and snowball sampling, occupational therapists aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years who were working in Hong Kong and able to read and understand Chinese were invited to participate in a survey between January 2021 and April 2021 (during the fourth wave of COVID-19 pandemic). Data collected included age, sex, education level, employment status, marital status, living status, level of perceived social support (measured by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support [MSPSS-C]) and level of depression (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). 87 occupational therapists completed the survey. The mean MSPSS-C score was 67.87; 88.5% of participants had a high level of perceived social support. The mean PHQ-9 score was 4.67; 59.8% of participants had no or minimal depression and 11.5% of participants had clinical depression. The MSPSS-C score negatively correlated with the PHQ-9 score (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.401, p &lt; 0.001). In regression analysis, the MSPSS-C score was associated with the PHQ-9 score (F(1, 85) = 44.846, <i>r</i> = 0.588, p &lt; 0.001). About 34.5% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score was accounted for by the MSPSS-C score. Higher level of perceived social support is associated with lower level of depression. Social support might serve as a protective factor for depression among occupational therapists in Hong Kong during the pandemic.","Chan, Lee","https://doi.org/10.12809/eaap2205","20220325","COVID-19; Depression; Occupational therapists; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29028,""
"Emotional and Behavioural Changes in Children and Adolescents and Their Association With Parental Depression During COVID-19 Pandemic: a Pilot Study in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of children, adolescents, and their parents. This study aimed to assess the emotional and behavioural changes in children and adolescents and their association with parental depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. On 7 May 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown, an online questionnaire was distributed through social media and made available for 10 days. Data were collected from parents of children aged 4 to 17 years. The Bangla version of the parent-rated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to determine the behavioural and emotional disturbances of the children and adolescents. The Bangla version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the depression status of parents. There were 512 participants. 21.5% of children and adolescents had emotional and behavioural problems. More boys than girls had abnormal peer relationship problems (21.1% vs 15.4%, p = 0.03). Of the parents, 16.2% had moderate depression, 5.5% moderately severe depression, and 2.9% severe depression. 8.2% and 2.9% of parents reported that it was very difficult and extremely difficult, respectively, to do work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people; the proportion was higher in mothers than fathers (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 11.4, df = 3, p = 0.01). The PHQ-9 total score of parents mildly correlated with the SDQ score of children and adolescents (<i>r</i> = 0.51, p = 0.01). In multiple linear regression, a combination of parent sex (ÃŽÂ² = 0.08, p &lt; 0.001), child's history of developmental/psychiatric problems (ÃŽÂ² = 0.02, p = 0.67), and the SDQ total score of children and adolescents (ÃŽÂ² = 0.52, p = 0.03) accounted for 27% of the variability in PHQ total score of parents. During lockdown, the prevalence of psychiatric disorder among children and adolescents and their parents increased. The depression status of parents mildly correlated with the behavioural and emotional disturbances of children and adolescents. We recommend opening the schools as soon as the situation improves and developing interventions such as virtual mental health assessment for children and adolescents and their parents.","Syed, Khan, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.12809/eaap2138","20220325","Adolescent; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Children; Depression; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29029,""
"Posttraumatic Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in COVID-19 Survivors","This study aims to examine the rates of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after hospital discharge among COVID-19 survivors and to determine the associated risk factors. Adult COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospitals between March 2020 and March 2021 were asked to complete a questionnaire at 4 weeks after discharge. The Chinese version of the 22-item Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was used to measure symptoms of PTSD. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess symptoms of major depressive disorder. The 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to measure symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder. The rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among discharged patients were determined, as were associations between psychosocial factors and outcome measures and predictors for moderate-tosevere symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. 96 men and 103 women aged 18 to 81 years returned the completed questionnaire. 12.1% to 20.1% of them reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, or depression. Higher symptom severity was associated with higher perceived life threat, lower emotional support, lower disease severity upon admission, and longer hospital stay. Women had more PTSD symptoms than men, particularly when knowing someone under quarantine. COVID-19 survivors with higher perceived life threat, lower emotional support, lower disease severity upon admission, and longer hospital stay were associated with higher severity of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Timely intervention should provide to at-risk survivors.","Wu, Lee, Sze, Ng, Cho, Cheng, Wong, Cheung, Tsang","https://doi.org/10.12809/eaap2176","20220325","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Depressive disorder; Patient Health Questionnaire; Stress disorders; post-traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29030,""

"Health and coping strategies of nursing home residents and their relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic hit older adults particularly hard, especially those living in nursing homes. The present study's primary aim is to quantify the states of physical and mental health of nursing home residents and their relatives following the implementation of the exceptional confinement measures. The secondary aim is to explore the lived experiences of the stressors perceived by older adults and their relatives, as well as the support strategies implemented by health professionals and their results. We chose a mixed-methods (quantitative/qualitative) study to best deliver a profound understanding of this phenomenon.Quantitative phase: participants are asked to complete several questionnaires. The study population includes all the nursing home residents in four French-speaking cantons of Switzerland (and their relatives) who are living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the scores of the General Health Questionnaire-12, Impact of Event Scale-6, Perceived Stress Scale, Brief Cope, Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, World Health Organization Quality of Life-<b>BREF</b> (WHOQOL-BREF) and WHOQOL-OLD scales. Correlational analyses will be considered.Qualitative phase: data are collected from several sources (individual semi-structured interviews, focus groups, field notes). Interviews are planned with about 12 representatives of each group of participants (residents and relatives). Two focus groups made up of healthcare professionals will be constituted to explore the lived experiences of the stressors perceived by residents and relatives, the coping strategies those two groups implemented to deal with them. The interviews and focus groups will be subjected to a thematic contents analysis.Integrating the quantitative and qualitative data will take place jointly with data interpretation. This project was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Canton of Vaud on 14 December 2020 (project ID: 2020-02397).

"The Impact on Postpartum Care by Telehealth: a retrospective cohort study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, our institution turned to telehealth as the primary method of postpartum care delivery. We aimed to determine the impact of telehealth on completion of postpartum care goals. In a single center, retrospective cohort study, we compared a 14-week period, March-June 2019, before implementation of telehealth to the same calendar months post-implementation during 2020. Patients with a postpartum visit scheduled at our institution during the study period were included. To demonstrate a 10% difference in attendance to the postpartum visit in the post-implementation compared to the pre-implementation group, a power analysis calculation resulted in a requirement of at least 356 subjects per group. Our primary outcome was attendance to the postpartum visit. Secondary outcomes included completion of postpartum depression screening, contraception selection, breastfeeding status at postpartum visit, completion of 2-hour glucose tolerance test postpartum for those with gestational diabetes, and cardiology follow-up when recommended. Multivariable logistic regression with backwards elimination was used to control for confounders. Of the 1,579 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 780 were in the pre-implementation group and 799 in the post-implementation group. Subjects in the post-implementation group were at 90% increased odds of attending a postpartum visit compared to those in the pre-implementation group, even when controlling for race, prenatal care provider, parity, gestational age at delivery and insurance status (82.9% vs. 72.4%, p&lt;0.001; aOR 1.90, 95% CI [1.47-2.46]). Patients in the post-implementation group were also more likely to get screened for postpartum depression (86.3% vs. 65.1%, p&lt;0.001). While subjects were as likely to choose contraception, those in the post-implementation group were less likely to select long-acting reversible contraception or permanent sterilization (26.2% vs. 33.2%, p=0.03). There was no significant difference in breastfeeding status, postpartum 2-hour glucose tolerance test completion, or cardiology follow up between groups. Availability of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased postpartum visit attendance and postpartum depression screening. However, telehealth was also associated with a decrease in utilization of long-acting reversible contraception or permanent sterilization.","Arias, Wang, Leitner, Sannah, Keegan, Delferro, Iluore, Arimoro, Streaty, Hamm","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2022.100611","20220325","COVID-19; long-acting reversible contraception; obstetrical care; postpartum depression screening; postpartum visit attendance; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29033,""
"The relationship of alcohol and other drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with or at risk of HIV; A cross-sectional survey of people enrolled in Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO) cohorts","Alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic increased. People living with HIV or at risk for HIV acquisition often have psycho-social and structural barriers or co-occurring substance use making them vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol. We describe factors associated with alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic in this group. From May 2020 to February 2021, 1984 people enrolled in 6 existing cohort studies completed surveys about alcohol and other drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe the past-month prevalence of no alcohol use, low-risk use, and hazardous use. We use multinomial regression to describe factors associated with low-risk or hazardous alcohol use relative to no alcohol use. Forty-five percent of participants reported no alcohol use, 33% low-risk use, and 22% hazardous use in the past 30 days. Cannabis and stimulant use were associated with a higher prevalence of low-risk use relative to no use. Tobacco, stimulant, cannabis use and recent overdose were associated with a higher prevalence of hazardous use relative to no use. Substance use treatment and living with HIV were associated with a lower prevalence of low-risk or hazardous use relative to no use. Stimulant use was strongly associated with a higher prevalence of hazardous alcohol use while engagement in substance use treatment or living with HIV was associated with a lower prevalence. Ascertaining hazardous alcohol and other drug use, particularly stimulants, in clinical care could identify people at higher risk for adverse outcome and harm reduction counseling.","Pytell, Shen, Keruly, Lesko, Lau, Fojo, Baum, Gorbach, Javanbakht, Kipke, Kirk, Mustanski, Shoptaw, Siminski, Moore, Chander","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109382","20220325","Alcohol use; HIV; Multiple substance use; Opioid use; Stimulant use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29034,""
"Depressive symptoms, but not anxiety, predict subsequent diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 19: a national cohort study","Several diseases are linked to increased risk of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Our aim was to investigate whether depressive and anxiety symptoms predict subsequent risk of COVID-19, as has been shown for other respiratory infections. We based our analysis on UK Biobank participants providing prospective data to estimate temporal association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and COVID-19. We estimated whether the magnitude of these symptoms predicts subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19 in this sample. Further, we evaluated whether depressive and anxiety symptoms predicted (i) being tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and (ii) COVID-19 in those tested. Based on data from N = 135 102 participants, depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.052; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.017-1.086; absolute case risk: (moderately) severe depression: 493 per 100 000 v. minimal depression: 231 per 100 000) but not anxiety (OR = 1.009; 95% CI 0.97-1.047) predicted COVID-19. While depressive symptoms but not anxiety predicted (i) being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.039; 95% CI 1.029-1.05 and OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.978-1.002), (ii) neither predicted COVID-19 in those tested (OR = 1.015; 95% CI 0.981-1.05 and OR = 1.021; 95% CI 0.981-1.061). Results remained stable after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, multimorbidity and behavioural factors. Depressive symptoms were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of multimorbidities. Potential underlying mechanisms to be elucidated include risk behaviour, symptom perception, healthcare use, testing likelihood, viral exposure, immune function and disease progress. Our findings highlight the relevance of mental processes in the context of COVID-19.","Meinlschmidt, Guemghar, Roemmel, Battegay, Hunziker, Schaefert","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796021000676","20220325","Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; comorbidity; corona; depression; mental disorders; multimorbidity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29035,""
"Nasal pressure swings as the measure of inspiratory effort in spontaneously breathing patients with de novo acute respiratory failure","Excessive inspiratory effort could translate into self-inflicted lung injury, thus worsening clinical outcomes of spontaneously breathing patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Although esophageal manometry is a reliable method to estimate the magnitude of inspiratory effort, procedural issues significantly limit its use in daily clinical practice. The aim of this study is to describe the correlation between esophageal pressure swings (ÃŽâ€P<sub>es</sub>) and nasal (ÃŽâ€P<sub>nos</sub>) as a potential measure of inspiratory effort in spontaneously breathing patients with de novo ARF. From January 1, 2021, to September 1, 2021, 61 consecutive patients with ARF (83.6% related to COVID-19) admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the University Hospital of Modena (Italy) and candidate to escalation of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) were enrolled. Clinical features and tidal changes in esophageal and nasal pressure were recorded on admission and 24Ã‚Â h after starting NRS. Correlation between ÃŽâ€P<sub>es</sub> and ÃŽâ€P<sub>nos</sub> served as primary outcome. The effect of ÃŽâ€P<sub>nos</sub> measurements on respiratory rate and ÃŽâ€P<sub>es</sub> was also assessed.

"How did Nunavummiut youth cope during the COVID-19 pandemic? A qualitative exploration of the resilience of Inuit youth leaders involved in the I-SPARX project","This study investigated how COVID-19 has affected the wellness of a group of Inuit youth leaders in Nunavut in the context of their involvement with an ongoing mental health research initiative, the <i>Making I-SPARX Fly in Nunavut</i> [<i>I-SPARX</i>] project. The study had three goals: (1) to understand how the pandemic has affected <i>I-SPARX</i> leaders' perceived involvement in the <i>I-SPARX Project</i>; (2) to build knowledge around how the pandemic has impacted the daily life and wellbeing of youth in Nunavummiut communities; and (3) to acquire a culturally specific understanding of their coping mechanisms and resilience strategies through the lens of <i>Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit</i> (IQ). Nine Inuit youth were interviewed virtually about their participation in <i>I-SPARX</i>, their life during the pandemic, and their coping strategies. Their comments were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Pandemic challenges, the utility of <i>I-SPARX</i> teachings and participation, and culturally and community-embedded pathways to resilience were discussed.The implications of COVID-19 on Inuit youth in remote communities are not fully understood. The current study illuminates their experiences of the pandemic to inform future research on ways in which Inuit youth might be supported in situations, such as a global pandemic, that restrict their traditional resilience-enhancing activities and create social isolation.","Thomas, Bohr, Hankey, Oskalns, Barnhardt, Singoorie","https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2022.2043577","20220325","Indigenous communities; Indigenous mental health; Inuit resilience; Nunavut; pandemic resilience; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29037,""

"Effect of Screen Time on Physical and Mental Health and Eating Habits During COVID-19 Lockdown in Lebanon","This study aimed to explore whether screen time and the screen type impacted various health aspects of children, including physical activity (PA), sleep quality, and eating habits. Additionally, we investigated whether children's eating behavior while using electronic devices affects their physical and mental health. We conducted an online survey asking for screen use (duration, type, and purpose), PA, eating habits, sleep problems, and level of depression. The participants were children between the ages of 3 and 7 years, and the survey was answered by the participants' parents from March 3 to March 20, 2021. A screen time of Ã¢â€°Â¥2 h in children was associated with various clinical characteristics, such as body mass index (BMI), sleep problems, depression, decreased PA, and unusual eating habits. Children's food eating behavior while using electronic devices was predicted by a total screen time Ã¢â€°Â¥2 h, smartphone screen time Ã¢â€°Â¥2 h, sleep problems, owning electronic devices, and eating unhealthy food. There was an interplay among children's PAs, eating behaviors, depression, sleep problems, and screen time in this pandemic era.

"Depression, Insomnia and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in COVID-19 Survivors: Role of Gender and Impact on Quality of Life","Evidence to date suggests that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients experience adverse psychological outcomes and neuropsychiatric complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent hospitalization on the mental health, sleep, and quality of life of COVID-19 survivors. Patients were assessed 1-2 months after hospital discharge using standardized screening tools for depression and anxiety (HADS), post-traumatic stress disorder (IES-R), insomnia (AIS), and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, disease severity and type of hospitalization were also collected. Amongst the 143 patients included, mental health symptoms were common (depression-19%; anxiety-27%; traumatic stress-39%; insomnia-33%) and more frequently reported in female than in male patients. Age, smoking status, comorbidities and illness severity were not found to significantly correlate with the presence of mood, sleep, or stress disorders. Finally, quality of life was worse for patients requiring ICU (<i>p</i> = 0.0057) or a longer hospital stay (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) but was unaffected by factors such as sex and other measured outcomes.

"Quality of Life of the Elderly during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Asian Countries: A Cross-Sectional Study across Six Countries","Few studies have explored the determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying these factors may help implement appropriate policies to enhance HRQoL in the elderly. Therefore, we aimed to identify the predictors of physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS) scores of HRQoL in selected six low- and middle-income Asian countries. We conducted an online survey of older people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 years in six countries: Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Palestine, and Sri Lanka. The Stark QoL questionnaire was used to measure the PCS and MCS scores. Univariate and multiple variable analyses after adjusting for confounders were performed to identify the possible predictors of PCS and MCS. A total of 1644 older people (69.1 Ã‚Â± 7.8 years, range 55-97 years, Female: 50.9%) responded to the survey. We documented age, country of residence, marital status, number of male children, current employment status, and health insurance, ability to pay household bills, frequency of family members visits and receiving support during COVID-19 pandemic predicted both PCS and MCS.

"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Physician Wellness: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has provided challenges to all healthcare workers. While the brunt of treating COVID-19 patients fell upon adult providers, pediatricians also experienced significant stressors and disruptions. Academic pediatricians and trainees (fellows and residents) were redeployed to manage adult patients in hospitalist and intensive care settings and/or had major changes to their clinical schedules. In this study, we aimed to describe levels of self-reported depression, anxiety, and burnout in pediatric physicians following the initial wave of the pandemic at the largest integrated health system in New York State. A cross-sectional study was conducted among pediatric physicians who cared for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic within the Northwell Health System as part of the Northwell Wellbeing Registry, a longitudinal registry assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare providers. A total of 99 pediatric physician respondents were included in this study; 72% of whom were attendings, 28% of whom were trainees. Compared to attendings, trainees reported significantly higher proportions of burnout-emotional exhaustion (<i>p</i> = 0.0007) and burnout-depersonalization (<i>p</i> = 0.0011) on the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory. There was not a similar trend in probable depression or probable anxiety using the Patient Health Questionnaire. In a multivariable logistic regression model, being a trainee was significantly associated with increased odds of burnout-emotional exhaustion (OR 5.94, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.85-19.02). These findings suggest that fellows and residents were a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training programs should pay special attention to their trainees during times of crisis, and future studies can help to identify protective factors to reduce the risk of burnout during these times.","Belfer, Feld, Jan, Fishbein, Young, Barone","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063745","20220325","COVID; burnout; medical education; pediatrics; trainees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29043,""
"The Influence of Research Follow-Up during COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Distress and Resilience: A Multicenter Cohort Study of Treatment-Resistant Depression","During the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with mental disorders have faced more negative psychological consequences than the public. For people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), it is unclear whether research engagement would protect them from the deterioration of their symptoms. The study aimed to examine if chronic depressive patients would have improved resilience and mental distress levels after follow-up interviews during an observation period under COVID-19. The study was nested within a three-year prospective cohort study. A two-group comparison design was conducted, i.e., the follow-up group with regular research interviews every three months after baseline assessment and the control group with one assessment-only interview. The two groups were compared with demographics, psychosocial, and suicide information. Baseline assessments were not significantly different in sociodemographic variables, suicide risks, mental distress, and resilience between groups. Significant differences were detected in resilient coping and mental distress levels (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). The follow-up group (<i>n</i> = 46) experienced a higher level of resilient coping (37% vs. 25%) and lower level of mental distress (47.8% vs. 64.7%) than the control group (<i>n</i> = 68).

"Depressive Symptoms and Their Associated Factors in Vocational-Technical School Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms, behavioral habits, and QoL in students from two vocational-technical schools, and to determine the association of depressive symptoms with behavioral habits and quality of life (QoL) in these students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with students attending the institution of the Brazilian Federal Network of Professional, Scientific and Technological Education. The students answered a questionnaire on sociodemographic variables, situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, behavioral habits, QoL, and depressive symptoms. The outcome variable was the presence of depressive symptoms, assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed. A total of 343 students participated in this study (women, 55.7%; mean age of 16.1 Ã‚Â± 0.93 years). The prevalence of depressive symptoms among students was 43.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.0-49.0), and these symptoms were significantly associated with being female (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.72; 95% CI: 1.31-2.27); being in the 10th grade (PR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.18-2.76) and 9th grade (PR 2.08; 95% CI: 1.37-3.18); social isolation (PR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.00-4.14); hunger due to a lack of food at home (PR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.33-2.39); low physical activity levels (PR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.09-2.59); and moderate (PR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.68-4.89) and low QoL (PR: 5.66; 95% CI: 3.48-9.19).

"Accessibility to Digital Mental Health Services among the General Public throughout COVID-19: Trajectories, Influencing Factors and Association with Long-Term Mental Health Symptoms","Digital mental health services (DMHSs) have great potential for mitigating the mental health burden related to COVID-19, but public accessibility (ease of acquiring services when needed) to DMHSs during the pandemic is largely unknown. Accessibility to DMHSs was tracked longitudinally among a nationwide sample of 18,804 adults in China from before to one year after COVID-19 outbreak. Unconditional and conditional latent growth curve models and latent growth mixture models were fitted to explore the overall growth trend, influencing factors, and latent trajectory classes of accessibility to DMHSs throughout COVID-19. Generalized estimating equation models and generalized linear mixed models were employed to explore the association between accessibility to DMHSs and long-term mental health symptoms. We found that people generally reported increased difficulty in accessing DMHSs from before to one year after COVID-19 outbreak. Males, youngsters, individuals with low socioeconomic status, and individuals greatly affected by COVID-19 reported greater difficulty in accessing DMHSs. Four DMHS accessibility trajectory classes were identified: ""lowest-great increase"" (6.3%), ""moderate low-slight increase"" (44.4%), ""moderate high-slight decrease"" (18.1%) and ""highest-great decrease"" (31.2%). Trajectory classes reporting greater difficulty in accessing DMHSs were at higher risk for long-term mental symptoms. In conclusion, an overall increase in difficulty in accessing DMHSs is observed throughout COVID-19, and heterogeneity exists in DMHS accessibility trajectories. Our results suggest that easy access to DMHSs should be consistently facilitated. Moreover, access gaps should be reduced across demographic groups, and target populations for service allocation should alter as the pandemic evolves.","Lu, Shi, Que, Zheng, Wang, Liu, Huang, Liu, Yuan, Yan, Shi, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063593","20220325","COVID-19; accessibility; digital mental health services; trajectory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29051,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Related Changes on Air Quality in Birmingham, Alabama, United States","Air pollution is responsible for a wide range of health effects in exposed populations. Variations in local air pollution can affect local population health outcomes. The strict regulations imposed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic ('lockdowns') resulted in a unique situation where human mobility was limited significantly, resulting in improved air quality in several major cities. The main goal of this study was to investigate if lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted air quality in Birmingham, Alabama-a city with a history of high air pollution levels-with a focus on PM<sub>2.5</sub> (Particulate Matter with an aerodynamic diameter Ã¢â€°Â¤2.5 Ã‚Âµm) and NO<sub>2</sub> (Nitrogen dioxide). Daily air pollutant and traffic data were obtained for the Birmingham Metropolitan Area for the period January to October 2020, and previous years. Mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and traffic volumes during the official city/state lockdown period (24 March to 30 April 2020) were compared to pre- and post-lockdown means. The mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations during the lockdown did not significantly differ from that of the pre- or post-lockdown periods. However, NO<sub>2</sub> significantly decreased even after the lockdown order was removed, with the mean decreasing significantly compared to pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. Both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> annual means in 2020 were significantly lower than the annual means in 2019, indicating the occurrence of significant changes over the longer term that were not limited by defined lockdown periods. Traffic significantly increased after the lockdown order was removed but did not correlate with the two pollutants studied. Therefore, we conclude that the Stay at Home/lockdown regulations and other COVID-19 restrictions had an impact on the air quality of Birmingham Alabama; although these lockdown impacts varied for each pollutant and were not limited only by the official lockdown dates/periods.","Jacob, Stowe, Babarinde, Sharma, Christopher, Vilcassim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063168","20220325","Birmingham Alabama; COVID-19; air quality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29052,""
"Do COVID-19 Worries, Resilience and Emotional Distress &amp;amp;nbsp;Influence Life Satisfaction? Outcomes in Adolescents in Ecuador during the Pandemic: SEM vs QCA","COVID-19 and the measures adopted have been a problem for society at all levels. The aim of the study was to analyze the main predictors of life satisfaction among adolescents in Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 902 adolescents from Ecuador aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 15.30; SD = 1.28). Variables such as life satisfaction, resilience, emotional symptomatology, and worries about COVID-19 were assessed. Two statistical methodologies were compared (structural equation models (SEM) and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)) to analyze the possible influence of worries about COVID-19, resilience and emotional symptomatology towards life satisfaction. The results indicated that in both models, worries about COVID-19 were negatively related to life satisfaction. However, having a greater worry, specifically for physical health issues, was associated with better life satisfaction. SEM models indicate that depression is negatively related to life satisfaction. In QCA models, high levels of life satisfaction are explained by low levels of anxiety and depression. Thus, resilience seems to play a mediating role in life satisfaction, although this is only true for the depression variable. It is necessary to detect signs of risk in this population and strengthen resilience in them as elements that can facilitate their adequate coping with their adverse situation.","Herrera, Lacomba-Trejo, Valero-Moreno, Montoya-Castilla, PÃƒÂ©rez-MarÃƒÂ­n","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9030439","20220325","COVID-19; adolescence; life satisfaction; psychopathology; resilience; worries about COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29053,""
"Physicians' Compliance with COVID-19 Regulations: The Role of Emotions and Trust","(1) Background: Medical teams are at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision making among medical staff is important for promoting and maintaining the health of patients and staff. This study examines factors associated with physicians' decision making and preventive behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. (2) Methods: An online survey was conducted among 187 Israeli physicians in April and May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included the levels of physicians' perceived threat and perceived risk during the epidemic, trust in the health system, emotions, and the degree of compliance with hygiene rules and mandated behaviors. (3) Results: Most physicians reported complying with the rules of hygiene at work (73%) and full compliance with Ministry of Health guidelines (61%). The findings show that higher levels of trust, positive emotions, and threat and risk perceptions were associated with a higher degree of compliance with Ministry of Health guidelines and more careful decision making among physicians. (4) Conclusions: Levels of trust in the health system and positive emotions among healthcare staff during the pandemic are related to careful adherence to guidelines. Taking steps to maintain physical and mental health among healthcare staff is important for their functioning and for maintaining public health.","Shahrabani, Bord, Admi, Halberthal","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10030582","20220325","COVID-19; emotions; perceptions; physicians; preventive health; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29054,""

In this observational study, data were collected after COVID-19 voluntary isolation. Patients were divided into two groups according to their fatigue severity reported with the Fatigue Severity Scale. Health status was assessed by the EuroQol-5D, anxiety and depression by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and disability by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. A total of 120 patients were included in the study. Patients with severe fatigue obtained higher impairment results compared to patients without severe fatigue, with significant differences in all the variables (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05).

"The Elephant in the Room: A Cross-Sectional Study on the Stressful Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mental Healthcare Workers","Despite extensive research on COVID-19's impact on healthcare workers, few studies have targeted mental health workers (MHWs) and none have investigated previous traumatic events. We investigated psychological distress in MHWs after the first lockdown in Italy to understand which COVID-19, sociodemographic, and professional variables represented greater effects, and the role of previous trauma. The survey included sociodemographic and professional questions, COVID-19 variables, and the questionnaires Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21). On the 271 MHWs who completed the survey (73.1% female; mean age 45.37), we obtained significant effects for contagion fear, experience of patients' death, increased workload, and worse team relationship during the first wave. Nurses were more affected and showed more post-traumatic stress symptoms, assessed by IES-R, and more depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, assessed by DASS-21. The strongest risk factors for distress were greater age, professional role, increased workload, worse team relationship, and separation from family members. Previous experience of severe human suffering and unwanted sexual experiences negatively impacted IES-R and DASS-21 scores. Being a psychiatrist or psychologist/psychotherapist and good team relationships were protective factors. Recent but also previous severe stressful events might represent relevant risk factors for distress, reducing resilience skills. Identifying vulnerable factors and professional categories may help in the development of dedicated measures to prevent emotional burden and support psychological health. Highlights: Psychological distress in mental health workers in the COVID-19 pandemic is more frequent in nurses, who experience more depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Previous and recent stressful events are risk factors for distress and should guide intervention strategies.","Minelli, Silva, Barlati, Vezzoli, Carletto, Isabello, Bortolomasi, Nibbio, Lisoni, Menesello, Perusi, Accardo, Deste, Vita","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12030408","20220325","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental healthcare workers; stress-related disorder; stressful life events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29056,""
"Effects of Phone-Based Psychological Intervention on Caregivers of Patients with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: A Six-Months Study during the COVID-19 Emergency in Italy","Caregivers of patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) experience higher level of burden, stress, and depression, due to premature role changes and social isolation. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compelled restrictions regarding social interactions and mobility in Italy from March 2020, prompting telemedicine approaches for supporting patients and their families confined at home. We reported our experience regarding the effects of psychological phone-intervention (phone-I) on EOAD caregivers during pandemic. Twenty caregivers of EOAD patients were randomly assigned to treatment (TG) or control (CG) group. TG weekly underwent a phone-I for one month. All participants were assessed for caregiver burden and needs, anxiety and depression levels, and subjective impact of traumatic events at baseline (T0), at the fifth week (T1) and after 6 months (T2) from phone-I. We observed higher vulnerability to post-traumatic stress in TG compared to CG in all timepoints (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05). Decreased stress effects and caregiver burden were revealed in TG at T1 compared to T0 (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05), although showing an increase of these measures at T2 in the treated caregivers. Our findings suggest that although TG showed a peculiar vulnerability to post-traumatic stress, they showed increased wellbeing immediately after phone-I. However, this benefit disappeared six months later, along with the second infection wave, probably due to ""exhaustion stage"" achievement in ""General Adaptation Syndrome"". This trend may suggest a beneficial but not solving role of a prompt phone-I on burden of caregivers of EOAD patients during the SARS-CoV-2 emergency.","De Stefano, Esposito, Iavarone, Carpinelli Mazzi, Siciliano, Buonanno, Atripaldi, Trojsi, Tedeschi","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12030310","20220325","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; COVID-19; EOAD; caregiver; psychological intervention; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29057,""
"Fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and social support among college students","The present study prospectively examined the association between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety and whether social support moderated this association among college students. 1,539 students from 11 universities in the United States completed two online surveys, one prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and one during the pandemic. Hierarchical linear regressions assessed the impact of COVID-19 fears and social support on anxiety, after accounting for pre-pandemic anxiety and demographics. Results supported that adding fear of COVID-19 to the regression model resulted in a significant increase in variance explained over demographics and pre-pandemic anxiety. Social support did not moderate the association between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety.

"Long-term cognitive impairments following COVID-19: a possible impact of hypoxia","Cognitive and emotional disorders frequently persist after recovery from the acute symptoms of COVID-19; possible explanations include pneumonia-induced hypoxia, infection of the central nervous system, and microstrokes. The objective of the present study was to characterize the impact of hypoxia on the cognitive and psychological profile following COVID-19. Sixty-two patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and divided into two groups based on disease severity: outpatients with no pulmonary complications vs. inpatients with hypoxemic pneumonia having received oxygen therapy. All the participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleepiness, attentional, memory and executive processes, and social cognition. For the inpatients, we also collected laboratory data (blood gas, blood glucose, fibrin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein). Cognitive disorders was found in patients with COVID-19: at least 18% had an impairment of memory and 11% had attentional dysfunctions. A high level of fatigue (90% of the patients), anxiety (52%), and depression (50%) was also observed. The impairments in attentional (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001 for omission and commission in CPT 3) and memory (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003 for Index Cue Efficiency from free and cue selected reminding test) functions were greater in COVID-19 inpatients that in COVID-19 outpatients. In contrast, levels of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were similarly high in both groups. These findings might help to improve the management of COVID-19 patients as a function of the disease severity in particular for patients with hypoxia.","Dondaine, Ruthmann, Vuotto, Carton, GelÃƒÂ©, Faure, Deplanque, Bordet","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-022-11077-z","20220324","Attention; COVID-19; Cognition; Hypoxia; Memory; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29059,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on Chinese healthcare workers: a systematic review and meta-analysis","This study aimed at investigating five dimensions of the psychological impact (post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance or profession-related burnout) of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCW) in China. Studies that evaluated at least one of the five target dimensions of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCW in China were included. Studies with no data of our interest were excluded. Relevant Databases were searched from inception up to June 10, 2020. Preprint articles were also included. The methodological quality was assessed using the checklist recommended by AHRQ. Both the rate of prevalence and the severity of symptoms were pooled. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020197126) on July 09, 2020. We included 44 studies with a total of 65,706 HCW participants. Pooled prevalence rates of moderate to severe PTSS, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were 27% (95% CI 16%-38%), 17% (13-21%), 15% (13-16%), and 15% (7-23%), respectively; while the prevalence of mild to severe level of PTSS, anxiety, and depression was estimated as 31% (25-37%), 37% (32-42%) and 39% (25-52%). Due to the lack of data, no analysis of profession-related burnout was pooled. Subgroup analyses indicated higher prevalence of moderate to severe psychological impact in frontline HCW, female HCW, nurses, and HCW in Wuhan. About a third of HCW in China showed at least one dimension of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the prevalence of moderate and severe syndromes was relatively low. Studies on profession-related burnout, long-term impact, and the post-stress growth are still needed.","Xiong, Fritzsche, Pan, LÃƒÂ¶hlein, Leonhart","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02264-4","20220324","COVID-19; Chinese healthcare workers; Mental health; Psychological impact; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29060,""
"Is fear of COVID-19 higher in individuals residing in more deprived areas? A nationwide study","This study investigated the association between various types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related fear and the level of area deprivation in Korea. Different types of COVID-19-related fear were examined, namely fear of infection, fear of dying from infection, fear of public criticism, fear of a family member getting infected and fear of economic loss. The level of area deprivation was measured based on the Area Deprivation Index, which was calculated based on population census data. The association between various types of COVID-19-related fear and the level of area deprivation was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. This study included 199Ã‚Â 859 individuals from the 253 administrative divisions in South Korea. Findings indicated that fear was most common in individuals residing in the most deprived areas, followed by those in the mediocre and least deprived areas (fear of infection: odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.09; fear of dying from infection: OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19-1.28; fear of public criticism: OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.24; fear of a family member getting infected: OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.18).

"Conversations that warm the heart: positive and negative links to the mental health challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic","Public-health precautions to curb Covid-19 (e.g. lockdowns) threaten mental health and emotional wellbeing, especially for today's youngest adults. Their overuse of solitary, screen-mediated social media, plus underdeveloped in-person conversation skills, heighten their vulnerability to mental health problems such as loneliness, anxiety and depression. To explore interconnections among variables such as social media use, empathic skills for in-person conversation and strategies for coping with Covid-19 anxiety, Australian 18- to 26-year-olds took several novel in-depth questionnaire measures that were purpose-built for the present research. Main findings were threefold: (i) Individuals who most frequently and wholeheartedly enjoyed live in-person conversations with friends suffered the most Covid-19 anxiety, worry and stress during periods of pandemic restriction. (ii) Empathic conversational skills were highest among those who conversed in-person (by phone or face-to-face) most often and were lowest for those who rarely did so and/or had little skill with in-person conversation. (iii) Those who gained the greatest relief from anxiety (e.g. about Covid-19) through solitary use of screen-based social media and games had the fewest empathic conversational skills. Implications of these findings for suggesting possible future interventions to help young people cope with public health measures such as lockdowns and to foster community health and wellbeing are discussed.","Peterson","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdac034","20220324","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29062,""
"Testing both affordability-availability and psychological-coping mechanisms underlying changes in alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic","Two theoretical perspectives have been proffered to explain changes in alcohol use during the pandemic: the 'affordability-availability' mechanism (i.e., drinking decreases due to changes in physical availability and/or reduced disposable income) and the 'psychological-coping' mechanism (i.e., drinking increases as adults attempt to cope with pandemic-related distress). We tested these alternative perspectives via longitudinal analyses of the COVID-19 Psychological Consortium (C19PRC) Study data (spanning three timepoints during March to July 2020). Respondents provided data on psychological measures (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, paranoia, extraversion, neuroticism, death anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, resilience), changes in socio-economic circumstances (e.g., income loss, reduced working hours), drinking motives, solitary drinking, and 'at-risk' drinking (assessed using a modified version of the AUDIT-C). Structural equation modelling was used to determine (i) whether 'at-risk' drinking during the pandemic differed from that recalled before the pandemic, (ii) dimensions of drinking motives and the psychosocial correlates of these dimensions, (iii) if increased alcohol consumption was predicted by drinking motives, solitary drinking, and socio-economic changes. The proportion of adults who recalled engaging in 'at-risk' drinking decreased significantly from 35.9% pre-pandemic to 32.0% during the pandemic. Drinking to cope was uniquely predicted by experiences of anxiety and/or depression and low resilience levels. Income loss or reduced working hours were not associated with coping, social enhancement, or conformity drinking motives, nor changes in drinking during lockdown. In the earliest stage of the pandemic, psychological-coping mechanisms may have been a stronger driver to changes in adults' alcohol use than 'affordability-availability' alone.","McBride, Bunting, Harkin, Butter, Shevlin, Murphy, Mason, Hartman, McKay, Hyland, Levita, Bennett, Stocks, Gibson-Miller, Martinez, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Bentall","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265145","20220324","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29063,""
"Behavioural Activation for Social IsoLation (BASIL+) trial (Behavioural activation to mitigate depression and loneliness among older people with long-term conditions): Protocol for a fully-powered pragmatic randomised controlled trial","Depression is a leading mental health problem worldwide. People with long-term conditions are at increased risk of experiencing depression. The COVID-19 pandemic led to strict social restrictions being imposed across the UK population. Social isolation can have negative consequences on the physical and mental wellbeing of older adults. In the Behavioural Activation in Social IsoLation (BASIL+) trial we will test whether a brief psychological intervention (based on Behavioural Activation), delivered remotely, can mitigate depression and loneliness in older adults with long-term conditions during isolation. We will conduct a two-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial across several research sites, to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the BASIL+ intervention. Participants will be recruited via participating general practices across England and Wales. Participants must be aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 with two or more long-term conditions, or a condition that may indicate they are within a 'clinically extremely vulnerable' group in relation to COVID-19, and have scored Ã¢â€°Â¥5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), to be eligible for inclusion. Randomisation will be 1:1, stratified by research site. Intervention participants will receive up to eight intervention sessions delivered remotely by trained BASIL+ Support Workers and supported by a self-help booklet. Control participants will receive usual care, with additional signposting to reputable sources of self-help and information, including advice on keeping mentally and physically well. A qualitative process evaluation will also be undertaken to explore the acceptability of the BASIL+ intervention, as well as barriers and enablers to integrating the intervention into participants' existing health and care support, and the impact of the intervention on participants' mood and general wellbeing in the context of the COVID-19 restrictions. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with intervention participants, participant's caregivers/supportive others and BASIL+ Support Workers. Outcome data will be collected at one, three, and 12 months post-randomisation. Clinical and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms at the three-month follow up, measured by the PHQ9. Secondary outcomes include loneliness, social isolation, anxiety, quality of life, and a bespoke health services use questionnaire.

"The association of COVID-19 employment shocks with suicide and safety net use: An early-stage investigation","This paper examines whether the COVID-19-induced employment shocks are associated with increases in suicides and safety net use in the second and third quarters of 2020. We exploit plausibly exogenous regional variation in the magnitude of the employment shocks in Japan and adopt a difference-in-differences research design to examine and control for possible confounders. Our preferred point estimates suggest that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2020 is associated with, approximately, an additional 0.52 suicides, 28 unemployment benefit recipients, 88 recipients of a temporary loan program, and 10 recipients of public assistance per 100,000 population per month. A simple calculation based on these estimates suggests that if a region experienced a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate caused by the COVID-19 crisis in the second quarter of 2020, which is roughly equivalent to the third-highest regional employment shock, this would be associated with 37.4%, 60.5%, and 26.5% increases in the total, female, and male suicide rates respectively in July 2020 compared with July 2019. These results are primarily correlational rather than causal due to the limitation of our data and research design, but our baseline findings are robust to several different model specifications.","Ando, Furuichi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264829","20220324","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29065,""
"The Effectiveness of Psychoeducational Interventions in Adolescents' Anxiety: A Systematic Review Protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on increasing anxiety in adolescents. This systematic review aims to identify the most effective psychoeducational interventions for reducing anxiety in adolescents following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). The inclusion and exclusion criteria have been defined, and the search strategy has been planned. The search strategy will aim to locate both published and unpublished studies using, among other databases: CINAHL Plus with Full Text; PubMed; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; and the JBI Database of Systematic Reviews. Following the search, all identified citations will be collated and uploaded into Endnote, and duplicates removed. Titles and abstracts will then be screened by two independent reviewers and by a third reviewer if a disagreement occurs. The results of the search will be reported in full in the final systematic review and presented in the PRISMA flow diagram. Eligible studies will be critically appraised for methodological quality using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the JBI. Data will be extracted from the studies included using the standardized JBI data extraction tool. For data synthesis, studies will be pooled using JBI SUMARI. The GRADE approach for grading the certainty of evidence will be followed, and a summary of findings will be created using GRADEPro GDT software.

"Sleep, Stress, and Symptoms Among People With Heart Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns about the effects of stress on sleep and mental health, particularly among people with chronic conditions, including people with heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to examine changes in sleep, sleep-related cognitions, stress, anxiety, and depression among people with HF who participated in a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia before the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants self-reported sleep characteristics, symptoms, mood, and stress at baseline, 6 months after cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or HF self-management education (attention control), and during the pandemic. The sample included 112 participants (mean age, 63 Ã‚Â± 12.9 years; 47% women; 13% Black; 68% New York Heart Association class II or III). Statistically significant improvements in sleep, stress, mood, and symptoms that occurred 6 months post treatment were sustained during the pandemic. Improving sleep and symptoms among people with HF may improve coping during stressful events, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia may be protective.","O'Connell, Jeon, Conley, Linsky, Redeker","https://doi.org/10.1097/JCN.0000000000000906","20220324","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29067,""
"Changes Among Mexican Adults in Physical Activity and Screen Time During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period and Association With Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress, May 29-July 31, 2020","We examined the association between changes in physical activity and leisure screen time and mental health outcomes during the early stages of the recommended COVID-19 stay-at-home period in a national sample of Mexican adults aged 18 years or older. A cross-sectional online survey conducted from May 29 through July 31, 2020, among 1,148 participants, reported time spent in physical activity and leisure screen time during a typical week before (retrospectively) and a week during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period. Mental health outcomes during this period were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between changes in physical activity and leisure screen time and mental health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES), adjusting for potential confounders. Compared with maintaining high levels of physical activity or increasing them, decreasing physical activity was associated with higher stress scores overall, and among people of high SES, with higher scores for DASS-21, depression, and anxiety. Among participants of low and medium SES only, increasing screen time was associated with higher DASS-21, depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared with maintaining low or decreasing leisure screen time. Results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity and limited leisure screen time on mental health in the context of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions.","JÃƒÂ¡uregui, Argumedo, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Alcaraz, Contreras-Manzano, Salinas-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Salvo","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.210324","20220324","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29068,""

"Substance Use, Financial Stress, Employment Disruptions, and Anxiety among Veterans during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in financial, employment, and mental health challenges. In general, American veterans report high rates of substance use, which may be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with pre-existing mental health problems, employment disruptions, or financial stress may be particularly vulnerable. We examined the relationships between pre-existing self-report screens for a probable anxiety disorder, COVID-19-related financial stress, employment disruption (e.g., lost job, reduced hours), and alcohol, cannabis, and cigarette use during the pandemic among 1230 veterans (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 34.5; 89% male). Participants were recruited through various social media sites and completed an online survey 1Ã‚Â month prior to implementation of the nationwide physical distancing guidelines in the United States (February 2020). Six months later (August 2020), they completed a follow-up survey. Compared to veterans who screened negative for anxiety prior to the pandemic, veterans who screened positive reported consuming more drinks per week (<i>b</i> = 3.05), were more likely to use cannabis (<i>OR</i> = 6.53), and smoked more cigarettes (<i>b</i> = 2.06) during the first 6Ã‚Â months of the pandemic. Financial stress was positively associated with alcohol (<i>b</i> = 1.09) and cannabis use (<i>OR</i> = 1.90). Alcohol use was heaviest among veterans with a positive pre-existing anxiety screen and high financial stress. Moreover, veterans who experienced employment disruption due to the pandemic consumed less alcohol but were more likely to use cannabis during the pandemic. Veterans with pre-pandemic anxiety and pandemic-related financial stress may be using substances at higher rates and may benefit from intervention to mitigate negative substance use-related outcomes. Findings also enhance our understanding of veteran substance use behaviors following disruptions in employment due to the pandemic.","Tran, Fitzke, Wang, Davis, Pedersen","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221080413","20220324","anxiety; pandemic; stress; substance use; veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29072,""

"Creativity, Boredom Proneness and Well-Being in the Pandemic","Throughout the course of the pandemic, it has become clear that the strictures of social isolation and various levels of lockdown constraints have impacted people's well-being. Here, our aim was to explore relations between trait dispositions associated with boredom proneness, self-regulation and well-being using data collected early in the pandemic. Specifically, we explored whether the tendency to engage in everyday creative pursuits (e.g., making your own greeting cards) would act as a prophylactic against poor well-being. Results showed that well-being was higher for those individuals who increased engagement with creative pursuits during the early stages of the pandemic. That is, people who engaged more in everyday creative activities also reported higher levels of self-esteem, optimism, and positive affect. In contrast, those who pursued fewer creative outlets had higher levels of depression and anxiety, were higher in boredom proneness, and reported experiencing more negative affect. As we emerge from the pandemic, these data provide a clue as to how people might plan to cope adaptively with the restrictive circumstances this extreme world event engendered. More generally, these data provide support for the notion that everyday creativity (and not necessarily creative expertise) has positive associations for well-being.","Brosowsky, Barr, Mugon, Scholer, Seli, Danckert","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12030068","20220325","COVID-19 pandemic; boredom proneness; creativity; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29075,""

"Role of Telemedicine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Telemedicine plays an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly during a pandemic such as COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of telemedicine in managing IBD are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the impact of telemedicine with that of standard care on the management of IBD. We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases on April 22, 2020. Randomized controlled trials comparing telemedicine with standard care in patients with IBD were included, while conference abstracts, letters, reviews, laboratory studies, and case reports were excluded. The IBD-specific quality of life (QoL), disease activity, and remission rate in patients with IBD were assessed as primary outcomes, and the number of in-person clinic visits per patient, patient satisfaction, psychological outcome, and medication adherence were assessed as secondary outcomes. Review Manage 5.3 and Stata 15.1 were used for data analysis. A total of 17 randomized controlled trials (2571 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. The telemedicine group had higher IBD-specific QoL than the standard care group (standard mean difference 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.34; P.03). The number of clinic visits per patient in the telemedicine group was significantly lower than that in the standard care group (standard mean difference -0.71, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.36; P&lt;.001). Subgroup analysis showed that adolescents in the telemedicine group had significantly higher IBD-specific QoL than those in the standard care group (standard mean difference 0.42, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69; I2=0; P.002), but there was no significant difference between adults in the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in disease activity, remission rate, patient satisfaction, depression, self-efficacy, generic QoL, and medication adherence outcomes between the telemedicine and standard care groups. Telemedicine intervention showed a promising role in improving IBD-specific QoL among adolescents and decreased the number of clinic visits among patients with IBD.

"The Impact of Isolation During COVID-19 on Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in the Geriatric Population: A Narrative Review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has been employed to decrease the spread of COVID-19, especially within the geriatric population; however, the resulting loneliness and isolation carry their own detrimental effects. Loneliness resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may also have negative implications on those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this review was to identify the role of loneliness specific to the recent COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to the prevalence and severity of chronic pain in the geriatric population and to provide an overview for clinicians. Narrative review. A literature search was conducted using combinations of relevant search terms. Databases included PubMed and relevant grey literature sources. Reference lists of selected articles were also searched for additional relevant literature. Recent literature supports that social isolation and loneliness stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have negative implications on chronic musculoskeletal pain. Loneliness has been well documented to have deleterious effects on physical and mental health, and it is increasingly linked to worsening debility and pain interference for those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. This has been found to be most prominent in the geriatric population, who are at the greatest risk for social decline and loneliness. Loneliness has also been found to have negative effects on cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, and mental health, as well as cognitive decline. Potential selection bias due to the narrative review design. Some included studies required the use of online questionnaires, which may not be accessible for the geriatric population, those without technology literacy, or low socioeconomic status populations. Future studies should emphasize screening patients for access to technological devices and reliable internet while partnering with community programs focused on digital literacy and resource access. A myriad of deleterious effects stemming from social isolation and loneliness have been documented, of which geriatric populations are especially susceptible. Both early identification of at-risk patients and safe interventions are essential to mitigate loneliness and stop the progression of debility. Further resources and research are necessary to illuminate how best to proceed, both in the setting of the ongoing pandemic and how interventions can be applied to alleviate suffering in those with limited ability to receive hospital or clinic-based care.","Gonder, Orr, Khan","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+Isolation+During+COVID-19+on+Chronic+Musculoskeletal+Pain+in+the+Geriatric+Population:+A+Narrative+Review.","20220325"," COVID-19 pandemic;  geriatric;  loneliness;  mental health;  musculoskeletal pain;  pain medicine&#13;;  social isolation; Chronic pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29078,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Interventional Pain Management Practices is Significant and Long-Lasting: An Interventional Pain Management Physician Survey","As with many others in the house of medicine, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the practice of interventional pain management. This in part relates to variousÃ‚ state health authority or medical board restrictions with reductions in patient volume for evaluations, follow-ups, and procedures. Of course, the pandemic continues to persist which is in turn leading to longer-lasting effects. Our previous survey was performed in March 2020. At that time, there was a national lockdown in the United States with COVID-19 disease qualifying as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The pandemic caused by COVID-19 disease continues to have far-reaching implications on how we deliver routine care to patients and its effect on patient care, economic aspects, and health of interventional pain management providers. To assess the current and expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on interventional pain management practices in a physician survey. The study was performed based on performance in 2021 compared to the 2019 pre-COVID era. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) administered a 16-question survey to their members by contacting them via a commercially available online marketing company platform. The survey was completed on www.constantcontact.com. The results showed that 88% of the providers experienced a reduction in income and a similar number expect decreases over the next 12 months. A large proportion of respondents (73.3%) reported a reduction in revenue of 11%-25%. In contrast, another 21.5% reported a revenue decline of 26%-50%, and 29% reported 11%-25% increase in expenses. Overall, new patient volume decreased 11%-25% based on the response from almost 63%, whereas almost 9% reported a decline of 26%-50%. In contrast, established patient volume declined 1%-10% as reported by 64% of the respondents, compared to an 11%-25% decrease by a small proportion of 14%. All interventional procedures showed significant decreases across the board, with 69% of the respondents reporting a decline in-office procedures, 64% in ambulatory surgery center (ASC) procedures, and 57% in hospital outpatient department (HOPD) procedures, ranging from 11%-25%. The survey included a relatively small number of member physicians which could introduce sampling error. Consequently, it may not be generalizable for other specialties or even to pain medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic has put interventional pain practices throughout the United States under considerable financial and psychological stress. This study seeks to quantify the extent of economic loss and other challenges resultant from the pandemic. Almost 99% reported a decrease in revenues in the last 12 months, with 86% reporting an expected reduction in the next 12 months and 49% reporting an increase in expenses. Declines have been reported in all sectors with new patients, office procedures, ASC, and HOPD procedures, except for established patient visits, which have shown minor declines compared to other domains.

"Fourth Wave of Opioid (Illicit Drug) Overdose Deaths and Diminishing Access to Prescription Opioids and Interventional Techniques: Cause and Effect","In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, data has shown that age-adjusted overdose death rates involving synthetic opioids, psychostimulants, cocaine, and heroin have been increasing, including prescription opioid deaths, which were declining, but, recently, reversing the trends. Contrary to widely held perceptions, the problem of misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription opioids has been the least of all the factors in recent years. Consequently, it is important to properly distinguish between the role of illicit and prescription opioids in the current opioid crisis. Multiple efforts have been based on consensus on administrative policies for certain harm reduction strategies for individuals actively using illicit drugs and reducing opioid prescriptions leading to curbing of medically needed opioids, which have been ineffective. While there is no denial that prescription opioids can be misused, abused, and diverted, the policies have oversimplified the issue by curbing prescription opioids and the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of severely limiting prescription opioids, without acknowledgement that opioids have legitimate uses for persons suffering from chronic pain. Similar to the opioid crisis, interventional pain management procedures have been affected by various policies being applied to reduce overuse, abuse, and finally utilization. Medical policies have been becoming more restrictive with reduction of access to certain procedures, with the pendulum swinging too far in the direction of limiting interventional techniques. Recent utilization assessments have shown a consistent decline for most interventional techniques, with a 18.7% decrease from 2019 to 2020. The causes for these dynamic changes are multifactorial likely including the misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, the relative ease of access to illicit synthetic opioids and more recently issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, recent publications have shown association of dose tapering with overdose or mental health crisis among patients prescribed long-term opioids. These findings are leading to the hypothesis that federal guidelines may inadvertently be contributing to an increase in overall opioid deaths and diminished access to interventional techniques. Together, these have resulted in a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic. A narrative review. The fourth wave results from a confluence of multiple factors, including misapplication of CDC guidelines, the increased availability of illicit drugs, the COVID-19 pandemic, and policies reducing access to interventional procedures. The CDC guidelines and subsequent regulatory atmosphere have led to aggressive tapering up to and including, at times, the overall reduction or stoppage of opioid prescriptions. Forced tapering has been linked to an increase of 69% for overdoses and 130% for mental health crisis. The data thus suggests that the diminution in access to opioid prescriptions may be occurring simultaneously with an increase in illicit narcotic use.Combined with CDC guidelines, the curbing of opioid prescriptions to medically needed individuals, among non-opioid treatments, interventional techniques have been affected with declining utilization rates and medical policies reducing access to such modalities. The opioid overdose waves over the past three decades have resulted from different etiologies. Wave one was associated with prescription opioid overdose deaths and wave two with the rise in heroin and overdose deaths from 1999 to 2013. Wave three was associated with a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths. Sadly, wave four continues to escalate with increasing number of deaths as a confluence of factors including the CDC guidelines, the COVID pandemic, increased availability of illicit synthetic opioids and the reduction of access to interventional techniques, which leads patients to seek remedies on their own.","Manchikanti, Singh, Staats, Trescot, Prunskis, Knezevic, Soin, Kaye, Atluri, Boswell, Abd-Elsayed, Hirsch","https://www.google.com/search?q=Fourth+Wave+of+Opioid+(Illicit+Drug)+Overdose+Deaths+and+Diminishing+Access+to+Prescription+Opioids+and+Interventional+Techniques:+Cause+and+Effect.","20220325"," Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;  Drug Enforcement Agency;  Food and Drug Administration;  access to interventional techniques;  conflicts of interest&#13;;  rapid tapering; Opioid overdose deaths","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29080,""
"Lockdown stringency and paediatric self-harm presentations during COVID-19 pandemic: retrospective cohort study","Lockdown during the pandemic has had significant impacts on public mental health. Previous studies suggest an increase in self-harm and suicide in children and adolescents. There has been little research on the roles of stringent lockdown. To investigate the mediating and predictive roles of lockdown policy stringency measures in self-harm and emergency psychiatric presentations. This was a retrospective cohort study. We analysed data of 2073 psychiatric emergency presentations of children and adolescents from 23 hospital catchment areas in ten countries, in March to April 2019 and 2020. Lockdown measure stringency mediated the reduction in psychiatric emergency presentations (incidence rate ratio of the natural indirect effect [IRRNIE] = 0.41, 95% CI [0.35, 0.48]) and self-harm presentations (IRRNIE = 0.49, 95% CI [0.39, 0.60]) in 2020 compared with 2019. Self-harm presentations among male and looked after children were likely to increase in parallel with lockdown stringency. Self-harm presentations precipitated by social isolation increased with stringency, whereas school pressure and rows with a friend became less likely precipitants. Children from more deprived neighbourhoods were less likely to present to emergency departments when lockdown became more stringent. Lockdown may produce differential effects among children and adolescents who self-harm. Development in community or remote mental health services is crucial to offset potential barriers to access to emergency psychiatric care, especially for the most deprived youths. Governments should aim to reduce unnecessary fear of help-seeking and keep lockdown as short as possible. Underlying mediation mechanisms of stringent measures and potential psychosocial inequalities warrant further research.","Wong, Vaezinejad, Plener, Mehdi, Romaniuk, Barrett, Hussain, Lloyd, Tolmac, Rao, Chakrabarti, Carucci, Moghraby, Elvins, Rozali, Skouta, McNicholas, Baig, Stevanovic, Nagy, Davico, Mirza, Tufan, Youssef, Meadowcroft, Ougrin","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.41","20220324","COVID-19; Self-harm; adolescent; children; lockdown; lockdown stringency; psychiatric emergency; retrospective study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29081,""
"An Investigation into the Relation of Coping Skills with Mental Health and Quality of Life in Family Members of Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health care workers, including nurses and their family members, experienced various psychological problems. Coping skills may help them deal with the current challenge and maintain their mental health and improve their quality of life. Therefore, this study investigated the relation of coping skills with mental health and quality of life of the nurses' family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted on the family members of the nurses working at Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord dedicated to admission and hospitalization of COVID-19 infected patients using a census sampling method in 2020. Participation in this study was voluntary and finally 220 persons were included in this study. To prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets or contact, a weblog was created using blogging software that contained questionnaires for collecting data on demographic information, mental health (PHQ-9), coping skills (coping responses inventory [CRI], Billings &amp; Moos), and quality of life (SF-36). The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests in SPSS software version 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Of the 220 participants in this study, 101 participants were male and 119 were female. The mean age of the subjects was 35.78 years, and 56.4% of them had an academic education level. The Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between coping skills and mental health, quality-of-life items, total quality-of-life score, and demographic variables of participants (except education) (P &lt; 0.05). This was a direct relationship in such a way that as the score of coping skills increases, so does the score of mental health and quality of life. Based on the results of regression analysis, the predictive power of mental health, coping skills, and education level was obtained to be 0.634. The coping skill variable was the strongest predictor (ÃƒÅ¸ = 0.467), and after that, the mental health variable (ÃƒÅ¸ = 0.421) had the highest predictive power. The obtained results showed that coping skill is the association between psychological health and quality of life such that the coping skill has a significant direct effect on psychological health and quality of life. The results also showed that, at the time of crisis, further attention should be paid to coping skills to develop and improve the quality of life and psychological health.","Banitalebi, Mohammadi, Torabi, Rabiei, Masoudi","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.22","20220324","COVID-19; Coping skill; coronavirus disease; family members of the nurses; mental health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29082,""
"Suicide Risk in Individuals With and Without Mental Disorders Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of Three Nationwide Cross-Sectional Surveys in Czechia","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on suicidal thoughts and behavior has been widely hypothesized but remains largely unexplored at the population-level. We aimed to assess changes in suicide risk (SR) in people with and without mental disorders, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Czechia. We analyzed data from three nationwide cross-sectional surveys of Czech adults (November 2017, May and November 2020). For the 2017 data collection, we employed paper and pencil interviewing, while for the two 2020 data collections, we used a mixed computer-assisted web interviewing and computer-assisted telephone interviewing approach. All samples were representative in terms of age, gender, education, and area of residence for the Czech adult population (18+). We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to screen for mental disorders and SR. We calculated weighted prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). When compared to baseline, we found a 4% and 6% increase in SR in individuals without mental disorders in pandemic surveys (1.95% (1.45%; 2.44%) vs. 6.29% (5.28%; 7.30%) and 8.42% (7.19%; 9.65%)). Relative to baseline, SR in people with major depressive episode or anxiety disorders was elevated in May and November 2020 (22.35% (17.64%; 27.06%) vs. 36.68% (32.45%; 40.91%) and 38.88% (34.51%; 43.25%)). We found substantially increased SR in both people with and without mental disorders, however, these changes could be partially related to differing data collection methods used in the baseline and subsequent surveys. Ongoing prevention, monitoring and evaluation of nationwide suicidality is warranted.HIGHLIGHTSWe found that suicide risk substantially increased during the pandemicSuicide risk was elevated in both individuals with and without mental disordersOur findings support increased suicide monitoring and prevention.","Kasal, KuklovÃƒÂ¡, KÃƒÂ¥gstrÃƒÂ¶m, Winkler, FormÃƒÂ¡nek","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2022.2051653","20220324","COVID-19; self-injurious behavior; suicidal ideation; suicidal thoughts and behavior; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29083,""
"COVID-19, Oxidative Stress, and Neuroinflammation in the Depression Route","COVID-19 is associated with oxidative stress, peripheral hyper inflammation, and neuroinflammation, especially in individuals with a more severe form of the disease. Some studies provide evidence on the onset or exacerbation of major depressive disorder (MDD), among other psychiatric disorders due to COVID-19. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are associated conditions, especially in the more severe form of MDD and in refractoriness to available therapeutic strategies. Inflammatory cytokines in the COVID-19 hyper inflammation process can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme. IDO activation can reduce tryptophan and increase toxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, which increases glial activation, neuroinflammation, toxicity, and neuronal death. This review surveyed a number of studies and analyzed the mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuroinflammation involved in COVID-19 and depression. Finally, the importance of more protocols that can help elucidate the interaction between these mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and MDD and the possible therapeutic strategies involved in the interaction of these mechanisms are highlighted.","Mingoti, Bertollo, SimÃƒÂµes, Francisco, Bagatini, IgnÃƒÂ¡cio","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-022-02004-y","20220324","COVID-19; Glial activation; Major depressive disorder; Neuroinflammation; Oxidative stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29084,""
"Flattening the quality of life curve? A prospective person-centred study from Norway amid COVID-19","We examined multidimensional, heterogeneous reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated measures to provide further insights into the developmental processes of risk and adaptation. We used three-wave questionnaire data from 8156 individuals participating in the Norwegian County Public Health Survey assessed 1-5Ã‚Â months before and three (June 2020) and nine (December 2020) months after the outbreak. Latent profile and latent transition analyses were used to identify latent quality of life (QoL) classes and multiform changes, their probabilities, and predictors. We identified five distinct QoL classes of varying proportions, namely Flourishing (i.e. 24-40%), Content (31-46%), Content-Symptomatic (8-10%), Languishing (14-20%), and Troubled (2-5%). Despite higher levels of negative affect and lower levels of life satisfaction and positive emotions, most individuals remained in their pre-pandemic QoL profiles. Yet, changes occurred for a meaningful proportion, with transition to a less favourable class more common than to a favourable. Between time 1 and 3, the flourishing and troubled groups decreased by 40% and 60%, while the content and languishing groups increased by 48% and 43%, respectively. Favourable pre-pandemic relational (marital status, support, interpersonal trust, and belonging), health, and economy-related status predicted significantly lower odds of belonging to the high-risk groups both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. Overall, this study shows lower levels of QoL amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but substantial stability in the QoL distribution, and an overall levelling of the QoL distribution. Our findings also underscore the importance of financial, health-related, and social capital to QoL.","Nes, Yu, Hansen, Vedaa, RÃƒÂ¸ysamb, Nilsen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-022-03113-2","20220324","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Latent transition analysis; Quality of life; Subjective wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29085,""
"Outcomes of telemedicine care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience from an intervention program designed for vulnerable population in Brazil","Telehealth plays an important role on the combat of COVID-19. In this context, the SAS Brasil telemedicine program became a viable option in Brazil, where the population faced challenging access to healthcare services during the pandemics. In this study, we describe the sociodemographic profile, reasons for enrollment, outcomes of consultation, and satisfaction of participants who received telemedicine consultations through the SAS program. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the SAS Telemedicine program including consultations performed from July 15, 2020, to April 15, 2021. The study describes the SAS Brasil experience and data collected in the period. Patients' satisfaction perception was evaluated through the Net Promoter Score (NPS). A total of 6490 participants were evaluated, 69.5% of them were female and 40.8% with age from 21 to 40 years. In the period, 22,664 teleconsultations were performed, mainly due to Mental health (40.4%), Respiratory (35.8%), and Nutritional (4.5%) disorders. Out of the 6312 patients with a defined outcome along the period, 96.0% were discharged and 4.0% were referred to presential care. The calculated NPS wasÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°95.77 and most patients answered that they would use the service again if needed (99.21%) and had their issue resolved (89.76%). During the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has been consolidated as a tool that offers access to specialized healthcare with wide acceptance by users and can be implemented in populations in vulnerability situations.","Carneiro, de Pinho, Belo, Bolonhini, Carneiro Neto, Mallet Toueg, Fernandes","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X221089151","20220324","NPS; satisfaction; telemedicine; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29086,""
"Challenges Faced by US Veterinary Technicians in the Workplace During COVID-19","During COVID-19, the demand for veterinary technicians increased due to increased animal care appointments booked, decreased worker productivity, pandemic-related staffing shortages, and adapted methods of care delivery. Research has been conducted to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on educators and human healthcare workers, but there is a lack of literature on veterinary technicians, the animal healthcare equivalent of nurses. The objective of our study was to evaluate how COVID-19 affected veterinary technicians. We distributed an electronic researcher-developed survey-based instrument to veterinary technicians working in the U.S. during COVID-19. We received 1,132 usable responses. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS 26.0. Our respondents were overwhelmingly female (97%) and mostly employed full-time (87%) in a companion animal practice (61%). A majority of respondents reported COVID-19 had a large effect (45%) or completely dominated the work (12%) at their practice. While 52% of respondents felt their efforts during COVID-19 were appreciated, only 43% agreed or strongly agreed their hours were manageable. Support staff availability was completely or barely adequate for 42% of respondents and personal protective equipment was mostly or completely adequate for 60% of respondents. The greatest professional challenges during COVID-19 were being treated worse by animal owners and difficulty communicating with clients (53 and 16% of respondents, respectively). There have been few efforts to document the professional environment experienced by veterinary technicians during COVID-19. This is critical as pre-pandemic data indicate veterinary technicians are high-risk for professional burnout and COVID-19 placed additional burdens on essential workers.","Rowe, Drewery, Anderson, Russo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2022.831127","20220325","PTSD; attrition; burnout; mental health; pandemic; personal protective equipment; veterinary nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29087,""
"Public attitudes to a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2: a mixed-methods study","<b>Background:</b> Human challenge studies involve the deliberate exposure of healthy volunteers to an infectious micro-organism in a highly controlled and monitored way. They are used to understand infectious diseases and have contributed to the development of vaccines. In early 2020, the UK started exploring the feasibility of establishing a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2. Given the significant public interest and the complexity of the potential risks and benefits, it is vital that public views are considered in the design and approval of any such study and that investigators and ethics boards remain accountable to the public. <b>Methods:</b> Mixed methods study comprising online surveys conducted with 2,441 UK adults and in-depth virtual focus groups with 57 UK adults during October 2020 to explore the public's attitudes to a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2 taking place in the UK. <b>Results:</b> There was overall agreement across the surveys and focus groups that a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2 should take place in the UK. Transparency of information, trust and the necessity to provide clear information on potential risks to study human challenge study participants were important. The perceived risks of taking part included the risk of developing long-term effects from COVID, impact on personal commitments and mental health implications of isolation. There were a number of practical realities to taking part that would influence a volunteer's ability to participate (e.g. Wi-Fi, access to exercise, outside space and work, family and pet commitments). <b>Conclusions:</b> The results identified practical considerations for teams designing human challenge studies. Recommendations were grouped: 1) messaging to potential study participants, 2) review of the protocol and organisation of the study, and 3) more broadly, making the study more inclusive and relevant. This study highlights the value of public consultation in research, particularly in fields attracting public interest and scrutiny <b>.</b>","Barker, Collet, Gbesemete, Piggin, Watson, PristerÃƒÂ , Lawerence, Smith, Bahrami-Hessari, Johnson, Baker, Qavi, McGrath, Chiu, Read, Ward","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17516.1","20220325","COVID-19; Ethics; acceptability; consultation; human challenge study; public","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29088,""
"Prolonged lockdown: psychological risk factors among children and their mental health","The most talked phenomenon and sui generis of the modern time, the coronavirus diseases-2019 impacted individuals in a variety of ways. Older adults had a higher risk of vulnerability, while there were negative ramifications among children due to indirect impact. The preventive measures, including closing down of schools, malls and playgrounds as well as practising social distancing served as a shield against the hazard of outbreak. On the contrary, these strategies inculcated fear, anxiety, ambiguous communication and manifestation of externalizing behaviours in children. Children living in dysfunctional families in underprivileged circumstances were more susceptible to abuse during the pandemic, and had increased risk of behavioural symptomology and psychological morbidities. Challenges brought by the new normal for children requires redefining the role of parenting for effective monitoring and intervention to mitigate the symptoms. Preventive strategies outlined by international scientific communities include reflective listening, debriefing and psychological first aid for effective parenting during the ongoing pandemic.","Ilyas, Farooqi","https://doi.org/10.47391/JPMA.1696","20220325","Children, Anxiety, Appetite, Sleep, Mental health, COVID-19, First aid.; Aged; Anxiety; Child; Child Abuse; Humans; Mental Health; Parenting; Risk Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29089,""
"Strengthening Social Capital to Address Isolation and Loneliness in Long-term Care Facilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Systematic Review of Research on Information and Communication Technologies","The COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) by disproportionately harming older adults and heightening social isolation and loneliness (SIL). Living in close quarters with others and in need of around-the-clock assistance, interactions with older adults, which were previously in person, have been replaced by virtual chatting using information and communication technologies (ICTs). ICT applications such as FaceTime, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams video chatting have been overwhelmingly used by families to maintain residents' social capital and subsequently reduce their SIL. Because of the lack of substantive knowledge on this ever-increasing form of social communication, this systematic review intends to synthesize the effects of ICT interventions to address SIL among residents in LTCFs during the COVID-19 period. We will include studies published in Chinese, English, and French from December 2019 onwards. Beyond the traditional search strategy approach, 4 of the 12 electronic databases to be queried will be in Chinese. We will include quantitative and intervention studies as well as qualitative and mixed methods designs. Using a 2-person approach, the principal investigator and one author will blindly screen eligible articles, extract data, and assess risk of bias. In order to improve the first round of screening, a pilot-tested algorithm will be used. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion with a third author. Results will be presented as structured summaries of the included studies. We plan to conduct a meta-analysis if sufficient data are available. A total of 1803 articles have been retrieved to date. Queries of the Chinese databases are ongoing. The systematic review and subsequent manuscript will be completed by the fall of 2022. ICT applications have become a promising avenue to reduce SIL by providing a way to maintain communication between LTCF residents and their families and will certainly remain in the post-COVID-19 period. This review will investigate and describe context-pertinent and high-quality programs and initiatives to inform, at the macro level, policy makers and researchers, frontline managers, and families. These methods will remain relevant in the post-COVID-19 era.

"Cognitive function, psychological distress and adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the Covid-19 pandemic, people were instructed to adhere to three key â€˜transmission-reducing behavioursâ€™ (TRBs); hand washing, wearing of face coverings, and physical distancing. Consistent enactment of these TRBs requires effortful cognitive functioning but multiple features of the pandemic (stress, social isolation, uncertainty) would be expected to detrimentally affect cognitive functioning. The present study assessed cognitive function in a nationally-representative sample of the general public during the pandemic and investigated its association with psychological distress and role in determining adherence to TRBs. Cognitive functioning was not impaired relative to population norms, but was significantly poorer in females than males and in those reporting higher anxiety and depression. General cognitive functioning did not predict adherence to TRBs, but TRB-specific cognitive functioning (forgetting and planning of specific TRBs) partially mediated the relationship between intentions and adherence for physical distancing and hand washing, suggesting that brief planning interventions and regular reminders may help to boost adherence to these TRBs.","Julia Allan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D4-903-AEF","20220325","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; cognitive function; covid-19; transmission reducing behaviours; hand washing; mask wearing; physical distancing","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-26","",29092,""
