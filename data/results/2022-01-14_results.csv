"The mental health of staff working on Intensive Care Units over the COVID-19 winter surge of 2020 in England: a cross sectional survey","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic generated a surge of critically ill patients greater than the NHS capacity. Additionally there have been multiple well-documented impacts associated with the national COVID-19 pandemic surge on ICU workers including an increased prevalence of mental health disorders on a scale potentially sufficient to impair high-quality care delivery. Aim: To identify prevalence of probable mental health disorders, functional impairment and establish demographic and professional predictors of probable mental health disorders, and functional impairment, in ICU staff between November 2020 to April 2021. Methods: English ICU staff were surveyed before, during and after the winter 2020/2021 surge using a survey which comprised of validated measures of mental health. Results: 6080 surveys were completed, by nurses (57.5%), doctors (27.9%), and other healthcare staff (14.5%). Reporting probable mental health disorders increased from 51% (prior to), to 64% (during) and then dropped to 46% (after) the peak. Younger, less experienced and nursing staff were most likely to report probable mental health disorders. Additionally, during and after the winter, over 50% of participants met threshold criteria for functional impairment. Staff who reported probable post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety or depression were more likely to meet threshold criteria for functional impairment. Conclusions: The winter of 2020/2021 was associated with an increase in poor mental health outcomes and functional impairment during a period of peak caseload. These effects are likely to impact on patient care outcomes and the longer-term resilience of the healthcare workforce.","Charlotte Elizabeth Hall; Joanna Milward; Cristina Spoiala; Jaskiran Kaur Bhogal; Dale Weston; Henry W.W Potts; Tristan Caulfield; Micheal Toolan; Kate Kanga; Sarah El-Sheikha; Kevin Fong; Neil Greenberg","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.13.22269151","20220113","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25465,""

"Integration of Negativity, Powerlessness and the Role of the Mediopassive: Resilience Factors and Mechanisms in the Perspective of Religion and Spirituality","Defining psychological resilience while taking into account all of its different facets has proven to be a difficult task, requiring an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach. This article will present some of the theologically relevant current findings of the new research group on ""Resilience in Religion and Spirituality"" (DFG-FOR 2686) working in cooperation between theology, philosophy, psychosomatic medicine, palliative care, and spiritual care (chapter 1). Even though our project builds on factors and mechanisms of resilience already intensively discussed (chapter 2), we will add some further aspects on resilience as a multidimensional and dynamic process of adaption (chapter 3) and on the integration of negative experiences, of endurance, of the formation of powerlessness and of the mediopassive (chapter 4). This will allow for some prospective considerations on understanding challenges and problems of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (chapter 5).","Richter, C.","https://doi.org/10.30965/23642807-bja10027","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Interdisciplinary Journal for Religion and Transformation in Contemporary Society; 7(2):491-513, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25469,""
"Sexual Division of Labor and Confinement among High School Students A Case Study from Aguascalientes, Mexico","This qualitative case study describes how a group of young students from a public high school in Aguascalientes (Mexico) experienced the confinement for the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main finding is the intensification of the sexual division of labor. While women intensified their domestic and care work participation, men were pushed to enter the informal labor market to support their household economy. Men dropped out of school to a greater extent than women, which could mean that unpaid household chores are more compatible with academic tasks compared to paid extra-domestic occupations. The lack of social protection for youth in Mexico exacerbates gender inequalities among young men and women during confinement, impacting their mental health and their autonomy. The paper is based on an ethnographic experience conducted in a public high school from August 2019 to July 2020.","Chavez-Llamas, N.; Ospina-Escobar, A.","https://doi.org/10.18046/recs.i35.4882","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Revista Cs En Ciencias Sociales; 35:41-66, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25470,""
"Women, Telework, and Care Strategies in the Pandemic Context of Chile","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world population in different dimensions and has increased inequalities in different countries. In addition to the effects on the economy and health, transformations in daily life are observed, such as the massification of telework. This has implied the convergence of the domestic and working spaces, significantly affecting working mothers, who have increased their care workload, and impacting their daily routines and mental health. The main objective is to analyze the strategies developed by Chilean mothers, who telework from confinement measures, to deal with the conflict between care tasks and paid work. Through the analysis of eighteen semi-structured interviews, five types of strategies adopted by women in this context of double presence and unequal distribution of tasks were recognized: organizational in the absence of time control, multiplicity and simultaneity of tasks, school support and proximity, work against overload, resistance.","Arteaga-Aguirre, C.; Cabezas-Cartagena, V.; Ramirez-Cid, F.","https://doi.org/10.18046/recs.i35.4879","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Revista Cs En Ciencias Sociales; 35:11-39, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25471,""
"Pandemic Language Teaching: Insights from Brazilian and International Teachers on the Pivot to Emergency Remote Instruction","This article reflects on the experiences of language teachers from Brazil, Spain, France, Cyprus, Costa Rica and Taiwan during the pivot to emergency remote/online instruction during the 2020 pandemic. The research question motivating the study was what language teachers' perceptions regarding online teaching during the pandemic were. Data were analyzed qualitatively, contrasting data from a questionnaire shared in an asynchronous online form with data from focus group interviews carried out via videoconferencing. The analysis of the questionnaire data showed that the vast majority of respondents used different digital technologies to teach online, both synchronously and asynchronously, but felt unprepared to work in this modality, mostly because of lack of institutional support and training. The analysis of the focus group interviews suggested that most teachers expressed concerns as to the limitations of online teaching for interaction and exams. In addition, some teachers displayed negative attitudes towards online teaching due to the lack of preparation and institutional support. This was aggravated by political implications of migrating to online education that could result in precariousness of the teacher profession. The positive aspects highlighted were the possibility of developing more self-directed and autonomous learning, as well as experimenting with different technologies and approaches. Overall, the analysis of the data suggests that, after the pandemic and with due preparation and support, some of the digital technologies and approaches experimented with will be incorporated into pedagogical practices in blended approaches, which represent a real trend and possibility for language teaching in the post-pandemic context.","Sevilla-Pavon, A.; Finardi, K.

"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical Activity Habits, Musculoskeletal Pain, and Mood of Healthcare Workers","Objectives: Self-isolation seems to be the best way to slow down the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, but it may also have negative impact on physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in physical activity habits during the outbreak and also the impact of the pandemic on musculoskeletal pain and mood in correlation with physical activity in healthcare workers. Methods: This study is conducted through Google Forms web survey platform. A total of 310 hospital staffs completed the Google Forms questionnaire in 2 weeks during lockdown and curfew period in Istanbul. The questionnaire included 60 questions including demographic, occupational, COVID-19 exposure data, physical activity habits, musculoskeletal pain, and mood. Results: There was a significant difference between physical activity habits before and after the pandemic (p&lt;0.001). Individuals engaged in regular physical activity (regardless of duration) had significantly higher happiness ratings (p=0.002). No statistically significant difference was found between the duration of physical activity and the musculoskeletal pain during the pandemic. Conclusion: Pandemic caused a decrease in physical activity, an unhappy and anxious mood, and an increase in musculoskeletal pain of healthcare workers. Participants who were doing regular physical activity were less unhappy, but no relationship between exercise and musculoskeletal pain was found which might be related to psychosocial state of the participants who worked under great stress with high effort during the pandemic.","Is, E.

"Satisfaction and Shortfall of OB-GYN Physicians and Radiologists","Ultrasound is pivotal to the practice of obstetrics-gynecology (OB-GYN). In the US, physicians who perform ultrasound are facing the unprecedented need for their services and skills. OB-GYNs, in particular, have been challenged to meet rising demands in womenâ€™s healthcare, as a result of an increasing female population, while the supply of physicians is not keeping pace. The ACOG projects current shortages will continue to grow to a deficit of up to 22,000 OB-GYNs by 2050. The future of the OB-GYN workforce is compromised by an aging OB-GYN population, insufficient OB-GYN residency positions, and a decreasing number of young physicians choosing to specialize in OB-GYN. As a consequence of mismatched supply and demand, practicing OB-GYNs are experiencing alarming rates of medical burnout, jeopardizing their mental health and wellness. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated risks to mental health;however, OB-GYNs have reported higher levels of burnout compared to other specialties, both before and after the pandemic. This article examines the threats to OB-GYNâ€™s central role in the provision of OB-GYN ultrasound, including factors contributing to insufficient growth of the OB-GYN workforce, and the resulting impacts on practicing OB-GYNsâ€™ job satisfaction and overall well-being. Data on medical burnout affecting OB-GYNs, both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, is presented along with a comparison of job satisfaction and wellness data collected from OB-GYNs and radiologistsâ€“the two groups of specialists performing female pelvic and OB ultrasound exams in the US. Understanding the factors that discourage medical graduates from entering into OB-GYN residencies is critical, not only for recruitment but for the development of strategies to support currently practicing OB-GYNs. Prevention of medical burn-out among OB-GYNs will be essential to keep OB-GYNs practicing through retirement age while attracting others to the specialty. The creation of rewarding work environments, which allow for a healthy work-life balance, will be essential to meeting the demand for specialized womenâ€™s health and reproductive care. Protecting the well-being of those practicing now, will be instrumental to the development of a sufficient OB-GYN workforce, and ensure its central role in the provision of OB-GYN ultrasound.","Herber-Valdez, C.; Kupesic-Plavsic, S.","https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10009-1822","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Donald School Journal of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology; 15(4):387-392, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25477,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on people suffering from dysfunctional eating behaviours: a linguistic analysis of the contents shared in an online community during the lockdown","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread several months ago from China and it is now a global pandemic. The experience of lockdown has been an undesirable condition for people with mental health problems, including eating disorders. The present study has the aim of understanding the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with self reported disordered eating behaviours. A linguistic analysis was carried out with regard to the online posts and comments published by 1971 individuals (86% women) in a Facebook online community focusing on EDs during the lockdown. A total of 244 posts and 3603 comments were collected during the 56 days of lockdown (from the 10th of March until the 4th of May 2020) in Italy and were analysed by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software. The results showed that words related to peer support decreased in posts over time, and that anxiety and anger increased in the published comments. Moreover, greater feelings of negativity and anxiety were found in posts and comments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lesser use of words related to positive emotions.

"COVID-19 Pandemic: Influence of Gender Identity on Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels in Canada","Background: This cross-sectional study explored variation of the prevalence of perceived stress, depression and anxiety among different self-identified gender identity groups in the Canadian population during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) respectively. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Results: There were 8267 respondents to the online survey;982 (12.0%) were male-identified, 7120 (86.9%) female-identified, and 92 (1.1%) identified as a diverse gender group. Prevalence rates for clinically meaningful anxiety (333 (41.7%), 2882 (47.6%), 47 (61.0%)), depression (330 (40.2%), 2736 (44.3%), 46 (59.7%)), and stress (702 (79.6%), 5711 (86.4%), 74 (90.2%)) were highest among respondents who self-identified as &ldquo;other gender&rdquo;followed by female-identified and then male-identified, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between gender groups for mean scores on GAD-7 (F (2, 6929) = 18.02, p = 0.00), PHQ-9 (F (2191.4) = 11.17, p &lt; 0.001), and PSS (F (2204.6) = 21.13, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Gender identity differences exist in terms of the prevalence and severity of anxiety, depressive, and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating self-identified gender identity in medical research, clinical practice, and policy.","Chima, Chidi, Shalaby, Reham, Lawal, Mobolaji A.; Vuong, Wesley, Hrabok, Marianne, Gusnowski, April, Surood, Shireen, Greenshaw, Andrew J.; Wells, Kristopher, Agyapong, Vincent I.O.","https://doi.org/10.3390/traumacare2010002","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Trauma Care; 2(1):11-22, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25479,""
"Hygiene Behaviors and SARS-CoV-2-Preventive Behaviors in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Self-Reported Compliance and Associations with Fear, SARS-CoV-2 Risk, and Mental Health in a General Population vs a Psychosomatic Patients Sample in Germany","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hygiene behaviors such as keeping distance, avoiding masses, wearing face masks, and complying with hand hygiene recommendations became imperative. The current study aims to determine factors interrelating with hygiene behaviors. Methods: A total of 4049 individuals (1305 male, 2709 female, aged 18&ndash;80 years) were recruited from rehabilitation clinics or freely on the internet. They were surveyed via online questionnaires between May 2020 and August 2021. Sociodemographics, hygiene behaviors, and fear of COVID-19 infection were assessed. Results: Overall prevalence for hygiene behaviors was: keeping a distance&mdash;88.1%;avoiding mass gatherings&mdash;88.0%;wearing face masks&mdash;96.9%;and hand hygiene&mdash;81.6%, with 70% of the study participants complying with all four researched behaviors. Hygiene behaviors were significantly related to fear in a linear and quadratic fashion. Conclusion: Patients are more compliant according to their self-reported responses than the general population. To improve hygiene behavior, hand hygiene in particular provides options for improvements. A medium level of fear seems to be more functional than too-elevated fear. Behavioral interventions and targeted communication aiming at improving different behaviors in orchestration can help individuals to protect their health and to remain healthy. Accordingly, communication is required to ensure high hygiene standards and patient safety, and to prevent adverse effects.","Lippke, Sonia, Keller, Franziska M.; Derksen, Christina, KÃ¶tting, Lukas, Dahmen, Alina","https://doi.org/10.3390/hygiene2010003","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Hygiene; 2(1):28-43, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25480,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lifestyles and Levels of Anxiety and Depression of Patients with Schizophrenia: A Retrospective Observational Study","The movement restrictions put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic required modification of the population&rsquo;s usual routines, including those of the most vulnerable groups such as patients with schizophrenia. This was a retrospective observational study. We used an online survey to collect information on patient adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener questionnaire), physical exercise (International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form), and tobacco consumption and levels of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) before and during the movement restrictions. A total of 102 people with schizophrenia participated in this study. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown the participants significantly increased the number of minutes spent sitting per day (z = &minus;6.73;p &lt; 0.001), decreased the time they spent walking (z = &minus;6.32;p &lt; 0.001), and increased their tobacco consumption (X2 = 156.90;p &lt; 0.001). These results were also accompanied by a significant increase in their reported levels of anxiety (z = &minus;7.45;p &lt; 0.001) and depression (z = &minus;7.03, p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences in patient diets during the pandemic compared to before the movement restrictions were reported.

"University Students&rsquo;Classroom Emotional Climate and Attitudes during and after COVID-19 Lockdown","With the advent of COVID-19, universities around the world have been forced to move to a fully online mode of delivery because of lockdown policies. This led to a flurry of studies into issues such as internet access, student attitudes to online learning and mental health during lockdown. However, researchers need a validated survey for assessing the classroom emotional climate and student attitudes towards learning in universities that can be used for online, face-to-face or blended delivery. Such a survey could be used to illuminate students&rsquo;perceptions of the experiences that make up learning at university level, in terms of such factors as care from teachers, collaboration and motivation. In this article, we report the validation of a University Classroom Emotional Climate (UCEC) questionnaire and an Attitudes to Learning scale, as well as their use in comparing the classroom emotional climate and attitudes during COVID-19 lockdown (fully online delivery) with post-lockdown (mixed-mode delivery). Female students experienced the post-lockdown condition significantly more positively than during lockdown for all scales except Care, while the only significant difference for males between the during and post-lockdown was their choice to engage with learning (Control) and the degree of Challenge that they found with the learning materials.","McLure, Felicity I.; Koul, Rekha B.; Fraser, Barry J.","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12010031","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(1):31, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25482,""
"Psychosocial Distress in Parents with Children Awaiting Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to resource restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, many pediatric patients are facing substantial delays for surgery, potentially resulting in additional distress for caregivers. We aimed to assess the experiences and psychosocial distress of parents during COVID-19 as they relate to the pandemic, waiting for surgery, and the combined effects of both events. The was a cross-sectional qualitative study. Parents with children who faced treatment delays during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic for elective, non-emergent procedures across a variety of surgical specialties were recruited. Semi-structured telephone interviews and thematic analysis were utilized. Thematic saturation was reached with eighteen participants. Four themes were identified: coping with COVID-19, distress levels, quality and nature of communication with the surgical team, and the experience of COVID-19 related hospital restrictions. Participants reported varying levels of distress due to the delay in surgery, such as the fear of developmental delay or disease progression for their child. They also indicated their own physical and mental health had been impacted by emotional distress related to both COVID-19 and delays in treatment. Most participants experienced the COVID-19-related hospital restrictions as distressing. This related predominantly to limiting in-hospital caregivers to only one caregiver. Participants were found to have substantial levels of psychosocial distress. Targeted social and emotional support may be helpful in reducing parental distress as the pandemic timeframe continues. Within the limits of individual health systems, reducing restrictions to the number of allowed care givers may help allay distress felt by parents.","Forner, David, Leslie, Patricia K.; Aldaihani, Abdullah, Bezuhly, Michael, Noel, Christopher W.; Horne, David, Walling, Simon, Robitaille, Johane, MacLellan, Dawn L.; El-Hawary, Ron, Logan, Karl, Romao, Rodrigo, LaRoche, Robert, Sett, Suvro, Urquhart, Robin, Hong, Paul","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9010087","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Children; 9(1):87, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25483,""
"The Emotional Response to Pandemic of Middle- and High-School Students of an Italian Northern Province: The ERP Study","The COVID-19 outbreak variably affected people&rsquo;s mental reactions worldwide but was only episodically investigated in healthy Italian teenagers. Our aim was to investigate the emotional responses of Italian middle and high school students to the pandemic. An anonymous 10-item questionnaire was distributed in pre-selected school samples. Responders had to score their perceived extent for each reaction from 0 (lowest perception) to 10 (highest perception). A group of adults was selected as control. Generalized linear models were used to estimate differences among adults and students, high school (HS) and middle school (MS) students, and urban (U) and rural (R) MS students. Comparisons were presented as mean difference (&Delta;) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 1512 questionnaires (635 adults, 744 HS, 67 UMS, and 66 RMS) were analyzed. Students appeared more indifferent (&Delta;= 1.97, 1.52&ndash;2.41), anxious (&Delta;= 0.56, 0.07&ndash;1.04), aggressive (&Delta;= 2.21, 1.72&ndash;2.70), and depressed (&Delta;= 1.87, 1.40&ndash;2.34) than adults did, and claimed a higher loss of interest in their activities (&Delta;= 1.21, 0.72&ndash;1.70). Students were less disbelieving (&Delta;= &minus;0.93, &minus;1.50&ndash;0.35) and feared for their loved ones (&Delta;= &minus;0.89, &minus;1.40&ndash;0.39). MS students were less affected by the outbreak than HS students were. Furthermore, R-MS students were significantly less aggressive and depressed, but more indifferent and disbelieving than U-MS. Female sex was an independent factor associated to almost all the questionnaire domains. The pattern of the psychological responses to the pandemic in Italian students proved multifaceted. In addition to anxiety, loss of interest in activities, and depression, aggressiveness emerged as the most characterizing mental attitude in response to the pandemic.","Povero, Massimiliano, Turco, Paola, Dal Negro, Roberto Walter","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9010059","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Children; 9(1):59, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25484,""
"The Impact of Quarantine on Pain Sensation among the General Population in China during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the pandemic era, quarantines might potentially have negative effects and disproportionately exacerbate health condition problems. We conducted this cross-sectional, national study to ascertain the prevalence of constant pain symptoms and how quarantines impacted the pain symptoms and identify the factors associated with constant pain to further guide reducing the prevalence of chronic pain for vulnerable people under the pandemic. The sociodemographic data, quarantine conditions, mental health situations and pain symptoms of the general population were collected. After adjusting for potential confounders, long-term quarantine (&ge;15 days) exposures were associated with an increased risk of constant pain complaints compared to those not under a quarantine (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.26;95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.03, 1.54;p = 0.026). Risk factors including unemployment (OR: 1.55), chronic disease history (OR: 2.38) and infection with COVID-19 (OR: 2.15), and any of mental health symptoms including depression, anxiety, insomnia and PTSD (OR: 5.44) were identified by a multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, mediation analysis revealed that the effects of the quarantine duration on pain symptoms were mediated by mental health symptoms (indirect effects: 0.075, p &lt; 0.001). These results advocated that long-term quarantine measures were associated with an increased risk of experiencing pain, especially for vulnerable groups with COVID-19 infection and with mental health symptoms. The findings also suggest that reducing mental distress during the pandemic might contribute to reducing the burden of pain symptoms and prioritizing interventions for those experiencing a long-term quarantine.","Sun, Jie, Zheng, Yong-Bo, Liu, Lin, Li, Shui-Qing, Zhao, Yi-Miao, Zhu, Xi-Mei, Que, Jian-Yu, Li, Ming-Zhe, Liu, Wei-Jian, Yuan, Kai, Yan, Wei, Liu, Xiao-Guang, Chang, Su-Hua, Chen, Xuan, Gao, Nan, Shi, Jie, Bao, Yan-Ping, Lu, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12010079","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 12(1):79, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25485,""
"The Simplification of Procedures in Portuguese Administrative Law","The present paper intends to provide an overview and a critical assessment of the administrative simplification policies implemented in Portugal over the past 20+ years. Throughout these decades, the major instruments for administrative simplification have been: (i) Decree-Law n. 135/99, of 22 April;(ii) the Simplex programme;(iii) the 2015 new Code of Administrative Procedure and its 2021 amendment;and (iv) the COVID-19 legislation. Although Decree-Law n. 135/99 (i) was the first attempt to specifically address simplification, it was a very thin one. The Simplex programme (ii), created in 2006, was the first cross-sectoral robust policy of simplification;its motto is &ldquo;the simpler the better&rdquo;and it encompassed reforms in all government areas aiming at cutting red tape, promoting administrative efficiency, and making the citizens&rsquo;and the corporations&rsquo;lives easier when dealing with State. The new Code of Administrative Procedure (iii), approved in 2015, brought about specific normative solutions to simplify procedures, namely, prior communications, administrative assistance, procedural conferences, and the electronic one-stop shop. Finally, the COVID-19 legislation (iv) was made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the fact that public health restrictions made it impossible for citizens to establish personal contact with the administration in many cases.","Silveira, JoÃ£o Tiago, Fidalgo de Freitas, Tiago, FabiÃ£o, GonÃ§alo, Assis Raimundo, Miguel","https://doi.org/10.3390/admsci12010009","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Administrative Sciences; 12(1):9, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25486,""
"COVID-19 and Hotel Productivity Changes: An Empirical Analysis Using Malmquist Productivity Index","This research investigates the impact of COVID-19 on hotel productivity change using the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI). For 26 U.S. hotel brands, productivity changes over 10 quarters from the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2020 were analyzed. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the investigated hotels' productivity deteriorated. Decomposition revealed that, whereas technical efficiency change (EC) improved, technological change (TC) regressed, resulting in deterioration of the MPI. The investigated hotels' EC-related practices included enhanced cleaning operations, partnering with a hygiene brand, cutting the workforce, and pay cuts. Practices related to TC included the adoption of new hygiene technology and setting a new standard at the organizational level through the formation of a global council and accreditation related to disinfection and hygiene. Our results show that though U.S. hotels are trying to improve their productivity by efficiently utilizing resources, frontier technology's regress is decreasing productivity. Our results support the importance of investment in technology for productivity management. This research provides empirical evidence for the need for hotels to pursue technological advances to overcome the pandemic.","Kim, C.; Kang, H.

"The mental health of NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: two-wave Scottish cohort study","BackgroundHealth and social care workers (HSCWs) are at risk of experiencing adverse mental health outcomes (e.g. higher levels of anxiety and depression) because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can have a detrimental effect on quality of care, the national response to the pandemic and its aftermath.AimsA longitudinal design provided follow-up evidence on the mental health (changes in prevalence of disease over time) of NHS staff working at a remote health board in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigated the determinants of mental health outcomes over time.MethodA two-wave longitudinal study was conducted from July to September 2020. Participants self-reported levels of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7) and mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale) at baseline and 1.5 months later.ResultsThe analytic sample of 169 participants, working in community (43%) and hospital (44%) settings, reported substantial levels of depression and anxiety, and low mental well-being at baseline (depression, 30.8%;anxiety, 20.1%;well-being, 31.9%). Although mental health remained mostly constant over time, the proportion of participants meeting the threshold for anxiety increased to 27.2% at follow-up. Multivariable modelling indicated that working with, and disruption because of, COVID-19 were associated with adverse mental health changes over time.ConclusionsHSCWs working in a remote area with low COVID-19 prevalence reported substantial levels of anxiety and depression, similar to those working in areas with high COVID-19 prevalence. Efforts to support HSCW mental health must remain a priority, and should minimise the adverse effects of working with, and disruption caused by, the COVID-19 pandemic.","De Kock, Johannes H.; Latham, Helen Ann, Cowden, Richard G.; Cullen, Breda, Narzisi, Katia, Jerdan, Shaun, Sarah-Anne, MuÃ±oz, Leslie, Stephen J.; McNamara, Neil, Boggon, Adam, Humphry, Roger W.","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1079","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25488,""
"Experiences of patients advising on mental health research: qualitative study in South-East European countries","BackgroundAlthough patient and carer involvement in research is well-developed in many countries, this area has been largely overlooked in South-East European countries.AimsTo explore experiences of patients participating in newly set up lived experience advisory panels (LEAPs) within a European Commission funded, large-scale, multi-country mental health research project that focused on improving treatment of individuals with psychosis.MethodTwenty-one mental health patients were individually interviewed across five countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. Topic guides covered the experience of participating in LEAPs and their sustainability. Data were analysed by framework analysis.ResultsSeven themes were identified about participating in LEAPs: predominantly positive evaluation, high levels of participant motivation, therapeutic benefits for participants, few challenges, various future perspectives, positive appraisal of the research project and mixed reflections on mental healthcare. Overall, patientsâ€™ experiences were positive and enabled them to feel empowered. Patients expressed interest in remaining involved in advisory panels. Additionally, they felt that they could potentially contribute to the work of non-government organisations.ConclusionsThis study is among the few studies exploring patient participation in research projects, and the first such study conducted in South-East European countries. Patients are highly motivated for this engagement, which has the potential to empower them to take on new social roles.

"Suicidal ideations and suicide attempts prior to admission to a psychiatric hospital in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic: interrupted time-series analysis to estimate the impact of the lockdown and comparison of 2020 with 2019","BackgroundThere is a substantial burden on global mental health as a result of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has become putting pressure on healthcare systems. There is increasing concern about rising suicidality consequential to the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken. Existing research about the impact of earlier epidemics and economic crises as well as current studies about the effects of the pandemic on public mental health and populations at risk indicate rising suicidality, especially in the middle and longer term.AimsThis study investigated the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidality by comparing weekly in-patient admissions for individuals who were suicidal or who attempted suicide just before admission, for the first 6 months after the pandemic's onset in Switzerland with corresponding 2019 control data.MethodData was collected at the Psychiatric University Hospital of Zurich. An interrupted time-series design was used to analyse the number of patients who were suicidal.ResultsInstead of a suggested higher rate of suicidality, fewer admissions of patients with suicidal thoughts were found during the first 6-months after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the proportion of involuntary admissions was found to be higher and more patients have been admitted after a first suicide attempt than in the corresponding control period from 2019.ConclusionsAlthough admissions relating to suicidality decreased during the pandemic, the rising number of patients admitted with a first suicide attempt may be an early indicator for an upcoming extra burden on public mental health (and care). Being a multifactorial process, suicidality is influenced in several ways;low in-patient admissions of patients who are suicidal could also reflect fear of contagion and related uncertainty about seeking mental healthcare.","HÃ¶rmann, Christoph, Bandli, Annatina, Bankwitz, Anna, Mateo De, Bardeci, RÃ¼esch, Annia, Villar De Araujo, Tania, Seifritz, Erich, Kleim, Birgit, Olbrich, Sebastian","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1072","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25490,""

"Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among psychiatric inpatients: a systematic review","Objectives: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes. Low vitamin D levels are more common among people who experience mental health issues. This is particularly vital due to the outdoor restrictions which arose from the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review assessed vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among psychiatric inpatients. Methods: A literature search was performed using the key words 'vitamin D', 'mental health', 'mental illness' and 'inpatient' and articles were selected by two independent reviewers. Eighteen studies were identified as eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (29 - 96%) and insufficiency (20 - 63%) were common among psychiatric inpatients. Over half of the studies recommended or advised consideration of vitamin D level screening among psychiatric inpatients, while nine recommended consideration of vitamin D supplementation. Conclusions: Screening for vitamin D deficiency during psychiatric admission may be clinically indicated and improve patient wellbeing and outcomes.","Seiler, N.; Tsiglopoulos, J.; Keem, M.; Das, S.; Waterdrinker, A.","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2021.2022701","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice;: 7, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25497,""
"Rural Psychology and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Highlighting Strengths and Future Directions","Public Significance Statement Rural mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been widely discussed within the existing literature. Challenges and strengths specific to rural Canada are reviewed within the context of COVID-19 with recommendations for future directions provided to the reader. These recommendations are important for practitioners and policymakers to consider, as they provide future directions for policy development. Recommendations include ensuring mental health policies and practices implemented in rural and remote communities maintain a rural perspective. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically impacted Canadians' mental health, including those who live in rural areas. Rural psychologists have long faced unique challenges associated with practice related to accessibility, isolation, and technology. They also have extensive experience in practicing with flexibility, creativity, and complex ethical considerations such as competency (generalist vs. specialist, cultural competence vs. content competence). Therefore, they may have adapted relatively rapidly to the dramatic changes that came along with the pandemic and be well positioned to lead their urban colleagues and organizations as we move forward. Whereas new and pre-existing challenges have been exacerbated by the pandemic, strengths of rural psychologists (e.g., managing geographical isolation, familiarity with telehealth) have emerged. This article looks at the strengths embedded in rural psychology that facilitated service provision during the pandemic. It also reviews future directions to build upon within the rural Canadian context.","Goodwin, S. L.; Lints-Martindale, A.; Conan, M.

"Lifestyle Behaviors and Parents' Mental Well-Being Among Low-Income Families During COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively altered many families' lifestyles and the mental well-being of parents, especially those who have a low income and young children. To improve low-income parents' mental well-being, especially during a pandemic, understanding parents' and children's lifestyle behaviors and the relationship between their lifestyle behaviors and parents' mental well-being is essential. This cross-sectional study examined relationships between lifestyle behaviors (sleep, physical activity, screen time, and eating behavior of parents and children) and low-income parents' well-being (stress, anxiety, depression) during COVID-19. Parents were recruited from two Michigan Head Start organizations as well as across the United States; 408 parents completed an online survey. Demographic characteristics were assessed along with parents' sleep, physical activity, screen time, and dietary intake; stress, anxiety, and depression were also examined. Children's sleep time, physical activity, screen time, and fruit/vegetable intake were assessed. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and the multivariate general linear model procedure were used. Approximately 69.4% of parents reported moderate stress levels, and 17.2% reported high levels. Most parents had sleep disturbances, attained minimal physical activity, and consumed &lt;5 fruits/vegetables per day; average screen time was &gt;2 hr per day. Only 41% of preschoolers were active 7 days a week and slept Ã¢â€°Â¥10 hr per day. Two thirds had &gt;2 hr per day of screen time, and less than one fifth consumed Ã¢â€°Â¥5 fruits/vegetables per day. After adjusting for parents' demographics and children's lifestyle behaviors, parents' sleep disturbance was positively correlated with their levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. After controlling for parents' demographics and lifestyle behaviors, child sleep time was negatively associated with parents' stress levels. Family demographics and parents' and children's lifestyle behaviors explained 33.4%, 29.8%, and 28.1% of the variances in parents' stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Most parents and preschoolers were not meeting many lifestyle behavior recommendations, indicating a need for interventions. Improving parents' sleep quality and reducing bedtime challenges involving their preschoolers may be necessary for enhancing parental mental well-being.","Robbins, Ling","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNR.0000000000000576","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25500,""
"COVID-19 and mental disorders in Healthcare Personnel: A Novel Framework to Develop Personas from an Online Survey","In this paper we propose a novel framework for the definition of Personas for healthcare workers based on an online survey, with the aim of highlighting different levels of risk of developing mental disorders induced by COVID-19 and tailor psychological support interventions. Data were gathered from Italian healthcare workers between April and May 2020. Information about socio-demographic characteristics, current lifestyle, occupational, COVID-19 infection, and psychological indexes (Maslach Burnout Inventory, Impact of Event Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire) was collected. Respondents were divided in four subgroups based on their health profession: physicians (P), nurses (N), other medical professionals (OMP) and technical-administrative (TA). For each sub-group, collected variables (46) were reduced using Principal Component Analysis and clustered by means of k-medoids clustering. Statistical analysis was then applied to define which variables were able to differentiate among the k clusters, leading to the generation of a Persona card (i.e., a template with textual and graphical information) for each of the obtained clusters. From the 538 respondents (153 P, 175 N, 176 OMP, 344 TA), the highest stress level, workload impact and risk of mental disorders were found in the N subgroup. Two clusters were identified for P, three clusters for N, two for OMP and one for TA. The proposed framework was able to stratify different risk levels of possible development of mental health issues in healthcare workers due to COVID-19. This approach could represent the first step towards the development of mobile health tools to tailor psychological interventions in pandemic situations.","Tauro, Gorini, Caglio, Gabanelli, Gianluca Caiani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.103993","20220113","Burnout syndrome; COVID-19; E-health; Personas","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25501,""
"Emotion-related impulsivity predicts increased anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Emotion-related impulsivity, defined by poor constraint in the face of emotion, is related to internalizing symptoms, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Internalizing symptoms, though, are profoundly tied to stress reactivity, and little is known about how emotion-related impulsivity relates to stress reactivity. Taking advantage of a sample that had completed measures of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and two forms of emotion-related impulsivity before the pandemic, we asked participants to complete three weekly follow-up internalizing assessments early in the pandemic. Among the 150 participants, pre-pandemic emotion-related impulsivity scores predicted higher depression, anxiety, general distress, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for pre-pandemic scores, one form of emotion-related impulsivity (Feelings Trigger Action) predicted increased anxiety and general distress. We also examined how pre-pandemic emotion-related impulsivity was moderated by weekly COVID-related stress. One form of emotion-related impulsivity (Pervasive Influence of Feelings) predicted internalizing symptoms at low stress levels, and a different form (Feelings Trigger Action) predicted internalizing symptoms at higher stress levels. Limitations include the small sample size, the absence of repeat measures of impulsivity, the attrition of individuals with more internalizing symptoms, and the reliance on self-rated measures. Forms of emotion-related impulsivity predict increases in anxiety and distress over time, but the interactions with stress levels appear to vary. Emotion-related impulsivity can be addressed with accessible intervention tools, suggesting promise for broader screening for those at risk for internalizing symptoms during periods of high stress.","Johnson, Porter, Modavi, Dev, Pearlstein, Timpano","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.037","20220113","Emotion-related impulsivity; anxiety; covid-19 pandemic; depression; stress reactivity; suicidal ideation; urgency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25502,""
"How does the presence of a surgical face mask impair the perceived intensity of facial emotions?","The use of surgical-type face masks has become increasingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings suggest that it is harder to categorise the facial expressions of masked faces, than of unmasked faces. To date, studies of the effects of mask-wearing on emotion recognition have used categorisation paradigms: authors have presented facial expression stimuli and examined participants' ability to attach the correct label (e.g., happiness, disgust). While the ability to categorise particular expressions is important, this approach overlooks the fact that expression intensity is also informative during social interaction. For example, when predicting an interactant's future behaviour, it is useful to know whether they are slightly fearful or terrified, contented or very happy, slightly annoyed or angry. Moreover, because categorisation paradigms force observers to pick a single label to describe their percept, any additional dimensionality within observers' interpretation is lost. In the present study, we adopted a complementary emotion-intensity rating paradigm to study the effects of mask-wearing on expression interpretation. In an online experiment with 120 participants (82 female), we investigated how the presence of face masks affects the perceived emotional profile of prototypical expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. For each of these facial expressions, we measured the perceived intensity of all six emotions. We found that the perceived intensity of intended emotions (i.e., the emotion that the actor intended to convey) was reduced by the presence of a mask for all expressions except for anger. Additionally, when viewing all expressions except surprise, masks increased the perceived intensity of non-intended emotions (i.e., emotions that the actor did not intend to convey). Intensity ratings were unaffected by presentation duration (500ms vs 3000ms), or attitudes towards mask wearing. These findings shed light on the ambiguity that arises when interpreting the facial expressions of masked faces.","Tsantani, Podgajecka, Gray, Cook","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262344","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25503,""
"Emergency department utilization for substance use disorders and mental health conditions during COVID-19","As the emergency department (ED) has evolved into the de-facto site of care for a variety of substance use disorder (SUD) presentations, trends in ED utilization are an essential public health surveillance tool. Changes in ED visit patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect changes in access to outpatient treatment, changes in SUD incidence, or the unintended effects of public policy to mitigate COVID-19. We use a national emergency medicine registry to describe and characterize trends in ED visitation for SUDs since 2019. We included all ED visits identified in a national emergency medicine clinical quality registry, which included 174 sites across 33 states with data from January 2019 through June 2021. We defined SUD using ED visit diagnosis codes including: opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD), alcohol use disorders (AUD), and other SUD. To characterize changes in ED utilization, we plotted the 3-week moving average ratio of visit counts in 2020 and 2021 as compared to visit counts in 2019. While overall ED visits declined in the early pandemic period and had not returned to 2019 baseline by June 2021, ED visit counts for SUD demonstrated smaller declines in March and April of 2020, so that the proportion of overall ED visits that were for SUD increased. Furthermore, in the second half of 2020, ED visits for SUD returned to baseline, and increased above baseline for OUD ever since May 2020. We observe distinct patterns in ED visitation for SUDs over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for OUD for which ED visitation barely declined and now exceeds previous baselines. These trends likely demonstrate the essential role of hospital-based EDs in providing 24/7/365 care for people with SUDs and mental health conditions. Allocation of resources must be directed towards the ED as a de-facto safety net for populations in crisis.","Venkatesh, Janke, Kinsman, Rothenberg, Goyal, Malicki, D'Onofrio, Taylor, Hawk","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262136","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25504,""
"Loneliness among people with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a linked UK population cohort study","Population surveys underrepresent people with severe mental ill health. This paper aims to use multiple regression analyses to explore perceived social support, loneliness and factor associations from self-report survey data collected during the Covid-19 pandemic in a sample of individuals with severe mental ill health. We sampled an already existing cohort of people with severe mental ill health. Researchers contacted participants by phone or by post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic restrictions had impacted health, Covid-19 experiences, perceived social support, employment and loneliness. Loneliness was measured by the three item UCLA loneliness scale. In the pandemic sub-cohort, 367 adults with a severe mental ill health diagnosis completed a remote survey. 29-34% of participants reported being lonely. Loneliness was associated with being younger in age (adjusted OR = -.98, p = .02), living alone (adjusted OR = 2.04, p = .01), high levels of social and economic deprivation (adjusted OR = 2.49, p = .04), and lower perceived social support (B = -5.86, p &lt; .001). Living alone was associated with lower perceived social support. Being lonely was associated with a self-reported deterioration in mental health during the pandemic (adjusted OR = 3.46, 95%CI 2.03-5.91). Intervention strategies to tackle loneliness in the severe mental ill health population are needed. Further research is needed to follow-up the severe mental ill health population after pandemic restrictions are lifted to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends. Loneliness was a substantial problem for the severe mental ill health population before the Covid-19 pandemic but there is limited evidence to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends during the pandemic.","Heron, Spanakis, Crosland, Johnston, Newbronner, Wadman, Walker, Gilbody, Peckham","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262363","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25505,""
"Quarantine-related traumatic stress, views, and experiences during the first wave of Coronavirus pandemic: A mixed-methods study among adults in Saudi Arabia","Mental health is a significant problem following exposure to a traumatic event. This study aimed to examine quarantine-related experiences, traumatic stress, and coping strategies among adults quarantined in Saudi Arabia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure or travel history. Individuals aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years who were quarantined in Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19 exposure or travel history were included. We used a sequential mixed methods design, using an online survey followed by in-depth individual telephonic interviews. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to measure post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after the quarantine. To identify factors associated with significant symptoms (IES-R score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 33), prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals were computed using Poisson regression with robust error variance. In the next phase, a subset of the participants (n = 26) were interviewed to elicit their quarantine-related experiences and coping responses. Major themes and subthemes were identified. Of the 111 adults who completed the survey, 32 (28.8% [95% CI, 21.1-38.0%]) had significant PTSD symptoms (IES-R score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 33) and 27 (24.3% [95% CI, 17.2-33.3%]) had severe symptoms (IES-R score &gt; 37). Marital status was the only variable that was significantly associated with significant PTSD symptoms (P = 0.028). Significant symptoms were twice as prevalent in married adults than among other marital groups (PR 2.00, 95% CI, 1.08-3.72). Participants reported negative emotions such as overwhelming fear, helplessness, anxiety, and disgust. Participants utilized both problem-centered coping (e.g., use of social support) and emotion-centered coping (e.g., use of positive diversionary activities) during the quarantine period. PTSD symptoms were present in one out of every four quarantined persons. The quarantine experience is viewed negatively. These findings highlight the need for increased awareness about stress-related disorders among quarantined individuals. Efforts are needed to detect and manage these symptoms early while making the quarantine experience more satisfying for the involved individuals and groups.","Bin Helayel, Ahmed, Ahmed, Ahmad, Khan, Al-Swailem","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261967","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25506,""

Retrospective pre-post cohort study with a matched control group. Large healthcare system in northeast Ohio. A total of 3,690 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who completed HRQOL surveys during routine care for ambulatory visits before and after infection. Propensity-score 1:1 match was utilized to identify controls without COVID who completed HRQOL at two time points. HRQOL was assessed with PROMIS Global Health: global mental and physical health summary scores. Pre- and post-COVID PROMIS Global Health was completed as part of routine care from 1/1/2019 to 2/29/2020 and 4/4/2020 to 11/1/2021, respectively, and extracted from the electronic health record. COVID-19 patients (mean age 53Ã‚Â±15; 66% female) completed PROMIS Global Health in the year prior (median 11.1 months) and after diagnosis (median 7.8 months). Compared to before infection, COVID-19 patients had a significant reduction in global mental health and stable global physical health (-0.85 and 0.05 T-score points, respectively) with clinically meaningful reduction (Ã¢â€°Â¥5 T-score points) experienced by 27% and 23% of patients, respectively.

The study was carried out with diabetic patients living in three different cities that are in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey between the dates of 15 of November and 30 of November 2020. The sample of the study consisted of 500 (Type 1, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°218, Type 2, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°282) diabetes patients. Data were collected using a demographic information form, Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Spiritual Well-being Scale (FACIT-Sp). While the mean scores of hopelessness and loneliness of type 1 patients were below the moderate level, the mean scores of their spiritual well-being were found to be above the moderate level. Moreover, while the mean scores of hopelessness and loneliness in type 2 patients were below the moderate level, the mean scores of their spiritual well-being were found above the moderate level. A significant relationship was found between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients' levels of hopelessness, loneliness, and spiritual well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that as the spiritual well-being levels of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients increased, the levels of their loneliness and hopelessness decreased. It is recommended that mass communication that includes spiritual care practices can be used effectively to reduce diabetes patients' levels of loneliness and hopelessness during the pandemic. In addition, while providing care to diabetes patients, it can be suggested that health professionals offer a holistic approach with initiatives that will increase diabetes patients' spiritual well-being.","DurmuÃ…Å¸, Ãƒâ€¡iftci, GerÃƒÂ§ek, DurmuÃ…Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01496-z","20220113","Diabetes; Hopelessness; Loneliness; Spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25511,""
"COVID-19-related anxiety and knowledge toward its preventive measures among patients with chronic medical illness on follow-up in public hospitals of Bale, East Bale, and West Arsi zones, Ethiopia","Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as 2019-nCoV cluster of acute respiratory illness with unknown causes, which occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China, was first reported to World Health Organization country office as of December 30, 2019. People with medical illness are at a higher risk for coronavirus disease, and the pandemic influences mental health and causes psychological problems, particularly in those with chronic medical illness. Hence, this study aimed to assess coronavirus disease 2019-related anxiety and the knowledge on its preventive measures among patients with medical illness on follow-up in public hospitals of Bale, East Bale, and Arsi zones. To assess coronavirus disease 2019-related anxiety and knowledge toward coronavirus disease 2019 preventive measures among patients with chronic medical illness on follow-up in public hospitals of Bale, East Bale, and West Arsi zones. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in selected hospitals of Bale and West Arsi zones, Southeast Ethiopia. A total of 633 study participants were included in this study, and data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. A descriptive summary was computed. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify the associated factors. Overall, the prevalence of anxiety among chronic patients in this study was 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.6%-8.5%) and 420 (66.35%) had good knowledge on the preventive measures of coronavirus disease 2019. Factors significantly associated with anxiety among chronic patients were being educated (95% confidence interval: adjusted odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26 (0.09-0.74)), being male (95% confidence interval: 2.69 (1.11-6.53)), and use of mask (95% confidence interval: 0.11 (0.05-0.26)). The prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019-related anxiety among chronic patients was high and being males, uneducated, and not using face mask was significantly associated with coronavirus disease 2019-related anxiety.","Yasin, Asefa, Takele, Fikadu, Sahiledengle, Tura, Gemmechu, Abduku, Zenbaba, Tesa, Tasew, Tekalign, Abdulkadir, Seyoum, Morka, Esmael, Ganfure, Teferu, Nigussie, Girma, Regasa, Bekele, Tesema, Kemal, Usman, Haile, Negero, Atlaw, Haji, Mamma, Solomon, Gezahegn","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211066682","20220113","Covid-19; anxiety; chronic patients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25512,""
"Community Mental Health Clinicians' Perspectives on Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed Methods Study","In March 2020, a rapid shift to telehealth occurred in community mental health settings in response to the need for physical distancing to decrease transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Whereas treatment delivered over telehealth was previously utilized sparingly in community settings, it quickly became the primary mode of treatment delivery for the vast majority of clinicians, many of whom had little time to prepare for this shift and limited to no experience using telehealth. Little is known about community mental health clinicians' experiences using telehealth. While telehealth may make mental health treatment more accessible for some clients, it may create additional barriers for others given the high rates of poverty among individuals seeking treatment from community mental health centers. We examined community mental health clinicians' perspectives on using telehealth to deliver trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to youth. We sought to better understand the acceptability of using telehealth, as well as barriers and facilitators to usage. We surveyed 45 clinicians across 15 community clinics in Philadelphia. Clinicians rated their satisfaction with telehealth using a quantitative scale and shared their perspectives on telehealth in response to open-ended questions. Therapists' responses were coded using an open-coding approach wherein coders generated domains, themes, and sub-themes. Clinicians rated telehealth relatively positively on the quantitative survey, expressing overall satisfaction with their current use of telehealth during the pandemic, and endorsing telehealth as a helpful mode of connecting with clients. Responses to open-ended questions fell into five domains. Clinicians noted that 1) telehealth affects the content (i.e., what is discussed) and process (i.e., how it is discussed) of therapy; 2) telehealth alters engagement, retention and attendance; 3) technology is a crucial component of utilizing telehealth; 4) training, resources, and support are needed to facilitate telehealth usage; and 5) the barriers, facilitators, and level of acceptability of telehealth differs across individual clinicians and clients. First, telehealth is likely a better fit for some clients and clinicians than others, and attention should be given to better understanding who is most likely to succeed using this modality. Second, although telehealth increased convenience and accessibility of treatment, clinicians noted that across the board, it was difficult to engage clients (e.g., young clients were easily distracted), and further work is needed to identify better telehealth engagement strategies. Third, for many clients, the telehealth modality may actually create an additional barrier to care, as children from families living in poverty may not have the requisite devices or quality broadband connection to make telehealth workable. Better strategies to address disparities in access to and quality of digital technologies are needed to render telehealth an equitable option for all youth seeking mental health services.","Schriger, Klein, Last, Fernandez-Marcote, Dallard, Jones, Beidas","https://doi.org/10.2196/29250","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25513,""

"Asprosin and Oxidative Stress Level in COVID-19 Patients","The global COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has created great problems in healthcare systems throughout the world. Although, just like other respiratory tract viral infections, it is a disease with pathophysiological processes associated in general with cytokine production, inflammation, cell death, and redox imbalance or oxidative stress, very little is known about the pathology. Also, in recent studies, the effect of asprosin, which has an important and complex role on metabolism, on COVID-19 is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the level of asprosin, a new hormone that has the potential to affect many metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, in COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is to determine whether asprosin is associated with oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients. Blood samples were taken from 30 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed with RT-PCR test and 30 healthy control subjects. The serum asprosin level was analyzed with ELISA, and total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels with colorimetric analysis. The asprosin and TAS levels were determined to be statistically significantly decreased in the COVID-19 patients, and the TOS and OSI levels were significantly increased. It can be thought that a decrease in asprosin level in COVID-19 patients causes a decrease in metabolic activity, prevents sufficient energy production in patients, and therefore oxidative stress increases in patients.","Seyhanli, Koyuncu, Yasak, Demir, Temiz","https://doi.org/10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210423","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25515,""
"EFFECTS OF THE EASTERN MIND-BODY PRACTICES ON MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: WHEN EAST MEETS WEST","The aim: The paper aims at reviewing the recent studies on the impact of the Eastern mind-body practices on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The recent studies (2020 - 2021) on the Eastern mind-body practices in combating the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar. Research papers were found by using the keywords ""mental health"", ""psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic"", ""Eastern mind-body practices"", ""meditation"", ""mindfulness"", ""yoga"", ""tai chi"", ""qigong"". A total of 27 selected publications were analyzed based on our criteria. Given the relatively small number of relevant articles in recent years, we also examined papers published before 2020. Along with the aforementioned, the authors used integrative anthropological approach and interpretive research paradigm. Conclusions: The Eastern mind-body practices are becoming increasingly popular, especially now when the outbreak of COVID-19 has created mental health concerns among the general population worldwide. They may prove an effective preventive or therapeutical intervention for mental health issues during and after the pandemic. However, the underlying mechanisms of these techniques are still insufficiently studied. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a well-planned study and interpret it from multiply perspectives involving an interdisciplinary team of specialists.","Danylova, Shmarhun, Vertel, Matyushko, Bondarenko, Kychkyruk, Petersen","https://www.google.com/search?q=EFFECTS+OF+THE+EASTERN+MIND-BODY+PRACTICES+ON+MENTAL+HEALTH+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC:+WHEN+EAST+MEETS+WEST.","20220113"," COVID-19;  meditation;  mental health;  mind-body medicine;  mindfulness;  psycho spiritual approach;  qigong;  tai chi;  yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25516,""

"CITIZENS OBTAINING PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN UKRAINE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY","The aim: To investigate the obtaining of psychosocial support by citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine using a cross-sectional study assessing the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Materials and methods: It was developed and used the authors' questionnaire ""Socio-psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine"". Data processing used Nonparametric Mann-Whitney analysis of variance and one-way Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (SPSS 26.0). Results: The study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 and sampled 100 individuals. Significant differences in the studied features are revealed. Gender: women have a more prosperous and broader range of contacts to discuss fears and anxieties during quarantine; suffer more from emotional loss; have more need to be heard and to be taken care of, with no criticism; are more experienced in professional psychological help obtaining; communicate with internal migrants more often. Age: young respondents (19-24 y.o.) suffer more from pandemic losses in the areas of spirituality and friendship; however, more often and more effectively use the means of online psychological support; older respondents are more likely to receive support from an important community and through meditation. Living conditions: living alone, citizens experience more pandemic stress, suffer from losses in personal life and friendship, and consider participation in challenge activities as the most convenient form of support. Place of residence: living in the rural areas is associated with a narrow circle of citizens' contacts to discuss their plans for leisure; more significant damage from pandemic losses in health; lack of support in the form of understanding themselves and their conditions. Education: higher education affects a broader circle of communication; more minor financial losses; willingness to share traumatic stories for art therapy. Financial satisfaction promotes the exchange of ideas between users of online psychological support. Conclusions: The identified conditionality of psychosocial support obtaining by socio-demographic indicators can be used in the development of psychosocial support interventions during a pandemic for Ukrainian citizens by the public and private sectors, particularly in creating specialized smartphone applications, adapting playback theatre in the online space, creating gender-sensitive online programs to integrate IDPs into local communities.","Tytarenko, Dvornyk, Larina, Myronchak, Savinov, Hundertaylo, Vella","https://www.google.com/search?q=CITIZENS+OBTAINING+PSYCHOSOCIAL+SUPPORT+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+IN+UKRAINE:+A+CROSS-SECTIONAL+STUDY.","20220113"," art therapy;  community participation ;  mental health;  sex differences;  telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25518,""
"COVID-19 PANDEMIC LIFESTYLE: STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES","The aim: To determine how quarantine restrictions affect the lifestyle of Ukrainian students, and their mental health. Materials and methods: 37 student essays were submitted to the university contest held at Lviv Polytechnic University in May-June 2020. They were analyzed with the help of qualitative thematic analysis and standard qualitative analysis method. Essays are focused on a list of issues important for assessing the social well-being of students during quarantine. Each fragment of essay's answer was coded into the data matrix system according to either multiple or single themes, built in the statements. The thematic analysis identified several categories that determine students' attitude to the pandemic situation and its consequences for them. Results: It is determined that students' lifestyle, including study and leisure, has changed significantly, which has affected their mental health. Learning online provoked a number of emotional disorders. At the same time, the desire for communication in person and self-improvement increased. Ã‚Â«Quarantine lessonsÃ‚Â» were divided into categories: challenges, threats and opportunities. Threats and challenges were considered at the global level, while opportunities affected rather the personal level. Conclusions: Mental health of students disorders: anxiety, restlessness, fear, self-doubt, feelings of loneliness, panic, sleep disturbances, and increased fatigue indicate the negative effects of the pandemic. At the same time, recording such facts as the feeling of satisfaction from communication with loved ones, the ability to help them, the desire for self-improvement, etc. allows to say about the positive effects.","Boiko, Herus, Klymanska, Savka, Klos, Shkoliar, Vitale","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+PANDEMIC+LIFESTYLE:+STUDENTS+MENTAL+HEALTH+CHALLENGES.","20220113"," Covid-19;  learning practices;  mental health;  pandemic;  students;  lifestyle ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25519,""
"STUDY OF THE MENTAL STATE OF STUDENTS IN THE PROCESS OF ONLINE EDUCATION DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC","The aim: Exploring the specifics of the underlying mental states of university students in the context of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifying their relationship to mental health. Materials and methods: The study of mental states was carried out using three valid methods, namely: a clinical questionnaire for the detection and evaluation of neurotic states (K. Yakhin, D. Mendelevich), a questionnaire for diagnosing the level of social frustration (L. Wasserman, adaptation of V. Bojko), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Ch. Spielberger, adaptation by Yu. Khanin). The author's questionnaire (L. Borysenko) was used to study the connection between the factors of online learning and emotional states of students. The obtained empirical data were subjected to qualitative and quantitative processing. Results: The analysis of the obtained data allows to state the fact of predominance of high and increased level of situational and personal anxiety in the subjects in the conditions of online learning. In the process of psychodiagnosis of neurotic states, it was found that most students have a level of painful or borderline mental conditions such as anxiety, neurotic depression, asthenia and autonomic disorders. It was found that students have an elevated level and high level of social frustration. The main factors of online learning, which, according to students, cause them to deteriorate mental health are: forced to stay in a confined space, lack of direct social contacts, prolonged stay in a static position, increased study load and volume of tasks, anxiety for academic success and quality professional training, concern for their health and the health of their loved ones. Conclusions: The forced transition to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental state of many students. In most respondents, this manifested itself in increased anxiety, depression, autonomic reactions due to limited opportunities to communicate with teachers and classmates, new learning conditions and increased workload.","Borysenko, Korvat, Lovka, Lovochkina, Serhieienkova, Beridze","https://www.google.com/search?q=STUDY+OF+THE+MENTAL+STATE+OF+STUDENTS+IN+THE+PROCESS+OF+ONLINE+EDUCATION+DURING+THE+CORONAVIRUS+PANDEMIC.","20220113"," anxiety;  mental health;  mental states;  neurotic states ;  online learning;  social frustration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25520,""

"Alcohol Consumption and COVID-19-Related Stress Among Health Care Workers: The Need for Continued Stress-Management Interventions","Although a known association exists between stress and alcohol consumption among health care workers (HCWs), it is not known how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected this association. We assessed pandemic work-related stress and alcohol consumption of HCWs. We emailed a cross-sectional, anonymous survey in June 2020 to approximately 550 HCWs at an academic hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana. HCWs from all departments were eligible to complete the survey. Questions measured work-related stress and emotional reactions to the pandemic (using the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS-CoV] Staff Questionnaire), depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), coping habits (using the Brief COPE scale), and pre-COVID-19 (March 2020) and current (June 2020) alcohol consumption. We measured alcohol consumption using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), with scores &gt;3 considered positive. We asked 4 open-ended questions for in-depth analysis. One-hundred two HCWs participated in the survey. The average AUDIT-C scores for current and pre-COVID-19 alcohol consumption were 3.1 and 2.8, respectively. The level of current alcohol consumption was associated with avoidant coping (r = 0.46, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Relative increases in alcohol consumption from March to June 2020 were positively associated with PHQ-9 score and greater emotional reactions to the pandemic. Availability of mental health services was ranked second to last among desired supports. Qualitative data demonstrated high levels of work-related stress from potential exposure to COVID-19 and job instability, as well as social isolation and negative effects of the pandemic on their work environment. Ongoing prevention-based interventions that emphasize stress management rather than mental or behavioral health conditions are needed.","Beiter, Wiedemann, Thomas, Conrad","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211058176","20220113","COVID-19; alcohol; health care workers; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25522,""
"Collecting Data During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons From an In-Person Survey of People Who Use Opioids","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, much in-person data collection has been suspended or become tele-remote. However, tele-remote methods often exclude marginalized groups, including people who use drugs, many of whom lack the technology to participate. To inform future surveillance and research during the pandemic and other public health disasters, we report methods and lessons learned from an in-person survey of people who use opioids conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This public health surveillance was a component of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Overdose Data to Action initiative and aimed to inform overdose prevention efforts. Survey domains inquired about participants' drug use patterns, risk behaviors, overdose history, and service use. From June 16 through September 9, 2020, DOHMH staff members conducted 329 surveys with participants from 4 syringe service programs (n = 148, 44.9%) and via street intercept (n = 81, 55.1%). To survey participants safely and effectively, it was important to build rapport upfront so that requests to maintain distance were not perceived as stigmatizing. DOHMH staff members offered all participants, regardless of survey eligibility, Narcan and hygiene products, including face masks and soap. Surveys administered outdoors during the COVID-19 pandemic should be limited to 30 minutes. Although conducting in-person surveys poses unique challenges, this method should be considered so marginalized populations are included in data collection and public health responses.","Jessell, Zaidi, Dominguez-Gomez, Harocopos","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211063473","20220113","COVID-19; hard-to-reach populations; opioid use; surveillance methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25523,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young professionals in blood banks and transfusion services: A global cross-sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic brought about changes to daily life as measures to contain the spread of the virus increased across the world. The aim of this survey was to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic on young professionals (YPs) in transfusion medicine. A cross-sectional web-based survey was distributed electronically to ISBT members inviting YPs (Ã¢â€°Â¤40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) to participate. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Two hundred and fifty-nine YPs completed the survey, including 107 clinicians/physicians and/or nurses. Almost half of the YPs (52.5%) indicated increased stress levels and 15.4% indicated symptoms of depression. YPs highlighted the loss of social engagement (59.1%) and increased pressure from information seen on media (35.5%) as factors negatively impacting their psychological wellbeing. Further, 20.8% expressed increased economic stress resulting from concerns about job security. Almost half of the YPs indicated that their organization provided moderate/occasional holistic support to them and their families. Sixty percent and 74.4% of YPs reported increased workload and staff absence due to COVID-19 infection, respectively. Only half of clinicians/physicians and/or nurses indicated that they often had sufficient personal protective equipment. The majority of these (76.6%) had family/household members living with them, and 61% indicated that they were significantly worried about infecting them because of the nature of their work. COVID-19 had a major impact on the well-being of YPs working in transfusion medicine. Measures are required to ensure that YPs are protected and mentally supported while undertaking their duties in current and future pandemics.","Al-Riyami, Masser, Herczenik, Arora, Boateng, Dinardo, Hutchinson, Ji, Langi Sasongko, Tung, Panchatcharam","https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13236","20220113","COVID-19; transfusion; young professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25524,""
"Sleep disorders and mental health in hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional multicenter study in Northern Italy","From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers had to face unprecedented emergency needs associated with an extraordinary amount of psychological distress. In this cross-sectional multicenter study, we investigated sleep disturbances, and the level of anxiety and depression among the healthcare and non-healthcare staff of three hospitals in Milan (Italy) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we explored potential predisposing factors for affective symptoms and poor sleep. Between June and July 2020, we administered an online questionnaire to evaluate the presence of sleep disorders (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia (Sleep Condition Indicator), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II). We used univariate and multivariate analysis to evaluate the association between the personal conditions and sleep and affective disorders. The 964 participants reported high rates of sleep disorders (80.3%)-mainly insomnia (30.5%)-anxiety (69.7%), and depression (32.8%). The multivariate analysis showed a strong association of sleep disorders, especially insomnia, with female gender (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), divorced marital status (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015), self-isolation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.037), and chronic diseases (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003). Anxiety was significantly associated with teleworking (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), while depressive symptoms were associated with self-isolation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028), modified work schedules (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), and chronic diseases (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027). In hospital workers, the high prevalence of sleep and psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak appears to be determined mainly by modifications of personal or work habits. Teleworking was associated with increased anxiety. An accurate planning of hospital activities and a psychological support are needed to prevent and manage sleep and mental disorders.","Proserpio, Zambrelli, Lanza, Dominese, Di Giacomo, Quintas, Tramacere, Rubino, Turner, Colosio, Cattaneo, Canevini, D'Agostino, Agostoni, Didato","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05813-y","20220113","COVID-19 pandemic; Hospital workers; Mental health; Sleep disorders; Teleworking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25525,""
"Psychological distress related to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic and coping strategies among general population in Egypt","Psychological distress is considered a threat to the mental health of human beings. This research was conducted at the beginning of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, when most people had limited knowledge about coronavirus, mode of transmission, associated manifestations, with uncertainty about treatment, vaccine, future life, and coping capacity. This study examined the nature of the psychological distress related to the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and coping strategies adopted among the general population in Egypt. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study assessing a convenience sample consisting of 312 participants from the general population in Egypt. Data were gathered as online responses to a questionnaire which incorporated a sociodemographic datasheet, psychological distress scale, and ways of coping scale. Forty-two percent of the participants showed severe psychological distress and 26% showed mild to moderate psychological distress. There was a strong positive correlation between the distress score and the overall coping score-that is, the higher the distress, the more ways of coping were adopted (p &lt; 0.001). This study also showed that the methods of adaptation used by most of the population were based on emotional coping strategy. The most adaptive people were those who work in the health field and the residents in the cities with a monthly income sufficient enough to meet their needs; better adaptation methods were also seen among both divorced and highly educated people. We also found a significant relationship between sociodemographic characteristics except for sex and overall coping methods (p &lt; 0.001). Further, significant relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and psychological distress were observed (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the study population as a sample of the general population in Egypt reported suffering from varying degrees of psychological distress during the COVID-19 crisis. However, the more severe an individual's level of psychological distress, the greater their adaptation ability was. This study focuses light on the importance to provide appropriate interventions against COVID-19-related stresses and equipping people with suitable strategies for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elkayal, Shahin, Hussien","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-021-00100-2","20220113","COVID-19; Coping; Coronavirus; Pandemic; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25526,""
"Relationship between Anxiety, Depression and Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Proof of Concept","Psychological factors can influence susceptibility to viral infections. We examined whether such influences are evident in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants (n=102) completed measures of anxiety, depression, positive mood and loneliness and provided a blood sample for the measurement of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was significantly associated with anxiety and significantly positively associated with depression. The model remained significant after adjustment for age and gender, although anxiety and depression were no longer significant independent predictors. These findings offer early support for the hypothesis that psychological factors may influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Vedhara, Ayling, Jia, Fairclough, Morling, Ball, Knight, Blake, Corner, Denning, Bolton, Jackson, Coupland, Tighe","https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiac006","20220113","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antibodies; anxiety; depression; seropositivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25527,""
"Interpreting the Lived Experiences of Home Caregivers in the Families of Patients with Covid-19 in Iran: A Phenomenological Study","Following the spread of Covid-19, many patients received home care services for recovery. The family is one of the informal caregivers who provide daily physical and psychological support to the patient, and they have the most contributions in the care of patients. Accordingly, this study explains the experiences of home caregivers in the families of patients with Covid-19. This is a qualitative study with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Purposeful sampling was applied, and semi-structured interviews in the Center of Covid-19 Control in Khoy, Iran, were used to collect the information. Twenty-three family caregivers, who had already provided care for patients with Covid-19 at home, participated in the study. The themes emerged from interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcripted then analyzed using Dickelman's interpretive phenomenological approach. 13 primary concepts, six sub-themes, and three main themes were extracted from the data analysis, including ""Irrational fear of disease"" with sub-themes: fear of getting infected and Indulging in strength of immune system, ""Increasing the burden of care in caregivers"" with sub-themes: lack of support and caregiver`s family challenges and ""Self reinforcement"" with sub-themes: highlighting positive features and turning to spirituality. Understanding the complexities, experiences, and beliefs of family caregivers about living with a Covid-19 patient provides a comprehensive perception of the psychological and physical consequences of care. Executive decision-makers, health care personnel, and mental health professionals can also take the necessary strategies to support and manage home caregivers and interdisciplinary cooperation.","Akbarbegloo, Sanaeefar","https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzab144","20220113","Covid-19; Experience; Family Caregivers; Phenomenological Study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25528,""
"Perception of the COVID-19 pandemic among people with spinal cord injury: an Italian survey","An observational study based on an online survey to explore if the participant had experienced (1) cancellation or delay of scheduled health services (2) reduction of assistance provided by a caregiver (3) barriers to social participation and recreational activities. Three validated questionnaires to investigate well-being and symptoms of anxiety and depression were also administered. Our main aim was to quantify the obstacles experienced by adults living with SCI in Italy during COVID-19 pandemic, to explore the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms and to quantify subjective well-being. Outpatient clinic of a Spinal Unit in Italy. Online survey via direct contact and by e-mail lists. In total, 101 individuals completed the survey. Of, 82.2% participants reported a history of deferment or cancellation of non-COVID-19 health services. The majority (56.4%) revealed that, at least seldom, they have chosen to reduce their usual everyday activities and more than one third (37.6%) affirmed that they had been forced to renounce to one or more of their occupations. Discontinuation of assistance by caregivers was uncommon. The median score of questionnaires measuring depression and anxiety symptoms do not differ significatively when compared with prior studies. The variable that explored the limitations experienced in everyday activities showed a significant correlation with the results of the questionnaires measuring well-being and symptoms of anxiety. We believe that our results could contribute to the discussion ongoing inside our community on how to answer to the new challenges of this pandemic period and of the post-pandemic future.","Righi, Baroni, Righi, Belloni, Del Popolo","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-021-00470-x","20220113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25529,""
"Emotional responses and coping strategies of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic","To assess the emotional responses and coping strategies of medical students during the lockdown and social distancing measures implemented during the coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This crossÃ¢â‚¬â€˜sectional study is based on data collected from undergraduate medical students at the College of Medicine, Alfaisal University Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the fall semester of academic year 2020-2021. All the participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire consisting of 3 parts: demographic information, emotional response scale, and 14-item, adapted brief coping orientation to problems experienced inventory to determine the use of avoidant or approach coping strategies. Coping and emotional response scores were compared using t-test. Linear regression analysis was also performed. A total of 261 students from all years were included. Overall scores were higher for avoidant coping strategies. The use of avoidant coping strategies was significantly higher in females (<i>p</i>=0.03) and in preclinical students (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Preclinical students had a higher mean score for anger (<i>p</i>=0.002). Conversely, students in the clinical phase had higher scores for anxiety (<i>p</i>=0.005) and sadness (<i>p</i>=0.027). The regression analysis of emotional responses and coping strategies suggests that avoidant coping is a predictor of anger (<i>p</i>=0.003) and sadness (<i>p</i>=0.005). Interventions to train medical students in the use of more productive and effective coping strategies may reduce negative emotional responses linked to the present COVID-19 pandemic and in the future.","Ifrah Naaz, Hussein, Khan, Hussein, Arain","https://doi.org/10.15537/smj.2022.43.1.20210698","20220113","COVID-19; coping strategies; emotional responses; medical students; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25530,""

"Toward Designs of Workplace Stress Management Mobile Apps for Frontline Health Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Design Implications for a Mixed Methods Qualitative Study","In recent years, mobile apps have been developed to prevent burnout, promote anxiety management, and provide health education to workers in various workplace settings. However, there remains a paucity of such apps for frontline health workers (FHWs), even though FHWs are the most susceptible to stress due to the nature of their jobs. The goal of this study was to provide suggestions for designing stress management apps to address workplace stressors of FHWs based on the understanding of their needs from FHWs' own perspectives and theories of stress. A mixed methods qualitative study was conducted. Using a variety of search strings, we first collected 41 relevant web-based news articles published between December 2019 and May 2020 through the Google search engine. We then conducted a cross-sectional survey with 20 FHWs. Two researchers independently conducted qualitative analysis of all the collected data using a deductive followed by an inductive approach. Prevailing uncertainty and fear of contracting the infection was causing stress among FHWs. Moral injury associated with seeing patients die from lack of care and lack of experience in handling various circumstances were other sources of stress. FHWs mentioned 4 coping strategies. Quick coping strategies such as walking away from stressful situations, entertainment, and exercise were the most common ways to mitigate the impact of stress at work. Peer support and counseling services were other popular methods. Building resilience and driving oneself forward using internal motivation were also meaningful ways of overcoming stressful situations. Time constraints and limited management support prevented FHWs from engaging in stress management activities. Our study identified stressors, coping strategies, and challenges with applying coping strategies that can guide the design of stress management apps for FHWs. Given that the pandemic is ongoing and health care crises continue, FHWs remain a vulnerable population in need of attention.","Chaudhry, Islam, Matthieu","https://doi.org/10.2196/30640","20220113","COVID-19; burnout; design; design requirements; frontline health worker; intervention; mHealth; mental health; need; pandemic; perspective; stress; user design","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-14","",25532,""
