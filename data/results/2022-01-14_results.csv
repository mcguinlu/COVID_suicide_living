"COVID-19 policies in practice and their direct and indirect impacts in Northern California jails","Context: Although the increased risk of COVID-19 in carceral facilities is well documented, little is known about the practical barriers to infection control and indirect impacts of pandemic policies in these settings. Evidence in jails is especially scarce. Methods: Between July 8, 2020 and April 30, 2021 we performed SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and administered a questionnaire among residents and staff in four Northern California jails. We analyzed seroprevalence in conjunction with demographic factors and survey responses of self-perceived COVID-19 risk, recent illness, COVID-19 test results, and symptom reporting behaviors. We additionally assessed COVID-19 policies in practice and evaluated their impacts on court dates, mental health, and routine health care. We engaged stakeholder representatives, including incarcerated individuals and their advocates, to guide study design, conduct, and interpretation. Findings: We enrolled 788 incarcerated individuals and 380 staff across four county jails. Most seropositive individuals had not previously tested positive for COVID-19, despite many suspecting prior infection. Among incarcerated participants, we identified deficient access to face masks and prevalent symptom underreporting associated with fears of isolation and perceptions of medical neglect in jail. Incarcerated participants also reported substantial hindrances to court cases and reductions in routine health care due to COVID-19. Incarcerated individuals and staff both cited worsened mental health due to COVID-19, which for incarcerated individuals was largely attributable to further isolation from loved ones and other pandemic restrictions on recreation and programming. Conclusions: Perceptions of inadequate protection from COVID-19 were pervasive among incarcerated individuals. Simultaneously, restrictive measures compounded poor mental health and fostered fears of isolation that undermined effective infection control. Custody officials should work to systematically improve provision of masks, understand and mitigate fears and mistrust, and take proactive steps to minimize the detrimental impacts of restrictive policies on residents' mental health and well-being.","Yiran E Liu; Christopher LeBoa; Marcela Rodriguez; Beruk Sherif; Chrisele Trinidad; Michael del Rosario; Sophie Allen; Christine Clifford; Jennifer Redding; Wei-ting Chen; Lisa G.

"Weekly dynamics of stressor resilience and protective factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe","Background: In a recent cross-sectional study, we highlighted psychosocial resilience factors associated with good mental health during the first COVID-19-lockdown. However, dynamic concepts of resilience suggest that people's response to adversity can change over time. To better understand the emergence of resilience, we here examined individual dynamics of stressor resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In a longitudinal experience sampling design, participants (N=200) completed six weekly questionnaires assessing current stressor exposure, mental health burden, and resilience factors. We used linear mixed models to investigate within- and between-subject associations between stressor resilience and protective factors. Results: Weekly stressor resilience scores were positively associated with subject-level variation in the resilience factors positive appraisal use, positive appraisal of the COVID-19 pandemic, and general self-efficacy (ps&lt;.05). Time-lagged analyses showed no prediction of stressor resilience by resilience factor use in the preceding week. Stressor exposure positively predicted behavioural coping use during the next week (p&lt;.02). Conclusion: Observed fluctuations in positive appraisal use and general self-efficacy within individuals support the notion that processes of resilience are not stable across time. The time-delayed effect of stressor exposure on behavioural coping use might indicate an early mechanism of stress inoculation, by which stress improves future coping strategies.","BÃ¶gemann, S.

"Variation of stress and mental health measures in dyads of parents and children during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a baseline: an opportunity study","To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress and mental health using a baseline measure, we designed an opportunity study in which dyads of parents (N=133, 74% mothers) and children (59% girls, 11-12 y/o) from a research project conducted in 2019 (baseline) were recontacted for data collection during the onset of the pandemic in April 2020 (T2) in Canada. Dyads completed self-report measures of perceived stress, anxiety and emotion regulation (ER) strategies. Mixed ANOVAs revealed an increase in parentsâ€™ stress (p&lt;.001, n2p=.27) and state anxiety (p&lt;.001, n2p=.16) compared to baseline, but not in their children (resp. p=.19, p=0.28). Dyadsâ€™ anxiety sensitivity remained unchanged (resp. p=.03, p=.28). Parents showed similar use of ER strategies (p=.22) while children showed similar use of cognitive reappraisal (p=.32) but less emotional suppression (p=.005, n2p=.06) and co-rumination (p&lt;.001, n2p=.18) at T2 compared to baseline. Finally, parental and children scores on mental health measures were not correlated at either time. Our results suggest that during the onset of the pandemic, parents and children responded differently in terms of stress and mental health and used different emotion regulation strategies.","Journault, A.

"Hair cortisol predicts susceptibility to increased depressive symptoms among older women during the COVID-19 pandemic: implications for the vulnerability-stress model of psychopathology","Background: Determining pre-existing biological risk markers of incident depression after exposure to a new stressor might help identify vulnerable individuals. We investigated whether hair cortisol predicted increased depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, 6 years later. Methods: We studied 933 older adults as part of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Depressive symptoms were assessed before (time 1) and during (time 2) the COVID-19 pandemic, and hair cortisol was measured 6 years previously. Hierarchical mixed effects poisson regression models were applied to investigate the association between cortisol and any change in symptoms. Results: In a fully covariate adjusted model higher cortisol was not associated with depressive symptoms at time 1 (p =.910) but was at time 2 (IRR= 1.05, p=.020), with a significant effect of the cortisol X time interaction (IRR= 1.06, p=.003). Stratified analyses revealed an effect in women only (IRR = 1.07, p=.001). Conclusions: Higher hair cortisol was associated with increased depressive symptoms among older adults during (but not before) the pandemic. Findings suggest a biological phenotype which denotes increased susceptibility to the negative impact of stress on mental health.","Feeney, J.; Kenny, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105468","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Psychoneuroendocrinology; 131, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25408,""
"SHAPER-PND and the SHAPER-PDNO protocols: a trial for a community singing intervention for postnatal depression and the COVID-19 pandemic response study","Introduction: The SHAPER-PND study will analyse the clinical and implementation effectiveness of 10-week in-person singing sessions for postnatal depression in new mothers. An online pilot study, SHAPER-PNDO, was designed to meet the social distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic, while investigating online delivery and COVID-19 anxiety specific questions. This  introduces the protocols for both studies, discuss the adaptations made for COVID-19 research and the biological samples collected from mothers in babies. Methods and analysis: For the SHAPER-PND study, 400 mothers and their babies will be recruited. The intervention group will attend 10 weekly singing sessions, facilitated by Breathe Arts Health Research. A control group will attend non-singing sessions for 10 weeks. A package of assessments will be collected from participants for clinical, mechanistic and implementation outcomes. Cortisol, oxytocin and other biological measures will be collected from saliva and hair samples. For SHAPER-PNDO, a total of 120 mothers and their babies will be recruited for the 6 weekly singing sessions intervention.

"Psychological compassion climate: Examining the nomological network of perceptions of work group compassion","Organizational scholars have begun to focus on the pervasiveness of human suffering at work and the capacity of compassion to ease such suffering. Recent conceptual work has shifted from the individual to the group by positing compassion as a collective capacity that involves noticing others' suffering, feeling empathic concern, and attempting to alleviate that suffering. Drawing upon this foundation, the current paper elaborates on the theoretical concept of psychological compassion climate, defining it as the individual perception of shared norms around compassion within one's work group/unit, and develops and validates a brief measure to assess this construct. Specifically, in Study 1, we developed a new measure of psychological compassion climate and examined its nomological network, including theoretical antecedents, correlates, and consequences. In Study 2, we cross-validated the compassion climate measure using a time-separated design. In this study, psychological compassion climate assessed at Time 1 predicted improvements from Time 1 to Time 2 in three well-being indicators (i.e., anxiety, depressed mood, psychological flourishing) over a month-long span during the summer of 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (when suffering of a variety of types was widespread). In addition, we also found that psychological compassion climate predicted compassion experiences at work over the one month interval, including compassion received from others as well as compassion given by the focal employees to others and to oneself.","Nolan, Megan T.; Diefendroff, James, Erickson, Rebecca J.; Lee, Matthew T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2021.103688","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Vocational Behavior;: 103688, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25411,""
"No significant association between COVID-19 diagnosis and the incidence of depression and anxiety disorder? A retrospective cohort study conducted in Germany","Little is known about the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mental health compared with other respiratory infections. Thus, the aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of depression and anxiety disorder in patients followed in general practices in Germany compared with acute upper respiratory infection diagnosis. This study included all patients diagnosed with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 for the first time in 1198 general practices in Germany between March 2020 and May 2021. Patients diagnosed with acute upper respiratory infection were matched to those with COVID-19 using propensity scores based on sex, age, index month, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. The index date corresponded to the date on which either COVID-19 or acute upper respiratory infection was diagnosed. Differences in the incidence of depression and anxiety disorder between the COVID-19 and the acute upper respiratory infection group were studied using conditional Poisson regression models. This study included 56,350 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 56,350 patients diagnosed with acute upper respiratory infection (52.3% women;mean [SD] age 43.6 [19.2] years). The incidence of depression (IRRÂ =Â 1.02, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.95â€“1.10) and anxiety disorder (IRRÂ =Â 0.94, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.83â€“1.07) was not significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than in the upper respiratory infection group. Compared with acute upper respiratory infection diagnosis, COVID-19 diagnosis was not associated with a significant increase in the incidence of depression and anxiety disorder in patients treated in general practices in Germany.","Jacob, Louis, Koyanagi, Ai, Smith, Lee, Bohlken, Jens, Haro, Josep Maria, Kostev, Karel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.013","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25412,""
"Application of mobile health to support the elderly during the COVID-19 outbreak: A systematic review","Background : The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the elderly's physical and mental health. The application of information and communication technology, such as mobile health (m-health), can help control this pandemic by changing the behavior and lifestyle of the elderly during this time of crisis. Objective : This review aimed to synthesize the capabilities of m-health in providing health services to the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify the factors contributing to the success of these tools. Methods : To find the relevant studies, a search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria were: studies in English that used m-health intervention in all aspects of elderly healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak, were published in peer-reviewed journals from 31 December 2019, and had any research design and methodology. Two authors independently took all the steps of this review, and finally performed narrative synthesis to report the findings. Results : Our initial search identified 421 studies, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. The data analysis showed that all the m-health interventions had positive effects on the health of the elderly. The m-health services for the elderly during the current pandemic were used for therapy, information provision, self-help, monitoring, and mental health consultation purposes. The results also indicated that various factors affected the elderly's use of m-health tools. Conclusion : The application of m-health keeps the elderly and healthcare providers safe, accelerates health service provision, reduces the costs of service provision, and decreases the risk of morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak. The successful use of m-health tools for the elderly in health programs during the current crisis greatly depends on supporting the elderly and overcoming the barriers.","Abbaspur-Behbahani, Sara, Monaghesh, Elham, Hajizadeh, Alireza, Fehresti, Saeedeh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2022.100595","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Health Policy and Technology;: 100595, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25413,""
"Post-COVID-19 psychiatric and cognitive morbidity: Preliminary findings from a Brazilian cohort study","Objective The present study aims to investigate the occurrence of psychiatric and cognitive impairments in a cohort of survivors of moderate or severe forms of COVID-19. Method 425 adults were assessed 6 to 9Â months after hospital discharge with a structured psychiatric interview, psychometric tests and a cognitive battery. A large, multidisciplinary, set of clinical data depicting the acute phase of the disease, along with relevant psychosocial variables, were used to predict psychiatric and cognitive outcomes using the â€˜Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operatorâ€™ (LASSO) method. Results Diagnoses of â€˜depressionâ€™, â€˜generalized anxiety disorderâ€™ and â€˜post-traumatic stress disorderâ€™ were established respectively in 8%, 15.5% and 13.6% of the sample. After pandemic onset (i.e., within the previous year), the prevalence of â€˜depressionâ€™ and â€˜generalized anxiety disorderâ€™ were 2.56% and 8.14%, respectively. Memory decline was subjectively reported by 51.1% of the patients. Psychiatric or cognitive outcomes were not associated with any clinical variables related to the severity of acute-phase disease, nor by disease-related psychosocial stressors. Conclusions This is the first study to access rates of psychiatric and cognitive morbidity in the long-term outcome after moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 using standardized measures. As a key finding, there was no significant association between clinical severity in the acute-phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the neuropsychiatric impairment 6 to 9Â months thereafter.","Damiano, Rodolfo Furlan, Caruso, Maria Julia GuimarÃ£es, Cincoto, Alissom Vitti, de Almeida Rocca, Cristiana Castanho, de PÃ¡dua Serafim, Antonio, Bacchi, Pedro, Guedes, Bruno F.; Brunoni, AndrÃ© R.; Pan, Pedro Mario, Nitrini, Ricardo, Beach, Scott, Fricchione, Gregory, Busatto, Geraldo, Miguel, Euripedes Constantino, Forlenza, Orestes V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.01.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25414,""

"Retrospective feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic among residents of long-term care facilities","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had an incisive effect on residents living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Local governments have introduced restrictive measures because of the danger posed by this virus. One increasing negative effect of these implementations among residents living in LTCFs is their subjective feelings of loneliness. This study assumed that these measures weighed heavily particularly on residents living in LTCFs, as this group of older people could not decide for themselves whether or how they should be implemented. Thus, this study investigated the retrospectively reported subjective loneliness of residents living in LTCFs. On a large-scale Swiss survey (NÂ =Â 828;mean age: 87.78, 75% female), residents of 22 LTCFs filled out a questionnaire on their subjective feelings of loneliness during the pandemic. The retrospective loneliness scores of the residents living in LTCFs were found to exceed those reported in other studies focusing on community-dwelling older people. Multivariate regression analyses showed that females, individuals with lower values of joy in life and life satisfaction, and individuals who were not satisfied with the manner in which their care home coped with the COVID-19 measures significantly felt lonelier. Therefore, the subjective feelings of loneliness of residents in LTCFs should be monitored very carefully. As the measures have still not been completely lifted, residents of LTCFs are assumed to still experience social isolation and be at high risk of encountering prolonged feelings of loneliness, which can be detrimental to their mental health and well-being.","Huber, A.; Seifert, A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahr.2022.100053","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Aging and Health Research;: 100053, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25416,""

"Coping with COVID-19 Prolonged and Cumulative Stressors: the Case Example of Egypt","The current study aimed to explore how COVID-19-traumatized populations cope using a coping model based on wills to exist, live, and survive (WTELS) that leads to positive coping and posttraumatic growth (PTG). We used data from 11 Arab countries (N = 2732), including Egypt (N = 831), and included measures for COVID-19 stressors (COVID-fear, economic, lockdown, and grief stressors), WTELS, resilience, religiosity, spirituality, social support, and PTG. We conducted ANOVA on the main sample to explore the differences between Arab countries, hierarchical regressions, and path analysis on the Egyptian subsample to test a model of the effects on WTELS. In the path model, WTELS was the independent variable. Other coping strategies were mediating variables, and COVID-19 stressor types were outcome variables. ANOVA on the main sample indicated that Egypt was the highest on COVID-19 stressors (infection fears, economic, lockdown, and grief stressors), actual infection, and WTELS. Hierarchical regression indicated that social support, resilience, and WTELS were positive predictors of PTG, with WTELS had the highest effect size (ÃŸ = .41) and WTELS being a negative predictor of COVID-19 stressors, while resilience and social support were not. Path analysis indicated that WTELS predicted higher religiosity, spirituality, social support, resilience, and lower COVID-19 stressors. Religiosity predicted higher spirituality, social support, and resilience and lower COVID-19 stressors. Interfaith spirituality predicted higher resilience and lower COVID-19 grief stressors. The results validated the central role of WTELS. Results helped to identify potentially effective interventions with COVID-19 victims that focus on WTELS, spirituality, and religiosity.

Moderate-severe depression was observed in 61 (22.5%), while 49 (18%) had moderate-severe anxiety;39 (14%) had both diagnoses. Mean (SD) stress score was 16.2 (7.4). There was no association between degree of severe COVID-19 risk and psychological morbidity. Flare symptoms and fatigue were associated with worse psychological morbidity, while accessibility of information regarding COVID-19 risk and reducing that risk was protective for depression (odds ratio [OR] 0.56 [0.33-0.94], P = 0.03), anxiety (OR 0.62 [0.4-0.96], P = 0.03), and stress (standardized beta-coefficient -0.15 [-0.28 to -0.03], P = 0.02). Seventy-nine (30%) respondents were interested in receiving psychological support during the pandemic, while 200 (76%) expressed interest beyond the pandemic. Conclusions: Although depression, anxiety, and stress among IBD patients during the pandemic were common, their frequency was similar to pre-pandemic rates and recent general population levels. Ensuring easy access to personalized risk information with targeted psychological support may mitigate psychological burden as patients reintegrate into society and deal with future COVID-19 waves.","Luber, R.

"Prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, and perceived stress and their relation with resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, a cross-sectional study","Background and aims Home quarantine and physical distancing at the time of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a severe effect on the mental health of the populations. Resilience has been reported previously to be a protective factor against anxiety, stress, and depression. This study evaluates the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress, and perceived stress and their relation with resilience associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of the general population in Southern Iran. Methods In this cross-sectional web-based survey, from April 12 to May 13, 2020, stress, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and resilience were measured using the Persian version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Statistical analyses were carried out using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Mean Â±?standard deviation (SD) and frequencies were used to describe demographic data. Independent sample t-test, Spearman correlation, and the Pearson correlation coefficient were performed to examine anxiety, depression, stress, and resilience. Results Among a total of 538 participants, the overall prevalence of moderate-to-extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 26.1%, 33.2%, and 5.8%, respectively. The overall median PSS and resilience score were 30 and 70, respectively. There was a significant association between higher age and perceived stress. Male and high income were related to higher resilience scores. Perceived stress positively correlates with resilience, whereas depression significantly correlates with anxiety and stress. Individuals with underlying disease demonstrated significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Also, perceived stress had a significant but weak, positive correlation with age and the number of quarantine days. Conclusion The occurring COVID-19 pandemic could be the culprit of psychological distress, anxiety, and depression of large population quantities. Our results showed a subordinate overall resilience in the general Iranian population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Parvar, Seyedeh Yasamin, Ghamari, Narges, Pezeshkian, Fatemehsadat, Shahriarirad, Reza","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.460","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Health Science Reports; 5(1):e460, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25421,""

"Family Factors Associated with Hands-On Play and Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background Parentâ€“child interactions are crucial for child development. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected mental health and increased parenting challenges impacting parentâ€“child functioning. Objective This study examined parent factors related to more and less enriching child activities during the pandemic through Bronfenbrennerâ€™s Ecological Systems framework. Methods A convenience sample of parents (N = 708), primarily mothers (n = 610;87.4%) aged 35.59Â years old (SD = 5.59;range = 21â€“72), with children ages 2â€“8Â years completed an online questionnaire between April 14-June 1, 2020. Participants mostly resided in Canada, had an income of &gt; $100,000, and identified as White (82.4%). Parentâ€“child activities were measured as total weekly time and combined time across activities within two categories: hands-on play and screen time. Bivariate correlations informed blockwise linear regression models. Results For families with childcare needs, parental anxiety was associated with higher total hands-on play, combined hands-on play, and combined screen time. Families without childcare needs indicated parenting stress was associated with lower total hands-on play and combined hands-on play, and higher supervised screen time. Family structure and indices of socioeconomic status were also predictive of activities across childcare needs and child ages. Conclusions To promote high-quality parentâ€“child interactions and positive developmental outcomes during the pandemic, childcare needs and parent wellbeing should be supported, while evidence-based guidelines for child screen time should be further researched in this context.","Stienwandt, Shaelyn, Cameron, Emily E.; Soderstrom, Melanie, Casar, Mercedes, Le, Cindy, Roos, Leslie E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Family+Factors+Associated+with+Hands-On+Play+and+Screen+Time+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Child & youth care forum;: 1-25, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25423,""
"QUALITY OF LIFE IN PREGNANT WOMEN INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2 AND ORAL HEALTH","Latest WHO reports estimate global mortality from Covid-19 infection at 3.4%. Pregnancy is a physiological condition that predisposes a woman to respiratory complications in viral infections. Due to physiological changes in the immune systems, pregnant women are more prone to severe forms of viral respiratory infections. Also, the hormonal changes that occurred during pregnancy have certain clinical manifestations in the form of gingival swellings, gingival bleeding, as well as favorable conditions for poor hygiene. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of pregnant women in terms of changes in the oral cavity. The study included 30 subjects - pregnant women in the first semester who were given a questionnaire consisting of 19 questions with general data, marital status, income, data on general and emotional health The data were recorded in the SPSS 26 for Windows program, establishing a statistical significance threshold of p &lt;= 0.05. The subjects felt the attention of doctors in the sense of encouragement and prompt response to telephone requests. However, 60% (18) had feelings of fear for them, feelings of fear and depression although had full support from spouse/family. The feelings were probably all the more exaggerated as all the subjects came in contact with patients infected with SARS Cov2, thus contacting the disease.

"Feasibility Study: Family-Based Pediatric Weight Management Program Adapted to Be Virtual","Background: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of schools across the United States(US), more children are struggling with mental health and obesity issues than ever before. KidShape, an evidence-based pediatric weight management program, had been implemented successfully across the United States as an in-person program. KidShape saw a need to reimagine the program in an online format to scale an effective family wellness program. Methods: Registered Dietitians (RD) and a health psychologist evaluated the nine-week KidShape behavioral family-based weight management intervention (totaling 26.5 contact hours over three months) to determine which evidence-based components were needed to implement the program online and meet the US Preventive Services Recommendation Statement for Obesity in Children as a comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions (2017). An online curriculum was designed for families with children ages 7 to 13 to meet one hour twice a week for 12 weeks plus a one-hour nutrition assessment at the beginning of the program and a nutrition reassessment at the program midpoint with an RD ( = 26 contact hours). The weekly family group sessions provide tools for healthy eating, improving physical activity, limiting screen time, mindfulness, problem solving, improving self-esteem/body image, and goal setting. The team evaluated three online platforms for implementation: Blackboard, Zoom and Outschool. Results: Virtual KidShape workshops were implemented with a combination of Outschool and Zoom platforms with the greatest success as determined by ease of use and participation. The RDs and health psychologist teaching the workshops were able to actively and positively engage with families virtually. The intervention was scalable quickly without physical space limitations. Families joined from multiple states and 100% provided positive feedback. Conclusions: Adaptation of KidShape, a comprehensive intensive behavioral intervention, to effectively address pediatric mental health and weight issues was feasible in an online virtual format. Families accessed the program accross the US regardless of geography. The evidence-based curriculum plus using technology that families were familiar with due to online school and parents working virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic created a positive user experience.","Rivard, Christiane M.

"Psychometric Validation of the Persian Self-Compassion Scale Youth Version","Objectives Empirical research investigating self-compassion is a rapidly developing field, and it is potentially crucial in early adolescence. The primary aim of the present study was to psychometrically evaluate the Persian translation of the Self-Compassion Scale Youth version (SCS-Y) and evaluate its factor structure among young adolescents. The second aim was to explore the buffering effect of self-compassion against the negative effect of difficulties in emotion regulation on COVID-19-related anxiety. Methods A sample of young students (n = 532;mean age 13.57Â years) completed an online survey, which included the SCS-Y, Patient Health Questionnaire, Difficulties In Emotion Regulation Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Youth Life Orientation Test, Brief Resilience Scale, and Brief 10-Item Big Five Inventory. First-order (six-factor) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and bi-factor exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) analysis were used to evaluate the factor structure of the SCS-Y. Results Results showed that the SCS-Y had very good internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient: 0.88;McDonaldâ€™s omega coefficient: 0.90), composite reliability (0.87), and adequate testâ€“retest reliability after 4Â weeks (0.60). The first-order (six-factor) CFA and bi-factor ESEM analysis demonstrated the SCS-Y had excellent dimensionality. Further analysis found negative associations between self-compassion with both depression and neuroticism, and positive associations between self-compassion with both resilience and optimism. Moreover, self-compassion moderated the association between emotion dysregulation and anxiety generated by the COVID-19. Overall, the findings indicated that the SCS-Y had acceptable criterion-related validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Conclusions The findings provide evidence that the SCS-Y is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the six factors of self-compassion among younger adolescents. Based on the studyâ€™s findings, self-compassion appears to be a protective factor against mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic for younger adolescents.","Nazari, Nabi, HernÃ¡ndez, Ronald M.; OcaÃ±a-Fernandez, Yolvi, Griffiths, Mark D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychometric+Validation+of+the+Persian+Self-Compassion+Scale+Youth+Version","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Mindfulness;: 1-13, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25430,""

"Effect of COVID-19 outbreak on anxiety among students of higher education;A review of literature","Background and Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of students and exacerbated the prevalence of anxiety among them. The purpose of the literature review was to consolidate evidence for the prevalence of anxiety among students of higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic and to underscore the effect of various pandemic-related factors on this anxiety. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing various databases such as MEDLINE, PsycInfo Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Embase to identify relevant studies. To be incorporated in this review, studies had to include students of higher education, measure the prevalence of anxiety, and assess anxiety during Covid-19 pandemic. Results 37 studies met the inclusion criteria and assessed the prevalence of anxiety among students during confinement. Studies showed that more than one-third of the students suffered from anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic. Moreover, being a female, living in rural areas, facing financial hardship, working full-time, spending the quarantine in isolation, worrying about infection for themselves and others, having the uncertainty of the future, having reduced sleep quality, and transitioning to online learning, were factors associated with increased anxiety during the pandemic.

"Risk of death in individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 with and without psychiatric disorders: an observational multicenter study in France","Background Prior research suggests that psychiatric disorders could be linked to increased mortality among patients with COVID-19. However, whether all or specific psychiatric disorders are intrinsic risk factors of death in COVID-19, or whether these associations reflect the greater prevalence of medical risk factors in people with psychiatric disorders, has yet to be evaluated. Methods We performed an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study to examine the association between psychiatric disorders and mortality among patients hospitalized for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at 36 Greater Paris University hospitals. Results Of 15,168 adult patients, 857 (5.7%) had an ICD-10 diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Over a mean follow-up of 14.6 days (SD=17.9), death occurred in 326/857 (38.0%) patients with a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder versus 1,276/14,311 (8.9%) in patients without such a diagnosis (OR=6.27;95%CI=5.40-7.28;p&lt;0.01). When adjusting for age, sex, hospital, current smoking status, and medications according to compassionate use or as part of a clinical trial, this association remained significant (AOR=3.27;95%CI=2.78-3.85;p&lt;0.01). However, additional adjustments for obesity and number of medical conditions resulted in a non-significant association (AOR=1.02;95%CI=0.84-1.23;p=0.86). Exploratory analyses following the same adjustments suggest that a diagnosis of mood disorders was significantly associated with reduced mortality, which might be explained by the use of antidepressants. Conclusions These findings suggest that the increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality in individuals with psychiatric disorders hospitalized for COVID-19 might be explained by the greater number of medical conditions and the higher prevalence of obesity in this population, but not by the underlying psychiatric disease.","Hoertel, Nicolas, SÃ¡nchez-Rico, Marina, Muela, Pedro de la, AbellÃ¡n, Miriam, Blanco, Carlos, Leboyer, Marion, Cougoule, CÃ©line, Gulbins, Erich, Kornhuber, Johannes, Carpinteiro, Alexander, Becker, Katrin Anne, Vernet, RaphaÃ«l, Beeker, NathanaÃ«l, Neuraz, Antoine, Alvarado, JesÃºs M.; Herrera-Morueco, Juan JosÃ©, Airagnes, Guillaume, Lemogne, CÃ©dric, Limosin, FrÃ©dÃ©ric, collaboration, Ap-Hp UniversitÃ© de Paris / INSERM COVID-19 research, Ap-Hp Covid Cdr Initiative, â€œEntrepÃ´t de DonnÃ©es de SantÃ©â€ A.

"The Association between Depression and Metabolic Syndrome Components in Adolescents with Obesity","Background: Obesity has metabolic consequences that were reported to have worsened by the co-existence of depression in adults. This relationship is explained by an overactive stress response and adoption of unhealthy lifestyle habits. The relationship between depression with obesity, its severity, and consequences is concerning, especially after an increase in prevalence of both during COVID-19. No data regarding this association is available for children and adolescents. The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) components in youth with obesity who are identified with depression and youth who are obese and are not diagnosed with depression. Methods: A retrospective review of patients with obesity seen at a pediatric weight management clinic between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021 was performed. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory data, and PHQ-9 depression screening tool scores were ed. Results: Out of 160 patients, only 46% had PHQ9 scores less than 5, which suggested no depression. 42 (26%) had a current/prior diagnosis of depression. Moderate to severe depression (scores &gt;= 10) was found in 25% of patients, including 18% of patients never diagnosed with depression. Scores were higher among those reporting daytime fatigue or trouble sleeping, and among patients that ate out 7 or more times per week compared to those that ate out less frequently. There were statistically significant associations between increasing weight, BMI, body fat percentage, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting blood insulin with higher PHQ9 scores (p &lt; 0.02 for all). Nonsignificant correlations were found between PHQ9 scores and SBP of serum lipids (spearman's r &lt; 30 for all). Conclusions: More than half of the adolescents with obesity had significant depression scores. Adolescents with higher PHQ9 scores had higher measurements of BMI, body fat percentage, diastolic blood pressure, and serum insulin. Screening and management of depression should be an important component of obesity management in adolescents.

"EFFECT OF COVID-19 ON COGNITIVE MATTER AND INSOMNIA APPLIED STUDY ON JORDANIAN PEOPLE","Background: The emerging of the COVID-19 pandemic has a strong mental impact on the people of Jordan. Some affected Jordanians still face a range of mental health problems due to social isolation, anxiety, and lockdowns. Studies are lacking in the mainstream analyzing this problem, particularly in Jordan. This study aims to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive matters and insomnia among the people of Jordan. Methods: A total of 388 Jordanians affected by COVID-19 pandemics were recruited in July 2020. The demographic information of all respondents was collected by a self-administered questionnaire Insomnia and cognitive matters were assessed through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for mental disorders screening. Results: the problem of insomnia and low cognitive matter existed generally among people of Jordan as affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 50% of the Jordanians scoring greater than eight on the ISI scale. Jordanians who were likely suffering from cognitive matter had more negative remembering, while individuals with pro-social behavior suffered from insomnia. The demographic results revealed statistically significant differences in the prevalence of insomnia and depression due to poor cognitive matter among COVID-19 affected Jordanians likely suffering from a cognitive matter affecting recognition of things or remembrance. Gender, age, and current place of residence were influencing factors for cognitive matter, while marital status and profession/job were influencing factors for insomnia. Conclusions: According to the findings, this study found that COVID-19 has encouraged a high incidence of insomnia symptoms and a relatively poor cognitive matter among Jordanians The potential cause of insomnia and poor cognitive matter might be linked with gender, age, current place of residence, marital status, profession/job, and the risks associated with the pandemic.","Al Soub, M.

"Association between unmet medication needs after hospital discharge and readmission or death among acute respiratory failure survivors: the addressing post-intensive care syndrome (APICS-01) multicenter prospective cohort study","Introduction Survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) commonly experience long-lasting physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments. Unmet medication needs occurring immediately after hospital discharge may have an important effect on subsequent recovery. Methods and analysis In this multicenter prospective cohort study, we enrolled ARF survivors who were discharged directly home from their acute care hospitalization. The primary exposure was unmet medication needs. The primary outcome was hospital readmission or death within 3Â months after discharge. We performed a propensity score analysis, using inverse probability weighting for the primary exposure, to evaluate the exposureâ€“outcome association, with an a priori sample size of 200 ARF survivors. Results We enrolled 200 ARF survivors, of whom 107 (53%) were female and 77 (39%) were people of color. Median (IQR) age was 55 (43â€“66) years, APACHE II score 20 (15â€“26) points, and hospital length of stay 14 (9â€“21) days. Of the 200 participants, 195 (98%) were in the analytic cohort. One hundred fourteen (57%) patients had at least one unmet medication need;the proportion of medication needs that were unmet was 6% (0â€“15%). Fifty-six (29%) patients were readmitted or died by 3Â months;10 (5%) died within 3Â months. Unmet needs were not associated (risk ratio 1.25;95% CI 0.75â€“2.1) with hospital readmission or death, although a higher proportion of unmet needs may have been associated with increased hospital readmission (risk ratio 1.7;95% CI 0.96â€“3.1) and decreased mortality (risk ratio 0.13;95% CI 0.02â€“0.99). Discussion Unmet medication needs are common among survivors of acute respiratory failure shortly after discharge home. The association of unmet medication needs with 3-month readmission and mortality is complex and requires additional investigation to inform clinical trials of interventions to reduce unmet medication needs. Study registration number: NCT03738774. The study was prospectively registered before enrollment of the first patient.

"Impact of COVID-19 public health restrictions on hospital admissions for young infants in Victoria, Australia","Strict public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic led to less support for infants and their parents. We aimed to characterise the frequency and nature of infant admissions to the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), Melbourne in 2020, compared to the previous year. A retrospective review of medical records identified infants Ã¢â€°Â¤3Ã‚Â months admitted to the general medicine unit, RCH from March to September in 2019 and 2020. Diagnoses potentially related to the impact of public health measures and reduced family and community supports were identified and compared to all infant diagnoses across both years. Clinical characteristics and need for referral for additional supports or mental health services were also ascertained. There were fewer admissions for infants Ã¢â€°Â¤3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months in 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°411) compared to 2019 (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°678), with a threefold increase in admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis of feeding difficulties, growth disturbance, infant irritability or maternal mental health concerns (191/411; 46% vs. 97/678; 14%). There were more infants of first-time parents (112/191; 59% vs. 44/97; 45%) and a reduction in the number of admissions due to infection (145/411; 35%; vs. 467/678; 69%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a threefold increase in admissions for infants Ã¢â€°Â¤3Ã‚Â months due to poor growth, feeding difficulties, irritability and maternal mental health concerns in 2020 compared to 2019. These findings may inform future pandemic planning and policy development to ensure maintenance of community supports such as maternal child health nurse (MCHN) service delivery for young infants.","Licheni, Devaraja, Watson, Simeonovic, Cheng, Hoq, Standish, Gawler, McNab, Danchin","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15885","20220112","COVID-19; feeding difficulties; growth; infants; post-partum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25445,""
"Pathways and obstacles to social recovery following the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from Aotearoa New Zealand: a qualitative cross-sectional study","Many public health experts have claimed that elimination strategies of pandemic response allow 'normal social life' to resume. Recognizing that social connections and feelings of normality are important for public health, this study examines whether, and for whom, that goal is realized, and identifies obstacles that may inhibit its achievement. Thematic analysis of narratives obtained via a qualitative cross-sectional survey of a community cohort in Aotearoa | New Zealand. A majority of participants reported that life after elimination was 'more or less the same' as before the pandemic. Some became more social. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority reported being less social, even many months after elimination. Key obstacles to social recovery included fears that the virus was circulating undetected and the enduring impact of lockdowns upon social relationships, personal habits and mental health. Within our sample, old age and underlying health conditions were both associated with a propensity to become less social. Elimination strategies can successfully allow 'normal social life' to resume. However, this outcome is not guaranteed. People may encounter difficulties with re-establishing social connections in Zero-COVID settings. Measures designed to overcome such obstacles should be an integral part of elimination strategies.","Long, Appleton, Davies, Deckert, Fehoko, Holroyd, Martin-Anatias, Sterling, Trnka, Tunufa'i","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab394","20220112","COVID-19; health policy; pandemic; sense of normality; social isolation; social relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25446,""
"The mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey in the UK","Higher education students' mental health has been a growing concern in recent years even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The stresses and restrictions associated with the pandemic have put university students at greater risk of developing mental health issues, which may significantly impair their academic success, social interactions and their future career and personal opportunities. This paper aimed to understand the mental health status of University students at an early stage in the pandemic and to investigate factors associated with higher levels of distress. An online survey including demographics, lifestyle/living situations, brief mental well-being history, questions relating to COVID-19 and standardised measures of depression, anxiety, resilience and quality of life was completed by 1173 students at one University in the North of England. We found high levels of anxiety and depression, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs, and females scoring significantly higher than males. The survey also suggested relatively low levels of resilience which we attribute to restrictions and isolation which reduced the opportunities to engage in helpful coping strategies and activities rather than enduring personality characteristics. Higher levels of distress were associated with lower levels of exercising, higher levels of tobacco use, and a number of life events associated with the pandemic and lockdown, such as cancelled events, worsening in personal relationships and financial concerns. We discuss the importance of longer-term monitoring and mental health support for university students.","Chen, Lucock","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262562","20220112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25447,""
"Lingering effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of first-year university students in Japan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is continuing unabated in Japan, as of October 2021. We aimed to compare first-year university students' psychological distress before the pandemic in 2019, during the pandemic in 2020, and one year after the onset of the pandemic, in 2021. The study conducted online surveys over three years from April to May each year. Participants were 400 first-year students in 2019, 766 in 2020, and 738 in 2021. We examined differences in scores on the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-Japanese version (CCAPS-Japanese) between the three years using a one-way analysis of variance, and differences in the CCAPS-Japanese critical items using chi-squared test and residual analysis. The average scores on the Depression and Generalized Anxiety subscale in 2021 were significantly higher than those in 2020, but remained the same as in 2019. The Academic Distress subscale score in 2020 was the worst compared to 2019 and 2021. Meanwhile, the number of students who experienced severe suicidal ideation increased year by year from 2019 to 2021. The mean mental health of first-year university students worsened after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and recovered to the pre-pandemic level over the next two years. However, the number of high-risk students with suicidal ideation continued to increase. A system is required for early detection and support for students at high risk of mental health issues.","Horita, Nishio, Yamamoto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262550","20220112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25448,""
"A call for nurses and interdisciplinary collaborators to urgently respond to the health and well-being needs of refugees across the world","The COVID-19 pandemic is compounding the distress of millions of refugees (made up of displaced persons, forced migrants, refugees and asylum seekers) throughout the world. This discursive paper pitches a challenge for the global nursing profession, within the multidisciplinary context, to consider its collective agency in responding to the health and well-being needs of a priority portion of the global population. Nursing leaders are encouraged to renew their commitment to the International Council of Nurses' Code of Ethics and consider the role of their profession in assisting global refugees, because the extent of present need has become an escalating major global humanitarian crisis. The nursing profession comprises half the world's healthcare workforce. The World Health Organization considers that nurses play a fundamental role in ensuring access to universal healthcare as a basic human right, addressing the global need for health promotion care, disease prevention and primary and community healthcare (International Council of Nurses, The ICN code of ethics for nurses; 2012). It is a human right to seek asylum from persecution, and in doing so, people should not be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or circumstances. Nurses are increasingly interested in fostering a healthy and adaptive environment in which people can thrive, despite personal, political, emotional, physical or social adversity. Nursing care is indispensable for the easement of human distress and for the promotion of comfort and coping. Nurses have an essential role in advocating for policies that will enhance immigrants' access to health/mental health services and address barriers irrespective of migrant/refugee/asylum seeker status. These are challenging times as the world responds to the pandemic crisis, and nurses are called to rise to global and local leadership roles and join with other health and social care colleagues in addressing the universal human health, social and political crisis of our time. The global nursing collective must come to terms with the need to initiate additional compelling ways to improve and integrate health and social care processes so that nursing care, mental health and social care augment a holistic achievement of appropriate care for refugees.","Wilson, Atem, Gumuskaya, Lavadas, Ã…Â oÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡, Urek","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15134","20220112","COVID-19; advocacy; allied health; asylum seekers; displaced persons; forced migrants; mental health; nursing; pandemic; refugees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25449,""

"Short-term impact of COVID-19 on quality of life, perceived stress, and serious psychological distress in an adult population in the midwest United States","This study aimed to investigate changes over time in quality of life, perceived stress, and serious psychological distress for individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in an urban academic health system. Phone-based surveys were completed with adult patients tested for COVID-19 during emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or outpatient visits at the Froedtert and Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network. Data were then matched to medical record data. Unadjusted and adjusted mixed effects linear models using random intercept were run for each outcome (physical health-related quality of life, mental health-related quality of life, perceived stress, and serious psychological distress) with time (baseline vs 3-month follow-up) as the primary independent variable. Individuals were treated as a random effect, with all covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, payor, comorbidity count, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay) treated as fixed effects. 264 adults tested positive for COVID-19 and completed baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Of that number, 31.8% were hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 10.2% were admitted for any reason to the ICU. After adjustment, patients reported higher physical health-related quality of life at 3Ã‚Â months compared to baseline (0.63, 95% CI 0.15, 1.11) and decreased stress at 3Ã‚Â months compared to baseline (- 0.85, 95% CI - 1.33, - 0.37). There were no associations between survey time and mental health-related quality of life or serious psychological distress.

"[Olfactory and gustatory disorders]","This manuscript aims to provide an overview of the etiology and diagnosis of olfactory and gustatory disorders. Not only are they common with about 5% of the population affected, but olfactory and gustatory disorders have recently gained attention in light of the rising SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 pandemic: sudden loss of smell and/or taste is regarded as one of the cardinal symptoms. Furthermore, in the early diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases, olfactory disorders are of great importance. Patients with olfactory dysfunction often show signs of depression. The impact of olfactory/gustatory disorders is thus considerable, but therapeutic options are unfortunately still limited. Following a description of the etiology, the diagnostic and therapeutic options are discussed on the basis of current literature. Potential future treatments are also addressed, e.g. autologous mucosal grafts or olfactory implants.

"Comparison of Self-harm or Overdose Among Adolescents and Young Adults Before vs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario","Self-harm and deaths among adolescents and young adults are notably related to drug poisonings and suicide. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are projections about a greater likelihood of such events arising among adolescents and young adults. To evaluate the risk of self-harm, overdose, and all-cause mortality among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. This population-based cohort study took place in Ontario, Canada, where a universal health care system captures all emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. The participants included all adolescents and young adults born in Ontario between 1990 and 2006, who were aged 14 to 24 years between March 1, 2018, and June 30, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic era (April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021), relative to the 2 years preceding the pandemic (March 1, 2018 to February 28, 2020). ED encounters or hospitalizations for self-harm or overdose. A secondary outcome was self-harm, overdose, or all-cause mortality. Cause-specific hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were used for the primary outcome. Follow-up started at March 1, 2018, or the individual's 14th birthday, whichever was later, and age was used as the time scale. In this study, 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯690Ã¢â‚¬Â¯733 adolescents and young adults (823 904 [51.3%] female participants) were included with a median (IQR) age of 17.7 (14.1-21.4) years at start of follow-up. After 4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯110Ã¢â‚¬Â¯903 person-years of follow-up, 6224 adolescents and young adults experienced the primary outcome of self-harm or overdose during the pandemic (39.7 per 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years) vs 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯970 (51.0 per 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years) prepandemic, with an HR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.75-0.80).

"Validation of the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire in Israel and Switzerland","The ICD-11 has introduced a new conceptualization of adjustment disorder (AjD) as a stress response syndrome with core symptoms of preoccupations and failure to adapt to the stressor. The current study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ) in two culturally distinct samples from Israel and Switzerland. Two samples were recruited in Israel (N = 1142) and Switzerland (N = 699) during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a correlated two-factor model provided an excellent fit to the Israeli and Swiss sample data. The IADQ scores correlated strongly with another measure of AjD symptoms, and with symptoms of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and negative emotions whereas correlations with posttraumatic stress disorder, complex posttraumatic stress disorder, and positive emotions were weaker. In the Swiss sample, 18.8% met diagnostic criteria for probable AjD and 10.2% in the Israeli sample. The current study provides the first evidence of the validity of the German and Hebrew versions of the IADQ and can be used for the screening of this debilitating condition.","Levin, Bachem, Hyland, Karatzias, Shevlin, Ben-Ezra, Maercker","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2710","20220112","Adjustment Disorder; Psychometrics; Stress related Disorders; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25455,""
"Factors associated with peritraumatic stress symptoms among the frontline healthcare workers during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China","This study aimed to examine the prevalence of peritraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs), perceived threat, social support and factors contributing to clinically significant PTSS among frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers (HCWs) in China. An online survey through self-administered questionnaires was conducted from 18 February to 4 March 2020, during the outbreak of COVID-19. PTSS was assessed using the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) self-rating scale. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, self-reported health, physical/psychological symptoms, perceived threat from frontline work and perceived social support were investigated. Multivariable line regression analysis distinguished factors associated with HCWs' PTSS scores. A total of 676 (58.1%) HCWs have shown clinically significant high levels of PTSS. Only 441 (37.9%) self-reported good health. Most had physical symptom(s) (915 (78.7%)), psychological symptom(s) (906 (77.9%)), inability to vent emotions (284 (24.4%)), emotional exhaustion (666 (57.3%)) and 1037 (89.2%) needed professional respect. Moreover, social support received was less than expected, and the receipt of psychological services/help scored the lowest (3.11Ã‚Â±1.73). Combined psychological and physical symptoms, difficulty in releasing tension and venting emotions timely, fear of infection, emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation are significantly associated with PTSS scores among frontline HCWs. Working Ã¢â€°Â¥8Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours, having the senior professional title, self-reported health, enjoying perfect protection and control measures, economic subsidy and control policy on reducing discriminatory practices are negatively correlated with PTSS scores. During the outbreak of COVID-19, frontline HCWs experienced clinically significant high levels of PTSS and heavy workload, and the emergency resulted in their inadequate psychosocial support. If this is left unchecked, HCWs have a higher risk of developing PTSD. Early detection, identification and person-directed, targeted multidisciplinary interventions should be undertaken to address various influencing factors. Comprehensive measures, including setting up emotional release channels, as well as providing psychological and social support intervention for HCWs globally, are highly recommended.","Qi, Wang, Liu, Amporfro, Wang, Liu, Shah, Wu, Hao","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047753","20220112","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; health &amp; safety; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25456,""
"'When will this end? Will it end?' The impact of the March-June 2020 UK COVID-19 lockdown response on mental health: a longitudinal survey of mothers in the Born in Bradford study","To explore clinically important increases in depression/anxiety from before to during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown and factors related to this change, with a particular focus on ethnic differences. Pre-COVID-19 and lockdown surveys nested within two longitudinal Born in Bradford cohort studies. 1860 mothers with a child aged 0-5 or 9-13, 48% Pakistani heritage. ORs for a clinically important increase (5 points or more) in depression (eight item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)) in unadjusted regression analyses, repeated with exposures of interest separated by ethnicity to look for differences in magnitude of associations, and lived experience of mothers captured in open text questions. The number of women reporting clinically important depression/anxiety increased from 11% to 20% (95% CI 10%-13%; 18%-22%) and from 10% to 16% (95% CI 8%-11%; 15%-18%), respectively. Increases in depression/anxiety were associated with loneliness (OR=8.37, 95% CI 5.70 to 12.27; 8.50, 95% CI 5.71 to 12.65, respectively); financial (6.23, 95% CI 3.96 to 9.80; 6.03, 95% CI 3.82 to 9.51), food (3.33, 95% CI 2.09 to 5.28; 3.46, 95% CI 2.15 to 5.58) and housing insecurity (3.29, 95% CI 2.36 to 4.58; 3.0, 95% CI 2.11 to 4.25); a lack of physical activity (3.13, 95% CI 2.15 to 4.56; 2.55, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.78); and a poor partner relationship (3.6, 95% CI 2.44 to 5.43; 5.1, 95% CI 3.37 to 7.62). The magnitude of associations between key exposures and worsening mental health varied between ethnic groups.Responses to open text questions illustrated a complex interplay of challenges contributing to mental ill health including: acute health anxieties; the mental load of managing multiple responsibilities; loss of social support and coping strategies; pressures of financial and employment insecurity; and being unable to switch off from the pandemic. Mental ill health has worsened for many during the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly in those who are lonely and economically insecure. The magnitude of associations between key exposures and worsening mental health varied between ethnic groups. Mental health problems may have longer term consequences for public health and interventions that address the potential causes are needed.","Dickerson, Kelly, Lockyer, Bridges, Cartwright, Willan, Shire, Crossley, Bryant, Siddiqi, Sheldon, Lawlor, Wright, McEachan, Pickett, Hou, Santorelli, West, Sohal, Sheard, Mon-Williams, McCooe, Lawton","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047748","20220112","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25457,""
"Children and adolescents' sleep patterns and their associations with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China","Background School closures and home confinement due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may lead to disrupted sleep patterns. Consequently, it could increase the risk of children and adolescents' mental health disorders. Methods In this prospective study, we randomly selected ten schools in Shanghai and conducted cluster sampling of students from each school. The first wave of the survey was conducted between January 3 and 21, 2020. Approximately two months after the COVID-19 outbreak declared, a second wave of the survey was conducted. In total, 2,427 individuals were surveyed in both waves using the same sampling method. Participants' mental health status (depression, anxiety and stress), sleep patterns and other demographic information were measured in both waves. Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine the associations between sleep patterns and mental health status. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 873 participants (19.9%), 1,100 participants (25.1%), and 670 participants (15.3%) reported depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Significant changes of both sleep duration and sleep-wake cycle patterns were observed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, shorter sleep duration and late to rise patterns (including early to bed late to rise and late to bed late to rise) were found to be associated with higher odds of having mental illnesses during the pandemic. Conclusions These results suggest there is a pressing need to monitor children's and adolescents' health behaviour and mental health and develop timely evidence-based strategies and interventions to mitigate adverse behavioural and psychological impacts caused by these unprecedented challenges.","Zhao, Xu, He, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.123","20220112","COVID-19; Children and adolescents; Mental health; School closure; Sleep patterns","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25458,""
"Perception, Prevalence, and Prediction of Severe Infection and Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19","The aim of the study was to assess, characterize, and describe the prevalence and predicting factors of patient-reported severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). We prospectively surveyed patients who received care in our outpatient clinic for COVID-19 from March 13, 2020, through August 17, 2020, and then retrospectively reviewed their electronic health records. We collected data for age, sex, and persistence of symptoms and compared data for hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Continuous and categorical variables were summarized, including time from COVID-19 onset, time to resuming normal activities, and length of time away from work. Of those receiving the survey, 437 adult patients with different degrees of severity of COVID-19 illness responded: 77% were between 3 and 6 months from the onset of infection. In total, 34.9% had persistent symptoms, and 11.5% were hospitalized. The most common symptom was fatigue (75.9%), followed by poor sleep quality (60.3%), anosmia (56.8%), dysgeusia (55%), and dyspnea (54.6%). Predicting factors for PASC were female sex and a negative psychological impact of the disease. Age, hospitalization, persistent symptoms, psychological impact (eg, anxiety and depression), and time missed from work were significantly associated with perception of having severe COVID-19 illness. Hospitalization was not significantly associated with PASC. Over one-third of patients in our study had PASC. Persistent symptoms correlated with severity of disease and were significantly more common for women, for patients who had psychological symptoms (depression and/or anxiety), and for patients reporting inability to resume normal activities.","Knight, Munipalli, Logvinov, Halkar, Mitri, Dabrh, Hines","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2022.01.002","20220112","Eepidemiology; SARS; fatigue; infectious diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25459,""

"Mental health status among prison officers in the process of enforcing the law during COVID-19epidemic: a cross-sectional survey from China","A global public health emergency triggered by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic may have are markable psychological impact on the population. There is still limited psychological research on police officers, especially prison officers in the process of enforcing the law. The present study aims to identify prevalence and influencing factors on mental health status among frontline prison officers in China during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A cross-sectional survey with a sample of 981 frontline prison officers was conducted using snowball sampling approach. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 4 parts: (i) informed consent form; (ii) socio-demographic section; (iii) work and life situations during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic; (iv) the Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify factors influencing mental health status. The prevalence of being prone to mental health problems (GHQ-12 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°4) was 33.43% among frontline prison officers. The results of GHQ-12 factors analysis indicated that the prison officers suffered from psychological issues was related to anxiety and depression, which main symptoms were unhappy and depressed, lost sleep over worry and constantly under strain. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that male (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.573, 95% CI:1.385-1.853), lockdown shift inside the prison(ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.203, 95% CI:2.139-2.297), more night shifts (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.163, 95% CI:2.031-2.317; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.749, 95% CI:2.194-2.901), more smoking (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.100, 95% CI:1.037-2.168), poor self-reported physical condition (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.947, 95% CI:1.478-2.250), chronic or serious illness history(ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.870, 95% CI:1.314-2.660; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.214, 95% CI:1.460-2.812) were risk factors for mental health among frontline prison officers, while regular diet (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.779, 95% CI:0.539-0.928), more physical exercise (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.702, 95% CI:0.548-0.899; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.641, 95% CI:0.316-0.887), more communication with family members (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.437, 95% CI:0.295-0.616) were protective factors. Chinese frontline prison officers experienced different psychological stress coming from the prevention and control of this epidemic. Therefore, continued surveillance of psychological problems and targeted mental health care for frontline prison officers were urgent.","Li, Wen, He, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03679-0","20220112","Administrative governance; COVID-19; Execution of punishment; Frontline prison officers; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25461,""

"Monitoring disinfection in the Covid-19 era A reagent-free nanostructured smartphone-based device for the detection of oxidative disinfectants","In this work, a ready-to-use colorimetric device for oxidative disinfectants (i.e., H2O2, C2H4O3, and NaClO) detection has been developed and proved for the evaluation of disinfection treatments in the COVID-19 containment framework. The sensing element of the proposed colorimetric indicator consists of a transparent flexible PET substrate integrating gold and silver nanostructures. The nano-equipped indicator was integrated into different devices realized using a craft-cutting plotter taking advantage of adhesive/thermo-adhesive flexible pouches and filter paper. In particular, two devices are presented (i) a flexible multi-analysis sampling plate and (ii) a paper-based sampling pipette, for the determination of oxidant disinfectants concentration, evaluation of disinfection treatments by spraying/fogging, and for the analysis of disinfectant residues. The sensing strategy relies on the ability of the disinfectants to oxidize the silver nanostructures of the indicator substrate, producing a colorimetric variation monitorable by a smartphone, maximizing the sensitivity using a colored background. The proposed colorimetric assay occurs in 5Â min and does not use external reagents; contact of the disinfectant with the sensing surface is the only requirement. The devices had very low limits of detection (~1 ppb) and good reproducibility (RSDÂ =Â 2 %, nÂ =Â 3) for direct disinfectants analysis. They were challenged for the evaluation of indoor disinfection treatments, allowing to evaluate spraying and fogging treatments, as well as residues monitoring. The here proposed system is disposable, low-cost both in therm of material and reagents (0.05 â‚¬) and instruments required, portable, and able to return information on the good practices recommended for environmental disinfection.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2021.107165","20220401","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-13","",25463,""
