"Psychological Distress and Unmanaged Negative Emotions: Examining Resilience Among Nurses Working on COVID-19 Designated Inpatient Units","Anecdotal evidence suggests nurses are engaging in resilience-based strategies to mitigate increased levels of psychological distress and unmanaged negative emotions they have been experiencing. Nurses' levels of resilience during the corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have not been clearly articulated, specifically in relation to psychological distress and negative emotions. The purpose of the current mixed-methods non-experimental descriptive study was to examine nurses' resilience during the pandemic. Sixty RNs working in acute care hospitals on inpatient units designated to care for patients with COVID-19 completed the study survey and 20 of these RNs completed an interview. Findings indicate moderate levels of resilience among participants, with the need to increase resources and support emerging as a common theme among the qualitative data. Suggestions for integration of resilience-based strategies into the clinical setting, such as creation of a dedicated space for nurses to engage in mindfulness, relaxation, and meditation, were put forward.

"Patients Hospitalized for Psychiatric Problems and Their Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Toward COVID-19","The current study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) of persons hospitalized for psychiatric problems and the correlation between knowledge and demographics. A correlational, cross-sectional study was used to collect data through structured interviews from a convenience sample of 200 patients with psychiatric disorders seeking treatment at a psychiatric hospital using the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices questionnaire. Participants had poor knowledge (51.5%), moderate attitudes (75%), and low to moderate practices (61%) toward COVID-19. Knowledge was different across most demographic and illness-related variables. Global assessment of functioning and educational level predicted knowledge and accounted for 37.5% of the variance. Due to disability and poor self-care, persons hospitalized for psychiatric problems are more vulnerable to infectious diseases than the general population. Mental health nurses need to raise KAP toward COVID-19. Current results are informative to health care policymakers and mental health authorities in helping identify target populations for prevention and education about COVID-19.

"Mental health prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with bipolar disorder: Insights from prospective longitudinal data","Many studies have examined the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the public, but few have focused on individuals with existing severe mental illness with longitudinal data before and during the pandemic. To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with bipolar disorder (BD). In an ongoing study of people with BD who used an online mood monitoring tool, True Colours, 356 participants provided weekly data on their mental health. Symptoms of depression, mania, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts were compared in 2019 and 2020. From May 2020, participants also provided weekly data on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, coping strategies, access to care, and medications. On average, symptoms of depression, mania, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts did not significantly differ in 2020 compared to 2019, but there was evidence of heterogeneity. There were high rates of anxiety about the pandemic and its impact on coping strategies, which increased to over 70% of responders in January 2021. A significant proportion of participants reported difficulty accessing routine care (27%) and medications (21%). Although mood symptoms did not significantly increase during the pandemic overall, we observed heterogeneity among our BD sample and other impacted areas. Individuals' unique histories and psychosocial circumstances are key and should be explored in future qualitative studies. The significant impacts of the pandemic may take time to manifest, particularly among those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, highlighting the need for further long-term prospective studies.","Lewis, Gordon-Smith, Saunders, Dolman, South, Geddes, Craddock, Di Florio, Jones, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.13204","20220322","Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; depression; longitudinal; mania","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28832,""
"COVID-19 and the enteric system: rapidly propagating issues","The newly described SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus is now righteously presenting as an ominous threat, based on the speed with which it originated a zoonosis from bats; advancing at a similar rate, the virus has placed mankind before a pandemic, with an infection toll of some 431 million, and a lethality of 5,9 million (as of 25 February 2022). The size of the harm that this agent can unleash against us is appallingly wide, from brain ischemia to foot chilblain, passing by heart massive infarction. Designing a possible response, we reappraised the well-known equation depression-inflammation, and tested the hypothesis that an upgraded ease-of-mind might help reduce the host's hospitality towards SARS-CoV-2. With time passing, it becomes increasingly evident that the virus shall tend to progressively occupy spaces, replacing pandemics with an apparently calm endemicity. This will have to be avoided, and surveillance of society on psychological terms will be one tenet.

"Associations between longitudinal changes in sleep disturbance and depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 virus pandemic among older women with and without breast cancer in the thinking and living with breast cancer study","Several studies have reported sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 virus pandemic. Little data exist about the impact of the pandemic on sleep and mental health among older women with breast cancer. We sought to examine whether women with and without breast cancer who experienced new sleep problems during the pandemic had worsening depression and anxiety. Breast cancer survivors aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60Ã‚Â years with a history of nonmetastatic breast cancer (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 242) and frequency-matched noncancer controls (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 158) active in a longitudinal cohort study completed a COVID-19 virus pandemic survey from May to September 2020 (response rate 83%). Incident sleep disturbance was measured using the restless sleep item from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). CES-D score (minus the sleep item) captured depressive symptoms; the State-Anxiety subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory measured anxiety symptoms. Multivariable linear regression models examined how the development of sleep disturbance affected changes in depressive or anxiety symptoms from the most recent prepandemic survey to the pandemic survey, controlling for covariates. The prevalence of sleep disturbance during the pandemic was 22.3%, with incident sleep disturbance in 10% and 13.5% of survivors and controls, respectively. Depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the pandemic among women with incident sleep disturbance (vs. no disturbance) (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.16, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01 and ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.14, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01, respectively), but there were no survivor-control differences in the effect. Development of sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 virus pandemic may negatively affect older women's mental health, but breast cancer survivors diagnosed with the nonmetastatic disease had similar experiences as women without cancer.","Bethea, Zhai, Zhou, Ahles, Ahn, Cohen, Dilawari, Graham, Jim, McDonald, Nakamura, Patel, Rentscher, Root, Saykin, Small, Van Dyk, Mandelblatt, Carroll","https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4682","20220322","behavioral science; breast cancer; epidemiology; psychosocial studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28834,""
"[Mental health and pandemic in children and adolescents: what is likely to label as ""long-covid""]","Long-covid is a typical condition of adults with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the previous 3 months and with symptoms lasting over 2 months not explained by an alternative diagnosis. In pediatric age the lack of significative differences comparing the reported symptoms between seropositive and seronegative suggests that long-covid might be less common than previously thought, emphasizing the impact of pandemic-associated symptoms regarding the well-being and mental health of young adolescents.

"Path analysis from COVID-19 Perceptions to Psychological Health: The roles of Critical Distance and Mastery","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was previously associated with psychopathological symptoms. However, the psychological mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unexplored. Previous studies suggested associations between metacognitive abilities (e.g.., mastery) and symptomatology, which may have impacts on COVID-19 perceptions. This study aims to explore, using path analysis, the mediational role of Critical Distance (differentiation and decentration abilities) and Mastery on the relationships between COVID-19 perceptions, and psychological well-being and distress. In a cross-sectional design, 227 participants (M= 34.21, SD=10.9) filled self-report questionnaires. Metacognitive abilities were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms. Both Critical Distance and Mastery mediated the path from COVID-19 perceived severity and anxiety to psychological distress and well-being. Critical Distance seems to augment Mastery which tends to increase psychological well-being and limited psychological distress. Metacognition seems to play a mediational role on the relationship between COVID-19 perceptions and mental health. Clinical psychologists and psychotherapists may enhance psychological interventions regarding COVID-19 psychopathological symptomatology by working on metacognitive Critical Distance) and Mastery abilities.","Faustino, Vasco, Farinha-Fernandes, Delgado, Guerreiro, Matos","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2736","20220322","COVID-19 perceptions; Critical Distance; Mastery; Metacognition; Symptomatology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28836,""
"Anxiety, depression, stress, burnout, and professional quality of life among the hospital workforce during a global health pandemic","Working in a hospital setting during a global health pandemic can lead to increased levels of anxiety, stress, burnout, and depression. Anecdotal evidence exists, but there is little research utilizing clinically validated tools to measure hospital staff psychological distress. In Summer 2021, 771 hospital staff in North Dakota responded to an electronic survey collecting demographic data and employing validated behavioral health screening tools to assess anxiety, depression, emotional distress, and work-related quality of life. Compassion satisfaction was significantly higher for those who worked in rural areas than urban [t(769) = -1.99, P = .0467]. The burnout rating was significantly higher for those who worked in urban areas than rural [t(769) = 2.23, P = .0261)]. There was no significant geographic variation in stress, anxiety, or depression. Anxiety, depression, burnout, and stress were all significantly higher for those who worked directly with COVID-19 patients than those who did not, regardless of hospital location. Hospital staff caring for COVID-19 patients experienced equitable (and high) levels of depression and anxiety. However, data indicate that rural providers experienced greater protective factors, resulting in lower rates of burnout and higher compassion satisfaction. Rural communities, hospitals, and health systems may have characteristics that could be duplicated in urban areas to support hospital staff well-being. Support and promotion of mental wellness must also come from the hospital system, and health care and policy leaders. If we do not care for our hospital staff, there will not be hospital staff left to care for the community.","Kelly, Schroeder, Leighton","https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12659","20220322","COVID-19; behavioral health; burnout; compassion fatigue; provider well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28837,""
"GP wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","Doctors' organisations in the UK have reported worrying levels of work-related stress and burnout in the GP workforce for some time, and the COVID-19 pandemic has presented clear new challenges. To synthesise international evidence exploring the impact of COVID-19 on primary care doctors' mental health and wellbeing, and identify risk factors associated with their psychological wellbeing during this time. Mixed-methods systematic review. Six bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, and <i>MedRxiv</i> were searched on 19 November 2020 and 3 June 2021 to identify studies of GP psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. Reference checking was also conducted. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of studies using standardised tools. Heterogeneity in outcomes, setting, and design prohibited statistical pooling; studies were combined using a convergent integrated thematic synthesis. Thirty-one studies were included. Multiple sources of stress were identified including changed working practices; risk, exposure, and inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE); information overload; pandemic preparedness; and cohesion across sectors. Studies demonstrated an impact on psychological wellbeing, with some GPs experiencing stress, burnout, anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, lower job satisfaction, and physical symptoms. Studies reported gender and age differences: women GPs had poorer psychological outcomes across all domains, and older GPs reported greater stress and burnout. Use of outcome measures and reporting practice varied greatly. This review of international evidence demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected GPs' wellbeing around the world. Further research could explore gender and age differences, identifying interventions targeted to these groups.","Jefferson, Golder, Heathcote, Avila, Dale, Essex, van der Feltz Cornelis, McHugh, Moe-Byrne, Bloor","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGP.2021.0680","20220322","COVID-19; coronavirus; general practice; mental health; systematic review; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28838,""
"UK children's sleep and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Sleep and mental wellbeing are intimately linked. This relationship is particularly important to understand as it emerges over childhood. Here we take the opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting lockdown in the UK, presented to study sleep-related behaviour and anxiety in school-aged children. Parents and children were asked to complete questionnaires towards the start of the UK lockdown in April-to-May of 2020, then again in August of that year (when many restrictions had been lifted). We explored children's emotional responses to the pandemic and sleep patterns at both time points, from the perspectives of parents and children themselves. Children's bedtime anxiety increased at the start of the lockdown as compared to a typical week; however, by August, bedtime anxiety had ameliorated along with children's COVID-19 related anxiety. Bedtime anxiety predicted how long it took children to fall asleep at night at both the start and the end of theÃ‚Â lockdown. Bedtime and wake-up time shifted at the start of lockdown, but interestingly total sleep time was resilient (likely owing to an absence of early school start times) and was not predicted by child anxiety. These findings further support calls for sleep quality (in particular, time taken to fall asleep) to be taken as a key indicator of mental health in children, particularly under usual circumstances when schools are open and sleep duration may be less resilient.","Knowland, van Rijn, Gaskell, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00729-4","20220322","Anxiety; COVID-19; Childhood; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28839,""
"The impact of an integrated safer use space and safer supply program on non-fatal overdose among emergency shelter residents during a COVID-19 outbreak: a case study","Opioid-related harms, including fatal and non-fatal overdoses, rose dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic and presented unique challenges during outbreaks in congregate settings such as shelters. People who are deprived of permanent housing have a high prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders, and need nimble, rapid, and portable harm reduction interventions to address the harms of criminalized substance use in an evidence-based manner. In February 2021, a COVID-19 outbreak was declared at an emergency men's shelter in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Building on pre-existing relationships, community and hospital-based addictions medicine providers and a local harm reduction group collaborated to establish a shelter-based opioid agonist treatment and safer supply program, and a volunteer run safer drug use space that also distributed harm reduction supplies. In the 4Ã‚Â weeks preceding the program, the rate of non-fatal overdoses was 0.93 per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. During the 26Ã‚Â days of program operation, there were no overdoses in the safer use space and the rate of non-fatal overdoses in the shelter was 0.17 per 100 nights of shelter bed occupancy. The odds ratio of non-fatal overdose pre-intervention to during intervention was 5.5 (95% CI 1.63-18.55, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0059). We were not able to evaluate the impact of providing harm reduction supplies and did not evaluate the impact of the program on facilitating adherence to public health isolation and quarantine orders. The program ended as the outbreak waned, as per the direction from the shelter operator. There was a significant reduction in the non-fatal overdose rate after the safer drug use and safer supply harm reduction program was introduced. Pre-existing relationships between shelter providers, harm reduction groups, and healthcare providers were critical to implementing the program. This is a promising approach to reducing harms from the criminalization of substance use in congregate settings, particularly in populations with a higher prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders.","Lew, Bodkin, Lennox, O'Shea, Wiwcharuk, Turner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00614-8","20220322","Case study; Controlled substances; Homeless shelters; Overdose; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28840,""

Online data on anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, overall mental health, and demographic information was collected from 2305 school staff in the greater Vancouver area between February 3 and June 18, 2021, as part of a seroprevalence study. School staff reported significantly higher anxiety symptoms than a national representative survey in Spring 2021 and higher exposure contact time with students was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, in addition to sex and age, but not level of education and ethnicity. School staff also reported poorer mental health and higher levels of psychological distress compared to pre-pandemic population measures. Cross-sectional design, self-report measures.

"Optimism as a protective factor against the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic through its effects on perceived stress and infection stress anticipation","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the recommended social isolation presented a challenge to people's mental health status. Optimism is a psychological factor that plays a key role in the evaluation of stressful situations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of perceived stress and Covid-19-related stress anticipation in the relationship between optimism and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Our sample included 1015 participants ranging in age from 18 to 79 years, 80% of whom were Spaniards. At the beginning of the worldwide pandemic, participants were confined to their homes for at least seven days and completed an online survey measuring various sociodemographic and psychological variables. We found an indirect effect of optimism on intrusion and hyperarousal through perceived stress and stress anticipation. In addition, we observed an indirect effect of optimism on avoidance through perceived stress. Finally, the results showed a significant indirect effect of optimism on the total post-traumatic stress symptoms score through perceived stress and stress anticipation.

"A Pilot Study Comparing Two Measures of Perceived Health Services Access Among Military Veterans With Musculoskeletal Injuries and Mental Health Conditions","Service members endure a number of musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs) during service (e.g., ankle sprains and chronic back pain). Musculoskeletal injuries can reduce engagement in physical activity after military service and contribute to a sedentary lifestyle that diminishes physical health and elevates the risk for psychological distress including suicide-related behaviors. Yet, little is known about barriers and facilitators to accessing care in veterans with co-occurring MSI and mental health conditions. The purpose of this study was to pilot two brief measures of barriers and facilitators to rehabilitation and mental health services in military veterans with musculoskeletal and mental health conditions. Self-report tools vary in their response formats in ways that can impact usability, data quality, and completeness. We examine two response styles (i.e., checklist vs. thermometer) for two health services (mental health and rehabilitation) to determine usability, patterns in item endorsement, and veteran preference. Barriers and facilitators informed by the Fortney Veterans Healthcare Access model were assessed by veterans (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31) on the newly developed 22-item, paper-and-pencil scale with separate ratings for mental health and rehabilitation services. All participants completed scales with both response styles and the order of administration was randomized (i.e., either the checklist first or the thermometer-style response first). Data also included self-reported demographics, musculoskeletal and mental health diagnoses, health-related quality of life, physical activity levels, mental health symptoms, suicide risk, and coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic-related stress. Veterans reported no differences in ease of use across response formats; however, 83.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26) preferred the checklist style, with only 3.22% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1) preferring the thermometer format. Checklist items also resulted in less missing data (i.e., range 0.00%-6.45%) than the thermometer-style option (i.e., range 6.45%-61.30%). On the checklist, total number of perceived barriers was low for mental health and rehabilitation services (i.e., MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.58 and MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.61, respectively). Distance to care and problems related to symptoms were the most frequently identified barriers for both services. Facilitators outnumbered barriers for mental and rehabilitation services, and nearness of the clinic/hospital was the top-rated facilitator for both. On the thermometer, the perceived strength of each mental health (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.37) and rehabilitation (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.81) service barrier was moderate (0-100 scale), while the average perceived strength of each mental health (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°61.66) and rehabilitation service (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°61.84) facilitator was higher. Associations between barrier and facilitator scores with mental and physical health indicators were small with exceptions. For instance, suicide attempt likelihood was positively correlated with rehabilitation services barriers; mental health burden was positively associated with both barriers and facilitators.

"Prevalence of Firearm Ownership Among Individuals With Major Depressive Symptoms","Both major depression and firearm ownership are associated with an increased risk for death by suicide in the United States, but the extent of overlap among these major risk factors is not well characterized. To assess the prevalence of current and planned firearm ownership among individuals with depression. Cross-sectional survey study using data pooled from 2 waves of a 50-state nonprobability internet survey conducted between May and July 7, 2021. Internet survey respondents were 18 years of age or older and were sampled from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Self-reported firearm ownership; depressive symptoms as measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Of 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯770 survey respondents (64.6% women and 35.4% men; 5.0% Asian, 10.8% Black, 7.5% Hispanic, and 74.0% White; mean [SD] age 45.8 [17.5]), 6929 (28.0%) reported moderate or greater depressive symptoms; this group had mean (SD) age of 38.18 (15.19) years, 4587 were female (66.2%), and 406 were Asian (5.9%), 725 were Black (10.5%), 652 were Hispanic (6.8%), and 4902 were White (70.7%). Of those with depression, 31.3% reported firearm ownership (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2167), of whom 35.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°777) reported purchasing a firearm within the past year. In regression models, the presence of moderate or greater depressive symptoms was not significantly associated with firearm ownership (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 0.98-1.17) but was associated with greater likelihood of a first-time firearm purchase during the COVID-19 pandemic (adjusted OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.56-2.02) and greater likelihood of considering a future firearm purchase (adjusted OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23-1.90). In this study, current and planned firearm ownership was common among individuals with major depressive symptoms, suggesting a public health opportunity to address this conjunction of suicide risk factors.","Perlis, Simonson, Green, Lin, Safarpour, Lunz Trujillo, Quintana, Chwe, Della Volpe, Ognyanova, Santillana, Druckman, Lazer, Baum","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.3245","20220322","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28846,""
"Representation of Ethics in COVID-19 Research: A Systematic Review","Ethical discourse in the scientific community facilitates the humane conduct of research. The urgent response to COVID-19 has rapidly generated a large body of literature to help policymakers and physicians address novel pandemic challenges. Plastic surgeons, in particular, have to manage the postponement of elective procedures and safely provide care for non-COVID-19 patients. Although COVID-19 research may provide guidance on these challenges, the extent to which ethical discussions are present in these publications remains unknown. Articles were identified systematically by searching the PubMed, Embase, Central, and Scopus databases using search terms related to ethics and COVID-19. The search included articles published during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following data were extracted: presence of an ethical discussion, date of publication, topic of ethical discussion, and scientific discipline of the article. One thousand seven hundred fifty-three articles were included, of which seven were related to plastic surgery. The ethical principle with the greatest representation was nonmaleficence, whereas autonomy had the least representation. Equity and access to care was the most common topic of ethical discussion; the mental health effects of COVID-19 were the least common. The principle of justice had the greatest variation in representation. In a systematic review of COVID-19-related articles that were published during the first 9 months of the pandemic, the ethical principles of autonomy and justice are neglected in ethical discussions. As ethical dilemmas related to COVID-19 remain prevalent in plastic surgery, attention to ethical discourse should remain a top priority for leaders in the field.","Seyferth, Wood, Kane, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRS.0000000000009027","20220321","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28847,""
"Global pandemic vaccine development, production and distribution challenges for the world population","The new type of virus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) from Coronaviridae family, discovered in 2019, caused a global pandemic with several massive lock-downs around the globe. Science and politicians became the center of world attention, receiving many questions without having clear answers. The hopes of many rested on vaccine development, which was done fast, facing novel challenges such as the massive production and distribution for several billions of people. In this paper, the global reaction to the pandemic is reviewed along with some critical comments. Different groups, including nations, took part in global lockdowns, while vaccine development was running in parallel without having enough capacity for some of the biggest medical demands in history. This review will bring together views from all interested groups in this pandemic crisis. The Western world waited too long (4 months), after the first case was confirmed in China, to introduce lock-down and safety measures. On the other side, vaccine development was done too fast to give clear long-term safety profiles of the medications developed. Due to the focus on development, it was overlooked that production and distribution of sterile products such as vaccines might have limitations globally. Usually when such limitations occur, power comes to the surface. Therefore, buyers who had power will get the vaccines they need first. However, we should recognize the economic impact that directly influenced healthcare funding. All of this will lead to post-crisis challenges, including depression, violence, suicide, migration, and many other social problems. The COVID-19 pandemic is a test for all of us, which many governments, industries and non-state actors are failing. It is a perfect ""general probe"" to detect some of the weaknesses of the current structure of global health. If politics and science do not work together to make a global production plan for vaccines and learn from this pandemic, then all of the lives lost were for nothing.","Injac","https://doi.org/10.3233/JRS-227019","20220321","COVID-19; development; global pandemic; production; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28848,""
"[Recommendation for a programme transforming and improving mental health services - starting the debate]","Today mental health services face various challenges for which they are barely or not at all prepared under current structural, functional and financial circumstances, while the mental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are yet to be fully recognized. In Hungary, health and social services provide mental health services collectively, although simul taneously: in many cases, vertical and horizontal cooperation tends to be incidental or completely lacking among treatment types and stages, causing perplexing patient journeys, significant regional disparities, and deficiencies in the necessary multidisciplinary approach. In our thesis, first we start from the definition of health by WHO, which brings well-being to the forefront, then we attempt to present a comprehensive assessment of the current situation of the Hungarian social and health care system regarding mental health, introducing international and domestic statistics along with foreign national public policy programmes. Finally, with particular attention to the recommendations of various professional programmes, we present a proposal for the reform and development of integrated social and health care systems. Along with delivering a keynote address, we hope to attract the critical attention of a wide range of mental health professionals with our proposed programme.","KapÃƒÂ³cs, BacsÃƒÂ¡k","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Recommendation+for+a+programme+transforming+and+improving+mental+health+services+-+starting+the+debate].","20220322","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28849,""
"Effects of a Nurse-Led Telehealth Self-care Promotion Program on the Quality of Life of Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","In recent years, telehealth has become a common channel for health care professionals to use to promote health and provide distance care. COVID-19 has further fostered the widespread use of this new technology, which can improve access to care while protecting the community from exposure to infection by direct personal contact, and reduce the time and cost of traveling for both health care users and providers. This is especially true for community-dwelling older adults who have multiple chronic diseases and require frequent hospital visits. Nurses are globally recognized as health care professionals who provide effective community-based care to older adults, facilitating their desire to age in place. However, to date, it is unclear whether the use of telehealth can facilitate their work of promoting self-care to community-dwelling older adults. This review aims to summarize findings from randomized controlled trials on the effect of nurse-led telehealth self-care promotion programs compared with the usual on-site or face-to-face services on the quality of life (QoL), self-efficacy, depression, and hospital admissions among community-dwelling older adults. A search of 6 major databases was undertaken of relevant studies published from May 2011 to April 2021. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and their 95% CIs were calculated from postintervention outcomes for continuous data, while the odds ratio was obtained for dichotomous data using the Mantel-Haenszel test. From 1173 possible publications, 13 trials involving a total of 4097 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the control groups, the intervention groups of community-dwelling older adults significantly improved in overall QoL (SMD 0.12; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.20; P=.006; I<sup>2</sup>=21%), self-efficacy (SMD 0.19; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30; P&lt;.001; I<sup>2</sup>=0%), and depression level (SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.36 to -0.08; P=.003; I<sup>2</sup>=89%). This meta-analysis suggests that employing telehealth in nurse-led self-care promotion programs may have a positive impact on older adults, although more studies are needed to strengthen the evidence base, particularly regarding organization and delivery.

"Treatment Interruptions and Telemedicine Utilization in Serious Mental Illness: Retrospective Longitudinal Claims Analysis","Avoiding interruptions and dropout in outpatient care can prevent mental illness symptom exacerbation and costly crisis services, such as emergency room visits and inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, to attempt to maintain care continuity, telemedicine services were increasingly utilized, despite the lack of data on efficacy in patients with serious mental illness. Patients with serious mental illness are challenging to enroll and sustain in randomized controlled trials over time due to fluctuations in disease exacerbation. However, capturing and examining utilization and efficacy data in community mental health center (CMHC) patients with serious mental illness during the pandemic is a unique opportunity to inform future clinical and policy decision-making. We aimed to identify and describe the characteristics of CMHC patients with serious mental illness who experienced treatment interruptions and who utilized telemedicine during the pandemic. We conducted a retrospective observational study of treatment interruptions and telemedicine use during the period from December 2019 to June 2020 (compared to the period from December 2018 to June 2019) in New Hampshire CMHC patients. The study population included all Medicaid beneficiaries with serious mental illness engaged in treatment 3 months prior to the declaration of a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used chi-square tests of independence and logistic regression to explore associations between treatment interruptions and variables (gender, age, rurality, and diagnosis). Telemedicine utilization was categorized as low (&lt;25%), medium (25%-75%), or high (&gt;75%) use. A total of 16,030 patients were identified. New Hampshire CMHCs demonstrated only a 4.9% increase in treatment interruptions compared with the year prior. Patients who were male (odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.38; P&lt;.001), under the age of 18 years (ages 0-12 years: OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.62-0.86, P&lt;.001; aged 13-17 years: OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.57-0.79, P&lt;.001), or among milder diagnostic categories, such as anxiety disorders (OR 3.77, 95% CI 3.04-4.68; P&lt;.001) and posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 3.69, 95% CI 2.96-4.61; P&lt;.001), were most likely to experience treatment interruptions. Patients who were female (OR 0.89, CI 0.65-0.74), 18 to 34 years old (OR 0.74, CI 0.70-0.79), or among milder diagnostic categories, such as anxiety disorder (OR 0.69, CI 0.65-0.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0.77, CI 0.72-0.83), and with major depressive disorder (OR 0.73, CI 0.68-0.78) were less likely to be in the low telemedicine utilization group. The integration of telemedicine supported care continuity for most CMHC patients; yet, retention varied by subpopulation, as did telemedicine utilization. The development of policies and clinical practice guidelines requires empirical evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of telemedicine in patients with serious mental illness.","Ainslie, Brunette, Capozzoli","https://doi.org/10.2196/33092","20220322","mental health; mental illness; retention; serious mental illness; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28851,""
"The influence of distractions of the home-work environment on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Previous research showed that office workers are mainly distracted by noise, influencing their mental health. Little investigation has been done into the influence of other workspace characteristics (i.e., temperature, amount of space, visual privacy, adjustability of furniture, wall colours, and workspace cleanliness) on distractions at the office, and even fewer while working from home (WFH). The influence of home-workspace distractions on mental health also received limited attention. This research aims to investigate relationships between home-workspace and personal characteristics, distraction, and mental health while WFH during COVID-19. A path analysis approach was used, to find that, at home, employees were distracted by noise and when having a small desk. Those with a dedicated workroom were less distracted. Distractions mediated most relationships between home-workspace characteristics and mental health, while personal characteristics influenced mental health directly. Employers can use these results to redesign policies regarding home-and-office working to stimulate a healthy work-environment. Practitioner summaryThe investigation of the influence of home-workspace characteristics on distractions and mental health while WFH during COVID-19 appears to be limited. This research filled this gap by performing a path analysis, using a holistic definition of mental health. Findings showed that distractions mediate relationships between home-workspace characteristics and mental health.","Bergefurt, Appel-Meulenbroek, Maris, Arentze, Weijs-PerrÃƒÂ©e, de Kort","https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2022.2053590","20220321","COVID-19 pandemic; Working from home; mental health; noise; workspace distractions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28852,""
"Tai chi or health education for older adults with hypertension: effects on mental health and psychological resilience to COVID-19","To compare the effectiveness of 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of community-based, in-person, group Tai Chi (TC) and Health Education (HAP-E) in improving health and wellbeing in older adults with hypertension and in promoting psychological resilience during COVID-19. A 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) in San Diego County, USA. Self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, gratitude, resilience, mental and physical health were assessed in-person pre- and post-intervention, and by long-term follow-up surveys during COVID-19. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess study arm differences over time and logistic regression to identify predictors of positive intervention response. Of 182 randomized participants (72.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.9 yrs; 72% female), 131 completed the intervention. Modest improvements in health and wellbeing occurred post-intervention in both arms (Cohen's <i>d</i>: TC = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.25-0.51; HAP-<i>E</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24, 0.11-0.37), though positive intervention responses were more than twice as likely in TC (OR = 2.29, 1.07-4.57). Younger age, higher anxiety, and poorer mental health at baseline predicted greater odds of response. Small declines in health and wellbeing were reported at the first COVID-19 follow-up, with smaller declines in the TC arm (Cohen's <i>d:</i> TC = -0.15, -0.31-0.00; HAP-E = -0.34, -0.49 to -0.19). Health and wellbeing stabilized at the second COVID-19 follow-up. Most participants (&gt;70%) reported that the interventions benefitted their health and wellbeing during COVID-19. TC and HAP-E improved health and wellbeing, though TC conferred greater odds of an improved mental health response. Declines in health and wellbeing were observed at pandemic follow-up, with smaller declines in the TC arm, suggesting increased resilience.","Kohn, Lobo, Troyer, Wilson, Ang, Walker, Pruitt, Pung, Redwine, Hong","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2053836","20220321","COVID-19; Tai Chi; hypertension; psychological well-being; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28853,""
"Healthcare and social needs of international migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America: analysis of the Chilean case","International migrants are a particularly vulnerable group in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Immigrants in Chile tend to experience multidimensional poverty and layers of social vulnerability. Our analysis aims to describe the perceived social and health-related needs of international migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile in terms of migration as a social determinant of health and layered social vulnerability. We carried out a qualitative analysis of responses to an open-ended question focused on the social and health-related needs linked to the pandemic included in an online questionnaire disseminated during April 2020 aimed at international migrants residing in Chile. The information gathered was thematically analysed. We included 1690 participants. They expressed needs related to health and others linked to the overall socio-economic and political response, employment, material conditions and psychosocial aspects. They also reported needs related to 'being a migrant'. Additionally, some participants described situations of vulnerability. We analysed their needs and situations of vulnerability identified around the following emerging frames: (a) work and living conditions, (b) regularisation traps and perceived lack of support and (c) and physical and mental health needs. International migrants in Chile report experiencing interrelated layers of social vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, where 'being a migrant' exacerbates physical and mental health risks. The issues revealed are immediate and direct public health challenges, as well as different aspects of social vulnerability linked to migratory status, employment and barriers to accessing healthcare that should be addressed through comprehensive policies and measures.","Blukacz, Cabieses, Mezones-HolguÃƒÂ­n, Cardona Arias","https://doi.org/10.1177/17579759211067562","20220321","COVID-19; Latin America; international migrants; social determinants of health; social vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28854,""
"Buffering traumatic reactions to COVID-19: Mindfulness moderates the relationship between the severity of the pandemic and posttraumatic stress symptoms","As an international public health emergency panic, Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused substantial impacts on economic and daily life. The public were at high risk of mental health problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This study aimed to evaluate the association between objective/subjective severity of COVID-19 pandemic and PTSS, and explore the moderating role of mindfulness. Using longitudinal and 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) designs, we gathered data from 109 college students who were home-quarantined to examined study hypotheses. In the EMA phase, participants completed questionnaires measuring subjective severity, mindfulness and PTSS three times per day. Objective severity was indicated using the daily new confirmed cases. Then participants completed a follow-up measure of PTSS 2 months later, when the epidemic initially became stable. The results of structural equation modeling showed that state mindfulness moderated the relationship between subjectivity severity of COVID-19 and PTSS. Specifically, the association between subjective severity of COVID-19 and PTSS was positive at the low level of state mindfulness, and negative at the high level of state mindfulness. Trait mindfulness did not moderate the relationship between objectivity severity of COVID-19 and PTSS. Mindfulness-based interventions can be used as preventive mental health education to the daily lives of the general public, and to deal with unpredictable crisis events. Implications of this study are drawn for theory, practice, and research.

"Delivering alone in a pandemic: Anticipated changes to partner presence at birth are associated with prenatal distress","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted individuals across the world, and in particular, dramatically affected the experience of pregnancy and childbirth for many expectant mothers. The transition to parenthood is a time of increased risk for mental health problems, and maternal prenatal stress is associated with long-term maternal and infant health implications. The current study explored whether COVID-19 related changes to mothers' childbirth plans and prenatal health care experiences during the first wave of pandemic lockdowns in the U.S. were associated with self-reported depression, anxiety, and stress. In spring 2020; we surveyed 641 pregnant women on their pregnancy and birth plans, as well as their mental health, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women anticipating changes to the presence of their partner at birth also reported heightened symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, women who anticipated changes to the timing of delivery reported both higher anxiety and higher perceived stress. These findings extend initial work suggesting increased risk for mental health problems in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting specific pandemic-related disruptions to pregnancy and birth that may have contributed to prenatal distress. Monitoring and intervention for these mothers and their infants are warranted.

"Parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic: The sociodemographic and mental health factors associated with maternal caregiver strain","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new stressors for parents (""caregivers"") that may affect their own and their child's mental health (MH). We explored self-reported levels of caregiver strain (parents' perceived ability to meet parenting demands), and the MH and sociodemographic factors of caregivers to identify predictors of strain that can be used to guide MH service delivery for families. We administered a web-based survey to Ontario caregivers with a child between 4 and 25 years old, between April and June 2020. We analyzed information from 570 maternal caregivers on their sociodemographics, youngest (or only) child's MH, their own MH, and the degree of caregiver strain experienced since the pandemic. We used linear regressions (unadjusted and adjusted models) to explore the relationship between caregiver strain and sociodemographics, child MH and caregiver MH. Over 75% of participants reported ""moderate-to-high"" caregiver strain. More than 25% of caregivers rated their MH as ""poor"" and 20% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Forty-five percent of the variance in caregiver strain was accounted for by child age, caregiver anxiety, and multiple child and caregiver MH variables. Younger child age and higher caregiver anxiety were the greatest predictors of caregiver strain. We found a relationship between child age, child and caregiver MH variables, and caregiver strain. Given the interrelatedness of these factors, supporting caregivers' MH and lessening their role strain becomes critical for family well-being. Evidence-based individual, family, and public health strategies are needed to alleviate pandemic-related strain.

"Does Servant Leadership Control Psychological Distress in Crisis? Moderation and Mediation Mechanism","This study aims to investigate the impact of servant leadership on the psychological distress of healthcare staff during the Covid-19 crisis. The authors propose that work engagement mediates and mindfulness moderates the direct relationship between servant leadership and psychological distress. Time-lagged data were collected from 277 healthcare staff working at different hospitals in Pakistan. Process Macro version 3.1 on SPSS 23 was used for statistical analysis. For model fitness, we used AMOS V 22. The results show that servant leadership is negatively related to psychological distress. Furthermore, work engagement mediates the relationship between servant leadership and psychological distress. Moreover, mindfulness is anticipated to moderate the direct relationship between servant leadership and psychological distress, drawing on the social exchange and conservation of resources theory. This study finds that servant leadership is vital for the mental health of healthcare staff. Thus, it extends the utility of the concept of servant leadership to the psychology and crisis management literature.","Zada, Zada, Khan, Saeed, Zhang, Vega-MuÃƒÂ±oz, Salazar-SepÃƒÂºlveda","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S354093","20220322","Covid-19 crisis; healthcare staff; mindfulness; psychological distress; servant leadership; work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28858,""
"Intimate Partner Aggression During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Stress and Heavy Drinking","This study aimed to test empirically whether (1) the local impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in intimate partner aggression (IPA) and heavy drinking, and (2) heavy drinking moderated the association between COVID-19 stress and IPA perpetration. Participants were 510 individuals (approximately 50% who endorsed a sexual or gender minority identity) recruited via Qualtrics Research Services in April 2020, during the height of shelter-in-place (SiP) restrictions across the United States. They completed a questionnaire battery that included measures of COVID-19 stressors, physical and psychological IPA perpetration, and heavy drinking. Rates of physical and psychological IPA perpetration significantly increased after implementation of SiP restrictions which aimed to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 stress was significantly and positively associated with physical and psychological IPA perpetration; however, COVID-19 stress was positively associated with physical IPA perpetration among non-heavy drinking, but not heavy drinking, participants. Drawn from a large sample of participants of diverse sexual identities, findings tentatively implicate COVID-19 stress as a critical correlate of IPA perpetration and suggest that ""low risk"" individuals (i.e., non-heavy drinkers) should not be overlooked. These data provide preliminary support for the usefulness of public health polices and individual-level interventions that target stress, heavy drinking, and their antecedents.","Parrott, Halmos, Stappenbeck, Moino","https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000395","20220322","Alcohol use; Domestic violence; Mental health; Partner violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28859,""

"Adjustment Processes After the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Grounded Theory Study Based on Clinical Psychologists' Experience","Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress have been reported among the general population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the adjustment after the emergency phase remains under-investigated. This study aims to understand the adjustment processes of the population after the emergency phase of the pandemic. We conducted a grounded theory based on the experience of 24 clinical psychologists who provided extensive support to the population during the pandemic in different Italian regions. Three online focus groups were conducted. The transcripts of the focus groups were analyzed through a process of open, axial, and selective coding. Data collection terminated once thematic saturation was reached. Repositioning emerged as the evolutionary task people were confronted with in the face of a New Reality. Repositioning meant dealing with and integrating unpleasant Emotional Experiences deriving from the lockdown and reopening (i.e., unsafety, emotional exhaustion, loneliness, uncertainty, loss, and disconnection) through different Coping Strategies. Repositioning was facilitated or hindered by contextual and individual Intervening Conditions and led to two Adjustment Outcomes: growth or block. Results suggest that repositioning was the core task people had to face after the emergency phase of COVID-19. Proactive psychological interventions may support the population in repositioning in order to prevent maladjustment and encourage post-traumatic growth.","Lamiani, Borghi, Bonazza, Rebecchi, Lazzari, Vegni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.854745","20220322","COVID-19; adjustment (psychology); clinical psychology and health; population; qualitative research and analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28861,""
"Impact of COVID-19 and Consortium Factors on Mental Health: Role of Emotional Labor Strategies in Achieving Sustainable Development Goals","The COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019 has created an acute fear of economic crisis, and people have experienced the state of perceived job insecurity. Several measures were taken to control this deadly pandemic, but it still affected the majority of global operational activities. This study addresses the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 8 that relates to decent work and economic growth. This quantitative study examines the impact of fear associated with economic crisis and perceived job insecurity on mental health with the moderating effect of surface and deep acting. Surface acting is displaying fake emotions, and deep acting is modifying inner feelings according to the required emotions. This study used sample data from private-sector employees and applied SmartPLS for structural model assessment. As many organizations took more challenging decisions to sustain their business operations, the study therefore analyzes the impact of the pandemic on private sector employees. The two main findings of the study are: (i) surface acting moderates the relationships of fear of economic crisis and perceived job insecurity with mental health and declines the impact of both on mental health, (ii) while deep acting negatively moderates the relationships of fear of economic crisis and perceived job insecurity with mental health and improved mental health even in the presence of both. The study highlighted the importance of deep acting at workplaces to sustain employees' mental and psychological stability. Organizations could introduce emotional labor strategies and strengthen the mental health of their employees against the underlying fear of economic crisis and perceived job insecurity.","Rehman, Hamza, Nasir, Ullah, Arshad","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.795677","20220322","COVID-19; SDG 8; deep acting; fear of economic crisis; mental health; perceived job insecurity; surface acting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28862,""

"Second Time Overlooked in Crisis: Examining How HIV/AID Health Policies in the USA Connect with Policy Implications Today for Aging LGBTQ Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","U.S. policy has, once again,Ã‚Â overlooked the health care needs of older adults who areÃ‚Â lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ). This population is estimated to more than double in the USA (Fredriksen-Goldsen, in Generations 38(4), 86-92,Ã‚Â 2015), with estimates of approximately 3 million LGBTQ adults over 50 currently and 7 million by 2030 (Services and Advocacy for GBLT Elders in SAGE, New York,Ã‚Â 2018). The healthcare model for addressing the needs of LGBTQ persons has historically been that of a disease model of care, particularly during the HIV/AIDS crisis, and has recently moved to that of a health equity model in the past 20Ã‚Â years. The LGBTQ community, social work profession, and general medical community worked to create the health care equity model we have today and this paper will discuss how this evolved. The health care equity model addresses the health needs for older adult LGBTQ populations. Older LGBTQ adults are more likely to experience elevated rates of chronic conditions (such as HIV, cancer, diabetes), higher prevalence of anxiety/depression, greater substance abuse, higher economic insecurities, limited community resources, and limited access to health care services compared to heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. This paper discusses howÃ‚Â health disparities among this minority population and heterosexual/cisgender individualsÃ‚Â have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, this paper will address policy, research, and practice implications to understand how to assist this vulnerable subpopulation of LGBTQ persons.","Bietsch","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41134-021-00208-7","20220322","COVID-19; HIV/AIDS; Health disparities; Older adult LGBTQ populations; Policy implications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28865,""
"Associations of home confinement during COVID-19 lockdown with subsequent health and well-being among UK adults","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom (UK) government introduced public health safety measures to mitigate the spikes in infection rates. This included stay-at-home orders that prevented people from leaving their homes for work or study, except for urgent medical care or buying essential items. This practice could have both short and long-term implications for health and wellbeing of people in the UK. Using longitudinal data of 10,630 UK adults, this study prospectively examined the association between home confinement status during the stringent lockdown in the UK (March 23-May 13, 2020) and 20 indicators of subjective well-being, social well-being, pro-social/altruistic behaviors, psychological distress, and health behaviors assessed approximately one month after the stringent lockdown ended. All analyses adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and social isolation status in the beginning of the pandemic. Home confinement during the lockdown was associated with greater subsequent compliance with COVID-19 rules, more perceived major stressors, and a lower prevalence of physical activity. There was modest evidence of associations with lower life satisfaction, greater loneliness, greater depressive symptoms, greater anxiety symptoms, and more perceived minor stressors post-lockdown. However, there was little evidence that home confinement was associated with other indices of subsequent health and well-being. While our study shows that home confinement impacts some indices of subsequent health and wellbeing outcomes even after lockdown, the degree of the psychological adaptation to the difficult confinement behavior remains unclear and should be further studied.

"Prediction of Online Psychological Help-Seeking Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interpretable Machine Learning Method","Online mental health service (OMHS) has been named as the best psychological assistance measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. An interpretable, accurate, and early prediction for the demand of OMHS is crucial to local governments and organizations which need to allocate and make the decision in mental health resources. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the online psychological help-seeking (OPHS) behavior in the OMHS, then propose a machine learning model to predict and interpret the OPHS number in advance. The data was crawled from two Chinese OMHS platforms. Linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC), neural embedding-based topic modeling, and time series analysis were utilized to build time series feature sets with lagging one, three, seven, and 14 days. Correlation analysis was used to examine the impact of COVID-19 on OPHS behaviors across different OMHS platforms. Machine learning algorithms and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) were used to build the prediction. The result showed that the massive growth of OPHS behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic was a common phenomenon. The predictive model based on random forest (RF) and feature sets containing temporal features of the OPHS number, mental health topics, LIWC, and COVID-19 cases achieved the best performance. Temporal features of the OPHS number showed the biggest positive and negative predictive power. The topic features had incremental effects on performance of the prediction across different lag days and were more suitable for OPHS prediction compared to the LIWC features. The interpretable model showed that the increase in the OPHS behaviors was impacted by the cumulative confirmed cases and cumulative deaths, while it was not sensitive in the new confirmed cases or new deaths. The present study was the first to predict the demand for OMHS using machine learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study suggests an interpretable machine learning method that can facilitate quick, early, and interpretable prediction of the OPHS behavior and to support the operational decision-making; it also demonstrated the power of utilizing the OMHS platforms as an always-on data source to obtain a high-resolution timeline and real-time prediction of the psychological response of the online public.","Liu, Zhang, Wang, Huang, Li, Ren, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.814366","20220322","COVID-19; interpretable machine learning; online mental health service; online psychological help-seeking; prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28867,""
"Gender-Specific Related Factors for Suicidal Ideation During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Among 5,175 Chinese Adolescents","Suicide was an urgent issue during the pandemic period in adolescents. However, few studies were focused on suicide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown. An online survey was conducted among 5,175 Chinese adolescents from June 9th to 29th in 2020 to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. A gender-specific stepwise logistic regression model was used. All analyses were performed with STATA 15.0. About 3% of the participants had reported having SI during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. The prevalence of female SI (3.64%, 95% CI: 2.97-4.45%) was higher than that of males (2.39%, 95% CI: 1.88-3.05%) (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 6.87, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Quarreling with parents [odds ratio (OR) = 9.73, 95% CI: 5.38-17.59], insomnia (OR = 5.28, 95% CI: 2.81-9.93), previous suicide attempt history (OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.69-8.03), previous SI history (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.30-6.06), and feeling depressed during pandemic lockdown (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.22-4.18) were positively associated with the males' SI. However, having emptiness inside (OR = 4.39, 95% CI: 2.19-8.79), quarreling with parents (OR = 3.72, 95% CI: 2.16-6.41), insomnia (OR = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.85-5.80), feeling anxious (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.46-4.70), and longing for father's emotional warmth (OR = 0.38, 0.20-0.72) were associated mostly with females' SI. Female adolescents, who felt emptiness from their families and their fathers' emotional warmth, were at much higher risk of having SI during COVID-19 lockdown.

"Factors Associated With Experiences of Fear, Anxiety, Depression, and Changes in Sleep Pattern During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Adults in Nigeria: A Cross-Sectional Study","Multiple facets of the pandemic can be a source of fear, depression, anxiety and can cause changes in sleep patterns. The aim of this study was to identify health profiles and the COVID-19 pandemic related factors associated with fear, depression, anxiety and changes in sleep pattern in adults in Nigeria. The data for this analysis was extracted from a cross-sectional online survey that collected information about mental health and well-ness from a convenience sample of adults 18 years and above resident in Nigeria from July to December 2020. Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous, closed-ended online questionnaire that solicited information on sociodemographic profile, health profiles (high, moderate and low COVID-19 infection risk profile) including HIV status, COVID-19 status, and self-reported experiences of fear, anxiety, depression and changes in sleep patterns. In total, 4,439 participants with mean age of 38.3 (Ã‚Â±11.6) years responded to the survey. Factors associated with higher odds of having COVID-19 related fear were health risk (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); living with HIV (AOR: 3.88; 95% CI: 3.22-4.69); having COVID-19 symptoms but not tested (AOR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.30-1.99); having a friend who tested positive to COVID-19 (AOR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.07-1.53) and knowing someone who died from COVID-19 (AOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65). The odds of feeling anxious was significantly higher for those with moderate or low health risk profile (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); living with HIV (AOR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.32-2.04); had a friend who tested positive for COVID-19 (AOR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.08-1.68) or knew someone who died from COVID-19 (AOR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.28-1.84). The odds of feeling depressed was significantly higher for those with health risk profile (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); living with HIV (AOR: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.89-3.28); and respondents who had COVID-19 symptoms but had not taken a test (AOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.02-1.94). Factors associated with higher odds of having sleep pattern changes were having moderate and low health risk profiles (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

"Neuropsychological Symptom Identification and Classification in the Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients During the First Wave of the Pandemic in a Front-Line Spanish Tertiary Hospital","Studies specifically designed to determine the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients are limited and based on case series, self-report questionnaires, and surveys. The objective of the study was to identify and classify the neuropsychological symptoms of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic in one of the most important front-line tertiary hospitals from Spain, and to analyze its correlation with diagnosed mental disorders, as well as to explore potential risk factors associated with mental health problems. This observational, cohort study involved data from COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) from February to May 2020. First, patients underwent a semistructured phone interview (screening phase), based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Then the confirmation of the diagnosis (confirmation phase) was performed in patients who reported a mental disorder development or worsening. A factorial analysis was performed to identify groups of symptoms. A tetrachoric matrix was created, and factorial analysis, by a principal component analysis, was employed upon it. Factors showing values &gt;1.0 were selected, and a varimax rotation was applied to these factors. Symptoms most frequently identified in patients were anosmia/ageusia (54.6%), cognitive complaints (50.3%), worry/nervousness (43.8%), slowing down (36.2%), and sadness (35.4%). Four factors were identified after the screening phase. The first (""anxiety/depression"") and second (""executive dysfunction"") factors explained 45.4 and 11.5% of the variance, respectively. Women, age between 50 and 60 years, duration in the hospital (more than 13 days), and psychiatric history showed significant higher levels (number of symptoms) in the factors. This study reports the factor structure of the psychiatric symptoms developed by patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 during the first wave of the COVID-19. Three item domains (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms) were loaded together on one factor, whereas sleep disturbance stood up as a separate factor. Interestingly, the item anosmia/ageusia was not captured by any factor. In conclusion, an increase in neuropsychiatric morbidity is expected in the upcoming months and years. Therefore, screening for early symptoms is the first step to prevent mental health problems associated with this pandemic.","Molina, Rodrigo Holgado, Juanes GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Combarro Ripoll, Lora Pablos, Rubio, Alonso, Rivas-Clemente","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.838239","20220322","COVID-19; mental health; psychiatric history; screening; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28871,""
"A multi-country comparative analysis of the impact of COVID-19 and natural hazards in India, Japan, the Philippines, and USA","Several countries have been affected by natural hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic. The combination of the pandemic and natural hazards has led to serious challenges that include financial losses and psychosocial stress. Additionally, this compound disaster affected evacuation decision making, where to evacuate, volunteer participation in mitigation and recovery, volunteer support acceptance, and interest in other hazard risks. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on disaster response and recovery from various types of hazards, with regard to preparedness, evacuation, volunteering, early recovery, awareness and knowledge of different types of hazards, and preparedness capacity development. This study targets hazards such as Cyclone Amphan in India, the Kumamoto flood in Japan, Typhoon Rolly in the Philippines, and the California wildfires in the U.S. This study made several recommendations, such as the fact that mental health support must be taken into consideration during COVID-19 recovery. It is necessary to improve the genral condition of evacuation centers in order to encourage people to act immediately. A pandemic situation necessitates a strong communication strategy and campaign with particular regard to the safety of evacuation centers, the necessity of a lockdown, and the duration required for it to reduce the psychological impact. Both national and local governments are expected to strengthen their disaster risk reduction (DRR) capacity, which calls for the multi-hazard management of disaster risk at all levels and across all sectors.","Izumi, Shaw","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102899","20220322","All-hazards approach; COVID-19; Compund hazard; Evacuation; Natural hazard; Volunteerism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28872,""

"Maximising the health impacts of free advice services in the UK: A mixed methods systematic review","After a decade of austerity spending cuts and welfare reform, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed further challenges to the finances, health and wellbeing of working-age, low-income people. While advice services have been widely seen (and funded) as an income maximisation intervention, their health and well-being impact is less clear. Previous systematic reviews investigating the link between advice services and health outcomes have found a weak evidence base and cover the period up until 2010. This mixed methods review examined up to date evidence to help understand the health impacts of free and independent welfare rights advice services. We included evaluations of free to access advice services on social welfare issues for members of the public that included health outcomes. Through comprehensive searches of two bibliographic databases and websites of relevant organisations we identified 15 articles based on a mixture of study designs. The advice interventions evaluated were based in a range of settings and only limited information was available on the delivery and nature of advice offered. We undertook a convergent synthesis to analyse data on the effectiveness of advice services on health outcomes and to explain variation in these outcomes. Our synthesis suggested that improvements in mental health and well-being measures are commonly attributed to advice service interventions. However, there is little insight to explain these impacts or to inform the delivery of services that maximise health benefits. Co-locating services in health settings appears promising and embracing models of delivery that promote collaboration between organisations tackling the social determinants of health may help to address the inherent complexities in the delivery of advice services and client needs. We make recommendations to improve routine monitoring and reporting by advice services, and methods of evaluation that will better account for complexity and context.","Young, Bates","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13777","20220321","advice services; health; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28875,""
"Trajectories of mental health among UK university staff and postgraduate students during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the social and working lives of many. Past studies have highlighted worsening mental health during the pandemic, but often rely on small samples or infrequent follow-up. This study draws on fortnightly assessments from a large occupational cohort to describe differing trajectories of mental health between April 2020 and April 2021 and individual characteristics associated with these trajectory types. King's College London Coronavirus Health and Experiences of Colleagues at King's is an occupational cohort study at a large university in London, UK. Participants (n=2241) completed online questionnaires fortnightly between April 2020 and April 2021. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). On average, participants reported low levels of anxiety and depression (GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores of 0-9, consistent with 'none', 'minimal' or 'mild' symptoms) throughout the year, with symptoms highest in April 2020 and decreasing over the summer months when no lockdown measures were in place. However, we observed more severe and variable symptoms among subgroups of participants. Four trajectory types for anxiety and depression were identified: 'persistent high severity' (6%-7% of participants), 'varying symptoms, opposing national cases' (4%-8%), 'varying symptoms, consistent with national cases' (6%-11%) and 'persistent low severity' (74%-84%). Younger age, female gender, caring responsibilities and shielding were associated with higher severity trajectory types. These data highlight differing individual responses to the pandemic and underscore the need to consider individual circumstances when assessing and treating mental health. Aggregate trends in anxiety and depression may hide greater variation and symptom severity among subgroups.","Carr, Oetzmann, Davis, Bergin-Cartwright, Dorrington, Lavelle, Leightley, Polling, Stevelink, Wickersham, Vitiello, Razavi, Hotopf","https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2021-108097","20220321","COVID-19; mental health; occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28876,""
"Fear of COVID-19 and its association with mental health-related factors: systematic review and meta-analysis","The severity of COVID-19 remains high worldwide. Therefore, millions of individuals are likely to suffer from fear of COVID-19 and related mental health factors. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize empirical evidence to understand fear of COVID-19 and its associations with mental health-related problems during this pandemic period. Relevant studies were searched for on five databases (Scopus, ProQuest, EMBASE, PubMed Central, and ISI Web of Knowledge), using relevant terms (COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, mental health-related factors, mental well-being and sleep problems). All studies were included for analyses irrespective of their methodological quality, and the impact of quality on pooled effect size was examined by subgroup analysis. The meta-analysis pooled data from 91 studies comprising 88 320 participants (mean age 38.88 years; 60.66% females) from 36 countries. The pooled estimated mean of fear of COVID-19 was 13.11 (out of 35), using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The associations between fear of COVID-19 and mental health-related factors were mostly moderate (Fisher's z = 0.56 for mental health-related factors; 0.54 for anxiety; 0.42 for stress; 0.40 for depression; 0.29 for sleep problems and -0.24 for mental well-being). Methodological quality did not affect these associations. Fear of COVID-19 has associations with various mental health-related factors. Therefore, programmes for reducing fear of COVID-19 and improving mental health are needed.","Alimoradi, Ohayon, Griffiths, Lin, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.26","20220321","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depressive disorders; fear; sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28877,""
"Factors shaping the mental health and well-being of people experiencing persistent COVID-19 symptoms or 'long COVID': qualitative study","Around one in ten people who contract COVID-19 report persistent symptoms or 'long COVID'. Impaired mental health and well-being is commonly reported, including anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life. However, there is limited in-depth research exploring why mental health and well-being are affected in people experiencing long COVID. To explore factors affecting mental health and well-being from the perspective of people with long COVID. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Twenty-one people with long COVID participated in the study. Participants were eligible if they self-reported a positive swab test/antibody test or one or more commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms at illness onset. and experiences of one or more long COVID symptoms Ã¢â€°Â¥3 weeks following illness onset. Five themes were identified across participant accounts regarding factors affecting mental health and well-being, including symptoms causing severe disruption to daily life, lack of service and treatment options, uncertainty of illness trajectories, experiences of care and understanding from others and changes to identity. People with long COVID experience a range of factors that negatively affect their mental health and well-being.

"Characterisation of a conspiracy believers and their mental health during the COVID-19 emergency state in Latvia","A wave of believers in conspiracies has emerged amid the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to characterise an individual who believes in conspiracies and to discover whether believing in them is associated with mental health. Data was collected as an online survey in a randomised, stratified cohort in July 2020 as a part of the National Research Program of Latvia. The precisely selected and segmented database corresponding to the general population of Latvia was used. Non-parametric tests to compare medians and Spearman correlation to measure the strength of the relationship were applied. The weighted study sample consisted of 2608 participants. A positive correlation was detected between age and belief in conspiracies among females (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.061; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017). Median conspiracy theory points were significant as follows: individuals who have primary or high school education (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) rather than higher education; females (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) who resided in a town (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) as opposed to occupying the capital; divorcees (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022) in contrast with those being in a relationship; along with those being unemployed (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared to the employed, or students.

"A Mixed-Methods and Prospective Approach to Understanding Coping Behaviors, Depression, Hopelessness, and Acute Stress in a US Convenience Sample During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in U.S. residents' stressors while limiting many of the resources previously available to cope with stress. Coping behaviors may contribute to the prevention or proliferation of psychological distress during and after the pandemic. Understanding these coping behaviors and associated psychological outcomes can help health educators develop programs that encourage effective coping and promote mental health. This study used a sequential mixed-methods approach informed by Roth and Cohen's conceptualization of coping to understand the use of approach coping behaviors- which are active and directed toward the perceived threat-and avoidance coping behaviors-which include activity directed away from perceived threat during the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. residents (<i>N</i> = 2,987) were surveyed online in April 2020 and again in September 2021. Open-ended responses at baseline were thematically analyzed to illustrate coping behaviors in participants' own words. At baseline, more than half (56%) of the sample met criteria for probable depression, 51% for acute stress symptoms, and 42% for moderate to severe hopelessness. At follow-up, 45% meet criteria for probable depression and 23% for acute stress. However, the proportion of the sample who reported moderate to severe hopelessness increased to 48%. We used mixed-effects general linear models to examine changes over time and found that increases in approach coping behaviors were associated with decreases in depressive symptoms and hopelessness; increases in avoidance coping were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and higher levels of hopelessness. Increases in both types of coping were associated with increases in acute stress symptoms related to COVID-19. Although there was some attenuation in distress in our sample between April 2020 and September 2021, our findings suggest a need for interventions that encourage the use of approach coping behaviors and that both increase access to and decrease stigma for mental health support.","Wootton, Rice, McKowen, Veldhuis","https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981221084272","20220321","coping; coronavirus; health behaviors; mental health; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28881,""
"Predicting New-Onset Psychiatric Disorders Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Machine Learning Approach","The investigators estimated new-onset psychiatric disorders (PsyDs) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Italian adults without preexisting PsyDs and developed a machine learning (ML) model predictive of at least one new-onset PsyD in subsequent independent samples. Data were from the first (May 18-June 20, 2020) and second (September 15-October 20, 2020) waves of an ongoing longitudinal study, based on a self-reported online survey. Provisional diagnoses of PsyDs (PPsyDs) were assessed via DSM-based screening tools to maximize assessment specificity. Gradient-boosted decision trees as an ML modeling technique and the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique were applied to identify each variable's contribution to the model. From the original sample of 3,532 participants, the final sample included 500 participants in the first wave and 236 in the second. Some 16.0% of first-wave participants and 18.6% of second-wave participants met criteria for at least one new-onset PPsyD. The final best ML predictive model, trained on the first wave, displayed a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 73% when tested on the second wave. The following variables made the largest contributions: low resilience, being an undergraduate student, and being stressed by pandemic-related conditions. Living alone and having ceased physical activity contributed to a lesser extent. Substantial rates of new-onset PPsyDs emerged among Italians throughout the pandemic, and the ML model exhibited moderate predictive performance. Results highlight modifiable vulnerability factors that are suitable for targeting by public campaigns or interventions to mitigate the pandemic's detrimental effects on mental health.","Caldirola, Cuniberti, DaccÃƒÂ², Grassi, Torti, Perna","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21060148","20220321","Anxiety Disorders (Neuropsychiatric Aspects); Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28882,""
"Factors associated with burnout among medical laboratory professionals in Ontario, Canada: An exploratory study during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this study was to examine factors associated with burnout among medical laboratory technologists (MLT) in Ontario, Canada during the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We employed a cross-sectional design and used a self-reported questionnaire designed for MLT in Ontario, Canada. There were 441 (47.5% response rate) MLT who were included in the analytic sample. Most of the respondents were women, with a mean age of 43.1 and a standard deviation of 11.7. The prevalence of experiencing burnout was 72.3% for MLT. In the adjusted demographic model, those Ã¢â€°Â¥50 (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.36, 95% CI: 0.22-0.59) were 0.36 or about one third as likely to experience burnout as those under 50.

Results of ISM revealed that the outcomes, namely, ""emotional instability,"" ""mental health self-harm,"" loneliness reduced recreational activities, obesity, and ""increased screen time"" come at the top of the model; therefore, they are less vital outcomes, whereas the most significant outcome which is at the bottom of the model is ""employment instability""; hence it has a major impact on the society. The remaining outcomes fall in the middle of the model, so they have a moderate-severe impact. Results of MICMAC validate the findings of ISM. Overall findings of the study reveal that ""employment instability"" is the crucial social outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Changes in physicochemical, heavy metals and air quality linked to spot Aplocheilus panchax along Mahanadi industrial belt of India under COVID-19-induced lockdowns","Positive effects of COVID-19-induced lockdowns on environment are well documented although pre-planned experiments for such analyses and appearance of fish species are lacking. We hypothesize that spotting the fish Aplocheilus panchax along the industrial belt of Mahanadi River near Cuttack in a never seen manner could be due to the regenerated environment. Heavy metals, water and air qualities along with spotting A. panchax in up, mid and downstream of Mahanadi River near Jagatpur industrial basins were analysed during pre-(end of March 2020) and after 60Ã‚Â days of lockdowns (last week of May 2020). An overall 45, 61, 79, 100, 97 and 90% reduction of Fe, Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb and Zn was recorded in the studied area after lockdowns, respectively. Similarly, dissolved oxygen and pH were elevated by 26 and 7%, respectively. Water temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solute levels were reduced by 7, 46 and 15%, respectively, which were again elevated during post-lockdowns during 2021 as observed from the Landsat-8 OLI satellite data.

Finally, for the first time, about 12 A. panchax fish per 100Ã‚Â m shore line in the area were spotted. The observed lockdown-induced environmental healing at the studied area could contribute to the appearance of A. panchax in the study site and therefore a stringent environmental audit is suggested during post-COVID-19 periods to make the regenerated environmental status long lasting in such habitats.","Paital, Pati, Panda, Jally, Agrawal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10653-022-01247-3","20220320","Aplocheilus panchax; COVID-19-induced lockdown; Environmental regeneration; Fish reappearance; Heavy metal pollution; Stringent global environmental audit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28885,""
"Does the COVID-19 personal protective equipment impair the surgeon's performance?","Despite increasing vaccination rates, new viral variants of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) are advancing the COVID 19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and continue to challenge the entire world. Surgical care of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients requires special protective measures. We hypothesized that ""COVID-19"" personal protective equipment (PPE) during surgery of SARS-CoV-2 positive or potentially positive patients would negatively affect the surgeon and thus the surgical outcome. Ten experienced trauma surgeons participated in the study. Each surgeon performed two simulated surgeries of a distal tibial fracture on a SawboneÃ‚Â® under standardized conditions either wearing regular PPE or special COVID-19 PPE. Baseline values at rest were acquired for heart rate, blood pressure, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory rate and capillary blood gas (CBG) analysis including capillary partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>), followed by four different standardized tests of attentional performance (TAP). Subsequently, the surgeon performed the first surgery according to a randomly determined order, with regular or COVID-19 PPE conditions in an operation theatre. After each surgery vital signs were acquired and CBG and TAP were performed again. In our simulated surgical procedure heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not show relevant differences. Percutaneously measured SpO<sub>2</sub> decreased with additional layers of PPE, while CBG parameters were not affected. TAP tests showed a significant impairment of attention if PPEs were compared to the baseline, but both PPEs had similar results and no meaningful differences could be measured. According to our results, for surgical procedures additional PPE required during COVID-19 pandemic does not relevant affect the surgeon's mental and physical performance. Surgeries under COVID-19 PPE conditions appear safe and do not increase patient risk.

"Determinants of weight, psychological status, food contemplation and lifestyle changes in patients with obesity during the COVID-19 lockdown: a nationwide survey using multiple correspondence analysis","The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced most of the Italian population into lockdown from 11 March to 18 May 2020. A nationwide survey of Italian Clinical Nutrition and Dietetic Services (Obesity Centers or OCs) was carried out to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions on the physical and mental wellbeing of patients with obesity (PWO) who had follow-up appointments postponed due to lockdown restrictions and to compare determinants of weight gain before and after the pandemic. We designed a structured 77-item questionnaire covering employment status, diet, physical activity and psychological aspects, that was disseminated through follow-up calls and online between 2 May and 25 June 2020. Data were analyzed by multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and multiple linear regression. A total of 1,232 PWO from 26 OCs completed the questionnaires (72% female, mean age 50.2 Ã‚Â± 14.2 years; mean BMI 34.7 Ã‚Â± 7.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 41% obesity class II to III). During the lockdown, 48.8% gained, 27.1% lost, while the remainder (24.1%) maintained their weight. The mean weight change was +2.3 Ã‚Â± 4.8 kg (in weight gainers: +4.0 Ã‚Â± 2.4 kg; +4.2% Ã‚Â± 5.4%). Approximately 37% of participants experienced increased emotional difficulties, mostly fear and dissatisfaction. Sixty-one percent reduced their physical activity (PA) and 55% experienced a change in sleep quality/quantity. The lack of online contact (37.5%) with the OC during lockdown strongly correlated with weight gain (p &lt; 0.001). Using MCA, two main clusters were identified: those with unchanged or even improved lifestyles during lockdown (Cluster 1) and those with worse lifestyles during the same time (Cluster 2). The latter includes unemployed people experiencing depression, boredom, dissatisfaction and increased food contemplation and weight gain. Within Cluster 2, homemakers reported gaining weight and experiencing anger due to home confinement. Among Italian PWO, work status, emotional dysregulation, and lack of online communication with OCs were determinants of weight gain during the lockdown period.","Caretto, Pintus, Petroni, Osella, Bonfiglio, Morabito, Zuliani, Sturda, Castronuovo, Lagattolla, Maghetti, Lapini, Bianco, Cisternino, Cerutti, Mulas, Hassan, Cardamone, Parillo, Sonni, Urso, Bianco, Scotto Di Carlo, Fantola, Vincis, Pironi, Barbanti, Musio, Ravaioli, Minciullo, Balzano, Cozzolino, CastanÃƒÂ², Cusano, Di Giacomo, Mollica, Coppola, Della Rosa, Vignola, Bolesina, Zaccheroni, Pullara, Caprino, Tubili, Baccari, Monacelli, Paolini, Martinelli, Carella, Di Gregorio, Cella, Facci, Lista, Giungato, Fazzolari, Altomare, Lo Prinzi, Grandone, Vigna, Di Berardino, Messeri","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-022-01100-8","20220320","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-23","",28887,""
"Effect of the Covid 19 pandemic on depression and mother-infant bonding in uninfected postpartum women in a rural region","Postpartum depression and maternal-infant attachment scores were examined in uninfected women during the COVID 19 pandemic in Kutahya, a rural province in Turkey's North Aegean region. This cohort study was conducted in the Kutahya Health Sciences University Hospital obstetrics unit between April 2021 and August 2021. 178 low-risk term pregnant women who gave birth were given the surveys Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBQ) 6Ã‚Â weeks after birth. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used to determine postpartum depression and the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale was used to determine maternal attachment. In this study, the postpartum depression rate was calculated as 17.4%. When depressed and non-depressed patients were compared, education level, maternal age, BMI, MIBQ score, history of previous pregnancies, route of delivery, previous operation history, economic status, employment status and pregnancy follow-up information were found to be similar (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The ratings on the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale were found to be similar in depressed and non-depressed patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).
