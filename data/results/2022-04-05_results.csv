"Peculiarities of the mental state of student youth of Ukraine during quarantine restrictions","The work was intended to generalize both world statistics and our own experimental study aimed at detecting changes in mental states during the introduction of quarantine restrictions caused by the prevalence of COVID-19. During quarantine restrictions we observed a high level of anxiety in almost 45% of young respondents, severe and extreme depression from 2% to 7% of respondents, and moderate from 40% to 50% of respondents. Impressive are also rates of explicit suicidal ideation - 10-13%. Thus, the situation with the mental state of the younger generation requires the intervention of specialists, the development of programs that allow them to provide timely assistance under quarantine restrictions and maintain a normal psychological state of young people. Identifying the peculiarities of mental states of young people provides an opportunity to develop programs of both prevention of suicidal ideation and support for people who are experiencing uncontrolled anxiety or are depressed. It should be noted that quarantine restrictions require special approaches to the provision and implementation of such programs, meaning their transference from real life to cyberspace. Given that programs quality should not suffer, assistance should be provided by expert professionals at a high level.","Asieieva, Y.; Sytnik, S.; Babchuk, O.; Heina, O.; Dementieva, K.","https://doi.org/10.34069/ai/2022.50.02.1","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Amazonia Investiga; 11(50):9-15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29533,""
"Attitudes of Primary Healthcare Professionals towards the Covid-19 Vaccine during the Coronavirus Episode and Their Perceptions of Covid-19 Disease","This research has been conducted to determine the relationship between the attitudes of primary health care workers towards Covid-19 vaccine and their perceptions of Covid-19 disease during the Coronavirus Epidemic in descriptive-relational type. The sample of the research is consisted of 63 health workers of family health centers in Kayseri central towns. In the study;Personal Information Form, Attitudes Towards Covid-19 Vaccine Scale and Covid-19 Disease Perception Scale have been used. Data have been collected through online surveys. It was determined that, of the participants of the study;58.7% were not afraid of the side effects of the vaccine, 96.8% were vaccinated, 95.2% of the participants' family members were vaccinated, and 95.2% recommended the Covid-19 vaccine to their patients. In the study, the total score median values have been determined as;for the positive attitudes towards the vaccine: 4.5, for the negative attitudes towards the vaccine: 4.0, for the Covid-19 Illness Perception dangerousness sub-dimension: 4.3, for the Covid-19 Illness Perception infectivity subdimension: 4.0. A positive, weak and significant relationship has been found between negative attitudes towards the vaccine and the sub-dimensions of dangerousness (rho=0.244, p=0.054) and contagiousness (rho=0.369, p=0.003), and in the sub-dimensions of positive attitudes towards the vaccine, dangerousness (rho=0.343, p=0.006) and contagiousness (rho=0.342, p=0.006) (p&lt;=0.05). It has been found that primary health care workers have positive attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccine, the perception of the danger of the disease and the perception of the contagiousness of the virus are high, but the relationship between them is weak and important. Considering that the perception of the disease has an effect on the groups, it is recommended to change this perception and the attitudes towards the vaccine with this perception.

"Acute Period Psychiatric Effects of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients: A Retrospective Investigation","Although it is known that COVID-19 has a serious impact on mental health, there are few studies on the acute period complications in hospitalized patients. In this study, it has been aimed to evaluate the reason for asking for consultation, prevalence of psychiatric disease and recommended psychiatric interventions, in COVID-19 infected patients who were consulted to consultation liaison psychiatry. This study has been conducted by retrospectively examining the psychiatric consultation reports of 138 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 in a university hospital in Turkey between March 2020 and October 2021. Patients' data were obtained from electronic medical records. According to the results of the analysis, the reasons for requesting a consultation were insomnia (26.22%), anxiety/fear of death (20.76%), agitation (17.48%), and hallucinations/fluctuation in consciousness (11.47%), respectively. The most common psychiatric diagnoses were delirium and sleep disorders (22.5%), these were followed respectively by adjustment disorder (11.6%), anxiety (10.9%) and depression (3.6%). Medical treatment was recommended for 85.5% of the patients, and haloperidol was the most frequently recommended agent. 44.1% of the patients treated in the intensive care unit were diagnosed with delirium and their age was higher. Advanced age caused an increase in delirium and death rates. These findings indicate that psychiatric morbidities and delirium are common among COVID-19 patients, and the need for consultation-liaison services may increase during the pandemic.

"Sleep behaviours among Canadian adults: Findings from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey healthy living rapid response module","Data and methods This cross-sectional study uses nationally representative data from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey healthy living rapid response module (N = 9,248), collected from January to March 2020. Keywords sleep, sleeplessness, surveillance, prevalence, population health What is already known on this subject? * Good sleep habits, which include adequate sleep duration, good sleep quality and sleep consistency, are associated with positive short-term and long-term health benefits. * The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines recommend that adults aged 18 to 64 obtain 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep on a regular basis, with consistent sleep and wake times for health benefits. What does this study add? * Three-quarters of Canadian adults aged 18 to 64 and half of Canadian adults aged 65 and older meet sleep duration recommendations. * Two-thirds of Canadian adults report high sleep quality. * Two-thirds of Canadian adults report high variability in sleep duration and wake-up time between work and free days. * Two-thirds of Canadian adults use electronic devices within 30 minutes of falling asleep. * High sleep quality and high sleep variability between work and free days are associated with meeting sleep duration recommendations. Sleep impacts physiological processes, cognitive performance and mood.1 Good sleep behaviours are associated with reduced risk of adverse health conditions, including mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental and cognitive disorders, accidents, and injuries.2 Sleep duration, quality, variability and timing are each components of sleep health that have been linked with health outcomes.3 The relationship between sleep duration and both physical and mental health has been widely researched and is regarded as a U-shaped association.2 Among adults, 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night have been most favourably associated with positive health outcomes,2 whereas shorter and longer sleep durations have been associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes.2,4 Sleep quality refers to efficiency in going to sleep and staying asleep, and also contributes to physical and mental health.5 Variability in sleep timing between work and free days, and late sleep timing within the 24-hour day have been associated with adverse outcomes.6 These behaviours can be affected by practices that facilitate sleep (often referred to as sleep hygiene),7 including minimal electronic use before bed, minimal screen time and sufficient physical activity, among others.8 October 2020 marked the release of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults aged 18 to 64 years, and 65 years and older, including the first official sleep recommendations for Canadian adults.","Wang, Chinchin, Colley, Rachel C.; Roberts, Karen C.; Chaput, Jean-Philippe, Thompson, Wendy","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202200300001-eng","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Reports; 33(3):3-14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29536,""
"Trees to towers shift: Power lines emerging as a novel habitat for birds in Gujranwala, Pakistan","Power infrastructure (electricity towers, mobile phone towers, transmission lines and wires) is a unique anthropogenic structure in terms of material composition, design and continuity serving as artificial habitat to avian wildlife for roosting and nesting. This study aimed at finding out the diversity, abundance and behaviour of birds using the power structures as artificial habitat in the Gujranwala city area, Pakistan. Field data was collected in Feb-Mar 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns in the city by recording all birds species and nests on power lines along a circular path (~32 km) by dividing into sampling zones. A total of 24 bird species of 16 families were found to be using these structures as roosting and nesting sites. The occupation rate of mobile phone towers is found to be 61%, transmission lines 32%, and electricity towers 1.8%. House crow was the most common species (~20% population) followed by the Black kite (~ 18% population). The spatial distribution pattern of nests on power structures indicated higher concentration in the southwestern area contrary to the highest abundance and diversity in the northwestern area close the urban forest planation. Total 112 nests of 4 species (Black kite, House crow, Common myna and Eurasian collard dove) were present on power lines. Black kite is the most frequent nesting species (&gt;80% of all nests), preferring high structures i.e. transmission lines (99% of all nests) and mobile phone towers (78% of all nests) for making nests. House crow and Common myna make nests on electricity towers at low height. It is found that the area where cutting of trees during the past time period occurred, birds have shifted their nesting habitat from trees to towers (i.e., power structures). Moreover, if habitat destruction continues these power lines will be the new nesting habitat of the birds in the urban area, hence, posing risks to both birds and utility structures. This study also highlighted the importance of strategic plantation in relation to spatial distribution and protection of urban birds.","Noreen, Zunaira, Sultan, Khawar","https://doi.org/10.19045/bspab.2022.110063","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pure and Applied Biology; 11(2):616-628, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29537,""
"Post-pandemic Trends in the Development of Social State Institutions","The article analyzes the new conditions and institutions of socio-economic dynamics developing under the influence of COVID-19 and overcoming its consequences. New directions of the macro-management system are actualized by the economic recession that arose Under the influence of COVID-19 and the previous depressive rates of economic growth. Social conditions tensions have predetermined the growth of the state's participation in socio-economic development, the formation of new institutional trends. Transformation of public administration institutions is due to the long-term influence of the characteristics of the information society and the conceptualization of modern sustainable growth in the areas of welfare, poverty reduction, and ecology. In the Russian Federation, a transition is underway to a new form of institutional regulation of socio-economic dynamics based on a system of medium-term strategic planning in the range from the development of key long-term development strategies to the operational management of specific projects. The modem national development goals and their indicators are presented, the existing risks of strategic planning are structured, which require consideration when developing subsequent system solutions. The current principles of the welfare state have been clarified, institutional innovations in the organization of social protection of the population arc shown in the context of strategic planning, the interaction of federal and regional authorities in the problem field of social assistance and social insurance of the population.","Vasiliev, V.

"Perceived advantages and disadvantages of telepsychiatry - An online survey of psychiatrists in India","Context: Telepsychiatry is being practiced in India for many years but was formalized only in 2020. It has many advantages and disadvantages. Aims: This study aimed to understand the perceived advantages and disadvantages of telepsychiatry practices in India. Settings and Design: An online survey with ethics approval by the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) Ethics Review Board. All psychiatrists who are members of the IPS and whose email address was available with the society were sent the survey link by email. Methodology: Information about existing telepsychiatry consultation practices in India and perception of advantages and disadvantages by the practitioners were collected between June and July 2020. Statistical Analysis: Frequency, percentages, mean, and standard deviation were calculated. Results: Responses by 340 responders were analyzed. Majority of the responders felt that telepsychiatry would provide easy accessibility to mental health services (n = 283, 83.24%) and would lead to less exposure to infections (n = 222, 65.29%). Half of the responders (n = 177, 52.06%) felt that there would be an increased doctor shopping resulting in poor care and nearly three-fourth (n = 245, 72.06%) felt that mental health professionals would fall into a problem while dealing with a suicidal or a homicidal patient. Some expressed that the inability to do physical and central nervous system examinations could lead to missing out comorbidities. About one-third (n = 117, 36.56%) felt that the patient recording the consultation would be a legal issue. Conclusions: This online survey showed that psychiatrists perceive many advantages and some disadvantages in practicing telepsychiatry.","Basavarajappa, C.; Grover, S.; Dalal, P.

"Bihemispheric ischemic strokes in patients with COVID-19","BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence that COVID-19 can trigger thrombosis because of a hypercoagulable state, including large-vessel occlusion ischemic strokes. Bihemispheric ischemic stroke is uncommon and is thought to indicate an embolic source. Here, we examine the findings and outcomes of patients with bihemispheric stroke in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study at a quaternary academic medical center between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We identified all patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who presented with simultaneous bihemispheric ischemic strokes. RESULTS: Of 637 COVID-19 admissions during the 2-month period, 13 had a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, including 5 who developed bihemispheric cerebral infarction. Three of those 5 (60%) were female, median age was 54 (range 41â€“67), and all five were being managed for severe COVID-19-related pneumonia complicated by acute kidney injury and liver failure before the diagnosis of cerebral infarction was established. Five presented with elevated ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and four had lymphopenia and elevated D-dimer levels. All patients underwent neuroimaging with computed tomography for persistent depressed mentation, with or without a focal neurologic deficit, demonstrating multifocal ischemic strokes with bihemispheric involvement. Outcome was poor in all patients: two were discharged to a rehabilitation facility with moderate-to-severe disability and three (60%) patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke is implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although causality cannot be established, we present the imaging and clinical findings of patients with COVID-19 and simultaneous bihemispheric ischemic strokes. Multifocal ischemic strokes with bihemispheric involvement should be considered in COVID-19 patients with severe infection and poor neurologic status and may be associated with poor outcomes.","Kurian, Christeena, Mayer, Stephan, Kaur, Gurmeen, Sahni, Ramandeep, Feldstein, Eric, Mena, Samaan, Viswanathan, Divya, Sami, Tamarah, Ali, Syed, Al-Shammari, Hussein, Bloomfield, Jessica, Bravo, Michelle, Rolla, Nuoman, Gulko, Edwin, Gandhi, Chirag, Al-Mufti, Fawaz","https://doi.org/10.4103/bc.bc_65_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain Circulation; 8(1):10-16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29545,""

While there is no doubt that humanity needs infrastructure to ensure safe, secure and sufficient access to food, water and energy, it is essential to prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems which are also at the basis of the provision of such fundamental services. Those complex, interconnected issues cannot be tackled without research and innovation, both in the fields of biodiversity and of infrastructure. IENE (Infrastructure Ecology Network Europe) was set up in 1996 to meet this need. Its mission is to promote the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practice in safe and sustainable pan-European transport infrastructure. With a status of an association today, this independent network has more than 400 members consisting of researchers, engineers, decision makers and infrastructure operators. IENE functions as an international and interdisciplinary forum. It supports cross-border cooperation in research, mitigation, planning, design, construction and maintenance in the field of biodiversity and transport infrastructure. Every two years, IENE organises an international conference to present cutting-edge research, identify pressing issues and problems, discuss effective solutions and map out future activities in the field of transport ecology and infrastructure. We are very glad to present you in this special issue some of the best scientific outcomes of the IENE 2020 conference, hoping that it will contribute to further breakthroughs in science and uptake in policy-making and practices on the ground. We commend the organising team of the University of Evora, Portugal, for their excellent programming of the conference and for having gathered exceptional scientists on the topic of biodiversity and infrastructure. They managed to host a high-quality event, despite the many adjustments that had to be done because of the covid-19, including postponing the conference to January 2021 and holding it entirely online. The topic of IENE conference 2020 was â€œLinear Infrastructure Networks with Ecological Solutionsâ€ and the motto was â€œworking togetherâ€. This means that every stakeholder has a role to play, and that biodiversity should be considered at all governance scales and during all phases of the set-up of infrastructure. The papers selected here are of particular interest to follow the path set forth in the conferenceâ€™s final declaration, that is included in this issue.","SjÃ¶lund, Anders, Autret, Yannick, Boettcher, Marita, de Bouville, Julie, Georgiadis, Lazaros E.; Hahn, Elke, Hallosserie, AgnÃ¨s, Hofland, Adam, Jean-FranÃ§ois, Lesigne, Mira, Antonio, Navarro, Charlotte, Rosell, Carme, Sangwine, Tony, Seiler, Andreas, Wagner, Paul","https://doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.47.81621","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nature Conservation; 47:9-13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29546,""
"Effect of Cosmetics Use on the In Vitro Skin Absorption of a Biocide, 1,2-Benzisothiazolin-3-one","1,2-Benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT) is a commonly used organic biocide containing an isothiazolone ring. However, it may have adverse effects on human health and its risk needs to be properly evaluated. Dermal exposure is the main route of BIT exposure, and co-exposed substances may affect its absorption. The dermal permeation profile of BIT has not been well-studied. This study aimed to investigate the dermal permeation profiles of BIT with or without cosmetic use. Dermal permeation profiles of BIT were investigated after infinite- (100 Âµg/cm2), or a finite-dose (10 Âµg/cm2) application with or without cosmetics using a minipig skin and Strat-MÂ®, an artificial membrane. A cream, lotion, and essence (namely, face serum) were pre-treated as representative cosmetics on minipig skin for 30 min, with BIT treatment afterward. After the treatment, BIT left on the skin surface was collected by cotton swabbing, BIT in the stratum corneum, by sequential tape stripping, and BIT retained in the remaining skin was extracted after cutting the skin into pieces before LC-MS/MS analysis. When an infinite dose was applied, permeation coefficients (Kp, cm/h) for minipig skin and Strat-MÂ® were 2.63 Ã— 10-3 and 19.94 Ã— 10-3, respectively, reflecting that skin permeation was seven to eight times higher in Strat-MÂ® than in the minipig skin. BIT, in the presence of cosmetics, rapidly permeated the skin, while the amount in the stratum corneum and skin deposit was reduced. We performed a risk assessment of dermally applied BIT in the absence or presence of cosmetics by calculating the skin absorption rate at 10 h based on the toxicological data from several references. The risk level was higher in the presence of essence as compared to lotion, which was higher than cream, which was higher than the control (non-treated). However, all of the margins of safety values obtained were greater than 100, suggesting that BIT is safe for use in dermally exposed consumer products. We believe that this research contributes to a greater understanding of the risk assessment of isothiazolinone biocides.","Huh, Yoonjung, Do-Hyeon, Lee, Choi, Dalwoong, Kyung-Min, Lim","https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10030108","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Toxics; 10(3):108, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29547,""
"Park Characteristics and Changes in Park Visitation before, during, and after COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place Order","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited peopleâ€™s visitation to public places because of social distancing and shelter-in-place orders. According to Googleâ€™s community mobility reports, some countries showed a decrease in park visitation during the pandemic, while others showed an increase. Although government responses played a significant role in this variation, little is known about park visitation changes and the park attributes that are associated with these changes. Therefore, we aimed to examine the associations between park characteristics and percent changes in park visitation in Harris County, TX, for three time periods: before, during, and after the shelter-in-place order of Harris County. We utilized SafeGraphâ€™s point-of-interest data to extract weekly park visitation counts for the Harris County area. This dataset included the size of each park and its weekly number of visits from 2 March to 31 May 2020. In addition, we measured park characteristics, including greenness density, using the normalized difference vegetation index;park type (mini, neighborhood, community, regional/metropolitan);presence of sidewalks and bikeways;sidewalk and bikeway quantity;and bikeway quality. Results showed that park visitation decreased after issuing the shelter-in-place order and increased after this order was lifted. Results from linear regression models indicated that the higher the greenness density of the park, the smaller the decrease in park visitation during the shelter-in-place period compared to before the shelter-in-place order. This relationship also appeared after the shelter-in-place order. The presence of more sidewalks was related to less visitation increase after the shelter-in-place order. These findings can guide planners and designers to implement parks that promote public visitation during pandemics and potentially benefit peopleâ€™s physical and mental health.","Ding, Yizhen, Li, Dongying, Sang, Huiyan","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063579","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(6):3579, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29548,""
"Sustainable Technology in High-Income Economies: The Role of Innovation","The aim of this article is to examine the effects of innovation on the availability of cutting-edge technologies while controlling education, public funds and life expectancy in high-income countries from 2008 to 2018. In this study, Westerlund cointegration, fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares tests were applied. The research results indicate that: (i) there is a cointegrating link between the availability of the latest technologies and innovation, education, public funding and life expectancy;(ii) innovation increases the availability of cutting-edge technologies in high-income economies, whereas education, public funds and life expectancy contribute to sustainable technological availability;(iii) innovation, education, public funding and life expectancy result in the availability of cutting-edge technologies.

"Analysis of Household Pulse Survey Public-Use Microdata via Unit-Level Models for Informative Sampling","The Household Pulse Survey, recently released by the U.S. Census Bureau, gathers information about the respondentsâ€™ experiences regarding employment status, food security, housing, physical and mental health, access to health care, and education disruption. Design-based estimates are produced for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), as well as 15 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Using public-use microdata, this paper explores the effectiveness of using unit-level model-based estimators that incorporate spatial dependence for the Household Pulse Survey. In particular, we consider Bayesian hierarchical model-based spatial estimates for both a binomial and a multinomial response under informative sampling. Importantly, we demonstrate that these models can be easily estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo through the Stan software package. In doing so, these models can readily be implemented in a production environment. For both the binomial and multinomial responses, an empirical simulation study is conducted, which compares spatial and non-spatial models. Finally, using public-use Household Pulse Survey micro-data, we provide an analysis that compares both design-based and model-based estimators and demonstrates a reduction in standard errors for the model-based approaches.","Sun, Alexander, Parker, Paul A.; Holan, Scott H.","https://doi.org/10.3390/stats5010010","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Stats; 5(1):139, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29550,""
"Linking COVID-19-Related Awareness and Anxiety as Determinants of Coping Strategiesâ€™ Utilization among Senior High School Teachers in Cape Coast Metropolis, Ghana","Cognitive-behavioral coping among teachers is an important issue of investigation due to the reported high prevalence of anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas several studies have assessed COVID-19 awareness of individuals as a predictor of anxiety, the moderating role of awareness in anxiety and coping mechanisms remains unclear. The study primarily examined the nexus between awareness of COVID-19 and (a) anxiety and (b) coping strategies, including the interaction effect of COVID-19-related awareness in the link between anxiety and coping strategies among senior high school teachers. A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was adopted to conveniently select 184 teachers from senior high schools in the Cape Coast Metropolis. Questionnaires were administered to the participants and data were analyzed with means, standard deviation, Pearson correlation, and linear regression statistical procedures. Summarily, the results revealed a negative relationship between COVID-19 awareness and anxiety levels of teachers. COVID-19-related anxiety significantly predicted coping mechanisms of teachers. Further, COVID-19 awareness significantly moderated the relationship between anxiety and coping strategies adopted. These findings imply that the public health education and mass awareness campaign programs on COVID-19 could act as buffers against the spread of COVID-19, its associated comorbidities, and help improve the mental health of teachers. Promoting adaptation to COVID-19 through the use of functional management strategies such as active coping and emotional support should be encouraged in the Cape Coast Metropolis among teachers.","John Elvis, HaganJr, Quansah, Frank, Ankomah, Francis, Agormedah, Edmond Kwesi, Medina, Srem-Sai, James Boadu, Frimpong, Schack, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11030137","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(3):137, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29551,""
"How Being a Researcher Impacted My Life","Doing research can help people to learn about a lot of different topics. For example, researchers can learn how to work in a group, collect and analyze data, how to make accessible materials, and get to know their own strengths. In this paper, a researcher shares what she learned while working on two research projects about young adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities and co-occurring mental health conditions. The first project was peer mentoring. In this project, we focused on individual needs for someone who may be struggling with mental health. The second project was about workplace disclosure. In this project, we tried to find out if young adults disclose their mental health conditions at work and in job interviews. We explain how we did the projects, how the researcher learned to do research, and what made it easy to learn. We also share about the impact of doing research on the researcherâ€™s personal life. Finally, we share why doing inclusive research is important and how to help researchers with disabilities feel like they are valued members of the research team.","Herer, Alix, Schwartz, Ariel E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11030127","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(3):127, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29552,""
"Heuristic Greedy Scheduling of Electric Vehicles in Vehicle-to-Grid Microgrid Owned Aggregators","In on-grid microgrids, electric vehicles (EVs) have to be efficiently scheduled for cost-effective electricity consumption and network operation. The stochastic nature of the involved parameters along with their large number and correlations make such scheduling a challenging task. This paper aims at identifying pertinent innovative solutions for reducing the relevant total costs of the on-grid EVs within hybrid microgrids. To optimally scale the EVs, a heuristic greedy approach is considered. Unlike most existing scheduling methodologies in the literature, the proposed greedy scheduler is model-free, training-free, and yet efficient. The proposed approach considers different factors such as the electricity price, on-grid EVs state of arrival and departure, and the total revenue to meet the load demands. The greedy-based approach behaves satisfactorily in terms of fulfilling its objective for the hybrid microgrid system, which is established of photovoltaic, wind turbine, and a local utility grid. Meanwhile, the on-grid EVs are being utilized as an energy storage exchange location. A real time hardware-in-the-loop experimentation is comprehensively conducted to maximize the earned profit. Through different uncertainty scenarios, the ability of the proposed greedy approach to obtain a global optimal solution is assessed. A data simulator was developed for the purposes of generating evaluation datasets, which captures uncertainties in the behaviors of the systemâ€™s parameters. The greedy-based strategy is considered applicable, scalable, and efficient in terms of total operating expenditures. Furthermore, as EVs penetration became more versatile, total expenses decreased significantly. Using simulated data of an effective operational duration of 500 years, the proposed approach succeeded in cutting down the energy consumption costs by about 50â€“85%, beating existing state-of-the-arts results. The proposed approach is proved to be tolerant to the large amounts of uncertainties that are involved in the systemâ€™s operational data.","Abdel-Hakim, Alaa E.; Abo-Elyousr, Farag K.","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22062408","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sensors; 22(6):2408, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29553,""
"Eco-Anxiety and Pastoral Care: Theoretical Considerations and Practical Suggestions","The environmental crisis is producing an increasing number of both physical and psychological impacts. This article studies the challenge of eco-anxiety for pastoral care, drawing from both interdisciplinary research and ecological theology. The aim is to help both practitioners and researchers to encounter eco-anxiety more constructively. The rapidly growing research about eco-anxiety and therapy is discussed in relation to pastoral care. The various forms of eco-anxiety are briefly analyzed. The role of the caregivers is discussed by using sources that study the challenges of therapists in relation to eco-anxiety. The existential depths of eco-anxiety are probed in the light of recent research and older existentialist theory. It is pointed out that the political character of ecological issues, especially climate change issues, causes many kinds of challenges for pastoral care. As the constructive conclusion of the article, various possibilities and resources for encountering eco-anxiety in pastoral care are discussed, along with the connections with wider pastoral theology. It is argued that pastoral care providers should engage in self-reflection about their own attitudes and emotions related to ecological issues, preferably with the support of trusted peers or mentors. Various organizational developments are also needed to support caregivers. Dialectical thinking is one tool that can help to navigate the complex dynamics related to environmental responsibility, eco-emotions, and questions of hope or hopelessness.","Pihkala, Panu","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13030192","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(3):192, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29554,""
"The Physiological Response of Different Brook Willow (Salix acmophylla Boiss) Ecotypes to Salinity","Few phytoremediation studies have been conducted under semi-arid conditions where plants are subjected to drought and/or salinity stress. Although the genus Salix is frequently used in phytoremediation, information regarding its tolerance of drought and salinity is limited. In the present study, Salix acmophylla Boiss. cuttings from three sites (Adom, Darom and Mea Sheâ€™arim) were tested for tolerance to salinity stress by growing them hydroponically under either control or increasing NaCl concentrations corresponding to electrical conductivities of 3 and 6 dS m-1 in a 42-day greenhouse trial. Gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence and concentration, and water-use efficiency were measured weekly and biomass was collected at the end of the trial. Root, leaf and stem productivity was significantly reduced in the Adom ecotype, suggesting that Darom and Mea Sheâ€™arim are the more salt-tolerant of the three ecotypes. Net assimilation and stomatal conductance rates in salt-treated Adom were significantly reduced by the last week of the trial, coinciding with reduced intrinsic water use efficiency and chlorophyll a content and greater stomatal aperture. In contrast, early reductions in stomatal conductance and stomatal aperture in Darom and Mea Sheâ€™arim stabilized, together with pigment concentrations, especially carotenoids. These results suggest that Darom and Mea Sheâ€™arim are more tolerant to salt than Adom, and provide further phenotypic support to the recently published data demonstrating their genetic similarities and their usefulness in phytoremediation under saline conditions.","Palm, Emily, Klein, Joshua D.; Mancuso, Stefano, Werther Guidi, Nissim","https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11060739","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Plants; 11(6):739, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29555,""
"Molecular Signaling Mechanisms for the Antidepressant Effects of NLX-101, a Selective Cortical 5-HT1A Receptor Biased Agonist","Depression is the most prevalent of the mental illnesses and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is considered to be the major neurotransmitter involved in its etiology and treatment. In this context, 5-HT1A receptors have attracted interest as targets for therapeutic intervention. Notably the activation of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors delays antidepressant effects whereas the stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A heteroreceptors is needed for an antidepressant action. NLX-101 (also known as F15599) is a selective biased agonist which exhibits preferred activation of cortical over brain stem 5-HT1A receptors. Here, we used behavioral, neurochemical and molecular methods to examine the antidepressant-like effects in rats of a single dose of NLX-101 (0.16 mg/kg, i.p.). NLX-101 reduced immobility in the forced swim test when measured 30 min but not 24 h after drug administration. NLX-101 increased extracellular concentrations of glutamate and dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex, but no changes were detected in the efflux of noradrenaline or 5-HT. NLX-101 also produced an increase in the activation of pmTOR, pERK1/2 and pAkt, and the expression of PSD95 and GluA1, which may contribute to its rapid antidepressant action.","Cabanu, Sharon, Pilar-CuÃ©llar, Fuencisla, Zubakina, Paula, Florensa-Zanuy, Eva, Senserrich, JÃºlia, Newman-Tancredi, Adrian, Adell, Albert","https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15030337","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals; 15(3):337, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29556,""
"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Nature Walk as an Intervention for Anxiety and Depression","Scientific research has widely examined the therapeutic and health benefits of being in contact with natural environments. Nature walk have been proposed as a cost-effective and inclusive method for successfully exploiting nature for the promotion of health and well-being. Depression and anxiety symptoms have been shown to benefit from nature walk. Despite recent empirical findings published in the scientific literature, a summary quantitative work on the effect of nature walk on depression and anxiety does not yet exist. The present systematic review and meta-analysis quantitatively analyze and qualitatively discuss the studies published on the effect of nature walk on depression and anxiety published during the past decade. A database search as well as snowballing methods were used to retrieve eligible articles. The research question and literature search were based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Based on screening and retrieval processes, seven studies met the eligibility criteria and were then included in the quantitative meta-analysis. Risk of bias (RoB) analysis was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies using the Newcastleâ€“Ottawa Scale. After a qualitative evaluation of the studies, data from six experiments were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis show that nature walk effectively improve mental health.

"Human-Computer Interaction in Digital Mental Health","Human-computer interaction (HCI) has contributed to the design and development of some efficient, user-friendly, cost-effective, and adaptable digital mental health solutions. But HCI has not been well-combined into technological developments resulting in quality and safety concerns. Digital platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) have a good potential to improve prediction, identification, coordination, and treatment by mental health care and suicide prevention services. AI is driving web-based and smartphone apps;mostly it is used for self-help and guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression. Interactive AI may help real-time screening and treatment in outdated, strained or lacking mental healthcare systems. The barriers for using AI in mental healthcare include accessibility, efficacy, reliability, usability, safety, security, ethics, suitable education and training, and socio-cultural adaptability. Apps, real-time machine learning algorithms, immersive technologies, and digital phenotyping are notable prospects. Generally, there is a need for faster and better human factors in combination with machine interaction and automation, higher levels of effectiveness evaluation and the application of blended, hybrid or stepped care in an adjunct approach. HCI modeling may assist in the design and development of usable applications, and to effectively recognize, acknowledge, and address the inequities of mental health care and suicide prevention and assist in the digital therapeutic alliance.","Balcombe, Luke, De Leo, Diego","https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics9010014","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Informatics; 9(1):14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29558,""
"Needs and Needs Communication of Nursing Home Residents with Depressive Symptoms: A Qualitative Study","Nursing home residents are affected by depressive symptoms more often than elders living at home. There is a correlation between unmet needs and depression in nursing home residents, while met needs positively correlate with greater satisfaction and well-being. The study aims to examine the needs of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms and the communication of those needs, as no previous study has explicitly addressed the needs of this group of people and the way they are communicated. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 residents of three nursing homes and analyzed them using content-structuring content analysis. The residents reported diverse needs, assigned to 12 categories. In addition, barriers such as health impairments prevented the fulfillment of needs. As to the communication of needs, various interlocutors, facilitators, and barriers were identified. The findings reveal that residents can express their needs and are more likely to do so if the interlocutors are patient and take them seriously. However, lack of confidants, missing or non-functioning communication tools, impatience and perceived lack of understanding on the part of caregivers, and residentsâ€™ insecurities limit communication of needs.","Schweighart, Roxana, Klemmt, Malte, Neuderth, Silke, Teti, Andrea","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063678","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3678, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29559,""
"Factors Related to Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms and Quality of Life in Breast Cancer","Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health problem internationally. Although illness survival rates have improved, patients usually suffer multiple symptoms, both physical and psychological, which can affect their quality of life (QoL). The main aim of this study was to evaluate depressive symptoms, anxiety and the QoL of people with BC. An observational, cross-sectional study was carried out at Badajoz University Hospital (Spain). A total of 200 women with BC were included. EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires were used to assess QoL. Patients were screened for depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and for state anxiety and trait anxiety using the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Thirty-eight percent of the patients in the sample had moderate to severe anxiety, which was related to the time of diagnosis, advanced stage of illness and surgical treatment. We found that 28% of patients had depressive symptoms, related mainly with time of diagnosis, adjuvant therapy and number of cycles of chemotherapy (CT). Patients with the longest time since diagnosis, in stage III, and in treatment with CT, especially those with the greatest number of cycles, had the worst scores in QoL.

"Cost-Benefit Analysis of an Intervention in Divorced Parents: Implications for Society, Public Administrations and Family Visitation Centers","Families going through conflictive divorce processes are at increased risk of developing mental health problems. The Egokitzen program is a group intervention for parents who have undergone a divorce process, funded by the public administration. Budgetary constraints cause funding institutions to be interested in the effectiveness and economic efficiency of these programs. Therefore, the objective of this research is to carry out an efficiency analysis of the Egokitzen program, implemented by family visitation centers in Spain, through a cost-benefit analysis, to determine whether the positive impact on symptomatology (measured using CBCL and SCL-90 instruments) is translated into a positive economic impact for society. A sample of 382 parents participated. Costs will be first identified and valued;secondly, benefits achieved with the program will be identified through a prevalence analysis and, finally, the cost-benefit comparative analysis will be carried out. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis will be performed. The results obtained in the analysis indicate that for every euro spent on this program, the public administration and society save 3.10 euros in future interventions through medical costs and productivity losses.

"Effect of Growth Mindset on Mental Health Two Years Later: The Role of Smartphone Use","The negative association between the growth mindset and mental health problems suggests that prevention and intervention programs to improve mental health by targeting mindset may have potential clinical value. However, research on the longitudinal effect of mindset on adolescent mental health and its underlying mechanisms is lacking. Using a three-wave longitudinal design, we obtained data from a diverse sample of Chinese adolescents (n = 2543). Longitudinal multiple mediation models were constructed to examine the effects of the growth mindset on levels of anxiety and depression two years later. In addition, the mediating effects of smartphone use for entertainment and problematic smartphone use (PSU) were examined. After controlling for various covariates and the autoregressive effects of mental health problems, the growth mindset had significant negative effects on anxiety (ÃŸ = -0.053, p = 0.004) and depression (ÃŸ = -0.074, p &lt; 0.001). Smartphone use had a significant mediating role in the effect of mindset on anxiety (ÃŸ = -0.016, p &lt; 0.001) and depression (ÃŸ = -0.016, p &lt; 0.001). The growth mindset has long-lasting positive effects on adolescent mental health.

"Positive Mental Health in University Students and Its Relations with Psychological Vulnerability, Mental Health Literacy, and Sociodemographic Characteristics: A Descriptive Correlational Study","This study aimed to evaluate positive mental health (PMH) and its relation with sociodemographic characteristics, mental health literacy, and the psychological vulnerability scale (PVS) in Portuguese university students aged 17 to 62. A descriptive correlational study was carried out. An online survey was conducted to evaluate demographic variables, and several questionnaires were applied to evaluate positive mental health, psychological vulnerability, and mental health literacy. The data was collected from 1 November 2019 to 1 September 2020. Overall, 3405 students participated in the study. The results show that 67.8% of students revealed a high level of PMH, 31.6% presented a medium level of PMH, and 0.6% had a low level of PMH. Male students reported higher personal satisfaction (t (3170) = -2.39, p = 0.017) and autonomy (t (3170) = -3.33, p = 0.001) in PMH compared to female students. Students without a scholarship scored higher (t (3127) = -2.04, p = 0.42) in PMH than students who held a scholarship. Students who were not displaced from their home reported higher (t (3170) = -1.99, p = 0.047) self-control in PMH than those displaced from their home. University students with higher PMH results had lower PVS results and higher literacy results.

"An Exploration of Narcan as a Harm Reduction Strategy and Userâ€™s Attitudes toward Law Enforcement Involvement in Overdose Cases","The street homeless, those who spend their nights either in shelters or unofficial camps, whether in tents on a street or in societyâ€™s hidden spaces such as beneath an overpass, face multiple challenges beyond finding a safe place to sleep. Of further concern is how official actions can worsen these situations, through day-to-day activities or planned intervention strategies. In this paper we explore how a planned intervention may be negatively perceivedâ€”even as a form of â€œstructural violenceâ€â€”and may prevent Narcan (naloxone) use to stop an overdose related death in the Skid Row of Los Angeles. Data for this study consisted of a combination of Spatial Video Geonarratives (SVGs) and 325 incident reports from the Homeless Health Care Los Angeles Center for Harm Reduction (HHCLA-HRC) between November 2014 and December 2015. Chi-square and simple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between fear-of-arrest and other covariates of interest. Mapping results are presented with different sets of shapefiles created for (1) all Narcan uses, (2) all homeless, (3) all homeless with a worry about being arrested, (4) all Narcan uses where an ambulance attended, (5) and the same as 4 but also with police attendance. In the multivariable model, the estimated adjusted odds of fear-of-arrest is over three times higher among Narcan users ages 30â€“39 when compared to users under the age of 30. Analyzing the association of calling 9-1-1 on Narcan user demographics, socio-contextual characteristics, and overdose victim demographics, the crude estimated probability of calling 9-1-1 for Narcan users aged 50 and older is nearly three times higher when compared to Narcan users aged 19â€“29. Conclusion: Results suggest that the fear-of-arrest and calling 9-1-1 during an overdose is still a concern among Narcan users despite protective legislation and access to harm reduction resources.","Durieux, Jared, Curtis, Andrew, Mirka, Melissa, Jefferis, Eric, Chaz, Felix, Essel, Baaba","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063149","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3149, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29565,""

Emotion analysis and social network analysis were used to examine the flow of emotional messages (emotion flow) by comparing them with the flow of general messages (information flow). Results indicated that both emotional messages and general messages present a multilayer diffusion pattern and follow network step flow models. In our dataset, emotion network has a higher transmission efficiency than information network;officially verified accounts were more likely to become super-spreaders of emotional messages;good emotions were predominant but isolated from other six emotions (joy, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise, anger) in online discussions;finally, government played a vital role in spreading good emotions.","Yi, J.

"Building Caregiver Resiliency in Global Health: Embodying the Catholic Social Tradition in the Face of COVID-19","For international healthcare NGOs, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant. Healthcare workers in both LMICs and high-income countries have described the impact of the pandemic as traumatic. This article focuses on one initiative designed to address this impact: CMMB?s Building Resiliency program. This article provides an overview of the structure and content of program, situating it within the landscape of global mental healthcare disparities and caregiver trauma. Designed to address caregiver mental health in Peru, Haiti, Kenya, South Sudan, and Zambia, the program sought to offset global mental healthcare disparities by bringing needed psycho-social-spiritual support to CMMB staff. It was intentionally shaped by the commitments of Catholic social thought?particularly to the well-being, dignity, and integral human development of CMMB staff members, to envisaging new forms of solidarity, and to prioritizing subsidiarity and participation. Theories of post-traumatic growth provided the theoretical framework for three remotely delivered seminar series, which made space for staff members to share their stories with their colleagues, to build community, to foster creativity and hope, and to intentionally integrate faith and spirituality into both personal self-care as well as the common life of the organization. Thus, this was designed equally to build the organizational resiliency that is the fruit of Catholic social thought. For attending to caregivers? mental health and well-being is crucial not only for the success of medical missions but for embodying and witnessing the Catholic commitment to the human dignity and the integral development of those who do the work of our organizations.","Lysaught, M.

"Software Measurement by Using Artificial Intelligence","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of computer science concerned with developing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks similar to those performed by humans. This human-created intelligence began more than 60 years ago. The goal of previous generations of applications was to demonstrate generic human-like behaviour. The goal has expanded with the advancement and increased compliance of this technology. It includes areas such as healthcare, gaming, and smart devices. The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a significant barrier to maintaining a sustainable strategy for mental health support clients with major mental illnesses and clinicians who have had to shift delivery modes quickly. In this study, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide an overview of the current state of the literature related to software measurement of healthcare using artificial intelligence. The study followed a secondary research strategy. The systematic literature review aim was to analyze software measurement of mental health illness in terms of previous literature. This study screened out of 28 research papers out of 1076 initial searches. We used Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, ACM, and Hindawi as database search engines. The research objective was to explore the needs of software applications and automation in the healthcare sector to bring efficiency to the systems. The research concluded that the healthcare setting crucially requires the implementation of software automation.","Tariq, Aliza, Mazhar Javed, Awan, Alshudukhi, Jalawi, Talha Mahboob, Alam, Alhamazani, Khalid Twarish, Meraf, Zelalem","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7283171","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Nanomaterials; 2022, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29570,""
"Randomised parallel trial on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in screening gait disorder of silent cerebrovascular disease assisted by artificial intelligent system versus clinical doctors (ACCURATE-1): study protocol","IntroductionSilent cerebrovascular disease (SCD), which is a common disease in the elderly, leads to cognitive decline, gait disorders, depression and urination dysfunction, and increases the risk of cerebrovascular events. Our study aims to compare the accuracy of the diagnosis of SCD-related gait disorders between the intelligent system and the clinician. Our team have developed an intelligent evaluation system for gait. This study will evaluate whether the intelligent system can help doctors make clinical decisions and predictions, which aids the early prevention and treatment of SCD.Methods and analysisThis study is a multi-centred, prospective, randomised and controlled trial.SCD subjects aged 60â€“85 years in Shanghai and Guizhou will be recruited continuously. All subjects will randomly be divided into a doctor with intelligence assistance group or a doctor group, at a 1:1 ratio. The doctor and intelligent assistant group will accept the intelligent system evaluation. The intelligent system obtains gait parameters by an Red-Green-Blue-depth camera and computer vision algorithm. The doctor group will accept the cliniciansâ€™ routine treatment procedures. Meanwhile, all subjects will accept the panelâ€™s gait assessment and recognition rating scale as the gold standard. The primary outcome is the sensitivity of the intelligent system and clinicians to screen for gait disorders. The secondary outcomes include the healthcare costs and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of intelligent systems and clinicians to screen for gait disorders.Ethics and disseminationApproval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Fudan University on 26 November 2019.

"Living with suicidal feelings: Japanese non-profit organizations for suicide prevention amid the COVID-19 pandemic","The number of suicides in Japan increased for the first time in 11?years during the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is particularly high among employed women and students. The Japanese government expanded its budget for providing telephone and social network service (SNS) counseling by prefectures and non-profit organizations (NPOs). On the basis of interviews with the chairman as well as counselors of an NPO in Osaka (Japan) that has provided telephone counseling services on suicide for over 40?years, this study examines suicide and suicide prevention amid the COVID-19 pandemic with a particular focus on how suicidal feelings are accepted. The results clarify that people do not wish to die just because of financial troubles or health problems;rather, they have lost the meaning in their life in the conflicts between social conditions and their personal life histories. Additionally, as volunteer counselors often experience the suicide of close relatives, their empathy for a caller may be based on their experiences of being overwhelmed by the realization of the otherness of others. They do not regard the acceptance of suicidal feelings as a ?job,? but act as ?friends.? Although modern society conceals death and suicide cases, the key to achieving a society where no one is driven into committing suicide is to place human life and human rights first as well as to talk about suicide and suicidal feelings without making the subject taboo or an aberration.","Yamada, Yoko","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijjs.12138","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Japanese Sociology; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29572,""
"The short-term economic consequences of COVID-19: Occupation tasks and mental health in Canada",". In this paper, we study the effect of COVID-19 on the labour market and reported mental health of Canadians. To better understand the effect of the pandemic on the labour market, we build indexes for whether workers: (i) are relatively more exposed to disease, (ii) work in proximity to co-workers, (iii) are essential workers and (iv) can easily work remotely. Our estimates suggest that the impact of COVID-19 was significantly more severe for workers that work in proximity to co-workers and those more exposed to disease who are not in the health sector, while the effects are less severe for essential workers and workers that can work remotely. Last, using the Canadian Perspective Survey Series, we observe that reported mental health is significantly lower among some of the most affected workers such as women and less-educated workers. We also document that those who were absent from work because of COVID-19 are more concerned with meeting their financial obligations and with losing their job than those who continue working outside their home. RÃ©sumÃ© ConsÃ©quences Ã©conomiques de la COVID-19 Ã  court terme : tÃ¢ches professionnelles et santÃ© mentale au Canada. Dans cet article, nous Ã©tudions les rÃ©percussions de la COVID-19 sur le marchÃ© de l?emploi et la santÃ© mentale dÃ©clarÃ©e des Canadiens.

"The trajectories of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and the protective role of psychological flexibility: A four-wave longitudinal study","Published reports on the adverse mental health impacts of the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest an emerging global mental health crisis. However, the trajectories of these mental health impacts over multiple COVID-19 peaks and corresponding lockdowns are unknown. This study explored the trajectories of anxiety and depression over two consecutive lockdowns during the first nine months of the pandemic in Europe (April 2020-January 2021) and examined whether they varied as a function of different psychological flexibility and inflexibility profiles. A total of 569 Italians completed online surveys at four assessment points. Trajectories of anxiety and depression were examined with latent growth modeling and according to different psychological flexibility and inflexibility profiles. Anxiety increased linearly throughout the study period, whereas depression displayed a quadratic trajectory evidencing a decrease with the easing of the first lockdown followed by an increase during the second lockdown. Furthermore, two profiles were identified that displayed different anxiety and depression trajectories. Compared to the psychologically flexible profile, the psychologically inflexible profile reported significantly higher anxiety and depression which remained higher across the study period. A reliance on self-report measures and convenience sampling constitute key study limitations. Results suggest that high psychological inflexibility is a risk factor for prolonged elevated anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas high psychological flexibility is a protective factor. Psychological flexibility and inflexibility should be targeted by preventive public health interventions that harness evidence-based strategies shown to effectively target these factors.","Landi, Pakenham, Crocetti, Tossani, Grandi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.03.067","20220404","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Longitudinal study; Psychological flexibility; Psychological inflexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29576,""
"Perceived risks of COVID-19, attitudes towards preventive guidelines and impact of the lockdown on students in Uganda: A cross-sectional study","This study explored students' perceptions of COVID-19 risks and preventive measures and assessed the impacts of the national lockdown on students in Uganda. A web-based survey was conducted to explore students' perceived risks of COVID-19 and preventive measures; sources of COVID-19 information and impacts of the lockdown. Both undergraduate and post-graduate students (n = 398) participated in the study. Data were analysed using IBM-SPSS-26. Students acknowledged COVID-19 as a health risk, and their preventive behaviours were influenced by age, gender, marital status and living situation. Most students followed face mask guidelines but did not comply with lockdown restrictions. Social distancing was not always possible due to overcrowding. Students' main sources of COVID-19 information were local media (e.g., TV, radio) and social media. Most students (especially females) were unable to access online learning platforms due to poor internet connectivity, high costs and no access to computers. Meanwhile, a majority of those who studied online did not enjoy the experience. Students experienced depression, frustration, stress and anxiety during the lockdown; became less physically active and spent most of their time on social media, sleeping, eating or watching movies. Some students indulged in smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs and gambling for their first time, while others did them more often than before. The increase in sedentary activity, poor mental health and substance use over the lockdown period puts students at risk of health complications and poses a potential threat to the healthcare system. These risks may also negatively impact their future learning and academic potential. Further research is needed to understand the transitional experiences of students between physical and virtual learning, and how they can be supported.

"Mental health disorders among post graduate residents in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare workers, including residents, are prone to various mental health disorders especially given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents, particularly, are already under undue stress due to their respective training program demands. This cross-sectional, online survey-based study from August to November 2020 collected demographic and mental health measurements from all residents at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The questionnaire investigated demographic variables, information regarding direct care of COVID-19 patients, prior history of mental health and mental health outcomes using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Impact of Event Scale-Revised Questionnaire and Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index Questionnaire. A total of 100 residents completed the survey (participation rate 77.5%). Participants were about equal in gender (women [53%]), with a median age of 31.28 years, and majority were single (66.7%). A total of 66 participants (66%) were directly engaged in COVID-19 care. Depression: 64.3%, anxiety: 51.5%, insomnia: 40.5%, distress: 35.4%, and burnout: 51.0% were reported in all participants. Statistical significance was found in median depression, professional fulfillment and interpersonal disengagement when comparing frontline resident directly involved in care of COVID-19 patient versus second line residents. Residents directly involved with caring for COVID-19 patients had statistically higher incidences of depression and interpersonal disengagement and lower professional fulfillment compared to second line residents. Keeping in mind the limited resources in sub-Saharan Africa, urgent and geographically specific strategies are needed to help combat mental health disorders in this specific population.","Ali, Shah, Du, Leekha, Talib","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266570","20220404","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29578,""
"A web-based cross-sectional study assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of radiology staff in Saudi Arabia","The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic has not only created massive public health issues, it has also produced excessive psychological disorders in healthcare professionals, including radiology staff. The aim of this study is to assess the risk perception and mental health of radiology staff in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researcher asked radiology staff to complete an online Google Forms questionnaire, between June 10, 2020 and June 17, 2020, which contained demographic data and self-designed questions related to anxiety, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and mental health services during the pandemic. A total of 168 radiology staff participated in the study. The results indicated that 53.05% and 57.14% of the participants were experiencing mild to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Moreover, 47.02% of the participants were experiencing insomnia symptoms. Among all the participants, only 16.61% had received psychological materials from their hospital during the pandemic, while 22.02% had accessed online psychological assistance techniques. The health of roughly one-third (30.95%) of the participants was worse than it had been before the pandemic. COVID-19 is a source of mental health disorders for healthcare professionals, particularly radiology staff. The findings of this study indicate that more than 70% of radiology staff in Saudi Arabia are concerned about insufficient protective measures and the risk of infection. In addition, a large percentage of them have experienced mental health disorders, such as anxiety, insomnia, and depression. Regular mental healthcare services are required to decrease the negative impact of the pandemic and enhance the overall mental health of the radiology staff.","Abdeen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265873","20220404","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29579,""
"Trends In Outpatient Mental Health Services Use Before And During The COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted mental health services delivery across the US, but the extent and implications of these disruptions are unclear. This retrospective observational analysis used the claims clearinghouse Office Ally to compare outpatient mental health services use from March to December 2016-18 against use during the same period in 2020. We identified encounters for people ages twelve and older with primary diagnosis codes corresponding to mental health conditions and categorized encounters as in-person or telehealth, using Current Procedural Terminology and place-of-service codes. In-person mental health encounters were reduced by half in the early months of the pandemic, with rapid recovery of service delivery attributable to telehealth uptake (accounting for 47.9Ã‚Â percent of average monthly encounters). We found variation in the degree to which telehealth use increased across groups: People with schizophrenia made up a lower proportion of telehealth encounters relative to in-person visits (1.7Ã‚Â percent versus 2.7Ã‚Â percent), whereas those with anxiety and fear-related disorders accounted for a higher proportion (27.5Ã‚Â percent versus 25.5Ã‚Â percent). These findings highlight the importance of broadening access to services through new modalities without supplanting necessary in-person care for certain groups.","Zhu, Myers, McConnell, Levander, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01297","20220404","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29580,""
"The relationship between stigma and mental health in a population of individuals with COVID-19","Illness stigma has been observed across previous outbreaks including Ebola, SARS, HIV/AIDS, and now COVID-19. Although both the stigma of having COVID-19 as well as mental health impacts of COVID-19 have been studied, limited research exists regarding the relationship of stigma and mental health in this population. Thus, the primary purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between stigma and mental health in adults with COVID-19. Adult respondents with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (<i>N</i> = 632) completed an online questionnaire distributed between April 17, 2020, and April 18, 2021. The study measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the 8-Item Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness (SSCI-8) tailored to measure perceived stigmatization from a COVID-19 diagnosis. Participants (mean age = 51) were mostly female (71%), White (73%), married (70%), obese (56%), and had a chronic health condition (56%). Female sex, education status, working from home or not working owing to COVID-19, previous mental health diagnosis, history of chronic illness, and being a current/former smoker were associated with higher stigma scores, whereas older age and Black race were associated with lower stigma scores. Greater stigma and psychological distress was observed in females with a previously diagnosed psychiatric illness and/or chronic health condition. Our findings suggest a disproportionate burden of mental health/psychiatric symptoms/sequelae, including stigma and PTSD, among COVID-19 survivors with a history of mental illness. Further studies are needed to fully characterize COVID-19 related stigma and subsequent mental health experiences.

"Effectiveness of an Internet-Based and Telephone-Assisted Training for Parents of 4-Year-Old Children With Disruptive Behavior: Implementation Research","There is a lack of effectiveness studies when digital parent training programs are implemented in real-world practice. The efficacy of the internet-based and telephone-assisted Finnish Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) parent training intervention on the disruptive behavior of 4-year-old children was studied in a randomized controlled trial setting in Southwest Finland between 2011 and 2013. After that, the intervention was implemented nationwide in child health clinics from 2015 onwards. The main aim of this study was to compare the treatment characteristics and effectiveness of the SFSW parent training intervention between the families who received the intervention when it was implemented as a normal practice in child health clinics and the families who received the same intervention during the randomized controlled trial. The implementation group comprised 600 families who were recruited in the SFSW intervention between January 2015 and May 2017 in real-world implementation. The RCT intervention group comprised 232 families who were recruited between October 2011 and November 2013. The same demographic and child and parent measures were collected from both study groups and were compared using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measurements. The child psychopathology and functioning level were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) version 1.5-5 for preschool children, the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), and a modified version of the Barkley Home Situations Questionnaire. Parenting skills were measured using the 31-item Parenting Scale and the shorter 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The estimated child and parent outcomes were adjusted for CBCL externalizing scores at baseline, maternal education, duration of the behavior problems, and paternal age. The baseline measurements of each outcome were used as covariates. The implementation group was more likely to complete the intervention than the RCT intervention group (514/600, 85.7% vs 176/232, 75.9%, respectively; P&lt;.001). There were no significant differences between the implementation and RCT intervention groups with regard to child measures, including CBCL externalizing score (-0.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.6; P=.83), total score (-0.7, 95% CI -3.0 to 4.5; P=.70), internalizing score (-0.3, 95% CI -1.0 to 1.6; P=.64), and ICU total score (-0.4, 95% Cl -1.9 to 1.2; P=.64). No significant difference was detected in the Parenting Scale total score (0.0, 95% Cl -0.1 to 0.1; P=.50), while DASS-21 total score differed nearly significantly (2.5, 95% Cl 0.0-5.1; P=.05), indicating better improvement in the implementation group. The internet-based and telephone-assisted SFSW parent training intervention was effectively implemented in real-world settings. These findings have implications for addressing the unmet needs of children with disruptive behavior problems.

"Enablers and Barriers to HIV Services for Gay and Bisexual Men in the COVID-19 Era: Fusing Datasets from Two Global Online Surveys Via File Concatenation with Adjusted Weights","Gay and bisexual men are 26 times more likely to acquire HIV than other adult men and represent nearly 1 in 4 new HIV infections worldwide. There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic may be complicating efforts to prevent new HIV infections, reduce AIDS related deaths, and expand access to HIV services. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gay and bisexual men's ability to access services is not fully understood. To understand access to HIV services at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study used data collected from two independent global online surveys conducted with convenience samples of gay and bisexual men. Both datasets had common demographic measurements, but only one, the COVID-19 Disparities Survey (n=13,562), collected the outcomes of interest (HIV service access at the height of the first COVID-19 wave) and only the other, GMHR-4 (n=6,188), gathered pre-COVID-19 pandemic exposures/covariates of interest (social/structural enablers of and barriers to HIV service access). We used data fusion methods to combine these datasets utilizing overlapping demographic variables and assessed relationships between exposures and outcomes. We hypothesized that engagement with gay community and comfort with one's healthcare provider would be positively associated with HIV service access and negatively associated with poorer mental health and economic instability as the COVID-19 outbreaks took hold. Conversely, we hypothesized that sexual stigma and experiences of discrimination by a healthcare provider would be negatively associated with HIV services access and positively associated with poorer mental health and economic instability. With 19,643 observations after combining datasets, our study confirmed hypothesized associations between enablers of and barriers to HIV prevention, care, and treatment. For example, community engagement was positively associated with access to an HIV provider (Coef. = 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.86, p=0.00), while sexual stigma was negatively associated with access to HIV treatment (Coef. =-1.39, 95% CI -1.42 - -1.36, p=0.00). HIV service access for gay and bisexual men remained obstructed and perhaps became worse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Community-led research that utilizes novel methodological approaches can be helpful in times of crisis to inform urgently needed tailored responses that can be delivered in real-time. More research is needed to understand the full impact COVID-19 is having on gay and bisexual men worldwide.","Ayala, Santos, Arreola, Howell, Hoffman","https://doi.org/10.2196/33538","20220404","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29583,""
"The mental health impact of daily news exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ecological momentary assessment study","Consumption of distressing news media, which increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has demonstrable negative effects on mental health. The current study examines the proximal impact of daily exposure to news about COVID-19 on mental health in the first year of the pandemic. A sample of 546 college students completed daily ecological momentary assessments for 8 weeks measuring exposure to news about COVID-19, worry and optimism specifically related to COVID-19, hopelessness, and general worry. Participants completed &gt;80,000 surveys. Multilevel mediation models indicated that greater daily exposure to news about COVID-19 was associated with higher same-day and next-day worry about the pandemic. Elevations in worry specifically about COVID-19 were in turn associated with greater next-day hopelessness and general worry. Optimism about COVID-19 mediated the relationship between daily exposure to COVID-19 news and next-day general worry but was not related to hopelessness. This study demonstrates the mental health impact of daily exposure to COVID-19 news and highlights how worry about the pandemic contributes over time to hopelessness and general worry.","Kellerman, Hamilton, Selby, Kleiman","https://doi.org/10.2196/36966","20220404","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29584,""
"Antifungal Activity of Fibrate-Based Compounds and Substituted Pyrroles That Inhibit the Enzyme 3-Hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA Reductase of <i>Candida glabrata</i> (CgHMGR), Thus Decreasing Yeast Viability and Ergosterol Synthesis","Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of yeasts belonging to the Candida genus, there is an urgent need to discover antifungal agents directed at alternative molecular targets. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the capacity of three different series of synthetic compounds to inhibit the Candida glabrata enzyme denominated 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and thus affect ergosterol synthesis and yeast viability. Compounds 1c (ÃŽÂ±-asarone-related) and 5b (with a pyrrolic core) were selected as the best antifungal candidates among over 20 synthetic compounds studied. Both inhibited the growth of fluconazole-resistant and fluconazole-susceptible C. glabrata strains. A yeast growth rescue experiment based on the addition of exogenous ergosterol showed that the compounds act by inhibiting the mevalonate synthesis pathway. A greater recovery of yeast growth occurred for the C. glabrata 43 fluconazole-resistant (versus fluconazole-susceptible) strain and after treatment with 1c (versus 5b). Given that the compounds decreased the concentration of ergosterol in the yeast strains, they probably target ergosterol synthesis. According to the docking analysis, the inhibitory effect of 1c and 5b could possibly be mediated by their interaction with the amino acid residues of the catalytic site of the enzyme. Since 1c displayed higher binding energy than ÃŽÂ±-asarone and 5b, it is the best candidate for further research, which should include structural modifications to increase its specificity and potency. The derivatives could then be examined with <i>in vivo</i> animal models using a therapeutic dose. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is currently an epidemiological alert in health care services due to outbreaks of Candida auris, Candida glabrata, and other fungal species multiresistant to conventional antifungals. Therefore, it is important to propose alternative molecular targets, as well as new antifungals. The three series of synthetic compounds herein designed and synthesized are inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis in yeasts. Of the more than 20 compounds studied, two were selected as the best antifungal candidates. These compounds were able to inhibit the growth and synthesis of ergosterol in C. glabrata strains, whether susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. The rational design of antifungal compounds derived from clinical drugs (statins, fibrates, etc.) has many advantages. Future studies are needed to modify the structure of the two present test compounds to obtain safer and less toxic antifungals. Moreover, it is important to carry out a more in-depth mechanistic approach.","Madrigal-Aguilar, Gonzalez-Silva, Rosales-Acosta, Bautista-Crescencio, Ortiz-ÃƒÂlvarez, Escalante, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Navarrete, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Chamorro-Cevallos, Tamariz, Villa-Tanaca","https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01642-21","20220404","Candida; HMGR; atorvastatin; ergosterol; fibrates; multidrug resistance; pyrroles; synthetic antifungal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29585,""

"A narrative review of the use of alcohol during the Covid-19 pandemic; effects and implications","The Covid-19 pandemic created an environment wherein stress and isolation could increase alcohol consumption. The effects of alcohol consumption on Covid-19 susceptibility and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol use, related harms and services were explored.Search terms were inputted to Medline and Embase databases, with relevant published papers written in English chosen.Alcohol ingestion both increased and decreased throughout the population globally, however, the overall trend was an increase. Risk factors for this included female sex, young age, family conflicts, unemployment, mental health disorders, substance misuse and lack of support. Alcohol misuse was found to be an aggravator of domestic violence and worsening mental health. It exacerbated the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and worsened the Covid-19 infection severity, with &gt;10 drinks/week increasing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) risk similarly to established risk factors. This was attributed to the immunosuppressive and disinhibition effects of alcohol. Therefore, healthcare professionals should provide support to vulnerable groups, encouraging stress reduction, healthy habits, limiting alcohol consumption (&lt;5 drinks/week) and promoting coping techniques. Self-help tools that monitor individual alcohol intake and psychosocial interventions in a primary care setting can also be employed. Finally, governing bodies should inform the public of the risks of alcohol ingestion during the Covid-19 pandemic.Thus, the Covid-19 pandemic could create a cycle whereby alcohol misuse could become a risk factor for Covid-19 infection and the Covid-19 pandemic could become a risk factor for alcohol misuse. Healthcare professionals should counsel people on alcohol misuse risk and protective factors.","Bantounou","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2022.2058852","20220404","Alcohol; Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; immunity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29587,""
"Masking care: A qualitative investigation of the impact of face masks on the experience of stroke rehabilitation from the perspective of staff and service users with communication difficulties","Face mask use has become widespread as a means of reducing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Research suggests face coverings can impact speech discrimination, therapeutic alliance and the interpretation of non-verbal cues. However, there is little research into the impact of face masks on people with communication difficulties (pwCD) post-stroke. To explore the perspectives of service users and staff on a stroke rehabilitation unit in order to understand the impact of staff wearing face masks on the experience of rehabilitation for pwCD. Strategies that might improve the experience of rehabilitation for pwCD were also explored. Semi-structured interviews and a focus group were conducted with six pwCD and five health professionals (HPs) on a stroke rehabilitation unit. The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Four main interacting themes were identified from the data: (1) face masks as a barrier to effective communication; (2) face masks as a barrier to human connection and therapeutic relationships; (3) the impact of face masks on an individual is influenced by multiple internal and external factors; and (4) there is a need for service provision to evolve to meet pwCD's needs when using face masks. Findings shed light on how face masks can act as a barrier for pwCD within the rehabilitative process, and emphasize that each individual with communication difficulties is likely to be affected to a differing extent, as a result of multiple interacting factors. HPs are encouraged to consider the individual holistically, tailor strategies and adapt to each individual's needs. Further research is required to understand how to optimize rehabilitation outcomes when face masks are used. What is already known on the subject There is evidence face masks can affect speech discrimination, therapeutic alliance and interpretation of non-verbal cues. The existing literature predominantly considers people with hearing impairments, mental health needs or the general public. The potential for face masks to impact pwCD post-stroke is high, given pre-existing communication barriers and evidence of increased social isolation. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study is the first of its kind to explore how face mask use by HPs impacts the experience of rehabilitation for pwCD post-stroke. The authors consider the need to tailor compensatory strategies to each individual and adapt them to meet service users' needs. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? HPs should monitor closely the impact of face mask use on pwCD with whom they are working, and consider what adaptations to delivery are required. It would be helpful for clinicians to have a discussion with pwCD post-stroke to understand the impact of face mask use on them personally and what strategies they would find most helpful within rehabilitation. Additional training by speech and language therapists on supporting effective communication and successful interaction with pwCD may be indicated in the context of face mask use.","Broomfield, Clay","https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12711","20220404","aphasia; communication difficulties; dysarthria; face masks; rehabilitation; stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29588,""

"Transitioning Behavioral Healthcare in Louisiana Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Policy and Practice Innovations to Sustain Telehealth Expansion","A statewide COVID-19 quarantine order forced an abrupt shift for Louisiana's behavioral health providers who provide mental health and substance abuse treatment services. The Center for Evidence to Practice conducted a study of this unprecedented shift to better understand the disruption and continuation of care during early statewide adoption of telemental health. The Center performed a mixed-method assessment including a series of focus groups and key informant interviews followed by a survey of over 300 responding providers. Over 85% of providers reported sustaining behavioral health services using a variety of telemental health strategies. While traditional referral networks and client volume were significantly disrupted, temporary relaxation of Medicaid regulatory and reimbursement policies appeared to be a key facilitator of telemental health adoption and continued services. Shifting to telemental health relied on provider's quick adaptations, engaging clients with a hybrid of teleconferencing platforms, calls/texts, and socially-distanced in-person visits. Larger multi-clinician providers and evidence-based practice (EBP) providers were better equipped to support the adoption of telemental health. Rural and EBPs providers disproportionately discontinued services. Although many practitioners viewed the original COVID-19 pandemic as a short-lived condition, the recent emergence of Delta and other variants has shown the impact on the BH care system may be lasting. Flexibility across policies and a variety of telemental health platforms are keys to telehealth adaptation.

"The relationship between health-related quality of life of students at Tehran University of Medical Sciences and their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 in 2020","Present study attempts to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its relation with knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) during this pandemic. In this cross-sectional study which was conducted between 23 may to 21 June 2020, 470 students in different levels of TUMS were included to the study randomly. participants completed validate, designed online questionnaire which assessed KAP towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HRQoL. All statistical tests were applied, including Chi-square and Fisher's exact test, Partial correlation, analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, multiple binary and multinomial logistic regression models (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and were performed in SPSS 16, R 4.0.2, and GraphPad Prism 6.0 softwares. A total of 470 students were included in the study. The overall correct answer rate of the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire was 74.43% and total score of the HRQoL was 72.50 (14.85). 61.7% of the students were agreed that COVID-19 will finally be successfully controlled, 44.3% had confidence that Iran can win the battle against the COVID-19, and 92.6% agreed that Quarantine will reduce the prevalence of COVID-19. Most of them adhered to health protocols and about a relation between HRQoL and knowledge we have a weak positive and unsignificant correlation between them (r = 0.05, <i>P</i> = 0.27). TUMS students showed expected levels of knowledge, proper attitudes, and preemptive practices regarding COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 outbreak substantially affected the physical and mental health but, the students were in a way better physical health rather than mental. Therefore, motivational planning and other related intervention to improve mental health can be noticeable.","Heidari-Soureshjani, Mohammadi, Hashemi-Shahraki, Estakhri, Rasti","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_623_21","20220404","Attitude; COVID-19; health; knowledge; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29591,""
"COVID-19 and Mortality, Depression, and Suicide in the Polish Population","The study was aimed at assessing the mortality of the population, the occurrence of the phenomenon of depression and suicide before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on total mortality in Poland in 2017-2021 came from the report of the Ministry of Health. Data on the number of sick leave due to mental disorders were taken from the report of the ZUS (Social Insurance Institution in Poland). Data on the number of suicides came from police statistics. Increase in the number of deaths in Poland in 2021 compared to the 2017-2019 average - 26.86%. In 2018-2020, the greatest number of fatal suicides was recorded in the age group - 60-64 years (in 2018 <i>N</i> = 565; 10.90%; in 2020 <i>N</i> = 524; 10.15%). In the years 2020-2021, an increase in mortality was observed in Poland compared to the previous years.

"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents: A systematic review of survey studies","Mental health problems among children and adolescents are increasingly observed during the outbreak of COVID-19, leading to significant healthcare concerns. Survey studies provide unique opportunities for research during this pandemic, while there are no existing systematic reviews in this setting. The objective was to summarize existing survey studies addressing the effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. For this systematic review, we performed an electronic search in multiple databases from December 2019 to December 2020. The quality appraisal of the included studies was performed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Because of the high methodological heterogeneity between studies, a narrative synthesis of the qualitative data was used. In total, 35 survey studies with 65,508 participants, ranging from 4 to 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age, are included in this review. Anxiety (28%), depression (23%), loneliness (5%), stress (5%), fear (5%), tension (3%), anger (3%), fatigue (3%), confusion (3%), and worry (3%) were the most common mental health issues reported. Children and adolescents with psychiatric and/or developmental disorders, such as severe obesity, chronic lung disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cystic fibrosis, and obsessive-compulsive disorders, were especially vulnerable to the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, gender, psychological quality, and negative coping strategies were identified as risk factors for the development of mental health problems. Social and family support, along with a positive coping style, was associated with better outcomes. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents is multifaceted and substantial. Survey studies regarding child and adolescent mental health amid COVID-19 indicated that anxiety, depression, loneliness, stress, and tension are the most observed symptoms. Positive coping strategies with family and social support may be important to achieving better outcomes. Due to limited available evidence, more well-designed studies in this area are urgently needed.","Theberath, Bauer, Chen, Salinas, Mohabbat, Yang, Chon, Bauer, Wahner-Roedler","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121221086712","20220404","COVID-19; Child; adolescent; mental health; review; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29593,""
"A promising future for tele-mental health in Oman: A qualitative exploration of clients and therapists' experiences","Tele-mental health services can play an important role in overcoming barriers in mental health services in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. However, despite its potential, tele-mental health has not been widely adopted in Oman. This study is an exploratory investigation into the experiences of therapists and their clients in utilizing video-based tele-mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 19 semistructured qualitative interviews were individually conducted, it included 13 adult clients with mental health conditions who received video-based tele-mental health care and six clinical psychologists who provided video-based tele-mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The clients reported favorable experiences using tele-mental health, with the primary benefits being convenience, easy accessibility to subspecialized care, reduced absenteeism from work with commuting costs, and alleviated mental health stigma. The therapists also expressed experiencing benefits from tele-mental health, such as reduced risk of intrahospital infection, reduced healthcare costs, and the achievement of work-life balance. Primary concerns were related to the lack of public tele-mental health services, lack of specified tele-mental health guidelines, shortage of trained therapists, limited access to high-speed Internet, electronic devices, privacy, and concerns toward the security of telehealth systems in general. Clients and therapists report that tele-mental health offers new opportunities to improve the quality of mental healthcare services in Oman, and that the challenges could be resolved by establishing governmental tele-mental health services along with developing tele-mental health guidelines and implementing local postgraduate clinical psychology programs in universities in Oman.","Al-Mahrouqi, Al-Alawi, Al-Alawi, Al Balushi, Al Ghailani, Al Sabti, Al Sinawi","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121221086372","20220404","COVID-19; Tele-mental health; telemedicine; telepsychiatry; telepsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29594,""
"England's food policy coordination and the Covid-19 response","The impact of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and the response of government and non-government actors, from February-September 2020, offers critical insights into the current state of England's food policy processes and operations, and in particular the coordination of national food policy approaches. This study aims to clarify and solidify the discourse around food policy coordination by differentiating between <i>routine</i> coordination of the activities of government, and <i>strategic</i> coordination of such policy activities with higher-level strategic goals, such as those associated with a healthy and sustainable food system. This framework is applied to the case study based on documentary analysis. In detailing the evidence of coordination in the response, including examples of cross-government working, and collaboration across the public, private and third sectors, the findings illustrate the breadth of actors which constituted the policy and governance response. These included public policymakers in national and local governments, and from a range of different government departments; private sector food businesses; and third sector organisations. There was a high level of routine coordination, but also instances of disconnection and delay. A lack of strategic coordination provides an explanatory device for several instances of disconnection and incoherence, including interventions which failed to prioritise nutrition-related health, and the working conditions of those employed in the food sector. The routine-strategic distinction can be deployed to inform discussions on the types of policy coordination mechanisms, such as cross-cutting taskforces or bodies, which might be instituted to support connected working on food.","Parsons, Barling","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-022-01280-1","20220404","Covid-19; Food Governance; Food Policy; Food Systems; Policy Coordination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29595,""
"Meta-Regression on the Heterogenous Factors Contributing to the Prevalence of Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Crisis Among Healthcare Workers","This paper used meta-regression to analyze the heterogenous factors contributing to the prevalence rate of mental health symptoms of the general and frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in China under the COVID-19 crisis. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medrxiv and pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence rates, and ran meta-regression to tease out the key sources of the heterogeneity. The meta-regression results uncovered several predictors of the heterogeneity in prevalence rates among published studies, including severity (e.g., above severe vs. above moderate, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; above moderate vs. above mild, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), type of mental symptoms (PTSD vs. anxiety, <i>p</i> = 0.04), population (frontline vs. general HCWs, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), sampling location (Wuhan vs. Non-Wuhan, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and study quality (<i>p</i> = 0.04).

"Prevalence and Differences of Depression, Anxiety, and Substance Use Between Chinese College-Age Students Studying in China and America During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) swept the globe and harmfully influenced the mental health and behaviors of the college student population. This study aims to examine the prevalence and difference of mental health and the substance use problems of the Chinese college-age students studying in China and America (CSA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. One thousand five hundred four students participated in this study. A total of 42.12% of students are enrolled in Chinese colleges, and 57.78% of students are enrolled in American colleges, aged 17-23 years ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>Ã‚Â¯</mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mo>Ã‚Â±</mml:mo> <mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math> = 19.90 Ã‚Â± 1.50).

"Minimal Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health and Wellbeing of People Living With Dementia: Analysis of Matched Longitudinal Data From the IDEAL Study","Research suggests a decline in the mental health and wellbeing of people with dementia (PwD) during the COVID-19 pandemic; however few studies have compared data collected pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. Moreover, none have compared this change with what would be expected due to dementia progression. We explored whether PwD experienced changes in mental health and wellbeing by comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic data, and drew comparisons with another group of PwD questioned on two occasions prior to the pandemic. Community-dwelling PwD enrolled in the IDEAL programme were split into two groups matched for age group, sex, dementia diagnosis, and time since diagnosis. Although each group was assessed twice, one was assessed prior to and during the pandemic (pandemic group; <i>n</i> = 115) whereas the other was assessed prior to the pandemic (pre-pandemic group; <i>n</i> = 230). PwD completed measures of mood, sense of self, wellbeing, optimism, quality of life, and life satisfaction. Compared to the pre-pandemic group, the pandemic group were less likely to report mood problems, or be pessimistic, but more likely to become dissatisfied with their lives. There were no changes in continuity in sense of self, wellbeing, and quality of life. Results suggest the pandemic had little effect on the mental health and wellbeing of PwD, with any changes observed likely to be consistent with expected rates of decline due to dementia. Although personal accounts attest to the challenges experienced, PwD appear to have been resilient to the impact of lockdown and social restrictions during the pandemic.","Sabatini, Bennett, Martyr, Collins, Gamble, Matthews, Pentecost, Dawson, Hunt, Parker, Allan, Burns, Litherland, Quinn, Clare","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.849808","20220404","life orientation; optimism; quality of life; sense of self; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29598,""
"Pandemic Exposure, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Conflict Behaviors, and Online Aggressive Behaviors Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining the Moderating Role of Gender","The COVID-19 pandemic impacts people's mental health and behaviors, but the influence mechanism between pandemic exposure, conflict behaviors, and online aggressive behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak remains unclear. This study will address this gap. Data were collected from 1,153 college students in an online survey that included an pandemic experiences scale, a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scale, a conflict behaviors scale, and an online aggressive behaviors scale. Structural equation modeling and multi-group comparisons were used to analyze the data. Pandemic exposure positively predicted conflict and online aggressive behaviors through hyperarousal symptoms, and negatively predicted these behaviors through intrusive symptoms. The mediating roles of avoidance and negative alterations in cognition and mood symptoms in the relations between pandemic exposure and conflict behaviors and online aggressive behaviors were non-significant. Among male students, pandemic exposure directly predicted conflict and online aggressive behaviors, but for female students, pandemic exposure indirectly influenced these behaviors through intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms. The intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms play mediating roles in the relations between pandemic exposure and conflict behaviors and online aggressive behaviors. Gender plays a moderating role in the above mediating mechanism.","Zhen, Yao, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.809173","20220404","PTSD; conflict behaviors; gender; online aggressive behaviors; pandemic exposure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29599,""

"Evaluation of Stigma Related to Perceived Risk for Coronavirus-19 Transmission Relative to the Other Stigmatized Conditions Opioid Use and Depression","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic was initially characterized by misinformation and fear related to transmission that has been previously shown to produce stigma toward persons perceived to be at risk for transmission. This study evaluated perceptions toward scenarios with variable levels of perceived risk for COVID-19 acquisition, and compared stigma to COVID-19 to depression and opioid use disorder. Respondents (<i>N</i> = 280) from the United States completed a web-based survey 6 months after pandemic declaration. Questions included demographics and COVID-19 misconceptions, expected response to hypothetical scenarios with variable risk for COVID-19, and the Attribution Questionnaire-9 for COVID-19, depression, and opioid use disorder. Participants had several COVID-19 misconceptions, including that opioids increased immunity (63.6%), persons were more susceptible based upon racial/ethnic background (63.2%), and underlying health conditions did not influence risk (58.9%). Respondents were highly likely (64/100) to assume someone coughing had COVID-19 and the majority (93.5%) recommended quarantining persons with recent travel. However, the majority of respondents (&gt;70% in all cases) also believed they would not change their COVID-19-related behavior when interacting with persons of different racial, ethnic, and age backgrounds. Finally, persons with COVID-19 engendered greater pity, less fear, less blame, less anger, and more willingness to help from respondents relative to persons with opioid use disorder. Stigma ratings toward persons perceived at risk of transmitting COVID-19, collected soon after the onset of the pandemic, showed less evidence of stigma relative to persons with opioid use disorder despite pronounced misconceptions regarding COVID-19 risk. Data provide a foundation for additional research in this area.","Okobi, Bergeria, Huhn, Dunn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803998","20220404","COVID-19; depression; opioid; opioid use disorder; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29601,""
"Mapping Network Connectivity Among Symptoms of Depression and Pain in Wuhan Residents During the Late-Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Symptoms of depression and pain often overlap, and they negatively influence the prognosis and treatment outcome of both conditions. However, the comorbidity of depression and pain has not been examined using network analysis, especially in the context of a pandemic. Thus, we mapped out the network connectivity among the symptoms of depression and pain in Wuhan residents in China during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted from May 25, 2020 to June 18, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Participants' depressive and pain symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and a pain numeric rating scale (NRS), respectively. Network analyses were performed. In total, 2,598 participants completed all assessments. PHQ4 (fatigue) in the depression community showed the highest strength value, followed by PHQ6 (worthlessness) and PHQ2 (depressed or sad mood). PHQ4 (fatigue) was also the most key bridge symptom liking depression and pain, followed by PHQ3 (sleep difficulties). There were no significant differences in network global strength (females: 4.36 vs. males: 4.29; S = 0.075, <i>P</i> = 0.427), network structure-distribution of edge weights (M = 0.12, <i>P</i> = 0.541), and individual edge weights between male and female participants.

"Emotional Exhaustion of Burnout Among Medical Staff and Its Association With Mindfulness and Social Support: A Single Center Study During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","Although higher rates of burnout have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, the contribution of the modifiable factors is lesser-known. We investigated how the risk of emotional exhaustion was associated with mindfulness skills and social support in a single medical center in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional web survey on mental health for all staff of a national medical hospital from February to March 2021. We examined the association between self-rated emotional exhaustion and levels of mindfulness and social support using multivariate logistic regression. Of the 830 participants, signs of emotional exhaustion were observed in 261 (31%) individuals. Among those highly exposed to the virus at work, individuals with low levels of mindfulness and social support had significantly higher odds of emotional exhaustion [OR 3.46 (95% CI; 1.48-8.09), OR; 3.08 (95% CI; 1.33-7.13), respectively] compared to those with high levels. However, among those not highly exposed to the virus, individuals with both low and moderate levels of mindfulness had significantly higher odds of emotional exhaustion. [OR 3.33 (95% CI; 2.22-5.00), OR; 2.61 (95% CI; 1.73-3.94), respectively]. We found that factors associated with emotional exhaustion differed by exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Building mindfulness skills can help reduce the high burden placed on the staff. Additionally, increasing social support may be useful especially for workers highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2.","Sampei, Okubo, Sado, Piedvache, Mizoue, Yamaguchi, Morisaki","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.774919","20220404","burnout; emotional exhaustion; healthcare worker; mindfulness; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29603,""
"Isolation, Economic Precarity, and Previous Mental Health Issues as Predictors of PTSD Status in Females Living in Fort McMurray During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic represents an instance of collective trauma across the globe; as such, it is unique to our lifetimes. COVID-19 has made clear systemic disparities in terms of access to healthcare and economic precarity. Our objective was to examine the mental health repercussions of COVID-19 on adult females living in Fort McMurray, Canada in light of their unique circumstances and challenges. To investigate this issue, we analyzed responses gathered from an anonymous cross-section of online survey questionnaire responses gathered from females living in the Fort McMurray area (<i>n</i> = 159) during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 24-June 2, 2021). This included relevant demographic, mental health history, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as COVID-19 data. Chi-squared analysis was used to determine outcome relevance, and binary logistic regression was employed to generate a model of susceptibility to PTSD. 159 females completed the survey. The prevalence of putative PTSD in our sample was 40.8%. A regression analysis revealed 4 variables with significant, unique contributions to PTSD. These were: a <i>diagnosis of depression</i>; a <i>diagnosis of anxiety</i>; <i>job loss due to COVID-19</i>; and <i>lack of support from family and friends</i>. Specifically, women with a previous diagnosis of either depression or anxiety were ~4-5 times more likely to present with PTSD symptomatology in the wake of COVID-19 (OR = 3.846; 95% CI: 1.13-13.13 for depression; OR = 5.190; 95% CI: 1.42-19.00 for anxiety). Women who reported having lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic were ~5 times more likely to show evidence of probable PTSD (OR = 5.182; 95% CI: 1.08-24.85). Receiving inadequate support from family and friends made the individual approximately four times as likely to develop probable PTSD (OR = 4.258; 95% CI: 1.24-14.65), while controlling for the other variables in the regression model. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that volatility in factors such as social support, economic stability, and mental health work together to increase the probability of women developing PTSD in response to a collective trauma such as COVID-19.","Pazderka, Shalaby, Eboreime, Mao, Obuobi-Donkor, Agyapong, Oluwasina, Adu, Owusu, Sapara, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.837713","20220404","COVID-19; PTSD; collective trauma; isolation; precarity; resilience; retraumatization; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29604,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Supply in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease","In March 2020, the World Health organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. One year later, the direct and indirect burden of the COVID-19 pandemic become more visible. In this context, there is concern about the allocation of medical resources and medical treatment of other diseases than COVID-19. Particularly, patients with chronic diseases need constant medical and pharmacological treatment. Therefore, we evaluated a large cohort of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) regarding postponed medical appointments and their possibilities to receive medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 559 patients with ACHD (mean age 37.32 Ã‚Â± 11.98; 47% female). Clinical characteristics, answers to questionnaires concerning lifestyle, psychological well-being, addictive behavior and adherence were related to postponed medical appointments and limited access to medical care. One hundred and nine patients (19.5%) reported problems getting necessary medical treatment or visiting a physician. Higher anxiety levels (<i>p</i> = 0.004) emerged as the main factor associated with medical undertreatment. The main risk factors for postponement of least one medical appointment (<i>n</i> = 91) were higher depression (<i>p</i> = 0.013) and anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.05) symptoms as well as female sex (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.0001) and documented arrhythmias (<i>p</i> = 0.007) indicating a particular risk group of cardiovascular complications. In contrast, frequent physical activity identified patients at lower risk. In ACHD anxiety and depressive symptoms handicap patients to receive medical care. Postponement of medical appointments additionally relates to female sex and documented arrhythmias. The latter indicates that patients at high risk of adverse cardiac outcome avoid routine medical care. Our data may lead policy makers to develop strategies for the provision of medical services to particular vulnerable patient groups, and to optimize management of both future pandemics and daily routine.","Akkermann, Halling, LÃƒÂ¶ffler, Silber-Peest, KrÃƒÂ¼ger, Bleich, Bauersachs, Kahl, Westhoff-Bleck","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.812611","20220404","COVID-19; adherence; adult congenital heart disease (ACHD); depression and anxiety disorders; medical care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29605,""
"The Forgotten (Invisible) Healthcare Heroes: Experiences of Canadian Medical Laboratory Employees Working During the Pandemic","The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the stressors and coping strategies of medical laboratory technologists (MLTs) and assistants (MLAs) working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. In this descriptive qualitative study, we held two focus groups with MLTs and MLA who were working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus group sessions were transcribed verbatim followed by thematic analysis to develop codes and themes. A total of 13 participants across Ontario were involved in our study, which included one MLT (<i>n</i> = 7) group and one MLA (<i>n</i> = 6) MLA. Overall, the stressors and coping methods identified between both focus groups were consistent. Our results revealed four main themes: (1) COVID-19 contributing to the notable and existing staff shortage; (2) the pandemic reinforced that medical laboratory employees are forgotten within the healthcare system; (3) a poor work environment exacerbated by the pandemic; and (4) a resilient and passionate group. Rich descriptions explained the underlying issues related to the themes. MLTs and MLAs are critical members of the healthcare team and provide vital patient care services. This study explored their experiences working during the pandemic and offers timely recommendations to mitigate against occupational stressors.","Gohar, Nowrouzi-Kia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.854507","20220404","COVID-19; Canada; Ontario; medical laboratory professionals; mental health; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29606,""
"Role Stress and Psychological Distress Among Chinese Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model of Social Support and Burnout","Nurses are at high risk of psychological distress including stress, depression, and anxiety due to low personnel density and high work demand. Despite mounting evidence showing that role stress is a risk factor for nurses' psychological distress, the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relationship are less known. This study tests the mediation effect of burnout in the association between role stress and psychological distress, and whether this mediation is moderated by social support. A sample of 623 Chinese nurses were recruited from all hepatological surgery departments in Hunan Province and filled out an online questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographics, role stress, burnout, psychological distress, and social support. Mediation and moderation analyses were carried out in SPSS macro-PROCESS. Burnout partially mediated the positive association between role stress and psychological distress. Social support moderated the indirect effect of role stress on psychological distress via burnout, with the effect being stronger for nurses with low social support than those with high social support. These findings demonstrated how role stress contributed to nurses' psychological distress both directly and indirectly through burnout, and how this indirect effect was moderated by social support. The results provide important practical implications for future prevention and intervention programs to improve nurses' mental health from multiple aspects such as decreasing role stress and burnout while increasing social support.","Xiao, Zhang, Li, Xiao, Dai, Guo, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.812929","20220404","burnout; mediator; moderator; psychological distress; role stress; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29607,""
"A Year Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Deleterious Impact of Hormonal Contraception on Psychological Distress in Women","Women are more at risk than men of suffering from psychological distress during disease outbreaks. Interestingly, no biological factors have been studied to explain this disparity in such contexts. Sex hormone variations induced by hormonal contraceptives (HC) have been associated with mental health vulnerabilities. However, most studies have examined current effects of HC without considering whether a chronic modulation of sex hormone levels could induce long-lasting effects that persist after HC cessation. To date, the role of HC on psychological health in women during a disease outbreak is still unknown. We aimed to investigate both current and long-term effects of HC on psychological distress throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. At four time points during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020, September 2020, December 2020, March 2021), we collected self-reported data on psychological distress, assessing symptoms of post-traumatic stress [<i>via</i> the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)], symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress [<i>via</i> the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21)]. Linear mixed models were first used to compare men (<i>n</i> = 49), naturally cycling women (<i>n</i> = 73), and women using HC (<i>n</i> = 32) across time. To examine long-lasting effects of HC, exploratory analyses were restricted to women, comparing current HC users (<i>n</i> = 32), past users (<i>n</i> = 56), and never users (<i>n</i> = 17). The first model revealed that women taking HC reported stable post-traumatic stress symptoms across time, compared to naturally cycling women and men who showed a significant decrease from T1 to T2. HC users also reported greater DASS-21 total scores over time. Moreover, HC users reported higher stress and anxiety symptoms than men. In the second model, results showed that past HC users had similar anxiety levels as current HC users. These two groups reported significantly more anxiety symptoms than never users. HC users report increased distress during the pandemic relative to naturally cycling women and men. Our results also suggest a long-lasting effect of HC intake, highlighting the importance of considering both the current use of HC and its history. This could provide some insight into potential avenues for explaining why some women are prone to higher psychological distress than men.","Brouillard, Davignon, Fortin, Marin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.835857","20220404","COVID-19; distress; hormonal contraceptives; sex differences; sex hormones","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29608,""
"Gender Differences in Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms During the First Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Latin America and the Caribbean","Previous studies have suggested that the pandemic impact on mental health could vary according to gender. We aimed to evaluate the gender influence in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries in the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a secondary analysis employing the Facebook-COVID-19 Symptom Survey developed by the University of Maryland. We categorized gender as men, women, and non-binary. The outcomes were the presence of anxiety or depressive symptoms, measured with two adapted questions extracted from the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). We used generalized linear models from the Poisson family, considering the survey's complex sampling. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and explored interactions with gender using the adjusted Wald test. We included 1,338,320 adults from LAC countries; 48.0, 50.6, and 1.4% were men, women, and non-binary participants, respectively. The overall prevalence of anxiety or depressive symptoms was 44.8 and 46.6%, respectively. We found interactions between gender and the rest of the independent variables. In the non-binary group, the association between age and anxiety symptomatology was lost after an age of 55 years. Furthermore, whereas living in a town was associated with a lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomatology in men and women, this did not happen among non-binary individuals. Compliance with physical distancing was associated with a lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomatology among women (anxiety: PRa = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97-0.99; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, depression: PRa = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.95-0.97; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and only anxiety in non-binary participants (anxiety: PRa = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.88-0.98; <i>p</i> = 0.005). This was not evidenced among men participants (anxiety: PRa = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.96-1.01; <i>p</i> = 0.199, depression: PRa = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.96-1.00; <i>p</i> = 0.084). In addition, compliance with handwashing was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety symptomatology among men (PRa = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.05-1.11; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and women participants (PRa = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.05; <i>p</i> = 0.016). Approximately 4 out of 10 participants had anxiety or depressive symptoms. Women and non-binary gender people had more symptoms of anxiety or depression. The factors associated with these symptoms varied according to gender. It is essential to evaluate gender-related strategies to improve mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Herrera-AÃƒÂ±azco, Urrunaga-Pastor, Benites-Zapata, Bendezu-Quispe, Toro-Huamanchumo, Hernandez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.727034","20220404","COVID-19; Latin America; anxiety; depression; gender identity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29609,""
"Mediation-Moderation Links Between Mothers' ACEs, Mothers' and Children's Psychopathology Symptoms, and Maternal Mentalization During COVID-19","Research has suggested adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as a transdiagnostic risk factor for a variety of affective disorders. They are also linked with a parent's tendency toward affect dysregulation and hyperarousal, which may interfere with parenting and children's wellbeing. On the other hand, maternal mentalization can serve as a moderating factor that can help parents regulate their arousal, shielding children during adverse circumstances. We studied the mediated links between ACEs and mothers' and children's psychopathology symptoms during COVID-19 to determine whether maternal mentalization and the child's age moderate these links. Using results from 152 Israeli mothers of children aged 3-12 years recruited during the month-long lockdown in Israel, we documented that the mothers' ACEs were linked with increased risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms and with children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Moreover, as hypothesized, the mothers' symptoms of depression and anxiety mediated the links between their ACEs and their children's internalizing behaviors. In addition, the mothers' mentalization skills and, in the case of their depressive symptoms, their child's age, moderated these indirect links. For mothers of young children (3-6 years old) with higher mentalization levels, the link between the mothers' ACEs and the children's behavior problems was weaker compared to mothers with low mentalization levels. For mothers of older children (6-12 years old), and only in the case of maternal depressive symptoms, higher levels of maternal mentalization were linked with more internalizing behaviors. We discuss the potential clinical implications of the findings.","Dollberg, Hanetz-Gamliel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.837423","20220404","COVID-19; children's behavior problems; maternal ACEs; maternal anxiety; maternal depression; maternal mentalization; mind-mindedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29610,""
"In Times of Adversity: A Neuroscience Perspective on Stress, Health, and Implications for Society Post-pandemic","The relationship between chronic stress and chronic disease (including mental illness) is well established: HPA-axis hyperactivity leads to hormonal dysregulation of primary mediators (eg, glucocorticoids, cytokines, etc.), allostatic overload, and neurological degradation, followed by clinical manifestations of disease. Amid the largest public health crisis of the century lay a myriad of challenges pushing people beyond their limit. From experiencing loss of connection or dealing with loss of life to financial shocks of COVID-19 lockdowns or infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, stress is at an all-time high, threatening both brain and mental health at scale. Fortunately, there is a way forward: the neuroscience of resilience teaches us that it is possible to resist, recover, and redirect the brain from trauma to re-establish balance in the body and improve well-being. At the same time, health follows a social gradient: adverse and protective psychosocial factors are shaped by wider social and economic determinants of health. This paper argues the neurobiology of stress is not separate from health disparities linked to adverse factors (ie, stress) created by complex social and economic contexts. Therefore, the field of neuroscience is challenged to inform multi-context and multi-level approaches and engage with decision-makers to enact policies and interventions aimed at promoting the resilient element in a wider population health context. Undoubtedly, achieving such a goal for current and future generations to benefit and lead healthier lives requires a heroic effort from all key stakeholders. The cost of willful neglect to resolve these issues is too expensive.","Johnson","https://www.google.com/search?q=In+Times+of+Adversity:+A+Neuroscience+Perspective+on+Stress,+Health,+and+Implications+for+Society+Post-pandemic.","20220404","Covid-19; Glucocorticoids; Mental Health; Neuron; Population Health; Psychosocial; Resilience; Social Determinants of Health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29611,""
"Testing an Online Program to Foster Need Crafting During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a threat not only to individuals' physical health but also to their mental health. Self-Determination Theory assumes that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence promotes psychological well-being during destabilizing times. Yet, the pandemic seriously hampered individuals' opportunities to satisfy their needs. The current study provides a preliminary test of the effectiveness of a 7-session online program, LifeCraft, that promotes individuals' proactive attempts to uplift their need-based experiences (i.e., need crafting). Next to the effects on individuals' need crafting skills, we examined program-effects on adults' need-based experiences and mental health and we explored the role of participants' program engagement. An experimental study among 725 Belgian adults [<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51.67 (<i>range</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26 - 85); 68.55% female] was conducted, with an experimental condition of 252 and a control condition of 473 participants. At the level of the entire sample, there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of the program. There were only small immediate program-effects on need crafting and well-being. After taking into account the role of program engagement, findings showed that the program was more beneficial for participants who actively participated, with these participants reporting immediate and stable increases in need crafting, need satisfaction and well-being and decreases in need frustration. Further, changes in need crafting fully mediated changes in need-based experiences and well-being. To conclude, the findings provide initial evidence for the effectiveness of LifeCraft during the COVID-19 pandemic, with active participation being a prerequisite for the program to be effective.","Laporte, van den Bogaard, Brenning, Soenens, Vansteenkiste","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03012-2","20220404","Adults; COVID-19; E-Health; Need Crafting; Psychological Needs; Self-Determination Theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29612,""
"Perception of risk to COVID-19 and mental health indicators in workers of a Peruvian hospital: An analytical cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has caused great fear on health professionals and could affect their mental health, therefore it is important to determine the association between the perception of risk to COVID-19 and mental health in workers of a Peruvian hospital. Analytical cross-sectional study, through virtual survey. The dependent variables were: depression, anxiety and stress; The independent variable was perception of risk to COVID-19 and the covariates: sociodemographic, family, work and clinical data. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were found with a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of 5%. There was no association between risk perception and depression (adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.98 95% confidence interval: 0.89 to 1.08), anxiety (adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.94 95% confidence interval: 0.89 to 1.00), stress (adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.89 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.04). In the multivariate analysis, an association was found between depression with direct contact with the COVID-19 patient (adjusted prevalence ratio: 2.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 3.70) and with having a comorbidity (adjusted prevalence ratio: 2.56 95% confidence interval: 1.52 to 4.30); likewise, between anxiety with number of children (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.09 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.18), with direct contact with COVID-19 patient (adjusted prevalence ratio: 2.67 95% confidence interval 1.46 to 4.85) and having comorbidity (adjusted prevalence ratio: 2.00 95% confidence interval: 1.40 to 2.86); finally, between stress with direct contact with the COVID-19 patient (adjusted prevalence ratio: 2.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.20 to 6.83). No statistically significant association was found between risk perception and depression, anxiety, or stress. However, there was an association between depression, anxiety, and stress, each with direct contact with COVID-19 patients; between anxiety and depression, each with having comorbidities and, finally, anxiety with the number of children.

"The impact of shielding during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing","During the COVID-19 pandemic, older and clinically vulnerable people were instructed to shield or stay at home. Policies restricting social contact and human interaction pose a risk to mental health, but we know very little about the impact of shielding and stay-at-home orders on the mental health of older people. To understand the extent to which shielding contributes to poorer mental health. We used longitudinal data from wave 9 (2018/2019) and two COVID-19 sub-studies (June/July 2020; November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and constructed logistic and linear regression models to investigate associations between patterns of shielding during the pandemic and mental health, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic physical and mental health, and social isolation measures. By December 2020, 70% of older people were still shielding or staying at home, with 5% shielding throughout the first 9 months of the pandemic. Respondents who shielded experienced worse mental health. Although prior characteristics and lack of social interactions explain some of this association, even controlling for all covariates, those shielding throughout had higher odds of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (odds ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.22-2.87) and lower quality of life (ÃŽÂ² = -1.28, 95% CI -2.04 to -0.52) than those who neither shielded nor stayed at home. Shielding was also associated with increased anxiety. Shielding seems associated with worse mental health among older people, highlighting the need for policy makers to address the mental health needs of those who shielded, both in the current pandemic and for the future.","Di Gessa, Price","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.44","20220404","COVID-19; Depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; quality of life; shielding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29614,""

Associations between changes in symptoms of PWD and carers' concerns and mental health were investigated. About 44% of carers experienced anxiety and irritability and reported changes in behavioural and cognitive symptoms in PWD. These changes were associated with worse carers' mental health and concerns about faster disease progression (Ãâ€¡2 = 13.542, p &lt; 0.001).

"Changes to pubic hair removal practices during COVID-19 restrictions and impact on sexual intimacy","Pubic hair grooming (hair removal) has been linked to body image and sexual behaviour and, given the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on access to sexual partners and beauty salons, we explored these associations. Data derive from a cross-sectional online survey. Participants were aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or over and in Australia. All genders were included. We explored factors associated with changes to hair removal using logistic regression and analysed free-text responses using content analysis. Of 256 participants, 89 (34.8%) had changed their grooming practices. Multivariable analysis found that female participants had 4.5 times increased odds of changed grooming (95%CI 1.8, 11.0; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared with males. Individuals who reported 'more' or 'less' oral sex compared with the previous year were more likely to report increased odds of changed grooming (AOR 3.2; 95%CI: 1.4, 7.7; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009 and AOR: 3.3; 95%CI:1.6, 6.7; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, respectively). Most who changed their grooming practices said it had reduced, attributing this to lack of partners, inability to access beauticians, and the mental health effects of the pandemic. For most, this change had no impact on sexual behaviour or body image; however, some spoke of reduced sexual desire and willingness to receive oral sex. Partner expectations influenced whether reduced grooming had negative consequences, and women were more affected than men, highlighting a gendered impact.","Bourchier, Bittleston, Hocking, Coombe","https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2022.2056246","20220404","Australia; COVID-19; Pubic hair removal; oral sex","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29616,""
"Rural/urban differences in mental health and social well-being among older US adults in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic","This study seeks to identify differences in mental health and social well-being during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults by rural/urban location. We use data from the COVID-19 Coping Study, a nation-wide online study of U.S. adults aged 55 and older (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6,873) fielded during April-May, 2020. We investigated rural/urban differences in mental health (depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms) and social well-being (loneliness and social isolation); concern about COVID-19; and types of social participation (e.g. phone/video calls, visits). We also used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relationship of rurality with mental health, adjusting for socio-demographic correlates, COVID-19 history, and COVID-19 concern. We found similar prevalence of mental health and social well-being outcomes for rural and urban respondents. Rural respondents reported lower concern about COVID-19 and more frequent use of social media than urban respondents. Mental health and social well-being did not differ by rural/urban location in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, rural residents reported less concern about COVID-19 and more use of social media, potentially leading to greater risk of illness from the pandemic in later months.","Henning-Smith, Meltzer, Kobayashi, Finlay","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2060184","20220404","COVID-19; Rural; environmental factors/housing/rural-urban factors; loneliness; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29617,""

"Physical activity, mental and physical health during the Covid-19 outbreak: longitudinal predictors of suicide ideation in Germany","Suicide ideation has increased since the outbreak of Covid-19 in many countries. The present longitudinal study investigated potential predictors of suicide ideation. Data of 406 participants from Germany (age <i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27.69, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.88) were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020 (baseline, BL) and in spring 2021 (follow-up, FU). The current results reveal a significant increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress between 2020 and 2021. Positive mental health (PMH), sense of control, and physical health significantly decreased. Depression symptoms (BL), PMH (BL), and consciously enhanced physical activity since the pandemic outbreak (FU) significantly predicted 12-month suicide ideation (FU). In a moderated mediation analysis, the positive relationship between depression and suicide ideation was significantly mediated by PMH. Consciously enhanced physical activity significantly moderated the negative association between PMH and suicide ideation. The context of Covid-19 could negatively impact mental health and physical health. This might increase the risk for suicide ideation. However, PMH and physical activity might serve as protective factors. The protective effect of physical activity could be especially important in people with high depression symptoms and low PMH, such as clinical patients. Potential ways of how PMH and physical activity could be enhanced in the Covid-19 context to prevent suicide ideation are discussed.","Brailovskaia, Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene, Kazlauskas, Gelezelyte, Teismann, Margraf","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-022-01708-0","20220404","Covid-19; Mental health; Physical activity; Physical health; Suicide ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29619,""
"Has the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown worsened eating disorders symptoms among patientsÃ‚Â with eating disorders? A systematic review","During the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, general medical complications have received the most attention, and few studies have examined the association between the COVID-19 lockdown and eating disorders (ED). This study aimed to investigate the impact of the coronavirus lockdowns on ED symptoms severity and summarize factors associated with lockdowns that led to changes in eating disorders. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies measuring the impact of coronavirus lockdowns on ED symptoms. A total of 132 studies were retrieved,Ã‚Â after abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 21 papers were full-text screened, and 11 eligible papersÃ‚Â were identified. Factors associated with symptomatic deterioration in ED patients during COVID-19 lockdowns included disruption of lifestyle routine, social isolation, reduced access to usual support networks, limited or no access to healthcare and mental care services, and social anxiety. Overall, the pandemic lockdowns were associated with worsening of eating disorders.This triggering environment can lead to increased anxiety and depression symptoms, change in dietary habits, and eventually result in worsening eating disorder symptoms.","Gao, Bagheri, Furuya-Kanamori","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-022-01704-4","20220404","anorexia nervosa; binge eating disorder; bulimia nervosa; coronavirus; eating disorders; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29620,""
"Reading Emotions in Faces With and Without Masks Is Relatively Independent of Extended Exposure and Individual Difference Variables","The ability to read emotions in faces helps humans efficiently assess social situations. We tested how this ability is affected by aspects of familiarization with face masks and personality, with a focus on emotional intelligence (measured with an ability test, the MSCEIT, and a self-report scale, the SREIS). To address aspects of the current pandemic situation, we used photos of not only faces <i>per se</i> but also of faces that were partially covered with face masks. The sample (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49), the size of which was determined by an <i>a priori</i> power test, was recruited in Germany and consisted of healthy individuals of different ages [<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24.8 (18-64) years]. Participants assessed the emotional expressions displayed by six different faces determined by a 2 (sex)Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°3 (age group: young, medium, and old) design. Each person was presented with six different emotional displays (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, and sad) with or without a face mask. Accuracy and confidence were lower with masks-in particular for the emotion disgust (very often misinterpreted as anger) but also for happiness, anger, and sadness. When comparing the present data collected in July 2021 with data from a different sample collected in May 2020, when people first started to familiarize themselves with face masks in Western countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not detect an improvement in performance. There were no effects of participants' emotional intelligence, sex, or age regarding their accuracy in assessing emotional states in faces for unmasked or masked faces.","Carbon, Held, SchÃƒÂ¼tz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.856971","20220404","COVID-19 pandemic; accuracy; cover; emotion perception; emotional intelligence; face mask; face perception; personality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29621,""
"Psychological Distress, Anxiety, Family Violence, Suicidality, and Wellbeing in Pakistan During the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study","The purpose of this study was to draw the attention toward the implications of COVID-19 and the related restrictions imposed worldwide especially in Pakistan. The primary objective was to highlight the levels of psychological distress, anxiety, family violence, suicidality, and well-being due to COVID-19 and the secondary objective was to associate it to social demographic factors. It is designed as a cross-sectional study by employing an online questionnaire in the English language and obtaining responses using a snowball sampling technique. We used three validated measures including Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) index and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). A sample of 420 participants was recruited from across Pakistan, with most participants were females (79%), students (89.8%) and belonging to Punjab (54%). Nearly one-fourth of the participants (23.8%) scored above the minimum value set for moderate or high psychological distress (K10 &gt; 12). There was a higher prevalence of distress among females and resident of province Punjab. The majority of individuals reported that they were living with their family (94.5%) and more than half (52.6%) were neutral regarding their satisfaction with their living conditions. 40.5% believed that the lockdown has had a negative impact on their mental health. 31.4% have reported that they themselves have experienced abuse from a family member. 48.6% scored high on the GAD-7 scale and low wellbeing score was found among 80.2%. Students were found to be more vulnerable to mental illness and anxiety. With the lockdown restrictions, psychosocial distress has become prevalent in Pakistan.","Yasmin, Jatoi, Abbasi, Asghar, Siddiqui, Nauman, Khattak, Alam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.830935","20220404","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; psychological distress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29622,""
"COVID-19 Adaptive Interventions: Implications for Wellbeing and Quality-of-Life","Social bonds may assist in cultivating a more positive attitude to life through commonly shared meanings about the COVID-19 pandemic. The key challenge, however, is how to foster social bonds meeting the changing demands in a post pandemic world. Yet, it is in the middle of a crisis that the conversation needs to start about how to strategically plan for the recovery. This is important not only in the current pandemic, but also in a post pandemic world. Reinforcing or fostering new social bonds is likely to bring positive experiences. The latter is central to human health and wellbeing, and has potential to contribute greatly in enhancing people's quality of life. In an attempt to foster place social bonding in the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond to subsequently contribute to wellbeing, this paper develops and proposes a new conceptual framework suggesting the need for adaptive social bonding interventions in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This is an essential measure to manage the significant impacts on our global health services due to a decline in people's mental health in addition to COVID-19 physical impacts. The paper discusses how promoting adaptive social bonding interventions (psycho-socio, digital and nature social bonding) can make people more resilient. It further discusses how they can be empowered psychologically, socially, and emotionally in the current challenging times. The conceptual framework posits that social bonding interventions can assist in maintaining better mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing and discusses how these wellbeing outcomes may also be experienced post the pandemic. This has important benefits and is of relevance to governments, policy makers and healthcare professionals in delivering better health care and equipping people with coping mechanisms both throughout the pandemic and in the long run.","Ramkissoon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.810951","20220404","COVID-19 pandemic; adaptive interventions; digital social bonding; nature social bonding; place attachment; psycho-social; quality-of-life; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29623,""
"Building the Positive Emotion-Resilience-Coping Efficacy Model for COVID-19 Pandemic","The world faces unprecedented challenges because of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Existing theories of human flourishing and coping efficacy are too broad and general to address COVID-19 unprecedented mental health challenges. This study examined two main objectives, first the associations between psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) and psychological wellbeing of this phenomenon, and second, moderating and mediating factors emotions, resilience and coping self-efficacy. A nationwide survey was carried out on a Malaysian sample (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°920). Participants completed an on-line survey that assessed psychological outcomes, psychological wellbeing, positive-negative emotions, resilience, and coping self-efficacy. The relationship between psychological states and psychological wellbeing was successfully mediated by coping self-efficacy (direct effects of -0.31 to -0.46 at <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and resilience (direct effects of -0.06 to -0.26 at <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01).

"A Perspective on Implementation of Technology-Driven Exergames for Adults as Telerehabilitation Services","A major concern of public health authorities is to also encourage adults to be exposed to enriched environments (sensory and cognitive-motor activity) during the pandemic lockdown, as was recently the case worldwide during the COVID-19 outbreak. Games for adults that require physical activity, known as exergames, offer opportunities here. In particular, the output of the gaming industry nowadays offers computer games with extended reality (XR) which combines real and virtual environments and refers to human-machine interactions generated by computers and wearable technologies. For example, playing the game in front of a computer screen while standing or walking on a force plate or treadmill allows the user to react to certain infrastructural changes and obstacles within the virtual environment. Recent developments, optimization, and minimizations in wearable technology have produced wireless headsets and sensors that allow for unrestricted whole-body movement. This makes the virtual experience more immersive and provides the opportunity for greater engagement than traditional exercise. Currently, XR serves as an umbrella term for current immersive technologies as well as future realities that enhance the experience with features that produce new controllable environments. Overall, these technology-enhanced exergames challenge the adult user and modify the experience by increasing sensory stimulation and creating an environment where virtual and real elements interact. As a therapy, exergames can potentially create new environments and visualizations that may be more ecologically valid and thus simulate real activities of daily living that can be trained. Furthermore, by adding telemedicine features to the exergame, progress over time can be closely monitored and feedback provided, offering future opportunities for cognitive-motor assessment. To more optimally serve and challenge adults both physically and cognitively over time in future lockdowns, there is a need to provide long-term remote training and feedback. Particularly related to activities of daily living that create opportunities for effective and lasting rehabilitation for elderly and sufferers from chronic non-communicable diseases (CNDs). The aim of the current review is to envision the remote training and monitoring of physical and cognitive aspects for adults with limited mobility (due to disability, disease, or age), through the implementation of concurrent telehealth and exergame features using XR and wireless sensor technologies.","Meulenberg, de Bruin, Marusic","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.840863","20220404","dual-task; exergames; functionality; mental health; tele rehabilitation; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29625,""
"Study of Mental Health Status of the Resident Physicians in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Investigating the mental health status of Chinese resident physicians during the 2019 new coronavirus outbreak. A cluster sampling method was adopted to collect all China-wide resident physicians during the epidemic period as the research subjects. The Symptom Checklist-90 self-rating scale was used to assess mental health using WeChat electronic questionnaires. In total, 511 electronic questionnaires were recovered, all of which were valid. The negative psychological detection rate was 93.9% (480/511). Among the symptoms on the self-rating scale, more than half of the Chinese resident physicians had mild to moderate symptoms of mental unhealthiness, and a few had asymptomatic or severe unhealthy mental states. In particular, the detection rate of abnormality was 88.3% (451/511), obsessive-compulsive symptoms was 90.4% (462/511), the sensitive interpersonal relationship was 90.6% (463/511), depression abnormality was 90.8% (464)/511), anxiety abnormality was 88.3% (451/511), hostility abnormality was 85.3% (436/511), terror abnormality was 84.9% (434/511), paranoia abnormality was 86.9% (444/511), psychotic abnormalities was 89.0% (455/511), and abnormal sleeping and eating status was 90.8% (464/511).

"Psychophysical Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Same-Sex Couples' Conflict: The Mediating Effect of Internalized Sexual Stigma","Research on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on same-sex relationships is limited. The present study aimed at analyzing the association between the psychophysical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and same-sex couples' conflict, also considering the potential mediating effect of internalized sexual stigma (ISS). For this purpose, psychophysical challenges and couples' conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic, ISS, age, biological sex, sexual orientation, relationship duration, religiosity, involvement in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) associations, sexual satisfaction, and interpersonal partner violence were assessed in an Italian sample of 232 LGB people engaged in a same-sex relationship (aged 18-45 years; <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 28.68, <i>SD</i> = 6.91). The results indicated that the psychophysical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with couples' conflict, and ISS mediated this relationship. Among the covariates considered, only sexual satisfaction was associated with couples' conflict. The findings suggest that ISS, over and above the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychophysical health, triggered conflict within same-sex relationships. Studying the role of ISS in various relational and social contexts is important, as ISS may have an adverse effect on the mental health of sexual minority people. We recommend that more efforts be made to improve research on the LGB population during the public health response to the COVID-19 emergency, because the paucity of studies underlines the invisibility of this population in many domains, including the domain of romantic relationships. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.","Pistella, Isolani, Ioverno, Laghi, Baiocco","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.860260","20220404","COVID-19; couplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conflict; health; internalized sexual stigma; sexual minorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29627,""

Specifically, from the third week of the mandatory quarantine through the two following weeks. Analysis of the responses of 1,458 members of the health personnel was done on a questionnaire on healthcare workers concerns regarding the care of patients with coronavirus, indicators of depression, anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and coping. The psychological indicators that were considered presented differences between the evaluated periods. Perceived concerns about the possibility of infecting loved ones and infecting themselves were greatest in the periods after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the perception of how the work environment worsened and how lack of sleep interfered with their work was also higher in periods 2 and 3. The same results were found in the indicators of depression, anxiety, and intolerance of uncertainty. Finally, the indicators of high tension and concurrent lack of emotional control, which was greater in the last periods evaluated, were also expressed in the coping strategies (showing emotional lability, only contained by hypercontrol). The differences found in the psychological indicators between the evaluated periods support the need for early psychological care of health personnel which should be a priority of public health and a fundamental fact to increase its immediate effectiveness in the care of infected patients.","Richaud, Eidman, Vargas Rubilar, Lemos, Mesurado, Klos, Rodriguez de Behrends, Muzio","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.742810","20220404","COVID-19; comparison of perceived concerns according to quarantine stage; healthcare workers; mental wellbeing; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29628,""
"A Grassroots Approach to Addressing the MCH Workforce Crisis","Following predictions of a dramatic drop in the developmental-behavioral healthcare workforce by 2023 due to retirement and/or burnout, much has been written about ways to replenish or sustain needed personnel. To date, we continue to have a crisis of not enough new clinicians being attracted to the field to replenish the third of the workforce that is expected to retire. Recent concerns about increased clinician mental health problems and burnout in the wake of COVID-19 and other societal stressors add further complexity and urgency.

"Becoming a Mother During COVID-19 Pandemic: How to Protect Maternal Mental Health Against Stress Factors","During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were an increasing prevalence of perinatal psychiatric symptoms, such as perinatal anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders. This growth could be caused by a range of direct and indirect stress factors related to the virus and changes in health, social and economic organization. In this review, we explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health, and propose a range of hypothesis about their etiological mechanisms. We suggest first that the fear of being infected or infected others (intrauterine transmission, passage of the virus from mother to baby during childbirth, infection through breast milk), and the uncertainty about the effect of the virus on the fetuses and infants may have played a key-role to weakening the mental health of mothers. We also highlight that public health policies such as lockdown, limiting prenatal visits, social distancing measures, and their many associated socio-economic consequences (unemployment, loss of income, and domestic violence) may have been an additional challenge for perinatal mental health. Ground on these hypotheses, we finally purpose some recommendations to protect perinatal mental health during a pandemic, including a range of specific support based on digital technologies (video consultations, phone applications) during pregnancy and the postpartum period.","Bottemanne, Vahdat, Jouault, Tibi, Joly","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.764207","20220404","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; maternal health; mental health; neonatal health; perinatal psychiatry; perinatality; postpartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29630,""
"Prevalence &amp;Ã‚Â Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence During COVID-19: A Rapid Review","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments enacted a range of public health measures aimed at preventing the spread of the virus. These measures resulted in school closures, social isolation, and job loss, which all contributed to increased psychosocial stress, particularly among families with pre-existing vulnerability factors. Given the relationship between increased psychosocial stress and intimate partner violence (IPV), this rapid review investigated change in the prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization during the first six months of the pandemic. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane COVID-19 registry were reviewed. This search resulted in 255 unique results, of which 24 studies were included. There were 19 studies that examined changes in the rate of IPV from before the COVID-19 pandemic to during the pandemic. Of the studies examining changes in the rate of IPV, 11 found a significant increase. Key vulnerability factors contributing to the increase include low socioeconomic status, unemployment, a personal or familial COVID-19 diagnosis, family mental illness, or overcrowding. Six studies examined whether the presence of children in the home was associated with IPV, but the direction of this relationship was inconsistent. This review finds preliminary evidence of a relationship between COVID-19 induced stressors, pre-existing vulnerabilities, and increased IPV, which present important implications for policy and practice.","McNeil, Hicks, Yalcinoz-Ucan, Browne","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-022-00386-6","20220404","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Family violence; Intimate partner violence; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29631,""
"Psychological Distress Was Still Serious Among Anesthesiologists Under the Post COVID-19 Era","This study aims to evaluate the psychological status and the attitudes toward the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among anesthesiologists. We expected to analyze related factors and offer them some strategies to prevent and manage psychological issues under the post COVID-19 era. Based on the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), an online survey was designed and conducted among anesthesiologists in Shaanxi, China. Participants were asked to complete a validated questionnaire voluntarily. The following tests were performed: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Primary Care Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD), and the attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 795 anesthesiologists completed the survey, the majority of them were female, young and middle-aged, well educated, and married. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this sample were 26.5%, 35.5%, and 19.9%, respectively. Longer daily working time, concomitant basic chronic disease, and COVID-19 exposure were extracted as risk factors for the psychological symptoms, while vaccination, elder age, and married status were negatively associated with them.

"Pembrolizumab versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in completely resected stage IIB or IIC melanoma (KEYNOTE-716): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial","Pembrolizumab prolongs progression-free and overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma and recurrence-free survival in resected stage III disease. KEYNOTE-716 assessed pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with completely resected, high-risk, stage II melanoma. We report results from the planned first and second interim analyses for recurrence-free survival. In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, involving 160 academic medical centres and hospitals in 16 countries (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA), patients aged 12 years or older with newly diagnosed, completely resected stage IIB or IIC melanoma (TNM stage T3b or T4 with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy) were recruited. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1), in blocks of four and stratified by T-category (3b, 4a, and 4b) and paediatric status (age 12-17 years vs Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years), using an interactive response technology system to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg (2 mg/kg in paediatric patients) or placebo every 3 weeks for 17 cycles or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. All patients, clinical investigators, and analysts were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (defined as time from randomisation to recurrence or death) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all patients randomly assigned to treatment). The primary endpoint was met if recurrence-free survival was significantly improved for pembrolizumab versus placebo at either the first interim analysis (after approximately 128 patients had events) or second interim analysis (after 179 patients had events) under multiplicity control. Safety was assessed in all patients randomly assigned to treatment who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03553836, and is closed to accrual. Between Sept 23, 2018, and Nov 4, 2020, 1182 patients were screened, of whom 976 were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n=487) or placebo (n=489; ITT population). The median age was 61 years (IQR 52-69) and 387 (40%) patients were female and 589 (60%) were male. 874 (90%) of 976 patients were White and 799 (82%) were not Hispanic or Latino. 483 (99%) of 487 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 486 (99%) of 489 in the placebo group received assigned treatment. At the first interim analysis (data cutoff on Dec 4, 2020; median follow-up of 14Ã‚Â·4 months [IQR 10Ã‚Â·2-18Ã‚Â·7] in the pembrolizumab group and 14Ã‚Â·3 months [10Ã‚Â·1-18Ã‚Â·7] in the placebo group), 54 (11%) of 487 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 82 (17%) of 489 in the placebo group had a first recurrence of disease or died (hazard ratio [HR] 0Ã‚Â·65 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·46-0Ã‚Â·92]; p=0Ã‚Â·0066). At the second interim analysis (data cutoff on June 21, 2021; median follow-up of 20Ã‚Â·9 months [16Ã‚Â·7-25Ã‚Â·3] in the pembrolizumab group and 20Ã‚Â·9 months [16Ã‚Â·6-25Ã‚Â·3] in the placebo group), 72 (15%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 115 (24%) in the placebo group had a first recurrence or died (HR 0Ã‚Â·61 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·45-0Ã‚Â·82]). Median recurrence-free survival was not reached in either group at either assessment timepoint. At the first interim analysis, grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78 (16%) of 483 patients in the pembrolizumab groups versus 21 (4%) of 486 in the placebo group. At the first interim analysis, four patients died from an adverse event, all in the placebo group (one each due to pneumonia, COVID-19-related pneumonia, suicide, and recurrent cancer), and at the second interim analysis, one additional patient, who was in the pembrolizumab group, died from an adverse event (COVID-19-related pneumonia). No deaths due to study treatment occurred. Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for up to approximately 1 year for stage IIB or IIC melanoma resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death versus placebo, with a manageable safety profile.

"Social Isolation, Cognitive Function, and Depression Among Chinese Older Adults: Examining Internet Use as a Predictor and a Moderator","Despite the theoretical and practical interest in Internet use among older adults, evidence examining the impacts of Internet use on late-in-life health is limited. This study examines how Internet use affects depression and cognitive function in older adults and investigates if Internet use moderates the relationship between social isolation and depression/cognitive function. We performed regression analyses using data came from the second wave of the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey of 2016. Our final sample featured 8,835 older adults. The results show 11.4% of Chinese older adults often used the Internet to engage in at least one activity. Internet use was negatively associated with depression, but it was positively related to cognitive function. Socially isolated older adults were more likely to have more depressive symptoms and higher level of cognitive function. There was also an interaction effect between Internet use and social isolation on depression/cognitive function. The negative effect of social isolation was stronger for older adults who used the Internet less. The moderating effect of Internet use was significant for both males and females. However, among those who used the Internet more, the depression levels of socially isolated male participants were much lower than female participants. Our results reveal the importance of considering Internet use in buffering the negative effects of social isolation and the associated health burdens for aging populations. Recommendations for service practice and future research are discussed.","Li, Bai, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.809713","20220404","Internet use; cognitive function; depression; older adults; social isolation; Aged; COVID-19; Cognition; Depression; Female; Humans; Internet Use; Male; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29634,""
"Characteristics of and Experience Among People Who Use Take-Home Naloxone in SkÃƒÂ¥ne County, Sweden","Opioid overdose related injury or death can be prevented by bystander naloxone administration. For naloxone to be present when and where overdoses occur, opioid prevention education and naloxone distribution (OPEND) must be established on a broad level. This is the 30-month follow-up of the first multi-site naloxone project in Sweden, implemented at 31 sites in the County of SkÃƒÂ¥ne 2018. To address participant characteristics and factors associated with returning for naloxone refill and with having used naloxone for overdose reversal. An additional aim was to describe self-reported reasons for naloxone refill and overdose experiences. Data were collected during June 2018-December 2020 through questionnaires at baseline and upon naloxone refill of the initial and subsequent naloxone kit. Descriptive statistics was used to address participant characteristics, those returning for naloxone refill and reporting overdose reversal. Chi-2 test was used for variable comparison between groups. Factors associated with overdose reversals were examined by logistic regression analysis. Reasons for naloxone refill, overdose situation and management were presented descriptively. Among 1,079 study participants, 22% (<i>n</i> = 235) returned for naloxone refill, of which 60% (<i>n</i> = 140) reported a total of 229 overdose reversals. Reversals were more likely to be reported by participants trained at needle exchange programs (NEPs) [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 5.18, 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 3.38-7.95)], with previous experience of own (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.03-2.58) or witnessed (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.05-4.29) overdose, or who had used sedatives during the last 30 days before initial training (AOR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.04-2.33). A majority of overdoses reportedly occurred in private settings (62%), where the victim was a friend (35%) or acquaintance (31%) of the rescuer. Participants with own risk factors associated with overdose (e.g., injection use, concomitant use of benzodiazepines and previous experience of own overdose) were more likely to report administering naloxone for overdose reversal. Overdose management knowledge was high. The findings indicate that implementation of multi-site OPEND reaches individuals at particularly high risk of own overdose in settings with limited previous harm reduction strategies and favors a further scaling up of naloxone programs in similar settings.","Troberg, Isendahl, BlomÃƒÂ©, Dahlman, HÃƒÂ¥kansson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.811001","20220404","harm reduction; naloxone; needle exchange programs; opioid substitution treatment; opioids; overdose management; prevention programs; substance use; COVID-19; Humans; Naloxone; Narcotic Antagonists; Opioid-Related Disorders; Sweden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29635,""
"Perceived Neighborhood Environment Impacts on Health Behavior, Multi-Dimensional Health, and Life Satisfaction","The impacts of perceived neighborhood environment on adults' health and life satisfaction have drawn increasing academic attention. However, previous studies usually examine multi-dimensional (physical, mental, and perceived) health and life satisfaction separately, and few studies dealt with them simultaneously. Moreover, limited research revealed the mechanisms behind the effects of perceived neighborhood environment on health and life satisfaction, as well as how such effects are moderated by socio-demographics. Therefore, employing the 2016 China Family Panel Study Dataset and using structural equation modeling, this study delves into the complicated relationships among perceived neighborhood environment, health behavior, health outcomes (i.e., body mass index, self-rated health status, and depression), and life satisfaction. Notably, it considers mediation and moderation simultaneously. It finds: (1) Better perceived neighborhood environment significantly promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior, smoking, and drinking; (2) Health behavior fully mediates the effects of perceived neighborhood environment on health; (3) Perceived neighborhood environment significantly affects life satisfaction both directly and indirectly (through health behavior and health outcomes); (4) Socio-demographics moderate the above relationships. This study disentangles the complicated impacts of perceived neighborhood environment on adults' multi-dimensional health and life satisfaction, thus providing policy makers and practitioners with nuanced knowledge for intervention.","Liu, Yang, Xiao, Tao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.850923","20220404","China; health behavior; health outcome; life satisfaction; perceived neighborhood environment; structural equation modeling; COVID-19; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Personal Satisfaction; Residence Characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29636,""
"Psychometric Properties of the Chinese Version of the Brief State Rumination Inventory","State rumination, unlike trait rumination which is described as a persistent and stable response style, is usually triggered by a specific stressful event and causes negative emotions within a short period of time. The measurement methods of trait rumination, such as the ruminative response scale (RRS), are therefore not fully applicable to state rumination. Recently, researchers have developed the brief state rumination inventory (BSRI) to characterize state rumination, addressing the gap in the field of accurate measurement of state rumination. To develop such an effective tool in the Chinese context, we developed a Chinese version of the BSRI and tested its psychometric properties. Two studies were conducted to address the research goal. In Study 1, we recruited 512 subjects, each of whom completed the Chinese version of the BSRI, RRS, emotional regulation questionnaire (ERQ), depression-anxiety-stress scale (DASS), and positive and negative affect scale (PANAS). Results showed that the scores of the BSRI were positively correlated with all other scale scores (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.001), and the correlation with the RRS was the highest, indicating that the BSRI showed good convergent validity. Additionally, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the Chinese version of the BSRI was 0.93. Study 2 aimed to examine the ecological validity of the Chinese version of the BSRI. We recruited another 54 subjects who were randomly divided into two groups, with 27 in the rumination induction group and 27 in the distraction group, and recorded the BSRI scores of the two groups before and after a specific experiment. We found there was a significant increase in BSRI scores after rumination induction (<i>t</i> = 3.91, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while there was no significant difference in the concrete distraction group before and after the experiment (<i>t</i> = 0.70, <i>p</i> = 0.48). In sum, the Chinese version of the BSRI showed good reliability and validity for assessing state rumination in the general Chinese population.","Wang, Song, Lee, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.824744","20220404","Chinese; reliability; state rumination; trait-like rumination; validity; COVID-19; China; Humans; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29637,""
"Influence of Different Exercise Types on Health-Related Quality-of-Life in Men With Depressive Disorder in South Korea","The aim of the study was to determine the influence of different exercise types on health-related quality of life (QOL) in men with depressive disorder (DD) in South (S) Korea. The data of 385 men aged 19 with DD were collected in S. Korea. The Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) index and Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) questionnaires were used to establish the purpose of this study. Furthermore, the complex sampling model was applied to investigate the influence of different exercise types on health-related QOL in participants. When reviewing the outcomes, the strength exercise and walking had significant influences on health-related QOL in men with DD in S. Korea. However, the flexibility exercise did not have a significant influence on them. Based on the results, strength exercise and walking were effective exercise types to increase levels of health-related QOL in men with DD in S. Korea.","Kim, Koo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.811168","20220404","South Korea; depressive disorder; exercise; health-related quality of life; men; Adult; COVID-19; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Male; Nutrition Surveys; Quality of Life; Republic of Korea; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","",29638,""
