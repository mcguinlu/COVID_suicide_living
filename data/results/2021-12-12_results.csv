"Mental health indicators in Sweden over a 12-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of people globally and is expected to have profound effects on mental health. Yet, self-reported large-scale online surveys on mental health are still relatively uncommon. Here we aim to describe the mental health burden experienced in Sweden using baseline data of the Omtanke2020 Study. Method Self-reported baseline data collected over a 12-month period (June 9, 2020-June 8, 2021) from the longitudinal online survey of the Omtanke2020 Study including 27,950 adults in Sweden. Participants were volunteers or actively recruited through existing cohorts and after providing informed consent responded to monthly online questionnaires on socio-demographics, mental and physical health, COVID-19 infection, and impact. Poisson regression was fitted to assess the relative risk of high mental health burden (depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific PTSD). Result The overall proportion of persons with high level of symptoms was 15.6%, 9.5% and 24.5% for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific PTSD, respectively. Overall, 43.4% of the participants had significant, clinically relevant symptoms for at least one mental health outcome and 7.3% had significant symptoms for all three outcomes. We also observed differences in the prevalence of these symptoms across strata of sex, age, recruitment type, COVID-19 status, region, and seasonality. Conclusion While the proportion of persons with high mental health burden remains higher than in pre-pandemic publications, our estimates are lower than previously reported levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the pandemic in Sweden and elsewhere.","AnikÃ³ Lovik; Juan GonzÃ¡lez-HijÃ³n; Anna K.

"Influence of post-COVID-19 deconfinement on psychiatric visits to the emergency department","Objective During the deconfinement period after the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number and characteristics of psychiatric visits changed in our emergency department (ED). We aimed to assess changes in the number of visits and characterize the profiles of these patients. Methods In this retrospective observational study, we examined the number of psychiatric ED visits and their proportion among the total number of ED visits. We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years. Results The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013). Moreover, during deconfinement, more visits (80%) were without an acute intoxication compared to past years (58.5%; p = 0.031). Also, in the deconfinement period, more visits lacked a follow-up consultation organized at discharge (40%) compared to the historical period (25%, p = 0.036). Conclusions The deconfinement period after the first wave COVID-19 changed the number and type of psychiatric emergency medicine consultations at our hospital, suggesting a psychiatric impact of confinement during this pandemic. These findings will be of interest to practitioners and politicians in the coming months.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.05.014","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-12","",23531,""
