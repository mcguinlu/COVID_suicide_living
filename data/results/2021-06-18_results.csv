"AIDS and COVID-19 infections: impact on vulnerable Indian population","The co-existence of AIDS and COVID-19 infections is poorly understood. India, the second-most populous nation, is home to 23.49 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS, and the country has no specific policy in this regard. COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant burden on these vulnerable populations in terms of financial aid, availing health services, and psychological issues (fear, anxiety, depression). Therefore, India needs to have a specific policy for these vulnerable populations to cope with any such pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100903","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-18","",15068,""
"Sleep problems during COVID-19 pandemic and itsâ€™ association to psychological distress: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The emerging novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become one of the leading cause of deaths worldwide in 2020. The present systematic review and meta-analysis estimated the magnitude of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and its relationship with psychological distress. Methods Five academic databases (Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Embase) were searched. Observational studies including case-control studies and cross-sectional studies were included if relevant data relationships were reported (i.e., sleep assessed utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or Insomnia Severity Index). All the studies were English, peer-reviewed papers published between December 2019 and February 2021. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020181644. Findings 168 cross-sectional, four case-control, and five longitudinal design papers comprising 345,270 participants from 39 countries were identified. The corrected pooled estimated prevalence of sleep problems were 31% among healthcare professionals, 18% among the general population, and 57% among COVID-19 patients (all p-values < 0.05). Sleep problems were associated with depression among healthcare professionals, the general population, and COVID-19 patients, with Fisher's Z scores of -0.28, -0.30, and -0.36, respectively. Sleep problems were positively (and moderately) associated with anxiety among healthcare professionals, the general population, and COVID-19 patients, with Fisher's z scores of 0.55, 0.48, and 0.49, respectively. Interpretation Sleep problems appear to have been common during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, sleep problems were found to be associated with higher levels of psychological distress. With the use of effective programs treating sleep problems, psychological distress may be reduced. Vice versa, the use of effective programs treating psychological distress, sleep problems may be reduced. Funding The present study received no funding.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100916","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-18","",15069,""

"Mental wellness among psychiatric-mental health nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychiatric nursing providers and their unique challenges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well-represented in the literature. Therefore, this study sought to describe mental well-being of psychiatric nurses, and sought to elucidate factors related to mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized cross-sectional survey methodology to evaluate burnout, mental wellness, COVID-related anxiety, professional fulfillment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms among psychiatric nurses. There was a total of 151 respondents. A linear regression model was employed to identify predictors of mental wellness. The final regression model included the following predictors: depressive symptoms, burnout, professional fulfillment, and educational status. These predictors together accounted for 73% of the variance for the outcome variable of mental well-being.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.05.003","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-18","",15072,""
