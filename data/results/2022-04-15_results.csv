"Psychological Impact in Covid Positive Pregnant Females","Apart from the physical effects of Covid-19, psychological effects are seen as well in the general population. In pregnant females, psychological impact leads to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Due to limited data, the mental health of COVID-19 positive pregnant patients is not clear especially in relation to isolation in hospital, treatment, time and mode of delivery. Objective: To determine and compare frequency of anxiety and depression in pregnant women with and without COVID-19. Material and Methods: It was a comparative cross-sectional study that was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, SGRH, Lahore. 60 pregnant females were enrolled and underwent nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and had HRCT to determine Covid-19 status. HADS was applied on all pregnant females to assess depression and anxiety and findings were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The mean age, gestational age, anxiety scores and depression scores were 29.93Â±4.15, 31.1Â±6.28, 10.56Â±3.29 and 10.02Â±2.72 respectively. There were 60% Covid positive pregnant females, depression was present in 31.7% and anxiety was present in 65% females. Comparison of pregnant females with or without Covid infection in terms of depression and anxiety using independent T-test revealed that anxiety was significantly associated with Covid positive status (p=0.032), however, no significant association was seen between depression and covid status (p=0.641) (table 3). Conclusion: Covid-19 was frequently seen in pregnant females and was significantly associated with high frequency of anxiety. Depression was less commonly seen and was not significantly associated with Covid-19 infection.","Javaid, M.

"Quality of Life among Lower Limb Amputees with Chronic Phantom Limb Pain or Stump Pain at a Tertiary Institution's Pain Clinic","Background: Phantom pain and stump pain in amputees have negative physical and psychological impacts. These effects may influence the quality of life (QoL) of lower limb amputees. Objective: To explore QoL of lower limb amputees treated at Ramathibodi pain clinic. Materials and Methods: All lower limb amputees treated at Ramathibodi pain clinic in 2020 were invited to answer questionnaires, including demographic data, the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants were recruited to join a focus group discussion and individual interviews. Qualitative data were collected, and then analyzed using content analysis and inductive thematic analysis. Results: Twenty-two participants were recruited. Average SF-36 score was 49.17Â±10.07. Physical component summary was 23.36Â±15.27 and mental component summary was 68.02Â±16.45. HADS were 5.91Â±3.69 and 5.23Â±3.42 for anxiety and depression, respectively. Eight participants were selected for focus group discussion and individual interviews. Five themes emerged, including biopsychosocial effects of amputation, pain among amputees, concepts of encouragement in life, gaps between patients and multidisciplinary team staff, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Lower limb amputees had low QoL. Amputation was found to restrict patients' physical function, and good pain management was reported to be crucial to help amputees cope and accept their condition. Positive self-esteem and social support also played a significant role. Inadequate communication was found to be the main deficit requiring attention. Lockdown policies during the COVID-19 pandemic affected QoL but pain intensity was maintained with management via telemedicine.","Pasutharnchat, K.; Juengsmarn, A.; Jarupongsa, J.","https://doi.org/10.35755/jmedassocthai.2022.03.13282","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand; 105(3):228-239, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30109,""
"Childhood and COVID-19: The indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of children and adolescents","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been overlooked in children and adolescents since many of the negative effects have been the result of containment and mitigation measures and will only be quantifiable in the medium and long term. Although the global response has been successful in reducing the lethality of the disease, the harmful effect on vulnerable populations, such as children and adolescents, is enormous and has been classified as catastrophic by international organizations. The pandemic has deeply affected the physical and mental health of children and adolescents, but also silently its negative effects extend across many areas such as schooling, familiar economy, child labor and food security. The third year of the pandemic is an opportunity to include the multidimensional well-being of children and adolescents as a cornerstone of societyâ€™s response to a global crisis, whether health, economic or political.","DÃ­az Rubio, F.; Fuentes, A.

"The trajectory of psychological distress and problematic Internet gaming among primary school boys: a longitudinal study across different periods of COVID-19 in China","Background: Children are a vulnerable population in terms of the impact of COVID-19 on their psychological well-being. When restricted to their homes, children are susceptible to problematic Internet gaming (PG). Primary school boys are particularly at risk of PG, which may lead to negative psychological effects, such as distress. Emerging research has identified perceived weight stigma (PWS) as a variable closely associated with both PG and psychological distress, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the trajectory of psychological distress among this vulnerable population from a longitudinal perspective, evaluating the role of PG and PWS. Methods: Self-report measures were used to assess psychological distress, PG, and PWS among primary school boys (grades 4 to grade 6; N = 283). Data were collected across three waves: before the pandemic, during school closure, and following the lifting of restrictions. Results: The trajectory of psychological distress among primary school boys was concave, indicating their mental health was negatively impacted during home restriction but recovered after the lockdown ended (linear change = 0.98, p &lt; 0.01; quadratic change = -0.19, p &lt; 0.01). PG was a significant covariate in terms of the trajectory of psychological distress (b = 0.02, p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, baseline values for PWS were shown to have a negative direct effect on mental health before the pandemic (b = 0.05, p &lt; 0.01), and moderated the time factor for boys' psychological distress over time (b of PWS Ã— linear change = 0.04, p = 0.006; b of PWS Ã— Quadratic change was negative at -0.01, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Although mental health gradually improved as home restrictions subsided, future studies are required to address changes in mental health upon return to school for students reporting higher levels of weight stigma.","Chen, I.

"The Relationship between the Students' Attitude toward Distance Learning, Alienation from Studying and Emotional Burnout","This article describes the study of the link between the students' preference for distance or traditional education and alienation from studying and emotional burnout. Additional variables such as the subjective evaluation of the success of studies, self-control, and academic control were also analysed. An empirical study was conducted on a sample of 359 students using the questionnaire to evaluate 1) preferred forms of education, 2) subjective alienation and burnout for students by E.N. Osin, 3) the scale of academic control by R. Perry and 4) the short scale of self-control by J. Tangney. Data analysis showed that a cautious, rather negative attitude toward distance learning prevailed among students, combined with a preference for traditional and mixed forms of education. Positive correlations were found between the preference for distance learning and alienation and burnout, as well as negative correlations with academic performance, self-control, and academic control. Structural equation modelling confirmed the assumption that the preference for distance learning is directly related to alienation and burnout, as well as indirectly (through burnout and alienation) and inversely related to self-control and academic control. It is concluded that under the conditions of forced distance learning at a university caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the preference for distance learning is more typical for less successful students experiencing alienation from study and emotional burnout, combined with a lower level of academic control and self-control.","Nevryuev, A.

"Perceived Anxiety and Stress among Pregnant Women during COVID-19 Pandemic - A Cross-sectional Study","Introduction: Mental health and well-being is as important as physical health during pregnancy. But the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more anxiety and stress among pregnant women. The augmented levels of anxiety and stress may have detrimental effects on antenatal women. Anxiety and depression in pregnancy can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes like increased risk of abortions, preterm labour and even foetal deaths. Aim: To assess the anxiety and stress levels among pregnant women attending a tertiary care hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the associated factors. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 348 pregnant women attending a tertiary care teaching hospital in Thiruvananthapuram District in Kerala during the period October and November 2020 using a validated tool, Pandemic Anxiety Stress Scale for pregnant women. Higher scores indicating higher perceived anxiety stress with a maximum score of 60, categorised as normal, mild, moderate and severe with score between 0-14, 15-29, 30-44, and 45-60, respectively. Qualitative variables were expressed in frequency and percentage. Multivariate logistic regression was done to determine the factors associated with anxiety and stress. The p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mild anxiety and stress were seen in 160 (45.98%) pregnant women, 89 (25.57%) had moderate and 7 (2.01%) had severe anxiety and stress, 92 women had no anxiety. A total of 145 (41.67%) pregnant women were scared of vertical transmission to their baby. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that residents in urban area and pregnant women with other co-morbidities associated with pregnancy were the two significant factors (p&lt;0.05) associated with anxiety-stress. Conclusion: About one-fourth of pregnant women had moderate or severe level of anxiety and stress. Antenatal women with pregnancy related diseases and those living in urban area had more anxiety and stress during pandemic. Measures need to be taken by health system to address the mental health of pregnant women.","Leelavathy, M.; Viswanathan, M.; Sukumaran, A.

"Temporal Unpredictability and Probabilistic Uncertainty Induced Anxiety in the Times of COVID-19 Pandemic","Human beings prefer a predictable and certain environment over an unpredictable and uncertain environment. No one predicted the coronavirus pandemic and it is not certain when the pandemic will come to an end. Pandemics not only affect the physical health but also the mental health of the public. An increase in anxiety and suicide rates has been reported during the previous pandemics and the same trend is also being observed in this current pandemic as well. Pandemics inevitably result in unpredictable and uncertain environments. Many studies have proven that unpredictability and uncertainty increase the levels of stress and anxiety in animals and humans. Coronavirus pandemic has caused many unpredictable and uncertain events resulting in increased confusion, frustration, stress and anxiety among the public. For instance, the institution of lockdowns was unpredictable and it was uncertain when the lockdowns will be unlocked. Similarly, events that unfolded around the initial touting of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible therapeutic agent and later lack of evidence in support of these drugs resulted in extreme confusion and frustration. The uncertainty around if a vaccine for coronavirus will be developed and when it will become available for public use has also caused stress and anxiety. Current studies indicate that coronavirus is not just a respiratory virus but it also affects the kidneys, brain, heart and blood vessels. This unpredictable nature of the virus has caused further confusion and frustration. These unpredictable and uncertain events around the current pandemic might have increased the levels of stress and anxiety among the public.","Jayaram, S.; Krishnamurthy, P.

"Long COVID and neuropsychiatric manifestations (Review)","There is accumulating evidence in the literature indicating that a number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID.19) may experience a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, persisting or even presenting following the resolution of acute COVID.19. Among the neuropsychiatric manifestations more frequently associated with 'long COVID' are depression, anxiety, post.traumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbances, fatigue and cognitive deficits, that can potentially be debilitating and negatively affect patients' wellbeing, albeit in the majority of cases symptoms tend to improve over time. Despite variations in results obtained from studies using different methodological approaches to define 'long COVID' syndrome, the most widely accepted factors associated with a higher risk of developing neuropsychiatric manifestations include the severity of foregoing COVID.19, the female sex, the presence of comorbidities, a history of mental health disease and an elevation in the levels of inflammatory markers, albeit further research is required to establish causal associations. To date, the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in neuropsychiatric manifestations of 'long COVID' remain only partially elucidated, while the role of the indirect effects of the COVID.19 pandemic, such as social isolation and uncertainty concerning social, financial and health recovery post.COVID, have also been highlighted. Given the alarming effects of 'long.COVID', interdisciplinary cooperation for the early identification of patients who are at a high risk of persistent neuropsychiatric presentations, beyond COVID.19 recovery, is crucial to ensure that appropriate integrated physical and mental health support is provided, with the aim of mitigating the risks of long.term disability at a societal and individual level.","Efstathiou, V.; Stefanou, M.

"Motivated Helplessness in the Coronavirus Pandemic: Experimental Evidence that Perceived Helplessness to Avoid the Virus Reduces Fear of Covid-19","Introduction: According to the motivated helplessness hypothesis, thinking that there is nothing to do to avoid the coronavirus may make people less afraid of being infected (Lifshin et al., 2020). Previous correlational evidence indicated that high levels of helplessness were associated with diminished fear of COVID-19 (Lifshin et al., 2020;Lifshin & Mikulincer, 2021). Method: We tested if manipulated perceived helplessness to avoid the virus using bogus messages (high, low or moderate helplessness) would reduce fear of COVID-19, state anxiety, and motivation for protective actions. Results: Supporting the hypothesis, in the high helplessness condition, higher perceived helplessness related to less fear of COVID-19, but this did not occur in the low and moderate helplessness control conditions. Perceived helplessness in the helplessness condition also indirectly reduced state anxiety and motivation for protective actions. Discussion: This research may advance the psychological study of helplessness and our understanding of human behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Power grab in a pandemic: Media, lawfare and policy in Myanmar","The 1 February 2021 coup dâ€™etat in Myanmar did more than force the countryâ€™s journalists and other media makers to operate under extreme conditions to continue their work, and win back the space for freedom of expression and the press lost to them. The coup also provoked a massive cultural shift, and the countryâ€™s independent media are playing a key role. After a half century of military dictatorship, a decade of much-lauded democratic opening (2011â€“20) prior to the coup had ushered in game-changing developments to the media landscape. Yet since the coup, the junta and its appointed State Administrative Council (SAC) have inflicted the kinds of brutalities in response to peaceful protesters that the military has used for decades with impunity against the countryâ€™s ethnic minorities, all justified, they claim, to ensure â€˜the rule of lawâ€™ and â€˜law and orderâ€™. The SAC has also attempted complete control over Myanmarâ€™s media, cutting off at various times nearly all internet and mobile access. This included Facebook, Twitter and other apps, thereby silencing the countryâ€™s independent media or forcing them into forms of self-censorship, hiding or exile, and allowing only a military-controlled narrative of unfolding events through military- and state-run media. Yet the independent media sector has not only survived, it has proven to be a key voice in efforts to thwart the regimeâ€™s attempts to control public mediated space. This article explores the various approaches to media policy-making in Myanmar during the COVID-19 pandemic and the aftermath of the coup, as employed by the military, the elected but later overthrown National League for Democracy government, various key components of the pro-democracy forces, and international aid and advocacy organizations working to increase freedom of expression and the press. It draws from interviews with key media policy-makers, journalists, academics and free expression advocates, and analyses of content from the (now) junta-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar and other key documents. It explores the various approaches taken and lessons learned by key stakeholders working to control or change public discourse and freedom of expression and the press in the country.","Brooten, Lisa","https://doi.org/10.1386/jdmp_00087_1","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Digital Media & Policy; 13(1):9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30118,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on cancer caregivers: Results from the Global Carer Well-being Index","Background: Caregiver burden has been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Carer Well-being Index is a global research study commissioned by Embracing Carers, a partnered initiative with nine global caregiving organizations. The study sought to explore and delineate the impact of the pandemic on the health and well-being of caregivers across the globe, including those caring for persons with cancer. Methods: The survey was conducted via online and phone methodologies in September and October 2020, with over 9,000 unpaid carers across 12 countries, including the United States and Canada. Unpaid carers were defined as those who care for someone with a long-term illness (e.g., cancer), physical disability (e.g., spinal cord injury), or cognitive/mental condition (e.g., Alzheimer's). The base sample size for cancer caregivers from the global surveyed population was n=1035. Statistically significant differences between cancer carers and non-cancer carers were evaluated using the Chi-square test with p = 0.05. Results: 63% of all caregivers were women, with a 60/40 female to male split in the cancer carer group. While the average age of started caregiving was 37.2 years, and 39.0 in cancer carers, caregivers caring for someone with cancer were more likely than the average caregiver to be in the 60+ age group. Compared to non-cancer caregivers surveyed, a higher percentage of cancer caregivers became carers in the last year (26 vs 13% of non-cancer caregivers). Providing emotional support, managing doctor appointments, preparing meals, home maintenance and housekeeping, transportation, and giving/managing medications were more likely to be among cancer caregivers' primary responsibilities, compared to non-cancer caregivers. Cancer carers were significantly more likely than non-cancer carers to have reported negative impacts because of COVID on their emotional/mental, physical, and financial health, and paid work responsibilities. Overall, cancer caregivers were significantly more likely to report that COVID has made caregiving harder than non-cancer caregivers (71 vs 63%), and were more likely to report never receiving support from a variety of organizations, such as insurance organizations (71 vs. 66% non-cancer caregivers) and local/state government (73 vs. 66%). Of note, cancer carers were more likely to report a positive impact on the relationship with the person being cared for (61 vs. 56%). Conclusions: These results highlight the burdens that have been intensified for cancer carers. Actions are needed to help with health and well-being such as offering and promoting mental health services, respite care;providing financial support to take leaves from paid work, access to equipment and services such as housecleaning. By working together with health care providers, organizations, and government on these types of initiatives, the burden upon cancer caregivers can be lessened.","Turpin, K. V.

"The association of the use of anxiety and depression medications with PSA testing","Background: Mental illness is a growing issue in the USA. More individuals continue to be diagnosed with illnesses such as depression and anxiety and placed on necessary medications. Studies have shown that the psychological makeup of an individual greatly impacts their health behavior and usage of preventative measures. However, there is limited research on the effect of anxiety and depression on PSA testing. This study explores the associations between the use of anxiety and depression medications and PSA testing. Methods: We used data from the National Health Interview Survey during the year 2018, and assessed responses to the question ""Have you ever had a PSA test?"" and ""What is the number of PSA tests you had in the last 5 years?"". Responses were stratified by whether men were taking medications for anxiety, depression, both or none. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to define adjusted odds ratios of undergoing PSA testing adjusting for relevant socio-economic and demographic parameters. Results: Among the 5,035 male participants, 89.4% did not take any medication, 2.9% reported they took anxiety medication, 2.1% took depression medication and 5.5% took both medications. There was a significantly higher rate of PSA testing in men who took medications for both anxiety and depression compared to men taking no medications (p=0.002). Furthermore, the average number of PSA tests in the last 5 years was highest in the group of men taking both medications (p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariable analysis showed that men who took medications for both depression and anxiety were more likely to undergo PSA testing in comparison to men, not on any of these medications (OR=1.755, p=0.001). The multivariable analysis also showed that age, living with a spouse, and prior cancer history were associated with an increased likelihood of PSA testing while being a minority, living in the south of the USA, and being a current smoker was associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing PSA testing. Conclusions: Taking both anxiety and depression medications in men may be associated with a higher likelihood of undergoing PSA testing. Despite obvious limitations of this analysis including its retrospective nature and recall bias, this association needs to be further explored, especially due to rising use of these medication in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khan, A.; Goldberg, H.; Pinkhasov, R.; Shapiro, O.; Jacob, J.

"Physical and visual (social) isolation increases tumor aggressiveness in thermoneutral housin temperatures in murine mammary cancer models","Correct interpretation of tumor progression data, including the influence of host biology, in mouse models of breast cancer requires models and conditions that faithfully recapitulate human disease and human host status. Our previous attempts to investigate the effects of social isolation have proven inconclusive due to premature mortality in tumor-bearing animals. Those studies were completed in standard temperature (ST), which commonly is 70-72Â°F (21-22Â°C) for in vivo murine research based on laboratory animal care and use guidelines. Previous work from the Repasky lab (Kokulus, 2013), which we have validated (Gaymon, 2020), demonstrates that ST housing results in chronic cold stress and immune suppression mediated by an increase in norepinrephrine (NE) levels, leading to increased tumor aggressiveness. Based on these findings, we investigated the effects of social isolation on BALB/cJ-4T1-luc and C57BL/6J/E0771 tumor progression and metastasis in thermoneutral housing conditions (84-85Â°F). Mice were first acclimatized to thermoneutral temperature and/or isolation for two weeks in cages that were unilaterally draped to provide physical and visual isolation. In BALB/cJ mice, 4T1-luc tumors were significantly larger in isolated mice compared to group-housed (GH) mice at day 18 (p&lt;.0001). Statistically larger tumors were observed in isolated mice compared to GH mice through day 24 and final tumor masses were Salso significantly different (p=.004). Spleen masses were not statistically different. In C57BL/6J mice, E0771 tumors were significantly larger in isolates at Day 25 (p=.002). Final tumor masses were statistically (p=.002) different while no difference in spleen sizes were observed. Data on metastasis will be presented at the meeting. We hypothesized that social isolation may perturb immune function and next investigated the growth of 4T1-luc xenograft tumors in NSG mice. 4T1-luc/NSG tumor progression and metastasis data will also be presented at the meeting. We conclude that syngeneic breast tumor growth in immunocompetent BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice demonstrates that social isolation is a bona fide stress with sufficient influence to exacerbate breast cancer growth. These data are potentially clinically important due the known relationship of social support to survivorship outcomes in patients and the high-risk of depression and isolation in patients following breast cancer diagnosis. The data may provide additional insight into possible effects of COVID-19 isolation on breast cancer progression.","Gaymon, D.

"Psychosocial aspects in relation to clinica status of breast cancer patients after prolonged COVID pandemic in south India: A observational survey study","Background: The prolonged global threat imposed by covid 19 pandemic's first and second wave has created immense stress among the breast cancer due to interruptions of standard oncological care. The frequent lockdown imposed had tremendous impact on the patients' financial status and posed hinderance in transportation to oncological centre. In our hospital, majority of the treatment population are from distant places and below poverty line. We conducted a questionnaire based study to assess the psychological impact in this situation affecting their quality of life(QOL) and their perspective in this current situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Breast cancer patients who had been diagnosed and registered in our department from 1st January to 1stApril 2020 before the covid out break were tracked from the medical records. The patients details, disease status dates of follow up and the treatment details were collected.Defaulted patients were contacted.Post one year, in April 2021, these patients were assessed clinically and questioned regarding the treatment perspective. Psychological status and health related quality of life were analysed with GAD-7 (Generalised anxiety disorder questionnaire), PHQ-9 (patient health questionnaire) and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Results:A total of 202 breast cancer patients were included. 83 patients(41%) were diagnosed with early breast cancer of which 67(33%) patients were started on Sadjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, 16 (8%)were registered for hormonal therapy. 54(27%) patients with locally advanced, were on neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 65(32%)had metastatic disease at presentation. 23 of 65 metastatic patients were in visceral crisis and were on supportive management for the same. 35 patients had been started on palliative chemotherapy. Out of the 156 patients who had been in initiated with various chemotherapy, only 62(31%) patients were able to review at correct interval for the scheduled chemotherapy. 45 patients(22%) reviewed in the day care irregularly. Among the 45, 28 patients had locally advanced breast cancer and 22 patients had clinical progression due to prolonged gap. 38 patients(19%) had defaulted completely.Of the 38, 16 had advanced disease and presented with clinical progression of disease and switched to second line chemotherapy. 15 patients progressed to have distant metastases and are started on palliative chemotherapy or supportive care. 7 patients who were on adjuvant chemotherapy are kept under close follow up. 11 patients with metastatic breast cancer had died during the past one year. 3 patients had committed suicide.112(55 %) patients were within the city. 71 patients(35%) were from suburban areas. 19 patients(10%) were from adjacent rural areas. 113(56%) were educated.176 (87 %) were desperate to continue treatment inspite of pandemic, while remaining patients main concern was to avoid infection than to get oncological management. While the most common reason for defaulting was travel restrictions, few also documented financial issues and ignorance about progression of cancer. 46 (22%)of patients who had been visiting the day care had turned covid positive. Except for 2 patients who succumbed to the infection, none had major complications. 51%, 42%, 7% had mild, moderate and severe anxiety. 69%, 25%, 6% had mild, moderate and severe depression. The severe anxiety and depression was significant with metastatic breast cancer and educated patients. There were 3 suicides. The overall heath score had a mean of 4. The overall QOL had a mean score of 3 (1-very poor to 7-excellent). CONCLUSION: In patients who were already psychologically affected by onset of cancer, the chaos created by the pandemic added to it further. Hence the patients also need counseling appropriately during oncological treatment.","Krishnan, C.","https://doi.org/10.1158/1538-7445.SABCS21-P4-12-13","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cancer Research; 82(4 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30122,""
"Implications of protoco treatment delays for breast cancer patient during Covid-19","The Covid-19 pandemic put a considerable strain on U.S. healthcare resources, resulting in significant disruptions in breast cancer care. Treatment protocols across the cancer care continuum were modified to permit continued delivery of critical cancer care with the lowest risk of Covid-19 transmission for both patients and healthcare providers. These deviations from standard treatment protocols revealed to patients the complexity of navigating cancer treatment, including critical dependencies and care coordination. While much of the research on cancer treatment protocols during the pandemic focuses on effectiveness or health outcomes, this research investigates the experiences of breast cancer survivors as they navigated the uncertainties and complexities of their cancer care during the Covid-19 pandemic. Method: We conducted a qualitative content analysis of survey data documenting patient experiences of the impact of Covid-19 related disruptions in cancer care and the challenges of navigating breast cancer treatment during the pandemic. Data for this analysis come from a larger data set collected from a national survey of adult breast cancer survivors, distributed online from 4/2/20 to 4/27/20. We used snowball sampling to recruit adult (&gt;18 years old) breast cancer survivors in the US. A 50-item survey instrument was administered to breast cancer survivors in the U.S to assess the impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer care. SResults: A total of 633 respondents completed the survey. We analyzed data from seven questions eliciting free-text responses detailing the nature of the delays in care and the impact of the delays on the physical, psycho-social, and practical aspects of life, yielding a sample size of 421 respondents. Patients reported experiencing a broad range of challenges across the cancer care continuum based on factors such as tumor type, disease stage, age, location and type of cancer care facility, and whether they were newly diagnosed, in active treatment, or completed active treatment. Respondents reported changes in the sequence, type, frequency, or location of treatment, follow-up, and symptom management. These changes were initiated by both providers and patients. Changes were associated with limited access to ancillary or supportive services such as imaging, labs, physical therapy and mental health care, and restricted availability of medical facilities such as operating rooms or emergency rooms. Balancing the risks of cancer and Covid-19 infection generated considerable uncertainty and anxiety for patients and their families, which they often attributed to feeling unable to reliably assess individual risk or prognosis. Respondents noted that navigating treatment protocol changes was further exacerbated by limitations on usual support services and resources, most notably restrictions prohibiting a companion or caregiver to accompany patients to appointments and changes in the frequency and channels of communication between survivors and their cancer care team. Conclusion: Our results point to the complex challenges and dependencies patient experienced in navigating cancer care during the Covid-19 pandemic. We suggest that a detailed understanding of patient experiences is critical to assessing the impact of the pandemic on cancer care, especially modifications to treatment protocols and other disruptions in care. These findings have implications beyond the crisis of the pandemic and can inform interventions to improve care coordination and communication between patients and providers and identify evidence-based opportunities to enhance breast cancer support and patient navigation in the U.S.","Hamlish, T.; Papautsky, E.

"Psychologic wellness of PA, NP, and physician hospitalists during the COVID-19 pandemic","Hospitalists, comprising PAs, NPs, and physicians, manage patients hospitalized with COVID-19. To guide the development of support programs, this study compared the psychologic wellness of hospitalist PAs, NPs, and physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed hospitalists in 16 hospitals at Mayo Clinic, from May 4 to 25, 2020. We used PROMIS surveys for self-reported global well-being (two single-item measures), anxiety, social isolation, and emotional support, before and during the pandemic. Linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for personal and professional factors. The response rate was 52.2% (N = 154/295). In adjusted linear regression models, the change in scores (before minus during pandemic) for anxiety, social isolation, and emotional support was similar for PAs and NPs compared with physicians. In adjusted logistic regression models, physicians, compared with PAs and NPs, had a higher odds of top global well-being for mental health (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.82 [1.12, 7.13]; P = .03) and top global well-being for social activities and relationships (adjusted odds ratio 4.08 [1.38, 12.08]; P = .01). During the COVID-19 pandemic, global well-being was lower for PAs and NPs compared with physician hospitalists. These results can guide support programs for hospitalists.","Dugani, Fischer, Geyer, Maniaci, Croghan, Burton","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.JAA.0000824964.37126.d8","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30124,""
"Prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Previous studies showed that the COVID-19 outbreak increased the levels of depression and anxiety in heterogeneous populations. However, none has explored the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the pandemic. This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students enrolled in US universities during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies the associated factors, including habits, social and psychological support, sleep quality, and remote learning. Between June and July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study through Wenjuanxing, a web-based survey platform. Participants were recruited with snowball sampling through 21 Chinese international student associations in US universities. The survey consisted of demographic questions, the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and self-constructed questions on academic performance, financial concerns, use of social media, physical exercise, and psychological support. Cut-off scores of 10 were used for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to determine the binary outcomes of depression and anxiety, respectively. Bivariant analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors. Among 1881 participants, we found a prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 scoreÃ¢Â©Â¾ 10) at 24.5% and that of anxiety (GAD-7 scoreÃ¢Â©Â¾ 10) at 20.7%. A higher risk of depression was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, agreement to pandemic's negative impacts on financial status, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of depression was associated with disagreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on academic performance and future careers, strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. In addition, a higher risk of anxiety was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, a lot of workloads, often staying up for online classes, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of anxiety was associated with the willingness and strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. This study showed a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple correlates-including recent exposure to traumatic events, pandemic-related financial concerns, workload, social support, remote learning, willingness to seek professional help, and sleep quality-were identified. It is critical for future studies to further investigate this student population and for universities to provide more flexible learning options and more access to psychological services.","Lin, Tong, Bai, Zhao, Quan, Liu, Wang, Song, Tian, Dong","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267081","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30125,""
"Psychological health of pregnant and postpartum women before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to influence psychological health of pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted a non-concurrent cross-sectional study among 1145 women living in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, 541 pregnant and 604 postpartum women. We measured psychological health with the Whooley questions, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and compared the scores of pregnant and postpartum women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. No differences were observed in the Whooley, GAD-2 or EPDS scores among pregnant women. The postpartum total GAD-2 scores before vs during the pandemic showed significant differences. Controlling for confounders, we observed a small main positive effect of having an infant during time of COVID-19 (F(1.13) = 5.06, p.025, d.27). The effect was significantly larger for women with (a history of) perinatal psychological problems (F(1.12) = 51.44, p &lt; .001, d.82). Emotional support was significantly related to GAD-2 scores of postpartum women during the pandemic (F(1.90) = 35.54, p &lt; .001). Postpartum women reported significant higher effects of the pandemic on their behavior compared to pregnant women (p.034). The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a positive effect on postpartum women during the first year postpartum, in particular for women with (a history of) perinatal psychological problems and for those women who experienced emotional support. The findings suggest that less external stimuli caused by lockdown restrictions might have a positive effect on postpartum women's emotional wellbeing. The sample consisted of white, educated women in a relationship and information regarding the extent of exposure to adverse COVID-19 consequences was lacking. We relied on self-selection and self-report. The postpartum pandemic sample was small.","Kuipers, Bleijenbergh, Van den Branden, van Gils, Rimaux, Brosens, Claerbout, Mestdagh","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267042","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30126,""
"Anxiety in cirrhosis: a prospective study on prevalence and development of a practical screening nomogram","The prevalence and effects of anxiety on health-related quality of life and clinical outcomes in cirrhosis are not well understood. This is increasingly relevant during COVID-19. Our aim was to use the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to determine the prevalence of anxiety, its association with clinical outcomes in cirrhosis and to develop a rapid cirrhosis-specific anxiety screening nomogram. Adults with a diagnosis of cirrhosis were prospectively recruited as outpatients at three tertiary care hospitals across Alberta and followed for up to 6 months to determine the association with unplanned hospitalization/death. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) was used as a screening tool as it is free of influence from somatic symptoms. Anxiety was diagnosed using the MINI. Of 304 patients, 17% of patients had anxiety by the MINI and 32% by the HADS. Anxious patients had lower health-related quality of life as assessed by the chronic liver disease questionnaire (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and also had higher levels of frailty using the Clinical Frailty score (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004). Multivariable analysis revealed smoking and three HADS subcomponents as independent predictors of anxiety. These were used to develop a rapid screening nomogram. A formal diagnosis of anxiety was made in approximately one in five patients with cirrhosis, and it was associated with worse HrQoL and frailty. The use of a 4-question nonsomatic symptom-based nomogram requires validation but is promising as a rapid screen for anxiety in cirrhosis.","Dang, Patel, Farhat, Abraldes, Ma, Bailey, Burak, Mitchell, Tandon","https://doi.org/10.1097/MEG.0000000000002301","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30127,""
"Immune Pathways in Etiology, Acute Phase, and Chronic Sequelae of Ischemic Stroke","Inflammation and immune mechanisms are crucially involved in the pathophysiology of the development, acute damage cascades, and chronic course after ischemic stroke. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and, in addition to classical risk factors, maladaptive immune mechanisms lead to an increased risk of stroke. Accordingly, individuals with signs of inflammation or corresponding biomarkers have an increased risk of stroke. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as IL (interleukin)-1ÃŽÂ² blockers, methotrexate, or colchicine, represent attractive treatment strategies to prevent vascular events and stroke. Lately, the COVID-19 pandemic shows a clear association between SARS-CoV2 infections and increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, mechanisms of both innate and adaptive immune systems influence cerebral damage cascades after ischemic stroke. Neutrophils, monocytes, and microglia, as well as T and B lymphocytes each play complex interdependent roles that synergize to remove dead tissue but also can cause bystander injury to intact brain cells and generate maladaptive chronic inflammation. Chronic systemic inflammation and comorbid infections may unfavorably influence both outcome after stroke and recurrence risk for further stroke. In addition, stroke triggers specific immune depression, which in turn can promote infections. Recent research is now increasingly addressing the question of the extent to which immune mechanisms may influence long-term outcome after stroke and, in particular, cause specific complications such as poststroke dementia or even poststroke depression.","Endres, Moro, Nolte, Dames, Buckwalter, Meisel","https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319994","20220414","COVID-19; depression; humans; microglia; monocytes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30128,""
"Effects of COVID-19-related disruptions on service use in a large smoking-cessation program","The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rapid shift to virtual care, with largely unknown consequences for accessibility. The purpose of this study is to examine pandemic-related changes in use of care for smoking cessation. We conducted a secondary analysis 65,565 enrolments in a large smoking cessation program in Ontario, Canada. We used piecewise mixed effects regression to examine how weeks NRT received, as well as counseling provided and visits attended, varied with date of enrolment over three time periods: more than 6M before the pandemic began; the 6M before the pandemic; and the pandemic period itself. We then examined changes in the associations between use of care and participant characteristics by fitting a model including a set of interactions between time and other variables. Based on an omnibus test of these interactions, we then tested individual terms, using the Holm method to control the familywise error rate. From the start of the pandemic in March, 2020, total weeks of NRT provided rose significantly and then declined, while the amount of counseling fell. Associations between NRT use and participant characteristics changed significantly after the pandemic onset. Individual models showed that people with lower income, living in areas of higher marginalization, unable to work, and reporting higher levels of depressive symptoms all received NRT for a longer time during the pandemic period. The pandemic led to small but significant changes in the amount of services used per enrolment. The transition to remote care appears to have reduced the effects of socioeconomic and health barriers. The amount of care used by participants in tobacco cessation treatment is known to be associated with health and sociodemographic characteristics. Most of these associations did not change markedly following the pandemic-related switch to virtual care in 2020; however, the effects of some economic and health barriers seems to have lessened, perhaps due to a likely reduction in transport and time requirements of treatment.","Veldhuizen, Mahinpey, Zawertailo, Minian, Melamed, Selby","https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntac103","20220414","COVID-19; depression; health services; poverty; smoking cessation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30129,""
"Association of Psychiatric Disorders With Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Breakthrough Infection Among Vaccinated Adults","Psychiatric disorders may be associated with an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection after vaccination, but no studies have tested this hypothesis. To evaluate whether past diagnoses of psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection among fully vaccinated individuals. This retrospective cohort study included data from the administrative and electronic health records of US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients from February 20, 2020, to November 16, 2021. Participants included 263Ã¢â‚¬Â¯697 patients who accessed VA health care during the study period, had at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 test recorded in the electronic health record, had no record of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination, and had completed a full SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regimen 14 days or more prior. Psychiatric disorder diagnoses in the past 5 years, including depressive, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, adjustment, alcohol use, substance use, bipolar, psychotic, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, dissociative, and eating disorders. SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections, defined as positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, among fully vaccinated individuals. Of 263Ã¢â‚¬Â¯697 fully vaccinated VA patients (239Ã¢â‚¬Â¯539 men [90.8%]; mean [SD] age, 66.2 [13.8] years), 135Ã¢â‚¬Â¯481 (51.4%) had at least 1 psychiatric disorder diagnosis, and 39Ã¢â‚¬Â¯109 (14.8%) developed a breakthrough infection. A diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder was associated with increased incidence of breakthrough infection, both in models adjusted for potential confounders (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09) and additionally adjusted for medical comorbidities and smoking (aRR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05). Most specific psychiatric disorder diagnoses were associated with an increased incidence of breakthrough infection, with the highest relative risk observed for adjustment disorder (aRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.10-1.16) and substance use disorders (aRR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21) in fully adjusted models. Stratifying the sample at 65 years of age revealed that associations between psychiatric diagnoses and incident breakthrough infection were present in both age groups but were stronger and robust to adjustment for medical comorbidities and smoking among older patients. This cohort study suggests that psychiatric disorder diagnoses were associated with an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection among VA patients, with the strongest associations observed for older individuals. Individuals with psychiatric disorders may be at heightened risk for contracting COVID-19 even after vaccination, suggesting the need for targeted prevention efforts.","Nishimi, Neylan, Bertenthal, Seal, O'Donovan","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.7287","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30130,""
"Applying after action review to examine residential treatment programs' responses to COVID-19","Resurgences of COVID-19 cases are a grave public health concern. Hence, there is an urgent need for health care systems to rapidly and systematically learn from their responses to earlier waves of COVID-19. To meet this need, this article delineates how we adapted the World Health Organization's After Action Review (AAR) framework to use within our health care system of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. An AAR is a structured, methodical evaluation of actions taken in response to an event (e.g., recent waves of COVID-19). It delivers an actionable report regarding (i) what was expected, (ii) what actually happened, (iii) what went well, and (iv) what could have been done differently, and thus what changes are needed for future situations. We share as an example our examination of Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Programs in Massachusetts (a COVID-19 hotspot). Our work can be further adapted, beyond residential treatment, as a consistent framework for reviewing COVID-19 responses across multiple health care programs. This will identify both standardized and tailored preparations that the programs can make for future waves of the pandemic. Given the expected resurgences of COVID-19 cases, the time to apply AAR is now.","Kim, Petrakis, McInnes, Gifford, Sliwinski, Smelson","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3475","20220414","COVID-19; housing; mental health; public health; residential treatment; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30131,""
"Lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic using virtual basic laparoscopic training in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia: effects on confidence, knowledge, and skill","An international surgical team implemented a virtual basic laparoscopic surgery course for Bolivian general and pediatric surgeons and residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. This simulation course aimed to enhance training in a lower-resource environment despite the challenges of decreased operative volume and lack of in-person instruction. The course was developed by surgeons from Bolivian and U.S.-based institutions and offered twice between July-December 2020. Didactic content and skill techniques were taught via weekly live videoconferences. Additional mentorship was provided through small group sessions. Participants were evaluated by pre- and post-course tests of didactic content as well as by video task review. Of the 24 enrolled participants, 13 were practicing surgeons and 10 were surgery residents (one unspecified). Fifty percent (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12) indicated ""almost never"" performing laparoscopic surgeries pre-course. Confidence significantly increased for five laparoscopic tasks.

"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Its Related Factors in Nurses Caring for COVID-19 Patients","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can result from direct or indirect contact with traumatic events. The current study aimed to evaluate PTSD and its related factors in nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. This study was a descriptive correlational study. Using convenience sampling methods, 395 nurses were enrolled in the study. The study instruments included demographic information, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and General Health and Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation test, <i>t</i>-test, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis. The mean (SD) age and work experience of the participants were 33.79 (6.74) years and 9.47 (6.47) years, respectively. Most nurses (86.60%) experienced PTSD. Multiple linear regression results showed general health (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.001), job insecurity (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.042), decision latitude (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.037), and high age (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.049) to be associated with an increase in PTSD, and having high social support (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.043) was associated with a decrease in PTSD in nurses. Nurses have experienced high levels of PTSD after the fatal outbreak of COVID-19 disease. Stressful conditions associated with an increased likelihood of this disorder should be identified, and coping skills such as decision latitude (control) and social support should be strengthened to prevent the symptoms of this disorder in nurses.","Mirzaei, Molaei, Habibi-Soola","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_456_20","20220414","COVID-19; mental health; post-traumatic; social support; stress disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30133,""
"A Global Longitudinal Study Examining Social Restrictions Severity on Loneliness, Social Anxiety, and Depression","Social restrictions and government-mandated lockdowns implemented worldwide to kerb the SARS-CoV-2 virus disrupted our social interactions, behaviours, and routines. While many studies have examined how the pandemic influenced loneliness and poor mental health, such as depression, almost none have focussed on social anxiety. Further, how the change in social restrictions affected change in mental-health and well-being has not yet been explored. This is a longitudinal cohort study in community dwellers who were surveyed across three timepoints in the first six months of the pandemic. We measured loneliness, social anxiety, depression, and social restrictions severity that were objectively coded in a sample from Australia, United States, and United Kingdom (<i>n</i> = 1562) at each time point. Longitudinal data were analysed using a multivariate latent growth curve model. Loneliness reduced, depression marginally reduced, and social anxiety symptoms increased as social restrictions eased. Specific demographic factors (e.g., younger age, unemployment, lower wealth, and living alone) all influenced loneliness, depression, and social anxiety at baseline. No demographic factors influenced changes for loneliness; we found that those aged over 25 years reduced faster on depression, while those younger than 25 years and unemployed increased faster on social anxiety over time. We found evidence that easing social restrictions brought about additional burden to people who experienced higher social anxiety symptoms. As country-mandated lockdown and social restrictions eased, people are more likely report higher social anxiety as they readjust into their social environment. Mental health practitioners are likely to see higher levels of social anxiety in vulnerable communities even as social restrictions ease.","Lim, Qualter, Thurston, Eres, Hennessey, Holt-Lunstad, Lambert","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.818030","20220414","SARS-CoV-2; depression; loneliness; social anxiety; social restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30134,""
"Impact of COVID-19 shocks, precarity and mediating resources on the mental health of residents of share housing in Victoria, Australia: an analysis of data from a two-wave survey","COVID-19 lockdown measures have challenged people's mental health, especially among economically vulnerable households. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of exposure to COVID-19 shocks (defined as job loss, living cost pressures and changing housing conditions throughout the lockdown period) and double precarity (defined as precarity in housing and employment) on mental health outcomes for members of share households as well as the mediating effects of a range of resources. We conducted a two-wave survey of occupants of share housing in June and October 2020 during a prolonged period of population lockdown. Research design involved fixed effects ordered logit regression models to assess the mental health consequences of baseline precarity and COVID-related shocks. Victoria, Australia. We surveyed 293 occupants of share houses (mean age 34 SD 11.5, 56% female). Members of share houses (where individuals are unrelated adults and not in a romantic relationship) are more likely to be young, casually employed, visa-holders and low-income. We measured household composition, housing and employment precarity, access to government support, household crowding, social networks and COVID-19 shocks. We used a self-reported measure of mental health. Those exposed to COVID-19 shocks reported a 2.7 times higher odds of mental health deterioration (OR 2.7, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.53 to 4.85). People exposed to double precarity (precarity in both housing and employment) reported 2.4 times higher odds of mental health deterioration (OR 2.4, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.99 to 5.69). Housing inadequacy and lack of access to sufficient government payments explained 14.7% and 7% of the total effect of double precarity on mental health, respectively. Results indicate that residents of group households characterised by pre-existing precarity were vulnerable to negative mental health effects during lockdown. Access to sufficient government payments and adequate housing buffered this negative effect.","Raynor, Panza, Bentley","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058580","20220414","COVID-19; Health policy; MENTAL HEALTH; SOCIAL MEDICINE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30135,""
"Long COVID in children","Several physicians in our family medicine clinic noted a recent increase in the number of children with nonspecific symptoms after having had COVID-19. Based on the assumption that these children may have long COVID syndrome, what is the recommended treatment? Lockdowns and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the physical and mental health of children and adolescents. A recognized complication of COVID-19 is a post-COVID-19 syndrome (<i>long COVID</i>) that was initially reported in adults with an estimated prevalence of 10%. More recent reports on long COVID in children suggest a prevalence of 8% to 10%, but small cohorts, a range of symptoms, and challenges in defining the syndrome make accurately estimating the prevalence difficult. Furthermore, providers may find it challenging to differentiate between neuropsychiatric symptoms that are consequences of COVID-19 infection versus those that are a result of stress, anxiety, or changes in behaviour owing to restrictions associated with the pandemic. Until more evidence is available, management includes obtaining a detailed history, performing a comprehensive physical examination, and aiming to relieve symptoms while following up every 2 to 4 months.","Goldman","https://doi.org/10.46747/cfp.6804263","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30136,""
"Changes of symptoms of eating disorders (ED) and their related psychological health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic and its related social restrictions have profoundly affected people's mental health. It can be assumed that symptomatic behaviors and mental health of individuals with eating disorders (ED) deteriorated during this time. To get a thorough overview, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the following aims: First, to provide a comprehensive overview of symptoms of ED during the COVID-19-related confinement; second, to identify psychological mechanisms which impacted the emergence and maintenance of ED symptoms; third, to describe changes of daily routine and changes of access to healthcare in individuals with ED during confinement. We searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases for observational studies published between January 1st, 2020, to July 1st, 2021, which investigated the symptomatology of ED during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the screening, 13 studies with 7848 participants were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of exacerbation of binge eating, food restriction, purging behaviors, and concerns about food intake in the pooled sample of 7848 was 59.65% (95% CI: 49.30%; 69.60%), and the overall prevalence of improved symptoms of ED in the pooled sample of 741 individuals was 9.37% (95% CI: 3.92%; 16.57%). Furthermore, COVID-19-related social restrictions negatively impacted the psychological health, daily routines, and physical activity of individuals with ED. More specifically, symptoms of anxiety and depression related to ED were increased significantly over time. However, there were also positive aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main positive consequences included more emotional support from the family, less pressure to engage in social activities, and more flexible meal planning. Individuals with ED reported having difficulties getting access to healthcare centers and using telemedicine. They also found a hard time communicating via online sessions. According to our interpretation, based on the data included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic and its related social restrictions detrimentally impacted the mental health of majority of individuals with ED. Limited and impaired access to healthcare interventions appeared to have further exacerbated mental health issues of individuals with ED. Given this background, it seems that individuals with ED demand more attention during the COVID-19 crisis, and it is necessary to ensure that their course of treatment remains uninterrupted. The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdowns have significantly impacted people's mental health and mental status worldwide. Remarkably, people with pre-existing illnesses (e.g., eating disorders) were affected by the COVID-19-related restrictions. Thus, gathering information and data would significantly help researchers and physicians provide better future therapy and support for people with ED. Moreover, the use of online surveys to evaluate the mental status of people with ED has grown hugely in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used as a promising way of communicating with these people in the future. Considering the growing number of studies that reported the status of individuals with ED in the COVID-19 era, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive review to summarize the current literature. Our findings show that, of all individuals participating in the surveys, 59.65% of them experienced exacerbations in their ED symptoms and 9.37% experienced improved ED symptoms. Altogether, this emphasizes the challenges to maintaining well-being in individuals with ED during the pandemic.","Haghshomar, Shobeiri, Brand, Rossell, Akhavan Malayeri, Rezaei","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00550-9","20220414","COVID-19; Confinement; Eating disorders; Meta-analysis; Psychological consequences; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30137,""
"Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and maternal and child health outcomes: a scoping review of the literature from low-and-middle income countries from 2016 - 2021","Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy is significantly associated with negative outcomes for both mother and child. Current evidence indicates an association between low levels of social support and IPV, however there is less evidence from low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) than high-income countries. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered how women can access social support. Hence since 2020, studies investigating IPV and pregnancy have occurred within the changing social context of the pandemic. This scoping review summarizes the evidence from LMICs about the effects of IPV during pregnancy on maternal and child health. The review includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social support as mentioned in studies conducted since 2020. Library databases were used to identify papers from 2016 to 2021. These studies reported the maternal and child health outcomes of IPV during pregnancy, and described how social support during pregnancy, and the COVID-19 pandemic, were associated with rates of IPV during pregnancy. Observational study designs, qualitative and mixed methods studies were included. Twenty - six studies from 13 LMICs were included. Half (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) were cross sectional studies which only collected data at one time-point. IPV during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher odds of postpartum depression, low birth weight, preterm birth and less breastfeeding in the year after birth. Lower levels of social support increased the odds of experiencing IPV during pregnancy, whilst higher levels of social support reduced antenatal anxiety and depression in women experiencing IPV during pregnancy. Of the four studies that investigated IPV during pregnancy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, only one compared prevalence before and after the pandemic and unexpectedly reported a lower prevalence. Further research on the impact of IPV during pregnancy on maternal and child outcomes in LMICs is required, especially evidence from longitudinal studies investigating a wider range of outcomes. To date, there is limited evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on IPV during pregnancy in LMICs, and this should be prioritized as the pandemic continues to affect women's access to social support globally.","Da Thi Tran, Murray, Van Vo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04604-3","20220414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30138,""
"Lessons learned during covid-19 pandemic, a worldwide survey: evolution of global neurosurgical practice","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of surveys have analyzed the impact virus spreading on the everyday medical practice, including neurosurgery. However, none have examined the perceptions of neurosurgeons towards the pandemic, their life changes, and the strategies they implemented to be able to deal with their patients in such a difficult time. From April 2021 to May 2021 a modified Delphi method was used to construct, pilot, and refine the questionnaire focused on the evolution of global neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. This survey was distributed among 1000 neurosurgeons; the responses were then collected and critically analyzed. Outpatient department practices changed with a rapid rise in teleservices. 63.9% of respondents reported that they have changed their OT practices to emergency cases with occasional elective cases. 40.0% of respondents and 47.9% of their family members reported to have suffered from COVID-19. 56.2% of the respondents reported having felt depressed in the last 1 year. 40.9% of respondents reported having faced financial difficulties. 80.6% of the respondents found online webinars to be a good source of learning. 47.8% of respondents tried to improve their neurosurgical knowledge while 31.6% spent the extra time in research activities. Progressive increase in operative waiting lists, preferential use of telemedicine, reduction in tendency to complete stoppage of physical clinic services and drop in the use of PPE kits were evident. Respondents' age had an impact on how the clinical services and operative practices have evolved.

"COVID-19 hospitalization is associated with pulmonary/diffusion abnormalities but not post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 severity","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has resulted in much acute morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is now a growing recognition of the post-acute sequela of COVID-19, termed long COVID. However, the risk factors contributing to this condition remain unclear. Here, we address the growing controversy in the literature of whether hospitalization is a risk factor for long COVID. We found that hospitalization is associated with worse pulmonary restriction and reduction in diffusion capacity at 3 months post-infection. However, the impact on mental health, functional and quality of life is equally severe in those who have and have not been hospitalized during the acute infection. These findings suggest that hospitalization is a risk factor for pulmonary complications of long COVID but not the overall severity of long COVID.","Lam, Befus, Damant, Ferrara, Fuhr, Laratta, Lau, Stickland, Varughese, Wong, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13427","20220414","COVID-19; COVID-19; Disease Progression; Hospitalization; Humans; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30140,""

"Positive prospective mental imagery characteristics in young adults and their associations with depressive symptoms","Background: Positive prospective mental imagery plays an important role in mental well-being, and depressive symptoms have been associated with difficulties in generating positive prospective mental images (PPMIs). We used a mobile app to gather PPMIs generated by young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed content, characteristics, and associations with depressive symptoms. Methods: For this longitudinal study, 50 healthy students reported PPMIs at least three times per day for seven consecutive days using a mobile app inducing PPMI generation. We categorized entries into themes and applied linear mixed models to investigate associations between PPMI characteristics and depressive symptom outcomes. Results: We distinguished 25 PPMI themes. The most frequent were related to consuming food and drinks, watching TV/streaming platforms, and doing sports. More vivid PPMIs were easier to generate. Vividness and ease of generation of PPMIs, but not their anticipation or pleasure intensity, were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Discussion: We identified PPMI themes in young adults and found significant negative associations between depressive symptoms and vividness and generation ease of PPMIs. These results may inform prevention and intervention science, including design of personalized interventions. We discuss implications for future studies and treatment development for individuals experiencing diminished PPMI.","Marta Anna Marciniak et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E020E-847-AB2","20220415","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Imagery; vividness; depression; ease; positive prospective mental imagery; mental imagery; mobile app","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","",30142,""
