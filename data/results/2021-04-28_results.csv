"Have news reports on suicide and attempted suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic adhered to guidance on safer reporting? A UK-wide content analysis study","Associations between sensational news coverage of suicide and subsequent increases in suicidal behaviour in the general population have been well documented. Amidst growing concern over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates, it is especially important that news coverage of suicidal behaviour adheres to recommended standards for the responsible reporting of suicide. Using a set of dimensions based on international media guidelines, we analysed the quality and content of all UK news reports of possible COVID-19 related suicides and suicide attempts in the first four months of the pandemic (N=285 reports of 78 individual incidents published in print and online newspapers between 16th March and 12th July 2020). The majority of news reports made an explicit link between suicidal behaviour and the COVID-19 pandemic in the headline (187/285, 65.5%), and portrayed this association as strong and direct (n=196/272, 72.1%), mostly based on statements by family, friends or acquaintances of the deceased (171/285, 60%). The impact of the pandemic on suicidal behaviour was most often attributed to feelings of isolation (78/285, 27.4%), poor mental health (42, 14.7%) and sense of entrapment (41, 14.4%) as a result of government-imposed restrictions. Although rarely of poor overall quality, reporting was biased towards young people, frontline staff and relatively unusual suicides (including those involving a celebrity, murder-suicide and violent methods) Also, to varying degrees, reports failed to meet recommended standards; for example, 41.1% (117/285) did not signpost readers to sources of support, a quarter (69, 24.2%) included examples of sensational language and a third provided over-simplistic explanations for the suicidal behavior (93, 32.6%). While news reporting has improved compared to earlier coverage of suicide in the UK, it is essential that careful attention is paid to the quality and content of reports, especially as longer-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic develop.

"EVIDENCE FOR BIOLOGICAL AGE ACCELERATION AND TELOMERE2 SHORTENING IN COVID-19 SURVIVORS","Introduction & Background: the SARS-CoV-2 infection determines the COVID-19 syndrome characterized, in the worst cases, by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary and cardiac fibrosis,inflammatory cytokines release, and immunodepression. This condition has led to the death of about 2.15% of the total infected world population so far. Among survivors, the presence of the so-called post-COVID19 syndrome (PPCS) is a common finding. In patients who survived the SARS-CoV-2 infection, overt PPCS presents one or more symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, sleep disorders, and difficulty concentrating. The pathophysiology of PPCS is currently poorly understood, and whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process is unexplored. Methods & Results: In this study, a cohort of 117 COVID19 survivors (post-COVID19) and 144 non-infected volunteers (COVID19-free) were analyzed using pyrosequencing of defined CpG islands previously identified as suitable for biological age determination. Besides, telomere length (TL) and ACE2 and DPP4 receptor expression were determined. The results show a consistent biological age increase in the post-covid population (mean 58,44 DS 14,66 ChronoAge Vs. mean 67,18 DS 10,86 BioAge, P<0,0001), determining a DeltaAge acceleration of 10,45 DS 7,29 years (+5.25 years above range of normality) compared to 3,68 DS 8,17 years for the COVID19-free population (P<0,0001). A significant telomere shortening parallels this finding in the post-COVID19 cohort compared to COVID19-free subjects (post-COVID19 TL: 3,03 DS 2,39 Kb vs. COVID19-free: 10,67 DS 11,69 Kb; P<0,0001). Additionally, ACE2 expression was decreased in post-COVID19 patients compare to COVID19-free, while DPP-4 did not change. Conclusion: In light of these observations, we hypothesize that some epigenetic alterations are associated with the post-COVID19 condition, particularly in the younger (<60 years). Although the consequences of such modifications on the long-term clinical outcome remain unclear, they might 46 indicate a direction to investigate the pathophysiological basis of the post-COVID19 syndrome","Alessia Mongelli; carlo gaetano; michela gottardi zamperla; veronica barbi; sandra atlante; maria teresa la rovere; tiziana bachetti; oronzo catalano; maurizio bussotti; laura della vecchia; simona nanni; antonella farsetti; fabio martelli","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.21255973","20210427","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13227,""
"The PhenX Toolkit: Establishing Standard Measures for COVID-19 Research","The PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) Toolkit (https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) is a publicly available, web-based catalog of recommended, well-established measurement protocols of phenotypes and exposures. The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a &quot;rapid release&quot; process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis. The COVID-19 specialty collections are Behaviors and Risks; Ethnicity, Race and Demographics; History, Treatment and Outcomes; Information Resources; Psychosocial and Mental Health; and Socioeconomic. The development and usage of PhenX COVID-19 specialty collections are described in this article. Ã‚Â© 2021 The Authors.

"Psychological interventions during COVID pandemic: Telehealth for individuals with cystic fibrosis and caregivers","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China, leading to worldwide morbidity and mortality, including depression and anxiety. As the pandemic spread throughout Italy, mental health concerns increased for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are at greater risk. The aim was to pilot a Telehealth Psychological Support Intervention for pwCF and caregivers to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety during the lockdown in Italy in March 2020. This intervention utilized cognitive behavioral skills (e.g., cognitive reframing). Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-8 and GAD-7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre- to post-testing for pwCF (paired t(14)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-4.06, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and parents (paired tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-5.2, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxietyÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°71%; parents: depressionÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°57%; anxietyÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°79%); a large proportion (20%-40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.0 to post: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.7; paired t(14)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.8, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) but not anxiety (pre: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.9 to post: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.6, t(14)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°NS-non-significant). Parental depression decreased for parents (pre: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.4 to post: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.1, t(14)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.5, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), but not anxiety (pre: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.1 to post: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.9, t(14)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.2, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°NS).

"Loneliness and symptom burden in oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Loneliness and social isolation are significant public health problems that are being exacerbated during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Little is known about the associations between loneliness and symptom burden in oncology patients before and during the pandemic. Study purposes include determining the prevalence of loneliness in a sample of oncology patients; evaluating for differences in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics between lonely and nonlonely patients; and determining which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with membership in the lonely group. A convenience sample (n = 606) completed online surveys that evaluated the severity of loneliness, social isolation, and common symptoms (ie, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and pain) in oncology patients. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to evaluate for differences in scores between the lonely and nonlonely groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for membership in the loneliness group. Of the 606 patients, 53.0% were categorized in the lonely group. The lonely group reported higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher symptom severity scores for all of the symptoms evaluated. In the multivariate model, being unmarried, having higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with membership in the lonely group. Study findings suggest that a significant number of oncology patients are experiencing loneliness, most likely as a result of mandate social distancing and isolation procedures. The symptom burden of these patients is extremely high and warrants clinical evaluation and interventions.","Miaskowski, Paul, Snowberg, Abbott, Borno, Chang, Chen, Cohen, Cooper, Hammer, Kenfield, Kober, Laffan, Levine, Pozzar, Rhoads, Tsai, Van Blarigan, Van Loon","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33603","20210427","anxiety; cancer; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); depression; loneliness; sleep disturbance; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13230,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Palliative Care for People with Parkinson's and Response to Future Pandemics","Although in some countries, palliative care (PC) still remains poorly implemented, its importance throughout the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasingly being acknowledged. With an emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, growing emphasis has been placed on the palliative needs of people with Parkinson's (PwP), particularly elderly, frail, and with comorbidities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge on aspects of daily living in PwP and might interact negatively with a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), both directly and indirectly - as a consequence of pandemic-related social and health care restrictions. Here, the authors outline some of the motor and NMS relevant to PC, and propose a pragmatic and rapidly deployable, consensus-based PC approach for PwP during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, potentially relevant also for future pandemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses a considerable impact on PwP and their caregivers, ranging from mental health issues to worsening of physical symptoms - both in the short and long term (&quot;Long-COVID&quot;), and calls for specific personalized PC strategies relevant in a lockdown setting globally. Validated assessment tools should be applied remotely to flag up particular motor or NMS that require special attention, both in short- and long-term.","Chaudhuri, Rukavina, McConvey, Antonini, Lorenzl, Bhidayasiri, Piemonte, Lim, Richfield, Walker, Bouca-Machado, Bajwah, Gao, Trivedi, Miyasaki","https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2021.1923480","20210427","COVID-19; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; non-motor symptoms; palliative care; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13231,""

"Medium-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic on epilepsy: A follow-up study","To analyze the medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on epilepsy patients, focusing on psychological effects and seizure control. Prospective follow-up study to evaluate the medium-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a cohort of epilepsy patients from a tertiary hospital previously surveyed during the first peak of the pandemic. Between July 1, 2020, and August 30, 2020, the patients answered an online 19-item questionnaire, HADS, and PSIQ scales. Short- and medium-term effects of the pandemic confinement and the perception of telemedicine were compared. 153 patients completed the questionnaire, meanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â SD age, 47.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 19.3Ã‚Â years; 49.7% women. Depression was reported by 43 patients, significantly more prevalent than in the short-term analysis (29.2% vs. 19.7%; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .038). Anxiety (38.1% vs. 36.1%; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.749) and insomnia (28.9% vs. 30.9%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .761) remained highly prevalent. Seventeen patients reported an increase in seizure frequency (11.1% vs. 9.1%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .515). The three factors independently associated with an increase in seizure frequency in the medium term were drug-resistant epilepsy (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.2, 95% CI 2.06-32.52), depression (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.46, 95% CI 1.80-23.11), and a reduction in income (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.47, 95% CI 1.51-19.88). A higher proportion of patients found telemedicine unsatisfactory (11.2% vs. 2.4%), and a lower percentage (44.8% vs. 56.8%) found it very satisfactory (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .005). Depression rates increased significantly after the first wave. Depression, drug-resistant epilepsy, and a reduction in family income were independent risk factors for an increased seizure frequency.

"Hospital workforce mental reaction to the pandemic in a low COVID-19 burden setting: a cross-sectional clinical study","ÃŽÂ¤he COVID-19 pandemic has mental health implications for both healthcare workforces and general population, particularly in regions heavily hit by the crisis. ÃŽÂ¤he study aimed (i) to investigate anxiety- and depression severity differences between staff of a COVID-19 treatment unit (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°84) and a hospital without such a unit (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°55) in comparison to participants of a convenience general population online survey (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°240) and (ii) to explore relations between such symptoms and hospital staff reaction to COVID-19 in a low COVID-19 burden setting. Anxiety was studied with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item in hospital workforces and with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) in online survey participants. Depression symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in hospital employees and the HADS in the online survey sample. Symptoms were classified as absent/minimal, borderline abnormal or indicating clinical caseness. Staff reaction to COVID-19 was tapped with a 9-item-questionnaire and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). Proper tests for differences and stepwise ordered logistic regression models were employed. Anxiety- and depression severity was higher in hospital workforces than in online survey participants (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Anxiety was more severe in frontline- compared to backstage employees (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) was inversely correlated with age (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011) and positively with avoidance (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028). Both anxiety and depression symptoms related to intrusion symptoms (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"COVID-19 and the Mental Health of Canadian Armed Forces Veterans: A Cross-Sectional Survey","There are no data on the impact of COVID-19 and associated public health measures, including sheltering at home, travel restrictions, and changes in health care provision, on the mental health of older veterans. This information is necessary for government and philanthropic agencies to tailor mental health supports, services, and resources for veterans in the peri- and post-pandemic periods. The objective of this study was to compare mental health symptoms between Canadian Armed Forces (CAFs) veterans and the general Canadian older adult population in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study of older adults in the national Canadian COVID-19 Coping Study. Individuals aged 55 years and older were eligible. A convenience sample of older adults was recruited through a web-based survey administered between May 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Canadian Armed Force military service history status (yes/no) was ascertained. The eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item Loneliness Scale were used to measure mental health symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression compared the odds of screening positive for depression, anxiety, and loneliness between veterans and non-veterans. Of 1,541 respondents who answered the final question (87% survey completeness rate), 210 were veterans. Forty percent of veterans met criteria for at least one of the mental health diagnoses compared to 46% of non-veterans (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.12). The odds of reporting elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were similar for veteran and non-veteran respondents after adjusting for confounders. Veterans' report of mental health symptoms was similar to the general population Spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although veterans' military training may better prepare them to adapt in the face of a pandemic, additional research is needed to understand the longitudinal impacts on physical and mental health.","Mahar, Rindlisbacher, Edgelow, Siddhpuria, Hallet, Rochon, Cramm","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab157","20210427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13235,""
"Perceived impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis-using emerging adults","Cannabis-using youth are a large epidemiologic subgroup whose age and smoking-related risks underscore the importance of examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in this population. Within a clinical trial (n = 36 received an intervention prior to data collection reported herein), we surveyed cannabis-using emerging adults (ages 18-25) about perceived COVID-19 impacts. Participants (n = 141) reporting weekly cannabis use (M = 18.6 use days in the past 30) were enrolled and completed online surveys as part of either their baseline or 3 month assessment. COVID-19-related measures included symptoms, substance use, mood, etc. Participants were 57% female (mean age = 21, standard deviation = 2.2), with 21% Hispanic/Latinx, 70% White, 20% Black/African American, and 10% of other races. Most participants (86%) reported quarantine/self-isolation (M = 59 days). Several had COVID-19 symptoms (16%), but none reported testing COVID-19 positive. Many respondents felt their cannabis use (35%-50%, across consumption methods) and negative emotions (e.g., loneliness, stress, and depression; 69.5%, 69.5%, and 61.8%, respectively) increased. They reported decreased in-person socialization (90.8%) and job losses (23.4%). Reports of increased cannabis smoking were associated with increased negative emotions. On an open-response item, employment/finances and social isolation were frequently named negative impacts (33.3% and 29.4%, respectively). Although cannabis-using emerging adults' reports of increases in cannabis use, coupled with mental health symptoms and social isolation, are concerning, the full impact of the pandemic on their health and well-being remains unknown.

"The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on socioeconomic inequality in psychological distress in the UK","We use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) to compare measures of socioeconomic inequality in psychological distress, measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), before (Waves 9 and the Interim 2019 Wave) and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to July 2020). Based on a caseness measure, the prevalence of psychological distress increased from 18.5% to 27.7% between the 2019 Wave and April 2020 with some reversion to earlier levels in subsequent months. Also, there was a systematic increase in total inequality in the Likert GHQ-12 score. However, measures of relative socioeconomic inequality have not increased. A Shapley-Shorrocks decomposition analysis shows that during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020) other socioeconomic factors declined in their share of socioeconomic inequality, while age and gender account for a larger share. The most notable increase is evident for younger women. The contribution of working in an industry related to the COVID-19 response played a small role at Wave 9 and the Interim 2019 Wave, but more than tripled its share in April 2020. As the first wave of COVID-19 progressed, the contribution of demographics declined from their peak level in April and chronic health conditions, housing conditions, and neighbourhood characteristics increased their contributions to socioeconomic inequality.","Davillas, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4275","20210427","COVID-19; GHQ; health equity; mental health; psychological distress; socioeconomic inequality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13237,""

We found a significant positive correlation between general PSI and depression as well as severity of illness. General PSI differed significantly depending on social contact. Neither general PSI nor psychopathology changed significantly between T1 and T2. At T1, patients' psychosocial support systems were reduced as compared to six months before. Patients reported an increase in psychosocial support between T1 and T2 and high demand for additional support (sports, arts/occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy). Elderly psychiatric patients show a negative PSI of the pandemic. They are likely to suffer from an impaired psychosocial situation, emphasizing the importance of developing concepts for sufficient psychosocial support during a pandemic.","Seethaler, Just, StÃƒÂ¶tzner, Bermpohl, Brandl","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09917-8","20210427","COVID-19; Depression; Elderly; Geriatric psychiatry; Mental health; Psychosocial burden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13238,""
"A qualitative investigation of LGBTQ+ young people's experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health","There is evidence that young people generally self-manage their mental health using self-care strategies, coping methods and other self-management techniques, which may better meet their needs or be preferable to attending specialist mental health services. LGBTQ+ young people are more likely than their peers to experience a mental health difficulty and may be less likely to draw on specialist support due to fears of discrimination. However, little is known about LGBTQ+ young people's experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health. Using a multimodal qualitative design, 20 LGBTQ+ young people participated in a telephone interview or an online focus group. A semi-structured schedule was employed to address the research questions, which focussed on LGBTQ+ young people's experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health, what they perceived to stop or help them to self-manage and any perceived challenges to self-management specifically relating to being LGBTQ+ . Reflexive thematic analysis yielded three key themes: (1) self-management strategies and process, (2) barriers to self-management and (3) facilitators to self-management. Participants' most frequently mentioned self-management strategy was 'speaking to or meeting up with friends or a partner'. Both barriers and facilitators to self-management were identified which participants perceived to relate to LGBTQ+ identity. Social support, LGBTQ+ youth groups and community support were identified as key facilitators to participants' self-management of their mental health, which merits further investigation in future research. These findings also have important implications for policy and intervention development concerning LGBTQ+ young people's mental health.","Town, Hayes, Fonagy, Stapley","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01783-w","20210427","COVID-19 lockdown; LGBTQ+ young people; Self-care; Self-management; Sexual minority adolescents; Youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13239,""
"Telepsychotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Experience of Lebanese Mental Health Professionals","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the mental health system by surprise, with the state of lockdown forcing businesses to close their doors, including many mental health services. This has driven many psychotherapists and other mental health professionals towards telepsychotherapy, relying on online consultations to provide continuity of care. However, the adoption of telepsychotherapy required major adaptations from both mental health professionals and patients. This study set out to explore the predictors of the use of online consultations and the perceived level of comfort using telepsychotherapy in a sample of 73 Lebanese mental health professionals. Data was collected via online dissemination of a survey. Results show that 82% of participants made use of online consultations in the past few days, reflecting the adaptation of Lebanese mental health professionals to the atypical newly imposed situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequent lockdown. Having previous experience in the use of online consultations and perceived level of telepresence were significant predictors of the level of comfort of mental health professionals in the execution online consultations. We suggest that more awareness and trainings are required around the practice of telepsychotherapy outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tohme, De Witte, Van Daele, Abi-Habib","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10879-021-09503-w","20210427","COVID-19; Lebanon; Mental Health; Online Consultations; Telepsychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13240,""
"Dual impacts of coronavirus anxiety on mental health in 35 societies","The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected both physical health and mental well-being around the world. Stress-related reactions, if prolonged, may result in mental health problems. We examined the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in a multinational study and explored the effects of government responses to the outbreak. We sampled 18,171 community adults from 35 countries/societies, stratified by age, gender, and region of residence. Across the 35 societies, 26.6% of participants reported moderate to extremely severe depression symptoms, 28.2% moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, and 18.3% moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Coronavirus anxiety comprises two factors, namely Perceived Vulnerability and Threat Response. After controlling for age, gender, and education level, perceived vulnerability predicted higher levels of negative emotional symptoms and psychological distress, whereas threat response predicted higher levels of self-rated health and subjective well-being. People in societies with more stringent control policies had more threat response and reported better subjective health. Coronavirus anxiety exerts detrimental effects on subjective health and well-being, but also has the adaptive function in mobilizing safety behaviors, providing support for an evolutionary perspective on psychological adaptation.","Chen, Ng, Hui, Au, Wu, Lam, Mak, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87771-1","20210427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13241,""
"Boosting positive mood in medical and emergency personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic: preliminary evidence of efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a novel online ambulatory intervention","The aim of this project was to test the efficacy of a brief and novel online ambulatory intervention aimed at supporting psychological health and well-being for medical personnel and first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interested participants, n=28, actively employed as medical personnel, support staff and emergency responders, in the Midwestern USA in May-June of 2020, provided informed consent and were randomised to complete either low-dose or high-dose intervention, one time daily for 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°week via smartphone application. Each daily intervention included expressive writing, adaptive emotion regulation activity and (one vs two) positive emotion-generation activities, lasting 3-6Ã¢â‚¬â€°min a day. Ratings of negative and positive emotion were provided before and after each activity daily. Analyses tested compliance, acceptability, as well as efficacy at increasing positive emotion and decreasing negative emotion with each use and across time. The results indicated a 13% increase in positive emotion, t(25)=2.01, p=0.056; and decrease in negative emotion by 44%, t(25)=-4.00, p=0.001 across both doses. However, there was a clear advantage for individuals in the high-dose condition as daily boosts in positive emotion were significantly greater (an additional 9.4%) B=0.47, p=0.018. Overall, compliance was good. Acceptability ratings were good for those who completed the follow-up assessment. Front-line personnel, including medical staff and emergency responders, are experiencing unprecedented psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation suggests both feasibility and efficacy for a brief, daily, ambulatory intervention which could provide essential psychological support to individuals at risk in the workplace.","Coifman, Disabato, Seah, Ostrowski-Delahanty, Palmieri, Delahanty, Gunstad","https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2021-107427","20210427","COVID-19; mental health; occupational health; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13242,""
"Overcoming culture restriction for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells facilitates the screening of compounds inhibiting viral replication","Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic include screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be re-purposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often show decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led to the selection of a variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved infectivity in human liver (Huh7 and Huh7.5) and lung cancer cells (unmodified Calu-1 and A549). The adapted virus exhibited mutations in the spike protein, including a 9 amino acid deletion and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6 cultured viruses that became viable in A549 cells. Original and adapted viruses were susceptible to SR-B1 receptor blocking and adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly less dependency of ACE2. Both variants were similarly neutralized by COVID-19 convalescent plasma but adapted-SARS2 exhibited increased susceptibility to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2 similarly, demonstrating the utility of the system for the screening of nucs. Among the tested nucs, only remdesivir, molnupiravir and to a limited extent galidesivir, showed antiviral effect across human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity. Analogously to the emergence of spike mutations <i>in vivo</i>, the spike protein is under intense adaptive selection pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate that the emergence of spike mutations will most likely not affect the activity of remdesivir.","Ramirez, Fernandez-Antunez, Galli, Underwood, Pham, Ryberg, Feng, Pedersen, Mikkelsen, Belouzard, Dubuisson, SÃƒÂ¸lund, Weis, Gottwein, FahnÃƒÂ¸e, Bukh","https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00097-21","20210427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13243,""
"Mental Health and Endocrine Telemedicine Consultations in Transgender Subjects During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey","Transgender people are a vulnerable group with a higher incidence of mental health issues and, during the COVID-19 outbreak, they may have faced psychological, physical and social obstacles. To evaluate the impact of the pandemic and the access to health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the transgender people living in Italy. An anonymous web-based survey was conducted among transgender people living in Italy. The survey consisted of 41 questions (to address socio-demographic and COVID-19 related variables, general health problems and trans-related health issues) and three validated questionnaires (the Impact of Event Scale [IES], the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II] and the SF-12. In total 108 respondents were included in the analysis, of these 73.1% were transmen and 26.9% transwomen. The mean age was 34.3 Ã‚Â± 11.7 years with 88.9% undergoing gender affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT). Of these respondents 55.6% were not working during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly because they lost their jobs due to the lockdown (30.5%) or because they were otherwise unemployed (25.0%). Only four subjects were quarantined at home because of a positive COVID-19 swab. The mean total IES score was 21.1 Ã‚Â± 14.9 with 24.1% of subjects scoring over the cut-off score of 26 thereby suggesting a moderate-to-severe impact of the pandemic event. Mean BDI score was 8.6 Ã‚Â± 8.4. SF-12 total mean score was 96.1 Ã‚Â± 11.9 with a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of 42.8 Ã‚Â± 9.1. Access to endocrinological consultations for hormonal prescription via telemedicine services was associated with better IES total scores (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .01). Our results highlight the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of this particular population and how telemedicine services may serve to mitigate negative psychological effects. Internet-based surveys may select a group of people not necessary representative of the whole population. The self-reporting bias should also be considered. Those who responded to our survey were mainly from northern Italy were COVID-19 has had a greater impact. Vulnerable groups such as the transgender population should receive more consideration also during pandemic events and their access to health services especially for endocrine and mental health care should be improved. A nationwide plan for the extended use of telemedicine should be established with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress. Gava G, Fisher AD, Alvisi S, etÃ‚Â al.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on application of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for exercise in adults with congenital heart disease: a data-based questionnaire","Regular physical activity is safe and effective therapy for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) and is recommended by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous challenges to healthcare teams and patients when ensuring guideline compliance. We explored the implications of COVID-19 on physical activity levels in ACHD patients. A data-based questionnaire was distributed to ACHD patients at a regional tertiary centre from October to November 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 96 (79.3%) of 125 respondents reported participating in regular physical activity, with 66 (52.8%) meeting target levels (moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week). Commonest motivations for physical activity were general fitness (53.6%), weight loss (36.0%) and mental health benefits (30.4%). During the pandemic, the proportion that met target levels significantly decreased from 52.8% to 40.8% (p=0.03). The commonest reason was fear of COVID-19 (28.0%), followed by loss of motivation (23.2%) and gym/fitness centre closure (15.2%). The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted exercise levels of ACHD patients. Most do not meet recommended physical activity levels, mainly attributable to fear of COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, only half of respondents met physical activity guidelines. Availability of online classes can positively impact exercise levels so could enhance guideline compliance. This insight into health perceptions and behaviors of ACHD patients may help develop quality improvement initiatives to improve physical activity levels in this population.","Thompson, Whitehead, Notley, Guy, Kasargod Prabhakar, Clift, Hudsmith","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951121001864","20210427","COVID-19; Congenital heart disease; exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13245,""
"Suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm in infectious disease epidemics: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Suicide accounts for 2.2% of all years of life lost worldwide. We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted. In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality. There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised. The development of up-to-date self-harm and suicide statistics to monitor the effect of the current pandemic is an urgent priority.","Rogers, Chesney, Oliver, Begum, Saini, Wang, McGuire, Fusar-Poli, Lewis, David","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796021000214","20210427","epidemic; infection; self-harm; suicide; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13246,""
"Patient oriented research in mental health: matching laboratory to life and beyond in Canada","As patient-oriented research gains popularity in clinical research, the lack of patient input in foundational science grows more evident. Research has shown great utility in active partnerships between patient partners and scientists, yet many researchers are still hesitant about listening to the voices of those with lived experience guide and shape their experiments. Mental health has been a leading area for patient movements such as survivor-led research, however the stigma experienced by these patients creates difficulties not present in other health disciplines. The emergence of COVID-19 has also created unique circumstances that need to be addressed. Through this lens, we have taken experiences from our patient partners, students, and primary investigator to create recommendations for the better facilitation of patient-oriented research in foundational science in Canada. With these guidelines, from initial recruitment and leading to sustaining meaningful partnerships, we hope to encourage other researchers that patient-oriented research is necessary for the future of mental health research and foundational science. This paper presents a roadmap for patient-oriented research in mental health in Canada. At the level of laboratory science, the direct involvement of patients and their collaboration with researchers on experimental development and dissemination of results has been scarce. With voices of collaborative patient partners, graduate students and the principal-investigator, it makes a clear case for involving people with lived experience within translational mental health research, which has shown positive outcomes that could potentially shape public policy and future practice. Starting with the premise that meaningful engagement spurs meaningful results, the paper addresses current literature, a discussion of the challenges faced by researchers and patient partners and includes a consideration of COVID-19 consequences. Ending with clear recommendations, this paper is an exciting call to action for involving patient partners in the full research cycle of mental health research and beyond.","Johnston, Ridgway, Cary-Barnard, Allen, Sanchez-Lafuente, Reive, Kalynchuk, Caruncho","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-021-00266-1","20210427","Knowledge transfer; Laboratory preclinical research; Mental health; Patient partners; Patient-oriented research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13247,""
"Feelings of loneliness and mental health needs and services utilization amongÃ‚Â Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic","Due to the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures, loneliness has been a major public health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have examined loneliness in Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as its associations with mental health needs and services utilization. The present study was a cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. A total of 7741 adults were invited and completed an online self-administered questionnaire. The Chinese 12-item General Health Questionnaire was used to screen for common mental health problems, loneliness was measured with a single-item self-report question (&quot;How often do you feel lonely in recent days?&quot;), and two standardized questions were used to assess perceived needs for and use of mental health services. In total, 24.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of the participants felt lonely in recent days. Age of 16-29 years (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.36, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.020), marital status of never-married (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.47, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), marital status of &quot;others&quot; (re-married, co-habiting, separated, divorced, and widowed) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.72, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), having infected family members or close relatives (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.64, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.026), and having infected colleagues, friends, or classmates (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were significant correlates of loneliness. Rates of mental health needs (17.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°% vs. 4.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and services utilization (2.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°% vs. 1.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were significantly higher in lonely than not lonely participants. After adjusting for socio-demographic and epidemic characteristics and common mental health problems, loneliness was still significantly associated with mental health needs (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.50, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and services utilization (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.020). Feelings of loneliness are prevalent among Chinese residents affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and the presence of loneliness is associated with high levels of mental health needs and greater services utilization. Effective measures aiming at preventing or reducing loneliness are potentially beneficial for the mental wellbeing of COVID-19-affected population and reducing the use of the limited mental health service resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bao, Li, Zhong","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00704-5","20210427","COVID-19; Loneliness; Mental health needs; Mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13248,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food rations of refugees in Rwanda","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has significantly impacted the global economy, by forcing people to stay indoors and creating a 'new normal' of living. Rwanda has made notable efforts to fight the pandemic. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country's economy are numerous and the refugees residing in Rwanda are not spared these effects. As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality.Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk. It is unsurprising that refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to local population, including higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is an issue as they are also less likely to receive support than the general population. Refugees in Rwanda are under the responsibility of UNHCR and WFP, who should ensure adequate food assistance is provided to refugees and therefore ameliorate the risks to health that result from food shortages, safeguarding these vulnerable communities.","Manirambona, Uwizeyimana, Uwiringiyimana, Reddy","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01450-1","20210427","COVID-19; Great Lakes; Health equity; Humanitarian assistance; Nutrition; Refugees; Rwanda","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13249,""
"Income-related health inequality among Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence based on an online survey","Partial- or full-lockdowns, among other interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, may disproportionally affect people (their behaviors and health outcomes) with lower socioeconomic status (SES). This study examines income-related health inequalities and their main contributors in China during the pandemic. The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media in China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China provided comprehensive data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the lockdown. Of them, 8448 subjects provided data for this analysis. Concentration Index (CI) and Corrected CI (CCI) were used to measure income-related inequalities in mental health and self-reported health (SRH), respectively. Wagstaff-type decomposition analysis was used to identify contributors to health inequalities. Most participants reported their health status as &quot;very good&quot; (39.0%) or &quot;excellent&quot; (42.3%). CCI of SRH and mental health wereÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and 0.04 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), respectively, indicating pro-poor inequality in ill SRH and pro-rich inequality in ill mental health. Income was the leading contributor to inequalities in SRH and mental health, accounting for 62.7% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and 39.0% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) of income-related inequalities, respectively. The COVID-19 related variables, including self-reported family-member COVID-19 infection, job loss, experiences of food and medication shortage, engagement in physical activity, and five different-level pandemic regions of residence, explained substantial inequalities in ill SRH and ill mental health, accounting for 29.7% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and 20.6% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), respectively. Self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, experiencing food and medication shortage, and engagement in physical activity explain 9.4% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), 2.6% (the summed contributions of experiencing food shortage (0.9%) and medication shortage (1.7%), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and 17.6% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) inequality in SRH, respectively (8.9% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), 24.1% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and 15.1% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) for mental health). Per capita household income last year, experiences of food and medication shortage, self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, and physical activity are important contributors to health inequalities, especially mental health in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention programs should be implemented to support vulnerable groups.","Nie, Ding, Chen, Liu, Zhang, Shi, Wang, Xue, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01448-9","20210427","COVID-19; China; Health inequality; Mental health; Socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13250,""
"The effect of refined nursing intervention on patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis in the hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 epidemic","The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has exerted considerable psychological pressure on patients undergoing hemodialysis, resulting in unhealthy psychological emotions. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out strict management and refined nursing intervention for patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis during the prevention and control of novel coronavirus. This study aims to analyze and discuss the effect of clinical refined nursing intervention on patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. This was a prospective cohort study. In this study, we used the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) or the Chinese adult SCL-90 norm to conduct nursing interventions for patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis to investigate the effect of clinical refined nursing intervention on patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis during the COVID-19 epidemic. The scores for all the factors of SCL-90 of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were higher than those of the Chinese SCL-90, and patients with a single factor scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 had a higher level of depression and anxiety, with extremely significant difference (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The depression and anxiety of the patients were reduced after the intervention, and there was a statistical difference. Among the 172 patients, the results of both nucleic acid tests were negative. During the COVID-19 epidemic, providing patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis with refined nursing intervention can regulate negative emotions, reduce related complications, improve their quality of life, and improve the nurse-patient relationship.","Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Meng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00584-5","20210427","COVID-19; Intervention strategy; Maintenance hemodialysis; Refined nursing intervention; SCL-90","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13251,""
"Association between supportive attitude and adoptive practice of control strategy against COVID-19 amosng college students in China: a cross-sectional study","We investigated college students' attitude and compliance towards a prevention strategy involving use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in four universities in Guangdong Province (China) based on purposive sampling. A self-administered questionnaire was given to College students (CSs) to measure the supportive attitude towards an outbreak control strategy and adoption of NPIs in respondents. A total of 44,446 CSs participated between 31 January and 10 February 2020; 92.7% of respondents supported the outbreak control strategy. The proportion of respondents who avoided public places, wore a facemask, avoid gatherings, and washed hands more frequently than usual was 94.8, 92.8, 91.2 and 86.9%. respectively. A total of 76.5% respondents adopted all four measures. A supportive attitude was associated with NPI adoption. Students who were female, postgraduate, anxious, and not depressed tended to have a higher supportive attitude and higher chance of NPI adoption. Higher supportiveness towards the disease control strategy for the Chinese public may lead to higher adoption rate of NPIs. Psychosocial factors were related to a supportive attitude and adoption of the NPI. We believe that our findings could aid policymakers to create NPIs to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Shen, Liu, Cai, Chen, Wang, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Wu, Yang, Mao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10752-6","20210427","Adoption; Attitude; College students; Coronavirus disease 19; Prevention and control strategy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13252,""
"The relationship between sexual function and mental health in Iranian pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","Sexual function, a significant contributor to quality of life, is affected by various factors, including overall mental health. COVID-19 is a current pandemic that influences the mental health of various populations, especially pregnant women. Despite the importance of sexual health, the specific nature of its relationship to overall mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is not clearly defined. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between sexual function and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iranian pregnant women. This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was carried out among 437 pregnant women using the sociodemographic and obstetrics characteristics questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Inventory, Stress, Depression, and Anxiety Scales. Random sampling was employed to select pregnant women who had a medical record in Health Centers of Tabriz city, Iran. The questionnaires were sent to the participants' cell phones via WhatsApp or text messages, including links of questionnaires and the participants completed these questionnaires. Spearman correlation test was used to determine the relationship between sexual function and stress, anxiety, and depression. Generalized linear modeling was used to estimate each of the independent variables (sociodemographic characteristics, stress, anxiety, and depression) on the dependent variable (sexual function). The mean (Standard Deviation) sexual functioning (total) score was 20.0 (8.50) from the available range of 2 to 36. The mean (SD) of depression, stress, and anxiety scale was 4.81 (5.22), 5.13 (4.37), and 7.86 (4.50) (possible score ranging from 0 to 21), respectively. Based on Spearman's correlation test, there was a significant reverse correlation between the total sexual function score and stress, anxiety, and depression, indicating that all three variables negatively impacted sexual functioning. Variables such as mild stress, spouse type of job, sufficient household income, living with parents, higher marital satisfaction, and higher gestational age had a significant, positive impact on sexual function and could predict 35.8% of the variance model. Sexual functioning was significantly impacted by stress, anxiety, and depression - all of which are heightened during a pandemic. This topic warrants further study, and the general public should be educated on the protective influence of safe sex/intimacy on overall mental health.","Effati-Daryani, Jahanfar, Mohammadi, Zarei, Mirghafourvand","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03812-7","20210427","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Sexual function; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13253,""
"Coping with COVID-19: Longitudinal Impact of the Pandemic on Adjustment and Links with Coping for Adolescents with and without ADHD","Understanding factors that foster resilience and buffer against the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 is critical to inform efforts to promote adjustment, reduce risk, and improve care, particularly for adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders. This prospective longitudinal study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescentsâ€™ mental health and substance use, and by assessing specific positive coping strategies among adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using multi-group autoregressive cross-lagged path models, the present study explored the reciprocal influence of positive coping behaviors on multiple adjustment outcomes including mental health symptoms, substance use, stress, and worry. Participants included 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15â€“17; 118 with ADHD). Parents provided ratings of adolescent routines, and adolescents provided ratings of coping behaviors and psychological adjustment in spring (May/June), summer (July/August), and fall (October/November) 2020. All models included the effects of adjustment at the prior timepoint as well as relevant covariates including adolescent race, ethnicity, sex, medication status, and family income. Adolescents with ADHD were at greater risk for experiencing increases in mental health symptoms and substance use throughout the pandemic, relative to adolescents without ADHD. The use of positive coping strategies and adolescent routines buffered against increases in substance use and mental health problems for adolescents with ADHD. These findings have important clinical and public policy relevance for parents, schools, and employers who may aim to prioritize keeping schedules as consistent as possible to promote healthy adjustment.","Melissa Dvorsky et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46178-DAF-DF8","20210428","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Disruptive, Impulse-control, and Conduct Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; prospective; coronavirus; coping; adolescence; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-28","",13254,""
