"Effectiveness of mobile application-based perinatal interventions in improving parenting outcomes: a systematic review","Objective Parents face many challenges during the perinatal period and are at risk for mental health issues, especially during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Mobile application-based interventions can help parents to improve their psychosocial well-being in a convenient and accessible manner. This review aims to examine the effectiveness of mobile application-based perinatal interventions in improving parenting self-efficacy, anxiety, and depression (primary outcomes), as well as stress, social support, and parent-child bonding (secondary outcomes) among parents. Methods Seven electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest Thesis and Dissertations) were searched from their respective inception dates until August 2021. The Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool was used to conduct quality appraisals. Results were narratively synthesized due to the high heterogeneity of intervention and participant types. Findings A total of 6164 articles were retrieved from the seven electronic databases and citation searching. After excluding duplicate records and irrelevant titles/s, 105 full texts were examined. Full-text screening excluded another 93 articles, leaving 12 included studies in this review. All studies were rated as having some concerns or a high overall risk of bias. Mobile application-based interventions were found to be feasible and promising in improving parentsâ€™ overall well-being post-intervention during the perinatal period. Further research would be needed to determine their long-term effects. Key conclusions and implications for practice Parental well-being was shown to improve using the following intervention components: educational resources on perinatal and infant care, psychotherapy, and support from peers and healthcare professionals. Hence, future interventions could aim to include these components and evaluate all inter-related parenting outcomes (parenting self-efficacy, stress, anxiety, depression, social support, and parent-child bonding). Parents could be provided with experiential learning exposure by using computer animations and virtual reality. Future research could be conducted on more fathers and parents from varied geographical regions.","Chua, Joelle Yan Xin, Shorey, Shefaly","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2022.103457","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Midwifery;: 103457, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36304,""
"Co-Designing the Health4Me Text Message Intervention to Support and Improve Adolescent's Physical and Mental Health Outcomes: An Active Research Partnership With Adolescents","Background: Despite suboptimal lifestyle health behaviours, current approaches to adolescent cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention are proving ineffective. Researchers have the responsibility to engage with adolescents as research partners. The aim is to co-design the Health4Me text message nutrition and physical activity support program with an adolescent advisory panel. Methods: Iterative, mixed methods process with consumer partnership. We assembled a consumer group of 16 youth advisors (13-18-years), named Health Advisory Panel for Youth at The University of Sydney (HAPYUS). HAPYUS is an evidenced-based leadership and collaboration initiative. The first co-design step to develop the text message content included identifying the top issues related to CVD prevention grounded in their lived experience via online workshops and an online conversation thread. Results: The top issues raised by HAPYUS related to CVD prevention were unbalanced nutritional intake, physical inactivity and mental health concerns, which are interconnected through the inimical rise of social media. HAPYUS also identified how issues have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be amplified with ongoing global issues (e.g., climate change). Conclusion: Engagement with HAPYUS has identified key issues and barriers relating to CVD prevention among adolescents. This work will enable development of content for an automated text message intervention suitable for testing in the Health4Me randomised controlled trial. This RCT will determine the effectiveness of the 6-month healthy lifestyle text message intervention to improve physical and mental health outcomes in adolescents compared to usual care.","Raeside, R.; Redfern, J.; Partridge, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2022.06.524","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heart Lung and Circulation; 31:S304, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36305,""
"Moderna Vaccine Induced Recurrent Myopericarditis","Background: COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis and myopericarditis is a rare complication, with the US Centers for disease Control and Prevention reporting 4.2 per million females aged 12-29 years, dropping to 1.0 per million over 30, and exceptionally rare is recurrent myopericarditis requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Case presentation: We report a case of a 51-year-old female with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with pleuritic chest pain, and progressive breathlessness 9 days after her first Moderna vaccine. Electrocardiography revealed widespread ST segment elevation with PR depression in the inferior leads. Her inflammatory markers were elevated with a C- reactive protein of 263. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with a maximum of 1.8cm adjacent to the lateral wall of the left ventricle in the parasternal short axis view and no evidence of tamponade physiology. The patient did not show initial response to anti-inflammatory therapy, and was commenced on steroid therapy, and subsequently immunosuppressive therapy, namely azathioprine, to manage disease activity. Conclusion: This case brings to light a rare but significant side effect of mRNA vaccine, and whilst this case should not impede vaccination efforts, it highlights that whilst the majority of patients get transient self-limiting myocardial inflammation, rare cases of prolonged myopericarditis may occur which may require prolonged immunosuppression.","Arasaratnam, K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2022.06.265","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heart Lung and Circulation; 31:S168, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36306,""
"Women in Thailandâ€™s gem and jewellery industry and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Empowerment or continued inequity?","Thailand is a worldwide hub for the value addition of gemstones. Women in Thailand enjoy a high level of education, their employment level is on par with other member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and they play a significant role in the gem and jewellery industry. Thai institutions support the industry, but their gender-neutral stance does not celebrate, or capitalise on, the contribution of female actors. Patriarchy and â€˜invisible masculinityâ€™ underlie entrepreneurship across the country. A few privileged women have experienced a degree of empowerment and fair conditions at work. But some parts of the industry, for example, home-based work, are informal and women in the home-based gemstone-cutting industry in the border regions, hit particularly hard by COVID-19, have experienced little progress. The literature has not paid much attention to the Thai gem resource sector or to the contribution of women. This paper considers the gem and jewellery industryâ€™s contribution to the lives of women in Thailand referencing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)â€”gender equality and empowerment (SDG 5), decent work and economic work (SDG 8), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). The paper is based on seven years of research into the opportunities and challenges for women in the gemstone value chain spanning Madagascar and Thailand. The paper questions the extent to which the industry has enabled and empowered women in Thailand, and whether it perpetuates some of the patterns of economic inequality reflected in, and caused by, the urbanâ€“rural divide.","Lawson, Lynda, Chowdhury, Arnab Roy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2022.07.018","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental Science & Policy; 136:675-684, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36307,""
"COVID-19 and environmental health: A systematic analysis for the global burden of biomedical waste by this epidemic","Since the beginning of this outbreak, much evidence stated that the climb in the amount of biomedical waste harmed human health and had adverse effects on the environment. With the increase of cases of COVID-19 all around the globe, the amount of biomedical waste was also constantly rising. Also, many solutions regarding either reducing or recycling biomedical waste. However, the potential global burden of biomedical waste during this pandemic was not yet been analyzed. Herein, we perform a systematic review of literature on these modalities, including mentioning types of biomedical waste, the effect on health, the environment, and methods of handling biomedical waste during this pandemic. A total of 3551 published papers were identified by two databases. In the end, 15 references were selected for this systematic analysis. Most of the included studies focus on research on the impact of medical waste caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment. The total biomedical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately 16,649.48 tons/day. Most publications agreed that the amount of waste has also increased due to the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 patients. In 15 articles, we identified 2 mentioning the COVID-19 biomedical waste on health. 9 out of 15 gave out the context related to the solution of BMW by COVID-19. More studies, including meta-analyses, are recommended to shed more light on the effects of medical waste on environmental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ngoc, Suong-Mai Vu, Nguyen, Mai-Anh, Nguyen, Thanh-Lam, Thi, Hue Vu, Dao, Thi Loi, Bui, Thi Minh Phuong, Hoang, Van Thuan, Chu, Dinh-Toi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscee.2022.100245","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Case Studies in Chemical and Environmental Engineering;: 100245, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36308,""
"Enlightening wellbeing in the home: The impact of natural light design on perceived happiness and sadness in residential spaces","As more people move towards work-from-home options during the COVID-19 pandemic, residential indoor environments are increasingly becoming places where we spend a large share of our time living, working and studying. While the relevance of indoor environments for our emotional wellbeing is well established, little is known about the specific aspects of residential indoor spaces that affect negative and positive emotions. This article studies the relationship between natural lighting in the home and the emotional subjective wellbeing (E-SWB) of its inhabitants. In a randomised control trial, we test the hypothesis that natural lighting improvements in housing contribute to residents' E-SWB, determining which aspects of housing daylight design are more relevant for this. A total of 750 participants took part in the experiment and rated, according to their perceived happiness or sadness, a series of 3D computer simulations representing seven types of natural lighting improvements in the home. The results show that the natural lighting conditions of housing significantly impact people's perceptions of happiness and sadness, with settings that have an increased amount of daylight entering the home leading to the greatest impacts.","Morales-Bravo, Javiera, Navarrete-Hernandez, Pablo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109317","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Building and Environment;: 109317, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36309,""
"La dÃ©pression aux urgences psychiatriquesÂ : une expÃ©rience quotidienne","RÃ©sumÃ© La dÃ©pression est le trouble psychiatrique le plus frÃ©quent dans la population gÃ©nÃ©rale, et les consultations aux urgences pour dÃ©pression seraient en hausse depuis plusieurs annÃ©es. Le Centre Psychiatrique dâ€™Orientation et dâ€™Accueil est un service dâ€™urgences psychiatriques Ã  vocation rÃ©gionale situÃ© Ã  Paris qui recense environ 10Â 000Â consultations par an. Parmi ces consultations, on retrouve prÃ¨s de 40Â % de diagnostics de troubles de lâ€™humeur. La prise en charge du patient aux urgences repose sur une Ã©valuation globale, qui ne doit pas se limiter Ã  lâ€™entretien psychiatrique. Le contexte dâ€™arrivÃ©e, lâ€™environnement et lâ€™entourage du patient doivent Ãªtre pris en compte afin dâ€™aboutir Ã  une orientation optimale. Une attention particuliÃ¨re doit Ãªtre portÃ©e aux premiers Ã©pisodes (Ã©limination dâ€™un diagnostic diffÃ©rentiel, dÃ©pistage dâ€™un Ã©ventuel trouble bipolaire) et Ã  lâ€™Ã©valuation du risque suicidaire. Lâ€™existence dâ€™un facteur causal externe ou dâ€™un trouble de personnalitÃ© comorbide ne doit pas faire banaliser la consultation et mener Ã  un sous-diagnostic de dÃ©pression caractÃ©risÃ©e. Le traitement mÃ©dicamenteux aux urgences est le plus souvent symptomatique (traitement anxiolytique par benzodiazÃ©pines ou neuroleptiques selon les situations), et lâ€™orientation ambulatoire doit toujours Ãªtre privilÃ©giÃ©e. Des adaptations thÃ©rapeutiques peuvent alors Ãªtre envisagÃ©es. La dÃ©cision dâ€™une hospitalisation doit toujours Ãªtre argumentÃ©e, et le consentement aux soins rigoureusement Ã©valuÃ©. La prise en compte et Ã©ventuellement lâ€™accompagnement de lâ€™entourage sont presque toujours nÃ©cessaires. Tous ces Ã©lÃ©ments doivent Ãªtre argumentÃ©s dans le dossier. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in the general population, and emergency room visits for depression have been increasing for several years. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to an explosion of psychiatric emergency room visits for this reason, with an overall prevalence of anxiety and depression that appears to be increasing since 2020. The Centre Psychiatrique dâ€™Orientation et dâ€™Accueil is a regional psychiatric emergency service located in Paris which records approximately 10,000 consultations per year. Among these consultations, the main symptoms are those of depression (depressive ideations, anxiety) and nearly 40Â % are diagnosed with mood disorders, including depression. The management of the patient in the emergency room is based on a global evaluation, which should not be limited to the psychiatric interview. In the best case, and if compatible with the organization of the service, an initial evaluation by the nursing reception staff determines the context of the arrival of the patient, the reason and the degree of urgency of the consultation can thus be assessed from the outset. The request for care can come from the patient themself, but also from family and friends who are worried about a decline in the patient's previous condition. The consultation may also be triggered by the intervention of emergency services, particularly in the case of attempted suicide or agitation. The context of arrival, the environment, and the patient's entourage must be taken into account in order to achieve an optimal orientation. Particular attention must be paid to the first episodes (elimination of a differential diagnosis, screening for a possible bipolar disorder). The existence of an external causal factor or a comorbid personality disorder should not trivialize the consultation and lead to a faulty diagnosis of a characterized depressive episode. Drug treatment in the emergency room is usually symptomatic (anxiolytic treatment with benzodiazepines or neuroleptics, depending on the situation), and outpatient referral should always be preferred. Therapeutic adaptations can then be considered. The decision to hospitalize must always be justified, and consent for care must be rigorously evaluated. It is almost always necessary to take the patient's entourage into account as well as the potential support of the patient by the entourage. All these elements must be recorded in the file. Suicide risk assessment must be systematic for all patients consulting psychiatric emergencies, and the use of the RUD (Risk, Urgency, Dangerousness) grid can be useful. Any decision to release a patient with suicidal tendencies must be made strictly following certain conditions:a rapid psychiatric re-evaluation of the crisis, with for example the proposal of a post-emergency consultation, a supportive entourage, accepted symptomatic treatment. The registration of the suicidal patient in a monitoring system such as VigilanS can also be beneficial and reduce the risk of recidivism.","Todorov, Louise, Gourevitch, RaphaÃ«l","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2022.07.029","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annales MÃ©dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36310,""
"CAVAsa: Pharmacists' taking up a role in the detection and referral of patients with (unmet) mental and psychosocial needs","Background: The role of community pharmacists has recently evolved from a medication to a patient-centered basis. Moreover, the pharmacist is one of the most accessible first line healthcare providers. Due to COVID-19, a growing need to support people with psychosocial needs, like suffering from family violence or mental health problems, was noted. Purpose: This pilot study evaluates the added value and feasibility of pharmacists' taking up a role in the detection and referral of patients with (unmet) mental and psychosocial needs. Therefore, a collaboration between community pharmacies and psychosocial organisations was set up and evaluated using quantitative and qualitative indicators. Method: A project named CAVAsa was launched in 70 community pharmacies situated in 9 primary care zones in Flanders (Belgium). In eptember 2021, all participating pharmacists were trained to detect psychosocial needs, to inform and help patients and to refer them to a Flemish Center for General Welfare Work (CAW) if needed. Posters and informative leaflets are used to support pharmacists and to inform patients. All patient contacts in the context of the project, going from giving advice to a referral, are registered on an online registration platform and will be fully analysed in January. Moreover, eight focus groups were held in November 2021 to explore the perspective of the participating pharmacists on the project. Findings: Up to date, 50 patient contacts in the context of CAVAsa have been registered. Patients are dominantly female and middle-aged, and the majority of patients' needs relate to family problems and/or mental health problems. The focus groups revealed that pharmacists are willing to take up this role because patient wellbeing and personal assistance are key values of community pharmacy. However, the high workload (partly due to the pandemic) is one of the most important barriers for registration and referral. Good cooperation, coordination and close involvement between the partners (project management, social workers and pharmacists) were shown to be vital. Conclusion: Despite the good position of the community pharmacist to detect psychosocial needs and the willingness of the participants, some barriers exist for the implementation, especially time constraints. COVID-19 made this extra challenging. Nevertheless, we decided to further promote the project and to train and include more pharmacists in the nearby future.","Hutsebaut, C.; Rens, E.; Ghijselings, A.; Scheepers, J.; Deneyer, H.; Cautaers, A.; Van Den Broeck, K.; Foulon, V.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-022-01407-6","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy; 44(3):803-804, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36311,""
"Establishing and developing a paediatric psychodermatology service and our experience of a new paediatric psychodermatology clinic during the Covid 19 pandemic","Children and young people (CYP) with skin and hair conditions are at an increased risk of mental health problems and vice versa. Current child and adolescent mental health services are already stretched and in our experience, this unique combination of symptoms and signs requires a multi-disciplinary approach. We report our experience of establishing a paediatric psychodermatology clinic where, at each appointment, CYP are seen by a consultant dermatologist and a clinical psychologist initially jointly and then individually to ensure all viewpoints are heard and a collaborative treatment plan can be agreed. The clinic was established one month prior to the national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and the face-to-face model was converted to a virtual format. CYP are now seen either face to face or virtually according to CYP/parent/carer preference and this hybrid model increases accessibility and has reduced DNA rates. Referrals were received from primary, secondary and tertiary care settings. Thirty ?six new patients were seen and followed-up over a 2Â year period, age range 3?17 years old. The majority of patients presented with compulsive hair pulling (trichotillomania) and medically unexplained signs (dermatitis artefacta);other problems seen were eczema, skin picking and acne. Half of the patients required additional psychology sessions. Seventy-six percent of patients have been discharged, almost half back to the care of their general practitioner. We use pre- and post-clinic questionnaires and share these and feedback from CYP/families who have found this clinic model helpful and effective.","Sears, Alison V.; Ali, Rukshana, Oâ€™Connor, Jane, Baron, Susannah","https://doi.org/10.1002/ski2.151","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Skin Health and Disease; n/a(n/a):e151, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36312,""
"PERSPECTIVES on MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION in PEDIATRIC PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: A CALL to ACTION","The already high rates of anxiety and depression among healthy children have increased further since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020. Pre-pandemic data suggest children with chronic disease were already experiencing increased rates of anxiety and depression as compared to their healthy peers. There is currently a paucity of literature on the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with pediatric pulmonary hypertension. In addition, there are no practice recommendations regarding mental health screening in this population. We evaluated provider perception of mental health screening at fourteen pediatric pulmonary hypertension care centers across the United States and Canada utilizing a cross-sectional survey. Thirty-seven providers from fourteen pediatric pulmonary hypertension centers in North America completed the survey. Health care providers caring for pediatric pulmonary hypertension patients perceive their patient cohort to frequently experience anxiety and depression. In addition, these providers believe that their patients would benefit from formalized, and routine, assessment of anxiety and depression with referral to mental health services as appropriate. Barriers to current mental health services were identified. This highlights the need to better understand the prevalence of anxiety and depression in pediatric pulmonary hypertension patients and to establish formal mental health screening practices within pediatric pulmonary hypertension care centers.","Parker, C.; Whalen, E.; McSweeney, J.; Brown, A.; Usha Raj, J.; Mullen, M.

"Macroeconomic effects of global policy and financial risks","Globalization has brought larger spillovers of global risks across borders since the 2000s. Specifically, global policy risk has sharply increased due to policy uncertainty in major countries in the recent decade as are shown in the Brexit, the US-China trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper empirically investigates effects of both global policy risk and global financial risk on macroeconomy and financial markets in eight major countries from January 1997 to June 2020. We employed a structural vector autoregressive framework to obtain interesting empirical results. First, global risks have recessionary effects on the macroeconomy, reducing production, deteriorating employment, lowering long-term interest rates, depressing prices and reducing global trade. Second, global risks also have recessionary effects on financial markets, plunging stock prices, appreciating the safe-haven currencies and depreciating the other currencies. Third, the macroeconomies and the financial markets respond to the global financial risk more significantly than the global policy risk. Fourth, the recessionary effects of global risks vary depending on countries.","Ogawa, E.; Luo, P.

"A comparison of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the quality of teaching of medical students in Poland and the Czech Republic","The Covid-19 pandemic has changed many areas of life. It influenced the students' well-being and the ways of learning. Universities have taken up online learning, introducing innovations in many fields. How were students in different countries perceived? How did these changes affect the teaching process? The study compares traditional learning methods in Poland and the Czech Republic. But also the changes and innovations introduced in the learning process during a pandemic. The similarities and differences in teaching models are described. Two Universities where the subject of Biochemistry was taught to medical students (Charles University, Prague, and Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow) were compared. The study was attended by students of the second year of medicine. As a research tool, a questionnaire created for the study was used to measure the mood of the respondents and the impact on behavior while studying during a pandemic. 276 people participated in the study (111 from Poland, 165 from the Czech Republic, including 192 women, 82 men, 2 others). The results are presented in the form of graphs as % of the number of answers given. The survey was divided into 2 parts, one referring to mental health and the other to the quality of education. The study revealed several significant differences between the two countries. Analysis shows that lockdown in Poland did not have such a negative impact on students' extra-curricular activities as in the Czech Republic, and Poles also felt less isolated. Czechs seem to show lower levels of stress in the pandemic situation, and they also indicated significantly more often that the University was able to provide them with psychological support. Charles University students rate the quality of education better than UJ CM students after switching to online learning, which is expressed in such indicators as the standard of materials prepared by instructors, lecturer involvement, and participation during classes.","Patena, M.; Lasota, M.; Wadowska, Z.; Rybak, J.; Kulda, V.; Jagusiak, A.","https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13440","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: FEBS Open Bio; 12:333, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36318,""
"ANALYSIS ON THE INFLUENCE OF CHINESE NATIONAL COMMUNITY AWARENESS EDUCATION ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' ANXIETY IN THE POST EPIDEMIC ERA","Background: The global spread of the COVID-19 has brought great damage to the economic development, infrastructure and social development of various countries, and has also had a huge negative impact on people 's daily life, work and study, bringing a lot of inconvenience. In the fear and tension of the epidemic, the psychological state of college students is worrying and prone to anxiety. Anxiety will affect the secretion of body hormones and the normal operation of organ functions, damage the physical and mental health of patients, and even seriously damage the cerebral cortex of patients, resulting in cognitive impairment, cognitive disorders, emotional and mental disorders and other diseases with different symptom dimensions. Based on learning psychology, the study explored the psychological changes of students in their study and life, and puts forward the idea of educating students on the consciousness of the Chinese nation community, so as to strengthen students' beliefs, improve students' psychological cognition, and avoid students ' anxiety. Subjects and methods: Experiment design in a university. First, recruit volunteer students on the platform to cooperate with the experiment to complete the research. A total of 132 students were recruited. After screening, 80 students were left as experimental subjects. The two groups of the Institute are mainly composed of 80 students. They are respectively expressed as intervention and control groups, for subjects who were subject to research intervention, in addition to the normal courses, they also received the awareness education of the Chinese national community based on school psychology;For the control group, only normal courses were accepted. Under different education modes, after three months of college education, the degree of anxiety and learning outcomes of the subjects of the two teams were compared. Results: Students were investigated anonymously by using the self-made College Students' Anxiety survey scale (CSAQ). Students filled in all the options on the college students ' anxiety survey scale, collected them, and counted and analyzed the scores of the college students' anxiety survey scale. Under different education modes, after three months of college education, the average score of the people who were intervened by the study design was higher than that of those who were intervened by the common method the research group is much lower than that of the control group. Conclusions: Most contemporary college students' growth environment and learning environment are relatively smooth, and they rarely experience setbacks, so their psychological tolerance is generally poor. In the fear and tension of the epidemic situation, college students are easy to have anxiety. Under the guidance of learning psychology, the study puts forward the education of the consciousness of the Chinese nation community for students, so as to strengthen students' beliefs and relieve students' anxiety.","Zhong, Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=ANALYSIS+ON+THE+INFLUENCE+OF+CHINESE+NATIONAL+COMMUNITY+AWARENESS+EDUCATION+ON+COLLEGE+STUDENTS'+ANXIETY+IN+THE+POST+EPIDEMIC+ERA","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 34:S1023-S1028, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36319,""

Dance therapy, as a novel treatment for mental illness, originates from the integrated development of modem dance art and psychology. Dance therapy is one of the most effective therapies for mental illness and attracts the attention of many scholars at home and abroad. It is increasingly accepted and valued by people nowadays. Subjects and methods: This paper conducts a two-month moderate-intensity dance therapy on 65 adults with depression. Analysis is carried out on the specific effect of dance therapy with depression patients during the COVID-19. Methods of mathematical statistics is adopted by the study. Results: The overall depression severity of women is higher than that of men (t = -2.025, P &lt; 0.05) at the 95% confidence level. There is a significant difference in depression at the 0.001 level before and after dance therapy (t = 22.059, P &lt; 0.001). The participation degree in dance therapy affects the therapeutic effect of dance therapy at a significant level of 0.001 (t = 10.108, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The overall depression severity of patients is affected by gender and pandemic awareness level and the overall depression severity of women is higher than that of men during the COVID-19. The higher the pandemic awareness level, the lower the depression degree. Dance therapy can effectively improve depression, which is affected by the participation degree in dance therapy. The higher the participation degree, the better the therapeutic effect.","Zhang, Z.; Wang, Y.

"EFFECT OF DANCE PERFORMANCE ON ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION PATIENTS","Background: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the overall proportion of patients with depression has been increasing. Dance therapy is a kind of expressive art therapy and has a good effect on the treatment of mental diseases. In China, there is still a lack of research on the treatment of depression by dance therapy. This study explores the effect of dance therapy on the adjuvant treatment of depression patients through experimental and statistical analysis. Subjects and methods: The study selected 124 patients with depression as research subjects. Under the circumstance that the patients have received conventional drug treatment and psychological support care, the test groups received an additional adjuvant dance therapy of different frequencies for one month. A total of seven tests were conducted before and after. The HAVID scale was used to test the depression status of the patients, and the statistical tool SPSS27.0 was used to analyze the experimental data. Results: The data of the test group 1 and the control group showed a difference at the 0.05 significance level (t = -2.955, P = 0.025 &lt; 0.05). The data of the test group 2 and the control group showed a difference at the 0.01 significance level (t = 4.086, P = 0.006 &lt; 0.01). The data between the test group 3 and the control group was significantly different at 0.05 level (t = 3.437, P = 0.014 &lt; 0.05). Before and after dance treatment, the GSES scores of patients in each test group were significantly different at 0.001 level. Conclusions: Dance therapy can effectively relieve the depression of patients, and has a good auxiliary effect on the current drug therapy or psychological therapy for patients. In addition, the effect of dance therapy for a long time of 30-45 minutes is better than that of a short period.","Yang, L.; You, X.","https://www.google.com/search?q=EFFECT+OF+DANCE+PERFORMANCE+ON+ADJUVANT+THERAPY+FOR+DEPRESSION+PATIENTS","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 34:S978-S982, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36321,""

"Effect of communication with mobile devices in hospitalized patients due to COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: To identify the effect of mobile communication devices on the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Controlled clinical trial, done from December 2020 to May 2021 in which patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, both sexes, older than 18 years, with O2 saturation greater than 70% and lesser than 90% at admission were included. Two groups were formed, the independent variable was the availability of a mobile device: Group 1: patients with communication with relatives through video calls and Group 2: patients without communication with relatives. Dependent variables were days of in-hospital stay, hospitalization costs, comorbidities, complications, outcome: death or discharge, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: The most frequent complications were: metabolic disorder, endotracheal intubation and multiple organ failure, there were no significant differences between groups. The average length of in-hospital stay was 12.64 days, there were no differences between the two groups and no differences were found in the outcome. The cost per patient (bed days, medications, paraclinical studies and imaging studies) was 110,848.59 Mexican pesos (5542 American dollars). CONCLUSIONS: The use of mobile communication devices in the areas did not improve the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Las variables dependientes fueron dÃ­as de estancia intrahospitalaria, costos de hospitalizaciÃ³n, comorbilidades, complicaciones, desenlace: defunciÃ³n o alta, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n. RESULTADOS: Las complicaciones mÃ¡s frecuentes fueron: descontrol metabÃ³lico, intubaciÃ³n endotraqueal e insuficiencia orgÃ¡nica mÃºltiple, no hubo diferencias significativas entre los grupos. El promedio de dÃ­as de hospitalizaciÃ³n fue de 12.64 dÃ­as, no hubo diferencias entre ambos grupos y tampoco se encontraron en el desenlace. El costo por paciente (dÃ­as-cama, medicamentos, estudios paraclÃ­nicos y estudios de gabinete) fue de 110,848.59 pesos mexicanos (5542 dÃ³lares estadounidenses). CONCLUSIONES: El uso de dispositivos mÃ³viles de comunicaciÃ³n en las Ã¡reas no mejorÃ³ la evoluciÃ³n clÃ­nica de pacientes hospitalizados con diagnÃ³stico de neumonÃ­a por COVID-19. Tampoco disminuyÃ³ los costos de atenciÃ³n ni los dÃ­as de hospitalizaciÃ³n.

"NORTH TO THE FUTURE: A NEW ASYNCHRONOUS DELIVERY OF THE CLASSIC ""FLORA CLASS"" AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS","Alaska is relatively isolated from the rest of the United States, due to its distance, size and widespread population. Online course delivery is a valuable alternative to on-campus enrollment for many of the rural students in our state. Introduction to the Flora of Alaska and Systematic Botany are now being offered as fully online courses with a lab component. These courses taught both online, and in the classroom (COVID-19 depending), are versions of the first author's own experiences taking these same classes taught by Don Pinkava at Arizona State University. His legacy as an intrepid botanist and inspiring educator influenced how I (Steffi Ickert-Bond) approached developing my own teaching style. The course design presented reflects some of Don Pinkava's rigorous detailed and challenging course content and innovative labs. The devoted teacher he was, Dr. Pinkava left for us a comprehensive statement outlining his teaching principles he had acquired over many years (Appendix 1). As a student of Don's, I have applied those teaching principles to my own courses. To create a lab experience like Don's classes, I have carefully chosen technology that will allow students from all over the state (and even outside Alaska) to have a hands-on learning experience. Using cutting-edge virtual herbaria they collect data, and perform plant dissections within the flora's native environment. Instead of traditional course materials like textbooks, students use an inexpensive wide-angle macro lens to take high-resolution, detailed photos of flora on the go. The technology not only lets students mimic lab spaces in their own areas but also expands their digital networks through the submission of images to iNaturalist, enabling them to share and collaborate with enthusiasts around the world. Students must get outside, touch with their hands and share what they discover. In combining traditional methods with modern technologies such as virtual, streaming dissections students develop skills and confidence with the microscope and dissection techniques just as much as I did in Don's in person Flora of Arizona class in 1993. Today the Introduction to the Flora of Alaska (BIOL190), and Systematic Botany (BIOL331) are both exciting intersections highlighting a curiosity for wild plants, an exploration of Alaska's plant communities as well as a great introduction to the science of botany. Don's Flora of Arizona took us students to those same crossroads. Together with my colleague Dr. Ute Kaden who teaches STEM methodology at the School of Education, UAF we describe effective course design elements for online delivery of a biology course and the challenges that come with it. Some student feedback after the first semester running will be presented here as well.

La entrega de cursos en lÃ­nea es una alternativa valiosa a la inscripciÃ³n en el campus para muchos de los estudiantes rurales de nuestro estado. IntroducciÃ³n a la Flora de Alaska y BotÃ¡nica SistemÃ¡tica ahora se ofrecen como cursos completamente en lÃ­nea con un componente de laboratorio. Estos cursos impartidos tanto en lÃ­nea como en el aula (dependiendo de COVID-19), son versiones de las propias experiencias del primer autor al tomar estas mismas clases impartidas por Don Pinkava en la Universidad Estatal de Arizona. Su legado como botÃ¡nico intrÃ©pido y educador inspirador influyÃ³ en cÃ³mo yo (Steffi Ickert-Bond) abordÃ© el desarrollo de mi propio estilo de enseÃ±anza. El diseÃ±o del curso presentado refleja algunos de los contenidos rigurosos, detallados y desafiantes del curso y los laboratorios innovadores de Don Pinkava. El devoto maestro que fue, el Dr. Pinkava nos dejÃ³ una declaraciÃ³n completa que describe los principios de enseÃ±anza que habÃ­a adquirido durante muchos aÃ±os (ApÃ©ndice 1). Como estudiante de Don, he aplicado esos principios de enseÃ±anza a mis propios cursos. Para crear una experiencia de laboratorio como las clases de Don, he elegido cuidadosamente la tecnologÃ­a que permitirÃ¡ a los estudiantes de todo el estado (e incluso fuera de Alaska) tener una experiencia de aprendizaje prÃ¡ctica. Utilizando herbarios virtuales de Ãºltima generaciÃ³n, recopilan datos y realizan disecciones de plantas dentro del entorno nativo de la flora. En lugar de los materiales tradicionales del curso, como los libros de texto, los estudiantes usan una lente macro gran angular econÃ³mica para tomar fotografÃ­as detalladas de alta resoluciÃ³n de la flora sobre la marcha. La tecnologÃ­a no solo permite a los estudiantes imitar espacios de laboratorio en sus propias Ã¡reas, sino que tambiÃ©n expande sus redes digitales mediante el envÃ­o de imÃ¡genes a iNaturalist, lo que les permite compartir y colaborar con entusiastas de todo el mundo. Los estudiantes deben salir, tocar con las manos y compartir lo que descubren. Al combinar mÃ©todos tradicionales con tecnologÃ­as modernas, como disecciones virtuales, los estudiantes desarrollan habilidades y confianza con el microscopio y las tÃ©cnicas de disecciÃ³n tanto como lo hice en la clase presencial de Flora de Arizona de Don en 1993. Hoy en dÃ­a, la IntroducciÃ³n a la Flora de Alaska (BIOL190) y Systematic Botany (BIOL331) son interesantes intersecciones que destacan la curiosidad por las plantas silvestres, una exploraciÃ³n de las comunidades de plantas de Alaska y una gran introducciÃ³n a la ciencia de la botÃ¡nica. Don's Flora of Arizona nos llevÃ³ a los estudiantes a esa misma encrucijada. Junto con mi colega, la Dra. Ute Kaden, quien enseÃ±a metodologÃ­a STEM en la Facultad de EducaciÃ³n de la UAF, describimos elementos de diseÃ±o de cursos efectivos para la entrega en lÃ­nea de un curso de biologÃ­a y los desafÃ­os que conlleva.

"Evaluation of Psychiatric Symptoms in 2-5 Years Old Children Who Are Followed and Treated with the Diagnosis of Wheezing during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Levels of Mothers","Objective: The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adults is a candidate to be one of the most current issues in healthcare in the near future. This study aimed to determine the clinical course of patients diagnosed with wheezing, to make emotional, behavioral, social, and psychiatric evaluations, and to investigate the possible effect of the pandemic on disease follow-up and treatment by evaluating the psychiatric conditions of their mothers. Material and Methods: The study included 58 patients diagnosed with a wheezy infant aged 2-5 years. Data regarding the sociodemographic characteristics and wheezing history of the patients were recorded. 'Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK)' was applied to evaluate their current clinical condition. For psychiatric evaluation, the 'Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ)' was applied to the patients, and the 'Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS 21)' and 'The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)' were administered to their mothers. Results: In our study, it was observed that our patients experienced emotional, behavioral, peer, and social problems at varying rates (17-43%) during the pandemic period. It was especially noteworthy that emotional problems were seen more frequently in girls. It has been shown that there is a positive relationship between depression scores in mothers and SDQ Total Scores of their children. On the other hand, it was observed that current disease control status, hospitalization history, and whether or not being symptomatic during the pandemic period did not contribute to mental impairment in mothers. Conclusion: The detection of high overall difficulty scores in children of mothers with high depression scores indicates that there is a need to evaluate maternal and child mental health together. Psychological influence is multifactorial and varies between societies. There is a need for studies on a larger scale that take familial and individual variables into account.

"Mobile phone enabled mental health monitoring to enhance diagnosis for severity assessment of behaviours: a review","Mental health issues are a serious consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, influencing about 700 million people worldwide. These physiological issues need to be consistently observed on the people through non-invasive devices such as smartphones, and fitness bands in order to remove the burden of having the conciseness of continuously being monitored. On the other hand, technological improvements have enhanced the abilities and roles of conventional mobile phones from simple communication to observations and improved accessibility in terms of size and price may reflect growing familiarity with the smartphone among a vast number of consumers. As a result of continuous monitoring, together with various embedded sensors in mobile phones, raw data can be converted into useful information about the actions and behaviors of the consumers. Thus, the aim of this comprehensive work concentrates on the literature work done so far in the prediction of mental health issues via passive monitoring data from smartphones. This study also explores the way users interact with such self-monitoring technologies and what challenges they might face. We searched several electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Libraries, Soups, APA PsycInfo, and Mendeley Data) for published studies that are relevant to focus on the topic and English language proficiency from January 2015 to December 2020. We identified 943 articles, of which 115 articles were eligible for this scoping review based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria carried out manually. These studies provided various works regarding smartphones for health monitoring such as Physical activity (26.0 percent;30/115), Mental health analysis (27.8 percent;32/115), Student specific monitoring (15.6 percent;18/115) are the three analyses carried out predominantly.","Gopalakrishnan, Abinaya, Venkataraman, Revathi, Gururajan, Raj, Zhou, Xujuan, Genrich, Rohan","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1042","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PeerJ Computer Science;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36337,""

"What role of the cGAS-STING pathway plays in chronic pain?","Chronic pain interferes with daily functioning and is frequently accompanied by depression. Currently, traditional clinic treatments do not produce satisfactory analgesic effects and frequently result in various adverse effects. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) serve as innate cellular sensors of danger signals, sense invading microorganisms, and initiate innate and adaptive immune responses. Among them, cGAS-STING alerts on the presence of both exogenous and endogenous DNA in the cytoplasm, and this pathway has been closely linked to multiple diseases, including auto-inflammation, virus infection, and cancers. Growing numbers of evidence suggest that cGAS-STING pathway involves in the chronic pain process, however, its role remains controversial. In this narrative review, we summarize the recent findings on the involvement of the cGAS-STING pathway in chronic pain, as well as several possible mechanisms underlying its activation. As a new area of research, this review is unique in considering the cGAS-STING pathway in sensory neurons and glial cells as part of a broader understanding of pain, including potential mechanisms of inflammation, immunity, apoptosis and autophagy. It will provide new insight into the treatment of pain in the future.","Wu, Jingxiang, Li, Xin, Zhang, Xiaoxuan, Wang, Wei, You, Xingji","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2022.963206","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36343,""

"Mental Health of Immigrants in a Shelter in Tabasco, Mexico During the COVID-19 Epidemic; Salud mental de personas migrantes en un refugio de Tabasco, MÃ©xico durante la epidemia de COVID-19","ABSTRACT  Introduction: Migration is a global phenomenon that must be recognized as a social determinant of health. In 2020, there were 280 million international migrants in the world. Undoubtedly, Mexico plays a fundamental role in transnational migration due to the large flow of migrants who transit through its borders. Research on mental health and migration suggests a high prevalence of mental disorders due to the conditions of the migration process; this scenario may be aggravated as result of the health contingency caused by COVID-19. Methodology: This research is intended to identify the relationship between the mental health of migrants, the migratory process, and the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, it is a qualitative study with a deductive approach. A sample evaluation of Central American migrants living in a shelter in Tabasco, Mexico in December 2020 was used. Results: Some factors impact the mental health of migrants in the place of origin and during transit (forced migration, persecution, and the lack of possibilities to achieve a decent standard of living...). Moreover, positive, and negative manifestations were reported in the dimensions of mental health, because of the migratory process and COVID-19. Conclusions: Migration has become an option for survival and well-being given the limited opportunities that exist in the regions of origin. Efforts must be made to develop migration and health policies that benefit this group. Unfortunately, some limitations of data collection emerged due to Covid 19. Finally, it is suggested to replicate the study among other areas of the southern border of Mexico with a high flow of migrants.; RESUMEN La migraciÃ³n es un fenÃ³meno mundial que se debe reconocer como un factor social determinante de la salud. En 2020 habÃ­a en el mundo 280 millones de migrantes internacionales y MÃ©xico juega un papel fundamental para la migraciÃ³n transnacional debido al gran flujo de personas migrantes que transitan por sus fronteras. Las investigaciones sobre salud mental y migraciÃ³n sugieren una alta prevalencia de trastornos mentales, este es un escenario que puede empeorar debido a la contingencia por la COVID-19. MetodologÃ­a: Esta investigaciÃ³n tuvo como objetivo identificar la relaciÃ³n entre la salud mental de las personas migrantes, con el proceso migratorio y la epidemia de COVID-19. Estudio cualitativo con enfoque deductivo. Se utilizÃ³ una muestra opinÃ¡tica de migrantes centroamericanas que habitaban en un refugio de Tabasco, MÃ©xico en diciembre de 2020. Resultados: Se reportaron manifestaciones positivas y negativas en las dimensiones de la salud mental debido al proceso migratorio y COVID-19. Conclusiones: Hay factores que impactan en la salud mental de los migrantes en el lugar de origen y durante su trÃ¡nsito (migraciÃ³n forzada, persecuciÃ³n, falta de posibilidades para una vida digna...). La migraciÃ³n se ha convertido en una opciÃ³n de supervivencia dadas las limitadas oportunidades que existen en las regiones de origen. Se deben realizar esfuerzos para desarrollar polÃ­ticas migratorias y de salud que beneficien a este grupo. Debido a la epidemia surgieron limitaciones para la recolecciÃ³n de datos pero se sugiere replicar el estudio en otras zonas de la frontera sur de MÃ©xico con alto flujo de migrantes.","CANO COLLADO, LUZ ALEJANDRA; HERNÃNDEZ, MARTA; PRIEGO ÃLVAREZ, HEBERTO ROMEO","http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0120-55522021000300583","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: Salud UNINORTE;37(3): 583-609, sep.-dic. 2021. tab, graf; Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36345,""
"Concern because of COVID-19, Social Support at Work, and Anxiety as Predictors of Depression in Peruvian Nurses; PreocupaciÃ³n por el contagio de la COVID-19, apoyo social en el trabajo y ansiedad como predictores de la depresiÃ³n en enfermeras peruanas","RESUMEN  Objetivo: Determinar si la preocupaciÃ³n por la COVID-19, el apoyo social y la ansiedad son predictores de la depresiÃ³n en enfermeras peruanas durante la emergencia sanitaria.  Material y mÃ©todos:  Estudio predictivo de corte transversal, realizado en 216 enfermeras peruanas, a quienes se aplicÃ³ la Escala de Apoyo Social en el Trabajo (EAST), la Escala de PreocupaciÃ³n por la COVID-19 (EPPC-Cov19), la Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2) y el Patient Health Questionnarie-2 (PHQ-2). Los datos se analizaron mediante coeficientes de correlaciÃ³n y modelos de regresiÃ³n lineal mÃºltiple.  Resultados: Se reportaron correlaciones significativas entre la preocupaciÃ³n por la CO-VID-19, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n. Los anÃ¡lisis de regresiÃ³n muestran un ajuste adecuado del modelo (Prueba F = 76,064, p &lt; .001), donde la preocupaciÃ³n por el contagio de la COVID-19 (&#946; = ,316, p &lt; .01) y la ansiedad (&#946; = ,417, p &lt; .01) son variables que predicen significativamente la depresiÃ³n en enfermeras peruanas (R2 ajustado = .39). Asimismo, los valores t de los coeficientes de regresiÃ³n beta de las variables predictoras son altamente significativas (p &lt; 0.01).

Data were analyzed using correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression models.  Results: Significant correlations were reported between concern over COVID-19, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses show adequate model fit (F-test = 76.064, p &lt; .001), where concern about COVID-19 (&#946; = ,316, p &lt; .01) and anxiety (&#946; = ,417, p &lt; .01), are variables that significantly predict depression in Peruvian nurses (adjusted R2 = .39). Likewise, the t-values of the beta regression coefficients of the predictor variables are highly significant (p &lt; .01).  Conclusion: It is concluded that experiencing concern about COVID-19 infection and anxiety predict the occurrence of depressive symptoms in Peruvian nurses that found themselves working in the context of the health emergency.","CARRANZA ESTEBAN, RENZO FELIPE; MAMANI-BENITO, OSCAR; QUINTEROS-ZÃšÃ‘IGA, DÃMARIS; CAYCHO-RODRÃGUEZ, TOMÃS; BLANCO SHOCOSH, DARWIN","http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0120-55522021000300539","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: Salud UNINORTE;37(3): 539-552, sep.-dic. 2021. tab; Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36346,""
"Prescribing safe supply: ethical considerations for clinicians","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the drug poisoning epidemic in a number of ways: individuals use alone more often, there is decreased access to harm reduction services and there has been an increase in the toxicity of the unregulated drug supply. In response to the crisis, clinicians, policy makers and people who use drugs have been seeking ways to prevent the worst harms of unregulated opioid use. One prominent idea is safe supply. One form of safe supply enlists clinicians to prescribe opioids so that people have access to drugs of known composition and strength. In this paper, we assess the ethical case for clinicians providing this service. As we describe, there is much that is unknown about safe supply. However, given the seriousness of the overdose death epidemic and the current limited evidence for safe supply's efficacy, we argue that it is ethically permissible for clinicians to begin prescribing opioids for some select patients.","Duthie, Mathison, Eyford, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.1136/jme-2021-108087","20220819","ethics; substance-related disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36347,""
"A Pediatrician's Guide to Working with Children on the Autism Spectrum in Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Beyond: Retrospect and Prospect","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event with devastating effects on children and families, highlighting and broadening disparities in the care of children with developmental disabilities, while simultaneously catalyzing innovation. Children are vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19, resulting in increased stress, anxiety, isolation, and health challenges, further amplified in autistic children and children with other neurodevelopmental disabilities. These children are uniquely vulnerable due to communication impairments, comorbid medical disorders, reduced adaptability, and reliance on therapeutic interventions. Abrupt reduction in services and access to care during the pandemic compromised physical and mental health and led to missed intervention opportunities at critical times. It is important to examine the effects that the pandemic triggered, address deficiencies, and recognize new opportunities to improve systems of care to prepare for unforeseen futures.","Sabapathy, Goss, Borelli, Steinberg-Epstein","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yapd.2022.04.001","20220819","Adapt; Autism; COVID-19; Health; Pandemic; Resilience; Services; Vulnerable","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36348,""
"Precarity and the pandemic: The impact of COVID-19 on single men living alone","Existing research reveals that single men living alone are at a heightened risk of isolation and precarity. This study traced the impact of the pandemic on the daily lives of a group of single men over three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. A qualitative longitudinal study with older people aged 50 and over (n=102), interviewed by telephone in 2020-2021. This analysis focuses on a sub-sample comprising single men (n=16) who lived alone and were interviewed three times (n=48). The men were White British, Black and Asian, age 58-88, and were identified as facing difficulties in their lives arising from long-term health problems and or/social isolation. Participants were asked about the impact of, and response to, three lockdowns. Data were analysed using themes identified in the secondary literature using thematic and longitudinal analysis. For single men living alone, precarity intensified during the pandemic due to worsening physical and/or mental health combined with restricted access to relationships and activities. Key moments in the life course influenced how these men experienced and viewed the impact of COVID-19. This analysis sheds light on the deepening precarity of older men living alone during the pandemic, highlighting the emergence of new vulnerabilities for some. The findings emphasise the need, given the likelihood of future waves of the pandemic, to target support at those living alone, particularly in relation to the provision of community health services, social infrastructure, and combatting digital exclusion.","Lewis, Phillipson, Lang, Yarker","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnac129","20220819","Isolation; LGBTQ+; Life course; Relationships; Social exclusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36349,""
"Child Mental Health and Sleep Disturbances During the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","Many children have experienced unprecedented levels of stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures, strained resources, and excess morbidity and mortality. The current study examines change in children's mental health and sleep during the early months of the US pandemic and identifies risk and protective factors. In May 2020, a total of 225 parents reported on the mental health and sleep of each child (N = 392 children) living in their household prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and about their functioning in the past month. McNemar's test examined change in mental health and sleep disturbance across developmental stage. Bivariate and multivariate generalized estimating equations examined predictors of change in mental health and sleep. Each age group showed a significant change in mental health and sleep outcomes, but the development of mental health problems was greater for older children. Parental caregiving strain (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-5.27) was identified as a risk factor associated with children developing anxiety, and income loss was associated with developing sleep disturbances (aOR = 2.34; 95% CI, 1.06-5.17). Parental receipt of emotional support was identified as a protective factor for all child health outcomes. Policies and interventions that promote access to mental health services, provide financial safety nets, and strengthen social support networks for families are needed.","Dayton, Kong, Powell, Bowie, Rebok, Strickland, Latkin","https://doi.org/10.1097/FCH.0000000000000338","20220819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36350,""
"Profiles of mental health and their association with negative impacts and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Canadian perspective","Mental health among Canadians has worsened since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to identify profiles of mental health difficulties and to quantify the relationships between mental health profiles, negative impacts related to the pandemic and suicidal ideation. Participants were 22,721 adults (18 years and older) from the 2020 and 2021 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health. Latent profile analysis was used to identify patterns of anxiety, depression and psychological distress. The relationships between mental health profiles, negative impacts and suicidal ideation were examined using logistic regression models. Three mental health profiles were identified. Individuals were classified as having no mental health difficulties (Profile 1, 65.70%), low-to-moderate mental health difficulties (Profile 2, 25.52%) and severe mental health difficulties (Profile 3, 8.78%). Individuals in Profiles 2 and 3 were at greater odds than individuals in Profile 1 of experiencing emotional distress; the death of a family member, friend or colleague; difficulty in meeting financial obligations or essential needs; the loss of a job or income; feelings of loneliness or isolation; physical health problems; challenges in personal relationships with household members; and other impacts. Individuals in Profile 2 (4.27%, odds ratio (OR) = 24.30) and Profile 3 (19.09%, odds ratio (OR) = 115.75) were considerably more likely to have contemplated suicide since the onset of the pandemic compared with those in Profile 1 (0.16%). Individuals who experienced high levels of anxiety, depression and psychological distress were most vulnerable to negative impacts related to the pandemic and suicidal ideation.","Guerrero, Barnes","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202200800002-eng","20220819","anxiety; depression; latent profile analysis; psychological distress; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36351,""
"Acceptability of Telehealth for Multidiagnostic Suicidal Patients in a Real-World Dialectical Behavior Therapy Clinic During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> <i>This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) delivered through telehealth to complex, suicidal patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.</i> <b><i>Methods:</i></b> <i>We surveyed 163 adult participants enrolled in outpatient services at a private, free-standing DBT clinic certified by the DBT-Linehan Board of Certification for its fidelity to the treatment. Treatment satisfaction was assessed, as well as ease of telehealth over time, differences in satisfaction between patients who had previously experienced face-to-face treatment and those who had only experienced telehealth, patients' beliefs regarding the impact of telehealth on their progress, and preference for face-to-face versus telehealth services. Additionally, participants' reasons for liking and disliking telehealth were reported.</i> <b><i>Results:</i></b> <i>The average overall satisfaction rating was 82.26 (Ã‚Â±18.71) on a 100-point scale. Factors identified as being relevant to satisfaction included increased access to care, saving time and money, and increased comfort participating in therapy from home. Factors identified as relevant to dissatisfaction included feeling less connected to therapists and other patients. The majority of participants reported that telehealth positively impacted or did not impact treatment progress. Satisfaction was significantly related to participants' perception of telehealth's impact on progress in treatment.

"Were we happy and we didn't know it? A subjective dynamic and financial assessment pre-, during and post-COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many changes into people's lives. Fear, job insecurity, changes in their financial stability, concerns about their future lives have changed the entire lives of people and have affected the cognitive well-being of individuals. The purpose of the present analysis is to measure how the COVID-19 pandemic, along with financial factors, has affected the perceived level of well-being of individuals. We are also interested whether there are differences between life before COVID-19, life now with COVID-19, and life after the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of future expectations. To address this objective, we performed an ANOVA approach and a GLM estimate on repeated measures for a large sample (1572 respondents) from 43 worldwide countries, during the period May 2020 and July 2021. Our results show that financial factors reflected by both the size of income and changes in personal or family income affect the levels of happiness. Robustness checks using stress as an alternative estimator for happiness have consolidated our results. Additionally, we find that well-being during COVID-19 compared to the previous period decreased, while in future, people expect to be happier, but not more than in the past when they did not know about the existence of this virus. This is one of the first studies to investigate the relationship between happiness and income before, during, and after COVID-19. These findings are important for policymakers to improve the conditions of living in the areas of health and financial stability.","MureÃˆâ„¢an, VÃ„Æ’idean, Mare, Achim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-022-01506-1","20220819","COVID-19; Financial stability; Happiness; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36353,""
"Avoidant and borderline personality disorder patients during the first Covid-19 wave in Norway - a survey-based comparison of therapy changes and patients' accommodations","Patients with personality disorders (PDs) often have insecure attachment patterns and may be especially vulnerable to abrupt treatment changes. Patients with borderline PD (BPD) are often considered vulnerable to treatment interruption due to chronic fear of abandonment. Nonetheless, other PDs are poorly investigated. In the first Covid-19 wave in Norway, in-person treatment facilities and group treatments were strongly restricted from March 12th until May/June 2020. To examine and compare changes in outpatient treatment for patients with avoidant (AvPD) and BPD during the first Covid-19 wave in Norway, and patients' reactions to these changes. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey distributed to 1120 patients referred to 12 different PD treatment units on a specialist mental health service level within the Norwegian Network for Personality Disorders. The survey included questions on treatment situation, immediate reactions, and changes during the crisis. From 133 responders (response rate 12%), 40 patients reported BPD and 30 AvPD as diagnosis. All patients were followed up from their therapist after March 12th. Almost all patients in both groups expressed satisfaction under the new circumstances. Both groups experienced the same regularity as before, but more AvPD patients reported less than weekly consultations. AvPD patients reported more negative feelings about changes in therapy, and missed the therapy and group members more than the BPD group. After the lockdown, BPD patients received a closer follow-up than AvPD patients, and the latter reported more negative feelings related to change in their treatment situation.","Zahl, Pedersen, Eikenaes, StÃƒÂ¤nicke, Wilberg, Baltzersen, Pettersen, Hummelen, Arnevik, Johansen, Hartveit Kvarstein","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2022.2110614","20220819","Avoidant personality disorder; Covid-19; borderline personality disorder; telepsychiatry; treatment changes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36354,""
"Effect of COVID-19 on quality of life of persons aged &gt;70 years with adult spinal deformity: A cross-sectional case-control study","This observational, cross-sectional case-control study evaluates the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in elderly persons who have undergone surgery for adult spinal deformity (ASD). On December 31, 2019, the Chinese authorities first reported severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and on March 11, 2020, it was declared a pandemic. The pandemic seems to have had a negative effect on elderly patients who underwent ASD, in terms of functional and psychological quality of life. We selected patients with ASD aged &gt; 70 years who had undergone surgery between 2010 and 2015 and compared them with age- and sex-matched patients who did not have ASD. We recorded sociodemographic variables, type of surgery, levels of spinal fusion, HRQoL (Scoliosis Research Society-22, Short Form 12 Health Survey, EuroQol-5D [EQ-5], Geriatric Depression Scale [Yesavage] [GDS], Modified Frailty Index-11, and Barthel index), fear of visiting a health center, fear of leaving one's house, and adherence to preventive measures. The study population comprised 174 patients (mean [standard deviation] age, 77.3 [5.9] years; 86% women), of whom 87 had undergone surgery for ASD. The incidence of COVID-19 was higher in patients aged &gt; 85 years (P = .041), urban areas (P = .047), and in patients in long-term care (P = .03). Similarly, no differences were observed for the ability to cope with the pandemic (P &gt; .05). Patients who underwent surgery also had a higher risk of depression (GDS, 6.7 [P = .02]), a lower EQ-5 score (P = .001), a higher body mass index (P = .004), greater consumption of drugs (P &lt; .001), especially opiates (P &lt; .001). Patients who underwent surgery constitute a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic, with poorer quality of life and had a much higher risk of depression. They are also polymedicated and prefrail, adhere well to COVID-19 preventive measures, and do not seem to fear visiting health centers.","SuÃƒÂ¡rez-Huerta, Gomez-Rice, Carvajal Alvarez, Vazquez Vecilla, Izquierdo-NuÃƒÂ±ez, Fernandez-Gonzalez, ZuÃƒÂ±iga-GÃƒÂ³mez, Betegon-Nicolas, Sanchez-Campos","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029954","20220819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36355,""
"Sleep quality, latency, and sleepiness are positively correlated with depression symptoms of Brazilians facing the pandemic-associated stressors of COVID-19","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has implicated on mental health and psychopathological sequelae through viral infection. Suggestively, the pandemic-associated stressors (e.g., isolation, fear of illness, inadequate information and supply) may affect the sleep and feedback the depression symptoms, ultimately decreasing the immune system and offering further opportunities for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection. Nevertheless, this association still requires investigation. Therefore, this study aimed to correlate the depression symptoms with sleep variables from subjects facing the restrictions of the ongoing pandemic in Brazil. One hundred sixty-two volunteers (age = 31Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13 years; body mass = 69.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg; height = 168Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9Ã¢â‚¬â€°cm) answered the Beck Depression Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index/Epworth Sleepiness Scale for determination of depression symptoms and sleep variables, respectively.

"Assessing the general health, increase in mental and physical workload among administrative staff of the University of Nigeria due to the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the global workloads and general well-being of employees, especially in the university system. The object of this study is to evaluate the mental health and effect of increase in workload on the general well-being of the administrative staff of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, on the resumption of academic activities after the lockdown due to COVID-19. A total of 73 randomly selected administrative staff were involved in the study. Three sets of instruments, the demographic questionnaire, National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index, and General Health Questionnaire, were used to obtain information on the demographic characteristics, workload, and level of mental disorder among the respondents due to COVID-19. The generalized linear regression model, 1-way analysis of variance, independent samples t test, and contingency coefficient were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that high workload is significantly associated with high risk of mental and general health disorders among the respondents. The married, divorced, widowed, older, and females staff with &gt;2 children are the most vulnerable to mental disorder, physical workload, frustration, and general health challenges. The younger staff, those with at most 2 children, and those who are still single experience lower mental and general health disorder and are more resilient. Significant and comprehensive health and administrative support should be provided for the overall well-being of the staff.","Edikpa, Chigbu, Onu, Ogakwu, Aneke, Nwafor, Diara, Chibuko, Oguejiofor, Anigbogu, Adepoju, Igbokwe","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029938","20220819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36357,""

"Addiction in the time of COVID-19: Longitudinal course of substance use, psychological distress, and loneliness among a transnational Tyrolean sample with substance use disorders","Next to an increased use of alcohol, the current pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress among the general population. Research on its effects on individuals suffering from substance use disorders (SUD) is scarce. This study aimed at expanding the existing literature on this topic with a focus on the impact of loneliness and perceived social support. Sixty-eight people diagnosed with SUD according to ICD-10 from the Austrian state of Tyrol and from the Italian Province of South Tyrol who had been treated in a psychiatric hospital in 2019 and one hundred and thirty-six matched reference subjects of the same regional background participated in an online survey. Sociodemographic variables and scores on the Brief Symptom Checklist, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were collected at baseline and 5 months thereafter. Baseline took place after the first wave, while follow-up largely coincided with the second wave of the pandemic. Among both patients and the matched reference group, substance use as a means to feel better facing the pandemic rose and predicted higher levels of psychological distress. Patients were less likely to receive specific care at follow-up than at baseline and presented with a significantly higher prevalence of clinically relevant psychological distress and loneliness than the matched reference group at both assessment times. Among both groups, psychological burden remained unchanged over time. Perceived social support was generally significantly higher in the matched reference group than in patients. Loneliness and, to a lesser degree, low perceived social support predicted psychological distress. These findings emphasize the need of preventive and educational measures regarding substance use behavior for both individuals suffering from SUD and those without mental health disorders.","Lommer, Schurr, Frajo-Apor, Plattner, Chernova, Conca, Fronthaler, Haring, Holzner, Macina, Marksteiner, Miller, Pardeller, Perwanger, Pycha, Schmidt, Sperner-Unterweger, Tutzer, Hofer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.918465","20220819","COVID-19; loneliness; psychological distress; social support; substance use disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36359,""
"Lockdown and No Lockdown: How Norwegian and Swedish Elite Athletes Managed Preparations for Tokyo 2020 and Mental Health Challenges in the Shadow of COVID-19","The present study explored Norwegian and Swedish Olympic aspirants' perceived challenges for the preparations of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games (OG) and risk and protective factors for mental health. The focus for this study was the timespan between the declaration of the postponement of Tokyo 2020 and the final months before the Games. A secondary purpose was to explore experiences of both elite athletes affected by lockdown (i.e., Norwegian athletes) and elite athletes not affected by lockdown in their home country (i.e., Swedish athletes). Twelve elite athletes (Norwegian: <i>n</i> = 6; Swedish: <i>n</i> = 6; Women: <i>n</i> = 6; Men: <i>n</i> = 6) with a mean age of 28.25 (<i>SD</i> = 3.60) participated. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between April and June 2021. Seven athletes had qualified and five were still trying to qualify. Eight of the interviewed athletes had previous experiences with OG participation. Template analysis revealed two main themes: <i>(a)</i> challenges and risk-factors for mental health and <i>(b)</i> protective factors. The pandemic exposed athletes to several psychological strains like uncertainty and difficulties with planning and preparations for the OG and personal and social challenges (i.e., worry about physical health and risk of overtraining, social contacts, identity, and life issues). Protective factors included perceived benefits of increased recovery and time for quality training. The athletes used several coping strategies and self-care behaviors (e.g., focus on the controllable, playfulness, putting sports in perspective, daily routines, short-term goals, working or studying for personal development) and they tapped into various internal and external psychosocial resources perceived as protective for mental health, personal growth, resiliency, and adjustment to the pandemic. The holistic perspectives used contribute to an increased understanding of elite sport athletes' mental health needs in stressful and unforeseen situations such as a pandemic.","Lundqvist, Kristiansen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.918825","20220819","Olympic Games; mental disorders; pandemic; resiliency; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36360,""
"Association of depression symptoms and sleep quality with state-trait anxiety in medical university students in Anhui Province, China: a mediation analysis","The prevalence of depression symptoms among medical students is particularly high, and it has increased during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sleep quality and state-trait anxiety are risk factors for depression, but no study has yet investigated the mediating role of state-trait anxiety in the relationship between poor sleep quality and depression symptoms in medical students. This study aims to investigate the relationship among depression symptoms, sleep quality and state-trait anxiety in medical university students in Anhui Province. This was a cross-sectional survey of 1227 students' online questionnaires collected from four medical universities in Anhui Province using a convenience sampling method. We measured respondents' sleep quality, state-trait anxiety, and depression symptoms using three scales: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). We analysed the mediating role of STAI scores on the association between PSQI scores and SDS scores through the Sobel-Goodman Mediation Test while controlling for covariates. PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 74.33% (912) and 41.40% (518) of the respondents reported suffering from poor sleep quality and depression symptoms. Sleep quality, state-trait anxiety, and depression symptoms were positively associated with each other (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.381Ã¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.775, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). State-trait anxiety partially mediated the association between sleep quality and depression symptoms (Sobel test ZÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.090, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and this mediating variable accounted for 83.79% of the association when adjusting for potential confounders. Subgroup analysis further revealed that STAI scores partially mediated the association between PSQI scores and SDS scores in females and rural students and fully mediated the association between PSQI scores and SDS scores in males and urban students. This study found that sleep quality and state-trait anxiety have a significant predictive effect on depression symptoms. State-trait anxiety mediated the relationship between sleep quality and depression symptoms, with a more complex mechanism observed among rural and female medical students. Multiple pathways of intervention should be adopted, such as encouraging students to self-adjust, providing professional psychological intervention and timely monitoring, enriching extracurricular activities, and making changes in policies regarding long shifts and working hours.","Chen, Tuersun, Yang, Xiong, Wang, Rao, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03683-2","20220818","Anxiety; China; Depression symptoms; Medical; Sleep quality; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","",36361,""

"Suicidal ideation and attempted suicide among cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to understand the suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts among cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected from patients diagnosed with cancer while attending the largest cancer center in the south of China. A structured questionnaire was used to investigate patients' demographic data, suicidal behavior, and factors related to COVID-19. Mental health conditions were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Comorbidities and medical conditions of cancer patients were extracted from the electronic healthcare records. Among the 5,670 cancer patients, 755 (13.3%) reported suicidal ideation, and 266 (4.7%) reported suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The age group with the highest risk of suicidal ideation was 20-24 years (23.9%). Lifetime history of suffering from mental disorders, longer time since cancer diagnosis, regional and distant tumor stage, depression, anxiety, hostility, having a higher frequency of worrying about cancer management due to COVID-19, higher frequency feeling of overwhelming psychological pressure due to COVID-19, having a higher level of barriers to manage cancer due to COVID-19, and higher barriers to continue treatment of cancer due to inconveniences caused by COVID-19, were all significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation. We also identified the risk factors of suicide attempts. This is the first study investigating the prevalence and risk factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts in Chinese cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that it is essential to monitor the mental health conditions of this vulnerable population, especially for the cancer patients who have a comorbidity with a history of mental disorders. Also, government policy maker should take actions to protect cancer patients to avoid any interruption of their continued treatment. Further efforts are urgently required to develop specific psychological interventions to reduce the risk factors among cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
