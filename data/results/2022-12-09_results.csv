"Physical and mental health disability associated with long-COVID: Baseline results from a US nationwide cohort","Importance: Persistent symptoms after SARS-COV-2 infection, or long-COVID, may occur in anywhere from 10-55% of those who have had COVID-19, but the extent of impact on daily functioning and disability remains unquantified. Objective: To characterize physical and mental disability associated with long-COVID Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a cohort study Setting: Online US nationwide survey Participants: Adults 18 years of age and older who live in the US who either report a history of COVID-19 illness (n=8,874) or report never having had COVID-19 (n=633) Main Outcome and Measures: Self-reported mobility disability (difficulty walking a quarter of a mile and/or up 10 stairs, instrumental activities of daily living [IADL] disability (difficulty doing light or heavy housework), and mental fatigue as measured by the Wood Mental Fatigue Inventory (WMFI). Results: Of 7,926 participants with long-COVID, the median age was 45 years, 84% were female, 89% self-reported white race, and 7.4% self-reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Sixty-five percent of long-COVID participants were classified as having at least one disability, compared to 6% of those with resolved-COVID (n=948) and 14% of those with no-COVID (n=633). Of long-COVID participants, about 1% and 5% were classified as critically physically disabled or mentally fatigued, respectively. Age, prior comorbidity, increased BMI, female gender, hospitalization for COVID-19, non-white race, and multi-race were all associated with significantly higher disability burden. Dizziness at the time of infection (33% non-hospitalized, 39% hospitalized) was associated with all five disability components in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups. Heavy limbs, dyspnea, and tremors were associated with four of the five components of disability in the non-hospitalized group, and heavy limbs was associated with four of the five components in the hospitalized group. Vaccination was protective against development of disability. Conclusion and Relevance: We observed a high burden of physical and mental disability associated with long-COVID which has serious implications for individual and societal health that may be partially mitigated by vaccination. Longitudinal characterization and evaluation of COVID-19 patients is necessary to identify patterns of recovery and treatment options.","Bryan Lau; Eryka Wentz; Zhanmo Ni; Karine Yenokyan; Candelaria Coggiano; Shruti H Mehta; Priya Duggal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.07.22283203","20221207","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42175,""
"Perceptions, readiness and recommendations of traditional herbalists to integrate traditional and modern medicine in controlling COVID-19 epidemics in Northeast Ethiopia: An interpretive qualitative study","BackgroundTraditional medicine is an approach that has unique knowledge and beliefs which incorporates plant, animal or mineral based medicines that applied alone or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses and maintain well-being. Suggestions from clinical practices and researches shown that integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine played an important role in Chinas successful control of COVID-19. Despite such evidence, the Ethiopian minister of health prohibited traditional herbalists from using traditional remedies for COVID-19. However many of the traditional herbalists and the community requested the government frequently to try traditional medicine for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions, readiness, and recommendations of traditional herbalists on the effect of traditional medicine on COVID-19 and to select the promising remedies for pre-clinical study.

MethodsThe study design used was an interpretive qualitative study. An in-depth interview was employed to gain access to the traditional herbalists experiences, perceptions, readiness and their recommendations. Traditional herbalists who lived in the North Wollo Zone were interviewed about the probable medicinal plants that can treat COVID-19. An inductive qualitative content analysis was conducted.

ResultsFrom the in-depth interview with traditional herbalists, 4thematic frameworks were developed. Those major themes are;(1)perception of traditional medicine practitioners about COVID-19;(2) hypothesizing potential traditional remedies to treat COVID-19;(3)traditional practitioners recommendations for the community, and (4) integration of traditional and modern medicine. There was no pronounced difference in opinion among traditional herbalists about COVID-19 signs and symptoms, mode of transmission, and source of information about the epidemics.

Traditional herbalists had not planned to treat COVID-19 because of the minister of healths prohibition of using traditional remedies. However, the traditional herbalists gave their remedies to minister of health, research institutes, and universities to get approval after the necessary procedures or laboratory investigations including toxicity studies. Despite the interest of traditional herbalists, currently, traditional medicine is not anymore economically and professionally useful for traditional herbalists because of many factors including the Ethiopian People Democracy Republic Fronts (EPDRF) government negative attitude, and its domination by the western medicine. Traditional herbalists were unsure which remedy might treat the COVID_19 but they believed that plants that were used to treat cough, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and other respiratory infections might be used to control the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. If there is potential traditional remedy for COVID-19 from the traditional herbalists, integration of traditional medicine (TM) and modern medicine (MM) may be compulsory to manage COVID-19 effectively.","Mesfin  Wudu Kassaw; Mohammed  Hussen Mohammed; Ousman  Ahmed Mohammed","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.01.22282963","20221205","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42176,""
"Availability and Accessibility of Mental Health Services in New York City","Mental health services are critical components of public health infrastructure that provide essential supports to people living with psychiatric disorders. In a typical year, about 20 percent of people will have a psychiatric disorder, and about 5 percent will experience serious psychological distress, indicating a potentially serious mental illness. Nationally, the use of mental health services is low, and the use of care is not equitably distributed. In the United States as a whole and in New York City (NYC), non-Hispanic white individuals are more likely to use mental health services than non-Hispanic black individuals or Hispanic individuals. The challenges of ensuring the availability of mental health services for all groups in NYC are particularly acute, given the size of the population and its diversity in income, culture, ethnicity, and language. Adding to these underlying challenges, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted established patterns of care. To advance policy strategy for addressing gaps in the mental health services system, RAND researchers investigate the availability and accessibility of mental health services in NYC. The RAND team used two complementary approaches to address these issues. First, the team conducted interviews with a broad group of professionals and patients in the mental health system to identify barriers to care and potential strategies for improving access and availability. Second, the team investigated geographic variations in the availability of mental health services by compiling and mapping data on the locations and service characteristics of mental health treatment facilities in NYC.","Breslau, Barnes-Proby, Bhandarkar, Cantor, Hanson, Kofner, Li, Malika, Mendoza-Graf, Pincus","https://www.google.com/search?q=Availability+and+Accessibility+of+Mental+Health+Services+in+New+York+City.","20221209","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Health Care Access; Health Care Facilities; Health Care Services Capacity; Medical Professionals; Mental Health Treatment; New York City; Patient Experience; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42177,""
"Lived Experience of Nurses in COVID-19 Units - A Phenomenological Study from Eastern India","<b>Introduction:</b> Nurses are the frontline workers who had to play multiple functions like in acute care, community, etc. but, it was stated that COVID-19 has caused immense trauma to nurses globally. <b>Methods:</b> A descriptive phenomenological study to explore the lived experience of nurses working in COVID-19 units was conducted among nine senior nursing officers recruited by purposive homogenous sampling and interviewed with an open-ended interview guide by ensuring data saturation. COREQ guideline were adopted for this qualitative study. <b>Results:</b> Qualitative data were analysed using Giorgi's framework, and themes and sub-themes were derived. The major themes that emerged in the present study were ""Reactions and preparation"", ""Feelings and satisfaction in active duty"", ""Role of a helping hand"", ""Working experience in PPE"", and ""Pandemic and socialization"". Each theme had further sub-themes to classify the verbatims. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most of the nurses had anxiety and prepared themselves to play with fire, had unrealistic hope, and mixed emotions, kept their family away and intentionally concealed information to reduce family's fear, were satisfied with training and preparation, and had unpleasant experiences with PPE, had to restrict their social activities and felt social stigma. It also concludes with the recommendation that warrants the need to improve their professional quality of life and working conditions by safeguarding nurses' physical and mental health.","Nair, Mohan, Jayakrishnan, Srinivasan, Javeth, Sharma, Kumari","https://doi.org/10.34172/jcs.2022.25","20221209","COVID-19; Lived experience; Nurses; Phenomenology; Qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42178,""
"Experiences of digital exclusion and the impact on health in people living with severe mental illness","The covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital tools within health and social care services. However, for a range of different reasons, across the UK there continue to be people who are digitally excluded. People living with a disability have been identified as being more likely to be digitally excluded and many of these people, including people with severe mental illness (SMI) already experience health inequalities. Therefore, understanding the perceived impact digital exclusion has on health and potential facilitators of increased inclusion is an important area for research. This study had two aims: 1. To understand experiences of digital exclusion and the impact on health in people with SMI. 2. To explore the influences and mechanisms which would increase engagement with digital health tools. This was an observational qualitative study, conducting focus groups (with the option of a 1:1 interview for those uncomfortable in groups) with nine people with severe mental illness. Participant's responses were themed in to four key areas in relation to digital exclusion and impact on health: 1. Reduced social connectedness, 2. The impact on wider determinants of health 3. Negative perception of self, 4. Disempowerment. Key facilitators for increased engagement with digital tools included, local digital skills support with mental health lived experience involvement in the delivery, digitally engaged social referents, access to digital tools and data, personalised and straightforward digital tools. In addition, increasing health and social care staff's awareness of digital exclusion was also viewed as important in promoting inclusion. The research findings suggest that digital inclusion should be viewed as a wider determinant of health. Many of the identified consequences of exclusion are particularly important in relation to mental health and mental health recovery. This research suggests that identifying and addressing digital exclusion should be viewed as a priority for mental health services.","Middle, Welch","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.1004547","20221209","SMI; digital; exclusion; health; inequalities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42179,""
"Integration of Mental Health Support Teams in COVID-19 Units within French General Hospitals: A Qualitative Study","This study aimed to explore the lived experience of mental health professionals (mhPs) who had been redeployed on support teams (MHSTs) implemented in general hospital for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their families, in order to scale up mental and physical health care integration in times of epidemic crisis. This multicentered qualitative study followed an IPSE (Inductive Process to analyze the Structure of lived Experience) research design. MhPs' recruitment took place in three general hospitals of Seine-Seine-Denis department, in Paris suburbs (France). Twenty-two participants were included. Data analysis produced three central axes: 1) the mhP in the epidemic crisis, underlying how participants confronted the unknown and adapted; 2) retrieving fundamentals of support therapy, that were: being present and listening, bonding with patients' families, and ensuring care continuity; and 3) moving forward with other health professionals, highlighting the collaborative work they developed and experienced. The epidemic prompted mhPs to rethink the values likely to guide the integration of their intervention with other individual and organizational care stakeholders, at different levels of health system. Normative integration based on shared appraisal of patients' and families' needs is highly required to overcome the multiple and sometimes contradictory health issues inherent in the crisis. Person- and family-centered approach of integrated care (IC) is essential to address fragmentation between mental and physical health care in times of epidemic crisis. Hospital and political leaders should support and draw from bottom-up mental health IC initiatives such as MHSTs, that embody this vision, in order to improve health systems preparedness for future crises.

"Psychological Status of College Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Saudi Arabia","This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among college students in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional study was conducted between February 10th to April 10th, 2021. An online self-administered questionnaire was emailed to college students at a large institution in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic, educational backgrounds, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The study included 311 university students (62.7% female and 39.3% male). The prevalence of higher than moderate level in each of the depression, anxiety, and stress were (n= 164, 52.7%), (n= 222, 71.4%), and (n= 112, 36%), respectively. Further analysis revealed that females, younger age, history of depression, history of being quarantined by a health authority, and having contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 were associated with a greater level of depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression, anxiety, and stress were highly prevalent among college students during the outbreak. There was a significant association between demographic characteristics and the DASS 21 score. Researchers are recommended to concentrate their future studies on establishing strategies to enhance students' flexibility and adaptability in the face of future catastrophes.","Alanazi","https://doi.org/10.2147/AMEP.S381916","20221209","COVID-19; DASS-21; anxiety; depression; psychological effect; stress; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42182,""
"Effects of general and corona-specific stressors on mental burden during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic turned out to be a serious threat to mental and physical health. However, the relative contribution of corona-specific (DH<sub>s</sub>) and general stressors (DH<sub>g</sub>) on mental burden, and specific protective and risk factors for mental health are still not well understood. In a representative sample (<i>N</i> = 3,055) of the German adult population, mental health, potential risk, and protective factors as well as DH<sub>s</sub> and DH<sub>g</sub> exposure were assessed online during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (June and July 2020). The impact of these factors on mental health was analyzed using descriptive statistics, data visualizations, multiple regressions, and moderation analyses. The most burdensome DH<sub>g</sub> were financial and sleeping problems, respectively, and DH<sub>s</sub> corona-media reports and exclusion from recreational activities/important social events. 31 and 24% of total mental health was explained by DH<sub>g</sub> and DH<sub>s</sub>, respectively. Both predictors combined explained 36%, resulting in an increase in variance due to DH<sub>s</sub> of only 5% (R<sup>2</sup> adjusted). Being female, older and a lower educational level were identified as general risk factors, somatic diseases as a corona-specific risk factor, and self-efficacy and locus of control (LOC) proved to be corona-specific protective factors. Further analyses showed that older age and being diagnosed with a somatic illness attenuated the positive influence of LOC, self-efficacy, and social support on resilience. Although the data showed that after the first easing restrictions, the stressor load was comparable to pre-pandemic data (with DH<sub>s</sub> not making a significant contribution), different risk and protective factors could be identified for general and corona-specific stressors. In line with observations from network analysis from other groups, the positive impact of resilience factors was especially diminished in the most vulnerable groups (elderly and somatically ill). This highlights the need to especially target these vulnerable groups to foster their resilience in upcoming waves of the corona pandemic.","Hubenschmid, Helmreich, K&#xf6;ber, Gilan, Frenzel, van Dick, Lieb","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.991292","20221209","SARS-CoV-2; mental burden; protective factors; resilience; risk factors; stressor loads; vulnerable groups","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42183,""
"Financial hardship and mental health among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the US COVID-19 Household Impact Survey","Our objective was to (1) identify associated characteristics of financial hardship (FH), and (2) evaluate associations of FH with mental health symptoms among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the nationally representative COVID-19 Impact Survey, we defined cancer survivors as those with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (<i>n</i> = 854,7.6%). We defined FH using the following question: ""Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for an unexpected $400 expense?"" Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) to identify associated characteristics of FH and associations of FH with mental health symptoms among cancer survivors overall and by age (18-59 years/60+ years). Forty-one percent of cancer survivors reported FH, with 58% in 18-59 and 33% in 60+ year old respondents. Compared to cancer survivors aged 60+ years, those aged 30-44 (aPR:1.74,95% CI:1.35-2.24), and 45-59 years (aPR:1.60,95% CI:1.27-1.99) were more likely to report FH. Compared to non-Hispanic(NH)-White cancer survivors, NH-Black cancer survivors had a 56% higher prevalence of FH (aPR:1.56; 95% CI: 1.23-1.97). Among 60+ years aged cancer survivors, NH-Black (aPR:1.80; 95% CI: 1.32-2.45) and NH-Asian cancer survivors (aPR:10.70,95% CI:5.6-20.7) were more likely to experience FH compared to their NH-White counterparts.

"College students' anxiety after returning to school during the COVID-19 epidemic: What should we care","The college students' anxiety during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the college students' anxiety after returning to school during the COVID-19 epidemic, to provide reference for the management and nursing care of college students. We conducted a survey from September 15, 2021 to September 30, 2021 investigate the anxiety level of college students. The Self-rating Anxiety Scale was used for anxiety assessment. The Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between students' anxiety and characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors of concurrent anxiety among college students. A total of 2168 college students were included, the incidence of anxiety was 30.07% in college students during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pearson correlation analyses showed that grade (R&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.715), main use of computer and mobile phone (R&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.622), daily exercise (R&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.735), whether relatives or friends are infected with COVID-19 (R&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.735) are associated with the anxiety level of college students (all P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that senior year (Odds ratio [OR]&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.064, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.355-3.001), online game (OR&#x2005;=&#x2005;3.122, 95% CI: 2.562-3.899), relatives or friends are infected with COVID-19 (OR&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.987, 95% CI: 1.901-3.451) are the independent risk factors of anxiety in college students (all P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.05). Daily exercise (OR&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.514, 95% CI: 0.205-0.814) was the independent protective factors of anxiety in college students (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.008). During the COVID-19 epidemic, college students have increased anxiety and there are many influencing factors. Administrators and educators should especially pay attention to the mental health of students with those risk factors to maintain students' physical and mental health.","Ding, Zhu, Jing, Gu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000032068","20221209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42187,""
"Social determinants and mental health needs of Palestine refugees and UNRWA responses in Gaza during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative assessment","Due to pre-existing difficulties, refugees are especially susceptible to the negative effects of the pandemic; nonetheless, the pandemic's effect on this group is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Palestine refugees in Gaza by identifying the role of social determinants. During the pandemic, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) enacted a number of policies and measures. The purpose of this research was to assess their efficacy and acceptability. This qualitative study took place between August and November 2020. Twenty-nine key-informant interviews were conducted remotely with UNRWA Headquarters, field and clinical staff in Gaza and with community members, aged &#x2265;18&#x2009;years and residing in Rafah and Jabalia camps. We sought informed consent verbally or via email. Data was coded based on the framework for social determinants of mental health. Interview results indicated that the relationship might be unidirectional, with COVID-19 causing the degradation of living conditions and vice versa, with living conditions exacerbating the COVID-19 situation by facilitating virus transmission. In other instances, the association between mental health determinants and COVID-19 might be bidirectional. In terms of experiencing violence and anxieties, women, children, and daily-paid employees were significantly more disadvantaged than other groups in the community. UNRWA modified its service delivery techniques in order to continue providing essential services. In general, UNRWA's strategies throughout the pandemic were deemed beneficial, but insufficient to meet the needs of Gazans. The pandemic highlights the need to go beyond disease treatment and prevention to address social determinants to improve refugees' health and reduce their susceptibility to future shocks. UNRWA has rapidly implemented telemedicine and mental telehealth services, making it imperative to assess the efficacy of these novel approaches to provide care at a distance. A long-term option may be to employ a hybrid strategy, which combines online and in-person therapy.","Jamal, ElKhatib, AlBaik, Horino, Waleed, Fawaz, Loffreda, Seita, Witter, Diaconu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14771-9","20221209","COVID-19; Gaza; Mental health; Occupied Palestinian territory; Pandemic; Refugees; Social determinants; UNRWA","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42188,""
"Pathways of association between disordered eating in adolescence and mental health outcomes in young adulthood during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased mental health problems. We investigated (1) associations between disordered eating in adolescence and mental health problems after one year of the pandemic and (2) the mechanisms explaining associations. We analyzed data from a population-based birth cohort in Quebec, Canada (557 males and 759 females). High and low levels of disordered eating symptom trajectories were previously estimated (age 12, 15, 17, and 20 years). Anxiety, depression, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicidal ideation were assessed at 23 years (March-June 2021). Putative mediators included loneliness and social media use (age 22 years, July-August 2020). Analyses controlled for mental health and socio-economic status at age 10-12 years and were conducted for males and females separately. Females in the high-level disordered eating symptom trajectory were at increased risk for non-suicidal self-injury (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.02-2.52) and suicidal ideation (2.16; 1.31-3.57), whereas males were at increased risk for severe anxiety (2.49; CI 1.11-5.58). Males and females in the high-level trajectory were more likely to report severe depression (2.26; 1.14-5.92 and 2.15, 1.36-3.38 respectively). Among females, associations were partially explained (17-35%) by loneliness during the first 4 months of the pandemic. Young adults who experienced disordered eating as adolescents were at increased risk of mental health problems during the pandemic. Loneliness partially mediated the effect, suggesting that pandemic mitigation resulting in increased social isolation may have exacerbated mental health problems among women with a history of disordered eating.

"Risk of postpartum depressive symptoms is influenced by psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic and dependent of individual stress coping","There are different studies worldwide, which have shown a higher risk of mental disorders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One aim of this study was to identify influencing factors of the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the development of postpartum depression. Further, the role of individual stress and coping strategies was analyzed in this context. Between March and October 2020, 131 women in obstetric care at the LMU Clinic Munich completed a questionnaire at consecutive stages during their perinatal period. The times set for the questionnaire were before birth, 1&#xa0;month, 2&#xa0;months, and 6&#xa0;months after birth. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this a modified version of the Stress and coping inventory (SCI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used. We could show that the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the EPDS score 1, 2 and 6&#xa0;months after birth. In addition, the prenatal stress and individual coping strategies affected the EPDS and the burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic before and after birth significantly. An association of the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic with the risk of developing postpartum depressive symptoms could be shown in this study. In this context, the separation of the partner and the family was recognized as an important factor. Furthermore, the SCI was identified as an effective screening instrument for identifying mothers with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Hereby allowing primary prevention by early intervention or secondary prevention by early diagnosis.","Meister, Dreyer, Hahn, Thomann, Keilmann, Beyer, Mayer, Prins, Hasbargen, Mahner, Jeschke, Kolben, Burges","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-022-06854-0","20221209","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental disorders; Postpartum depression; Stress and coping inventory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42190,""
"Differentiated mental health patterns in pregnancy during COVID-19 first two waves in Sweden: a mixed methods study using digital phenotyping","To utilize modern tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, wellbeing and life conditions in pregnant women during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Pregnant women (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1577) were recruited through the mobile application Mom2B. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and wellbeing were assessed during January 2020-February 2021. Movement data was collected using the phone's sensor. Data on Google search volumes for ""Corona"" and Covid-related deaths were obtained. Qualitative analysis of free text responses regarding maternity care was performed. Two peaks were seen for depressive symptoms, corresponding to the two waves. Higher prevalence of anxiety was only noted during the first wave. A moderating effect of the two waves in the association of depression, anxiety, and well-being with Covid deaths was noted; positive associations during the first wave and attenuated or became negative during the second wave. Throughout, women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and worry about partners not being allowed in hospital. The association of mental health outcomes with relevant covariates may vary during the different phases in a pandemic, possibly due to adaptation strategies on a personal and societal/healthcare level. Digital phenotyping can help healthcare providers and governmental bodies to in real time monitor high-risk groups during crises, and to adjust the support offered.","Fransson, Karalexi, Kimmel, Br&#xe4;nn, Kollia, Tas, van Zoest, Nordling, Skalkidou, Papadopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-25107-3","20221208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42191,""

"Is there an association between depression, anxiety disorders and COVID-19 severity and mortality? A multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in 50 hospitals in Germany","The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate associations between depression and anxiety disorder and the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality in patients treated in large hospitals in Germany. This retrospective study was based on anonymized electronic medical data from 50 public healthcare service hospitals across Germany. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to study associations between depression, anxiety and mechanical ventilation and mortality due to COVID adjusted for age, sex, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pre-defined co-diagnoses. Of 28,311 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1970 (6.9%) had a diagnosis of depression and 369 (1.3%) had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder prior to contracting COVID-19. While multivariable logistic regression models did not indicate any association between depression diagnosis and the risk of mechanical ventilation, depression was associated with a decreased risk of mortality (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.94). There was no association between anxiety disorders and risk of mortality, but there was a strong positive association between anxiety disorders and the risk of mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.35-3.10). In the present study, depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses were not associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Anxiety disorder was strongly associated with an increased risk of mechanical ventilation. Further studies are needed to clarify how depression and anxiety disorders may influence COVID-19 severity and mortality.","Kostev, Hagemann-Goebel, Gessler, Wohlmuth, Feldhege, Arnold, Jacob, Gunawardene, H&#xf6;lting, Koyanagi, Schreiber, Smith, Sheikhzadeh, Wollmer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.11.031","20221208","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Elderly; Hospital; Mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42193,""
"Sabbaticals in US Medical Schools","Sabbaticals are an important feature of academia for faculty and their institutions. Whereas sabbaticals are common in institutions of higher learning, little is known about their role and utilization in U.S. medical schools. This perspective piece examining sabbaticals in medical school faculty was undertaken at a time that wellbeing of health professionals was increasingly being recognized as a workforce health priority. We surveyed associate deans at U.S. medical schools in 2021 about faculty who had taken sabbaticals within the past three years, the parameters of the sabbaticals, as well as institutional policies and respondents' predictions of future sabbatical use. 53% of respondents reported any faculty had taken sabbaticals in the past three years (M&#x202f;=&#x202f;6.27; Median&#x202f;=&#x202f;3; range&#x202f;=&#x202f;1-60). Institutions rated enhancing research as the most important objective, while recognizing other benefits. Sabbaticals were more commonly taken by male, White, senior faculty Ph.Ds. Details about sabbaticals, including eligibility, expectations, length, financial support, and benefits were reviewed. Most (54.8%) respondents expected no change in the number of faculty seeking sabbaticals. Nearly all anticipated the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect sabbatical policies. In contrast to other institutions of higher learning, sabbatical-taking by medical school faculty is rare. We explore factors that may contribute to this phenomenon, e.g., the tripartite mission, faculty clinical responsibilities, culture of medicine, and student debt. Despite financial and other barriers, a closer look at the benefits of sabbaticals is warranted as a mechanism that may support faculty well-being, retention, and mental health.","Robiner, Buum, Eckerstorfer, Kim, Kirsch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2022.11.007","20221208","Sabbatical; burnout; health professionals&#x2019; education; medical faculty; professional development; retention; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42194,""

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular health behaviors and risk factors: A new troubling normal that may be here to stay","In March 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was officially declared a global pandemic, leading to closure of public facilities, enforced social distancing and stay-at-home mandates to limit exposures and reduce transmission rates. While the severity of this ""lockdown"" period varied by country, the disruptions of the pandemic on multiple facets of life (e.g., daily activities, education, the workplace) as well as the social, economic, and healthcare systems impacts were unprecedented. These disruptions and impacts are having a profound negative effect on multiple facets of behavioral health and psychosocial wellbeing that are inextricably linked to cardiometabolic health and associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19. For example, adoption of various cardiometabolic risk behavior behaviors observed during the pandemic contributed to irretractable trends in weight gain and poor mental health, raising concerns on the possible long-term consequences of the pandemic on cardiometabolic disease risk, and vulnerabilities to future viral pandemics. The purpose of this review is to summarize the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on cardiometabolic health risk behaviors, particularly related to poor diet quality, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors, smoking, sleep patterns and mental health. Additional insights into how the pandemic has amplified cardiovascular risk behaviors, particularly in our most vulnerable populations, and the potential implications for the future if these modifiable risk behaviors do not become better controlled, are described.","Laddu, Biggs, Kaar, Khadanga, Alman, Arena","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2022.11.017","20221208","COVID-19; Cardiovascular disease; Health behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42196,""
"Employment Intention of Chinese Medical Students During the COVID-19 Epidemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey","In the process of combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, medical personnel were at the forefront of the fight. As the future medical workforce, medical students often experienced firsthand how their seniors and teachers had to commit to working hard in combating the epidemic. Many were directly involved in the front line of the fight and that experience could easily have affected their intention to seek employment in a medically related career. The study intended to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Chinese medical students' employment intentions and the factors associated with them to put forward relevant suggestions to provide a basis for medical education in the future. The research team conducted a cross-sectional study, using an anonymous online questionnaire. The study took place in many provinces and cities in China and was conducted in an online questionnaire. Participants were 1114 college students studying clinical medicine, college students studying nursing, and students interning during standardized resident training, medical interns. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire, which investigated their psychological statuses related to anxiety and depression as well as COVID-19's impact on their intentions related to job searches, regarding their willingness to engage in clinical or basic research in epidemic-related specialties and epidemic-related work. Compared to college students studying clinical medicine, the employment intentions of nursing students and medical interns were more vulnerable to the epidemic. Females and nursing students were more reluctant to choose clinical work, and the choice was associated with depression. Nursing college students and medical interns were significantly less willing to engage in infection medicine, respiratory medicine, and intensive care medicine (all P &lt; .001). Medical students with a bachelor's degree and postgraduate degrees were significantly less willing to engage in infection medicine and respiratory medicine (all P &lt; .001), but medical students from regions with stable epidemics were more willing to engage in intensive care medicine. Medical students with a bachelor's degree were significantly less likely to be involved in epidemiology-related work than undergraduate students, and students from severe epidemic regions were significantly less willing to work in isolation wards or to go to Wuhan as volunteers. Participants' psychological statuses related to anxiety and depression, genders, degrees, current educational statuses, and regions affected employment intentions during the epidemic.","Long, Zhang, Chen, Xu, Shi, Cao, Shi, Yi, Kosasih, Chen, Wen, Wang, Mei, Wang","https://www.google.com/search?q=Employment+Intention+of+Chinese+Medical+Students+During+the+COVID-19+Epidemic:+A+Cross-Sectional+Survey.","20221208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42197,""

"Disparities in eating disorder symptoms and mental healthcare engagement prior to and following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a national study of US college students","Early COVID-19 eating disorders (EDs) research used regionally restricted samples with little sociodemographic diversity. The present study aimed to address these research gaps by examining whether pandemic-related changes in ED symptoms and mental healthcare prevalence differed for historically marginalized groups within a national sample of US college students. Participants included 242,906 US college students (M<sub>age</sub> &#xa0;=&#xa0;23.45, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.04; M<sub>BMI</sub> &#xa0;=&#xa0;25.28, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.91) who completed the repeated cross-sectional multi-institute Healthy Minds Study between January 2019 and May 2021. Moderated logistic regressions examined whether pandemic-related changes in individuals' likelihoods of exhibiting current probable ED, reporting lifetime ED diagnoses, and-among individuals with current probable ED-mental healthcare engagement differed for diverse gender, sexual, and racial/ethnic identity groups, and by body mass index (BMI) and financial stress. There were increases of 5% and 12% in individuals' likelihoods of exhibiting current probable ED and symptomatic individuals' mental healthcare engagement, respectively, pre- to post-COVID-19 onset, but no pandemic-related changes in lifetime ED diagnosis prevalence. There were also important variations in these time-trends for different marginalized groups. For example, individuals identifying as genderqueer/gender nonconforming and lesbian exhibited increasing ED symptoms pre- to post-COVID-19 onset, and individuals with current probable ED and higher BMIs were increasingly likely to receive mental healthcare. Associations between financial stress, and the ED and mental healthcare outcomes did not change over time. These findings provide insight into groups of US college students that experienced disproportionate ED burden during the pandemic at the population level, and directions for research and interventions that warrant consideration.","Romano, Lipson, Beccia, Quatromoni, Murgueitio","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23869","20221208","disordered eating; eating disorders; mental health; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42199,""

We screened for several putative factors associated with PTSS, including socio-demographic status, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, history of psychiatric disorder, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, and the home-to-hospital distance. Bivariate and multilinear regression analyses were performed to evaluate their association with PTSS. <b><i>Results:</i></b> 119 patients were evaluated 3 months after hospital discharge, and a subset of 94 were evaluated 6 months after discharge. The prevalence of PTSS was 31.9% after 3 months and 30.9% after 6 months. Symptoms of anxiety and depression and history of psychiatric disorder were independently associated with PTSS. Additionally, dissociative experiences during hospitalization (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35; <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and a longer home-to-hospital distance (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07; <i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017) were specifically associated with PTSS 3 and 6 months after discharge, respectively. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Patients with COVID-19 showed persistent high scores of PTSS up to 6 months after discharge from the hospital. In this specific pandemic setting, PTSS were associated with high rates of dissociative experiences during hospitalization and a longer home-to-hospital distance due to the saturation of health care facilities. These results can foster early identification and better prevention of PTSS after hospitalization for COVID-19. <b><i>Trial Registration:</i></b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04362930.","Pitron, Cantenys, Herbelin, Bottemanne, Dzierzynski, Caumes, Mathian, Amoura, Allenbach, Cacoub, Parrot, Rotg&#xe9;, Fossati","https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.21m14277","20221208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42200,""
"Sleep disturbance improves with SARS-COV2 vaccinations in patients with Chronic Inflammatory Disease","Immunocompromised patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) may have experienced additional psychosocial burden during the COVID-19 pandemic due to an immunocompromised status. We hypothesized that vaccination will result in improved patient-reported outcomes (PROs) longitudinally among individuals with CID undergoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following vaccination regardless of baseline anxiety. Data are from a cohort of individuals with CID from two sites undergoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Participants completed three study visits before and after two mRNA vaccine doses, in the initial vaccination series, where clinical data was collected. PROs were measured using the PROMIS-29 Profile and expressed as T-scores, with 2 groups stratified by high and low baseline anxiety. Mixed effects models were used to examine longitudinal changes, adjusting for age, gender, and study site. The cohort was 72% female with mean &#xb1;SD age of 48.1&#xb1;15.5&#x2009;years. Overall, sleep disturbance improved following both doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and anxiety decreased after the second dose. Physical function scores worsened but did not meet MID threshold. Stratifying by baseline anxiety, improvement in anxiety, fatigue, and social participation were greater for the high anxiety group. Physical function worsened slightly for both groups and sleep disturbance improved significantly in the high anxiety group. Sleep disturbance decreased in a significant and meaningful way in patients with CID upon vaccination. In patients with higher baseline anxiety, social participation increased and anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbance decreased. Overall, results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may improve mental health and wellbeing, particularly among those with greater anxiety.","Pawar, Taylor, Yang, Deepak, Kim, Paley, Matloubian, Carvidi, Ciorba, Demissie, El-Qunni, Huang, Kinnett, McMorrow, Paez, Poole, Rose, Schriefer, Kim, Nakamura, Katz, Gensler","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.25065","20221208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42201,""
"The Stress of Parenting in the Postpartum Period During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic produced a major shift in parental roles, which disproportionally exacerbated existing challenges for low-income new parents. Our objective was to identify pandemic-related parenting challenges experienced by low-income postpartum individuals in the context of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Semistructured interviews with 40 low-income postpartum individuals were conducted within 10 weeks after giving birth in April 2020-June 2020. Interviews addressed maternal health and well-being, parental stress, including COVID-related barriers to providing for children, and access to essential services. Interview themes were developed using the constant comparative method. Half (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) the participants identified as non-Hispanic Black and 38% (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) as Hispanic; 75% (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) were parents of multiple children. Parenting-related themes included challenges of parenting multiple children, barriers to maintaining self-care, and novel barriers to providing for children. Participants discussed handling new roles as educators, struggles with entertaining, allocating time among children, and effects of the pandemic on older children. Participants frequently described their lack of alone time, changes in self-care and coping strategies due to continuous parenting, and effects on maternal mental health like increased anxiety. Many participants reported lack of communal support, financial stress, and difficulty accessing services. New burdens introduced by the pandemic challenged low-income individuals' health and well-being. Understanding these psychosocial stressors and developing interventions to ameliorate these burdens may be key to promoting family health during difficult times; one potential solution for preventing postpartum depression is offering continual social services.

"COVID-19 Vaccination Perceptions Among Young Adults of Color in the San Francisco Bay Area","COVID-19 vaccination rates among U.S. young adults, particularly in communities of color, remain lower than other age groups. We conducted a qualitative, community-based participatory study to explore beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 vaccines among young adults in Black/African American, Latinx, and Asian American or Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We conducted six focus groups between June and August 2021. Participants were recruited by partnering with community-based organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Focus groups included Black/African American (<i>N</i>=13), Latinx (<i>N</i>=20), and AAPI (<i>N</i>=12) participants between 18 and 30 years of age. Emerging themes were identified using a modified Grounded Theory approach. Prominent themes among all three racial-ethnic groups included mistrust in medical and government institutions, strong conviction about self-agency in health decision-making, and exposure to a thicket of contradictory information and misinformation in social media. Social benefit and a sense of familial and societal responsibility were often mentioned as reasons to get vaccinated. Young adult mistrust had a generational flavor fueled by anger about increasing inequity, the profit-orientation of pharmaceutical companies and health institutions, society's failure to rectify injustice, and pessimism about life prospects. Factors influencing vaccine readiness among Black/African American, Latinx, and AAPI young adults have a distinct generational and life-course texture. Outreach efforts should appeal to young adults' interest in family and social responsibility and the social benefits of vaccination, while being cognizant of the friction mandates pose for young adults' sense of self-agency. Efforts will be most effective coming from trusted messengers with a proven commitment to communities of color and health equity.","Rios-Fetchko, Carson, Gonzalez Ramirez, Butler, Vargas, Cabrera, Gallegos-Castillo, LeSarre, Liao, Woo, Ellis, Liu, Doyle, Leung, Grumbach, Fernandez","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2022.0068","20221208","COVID-19 vaccination; disparities; vaccine hesitancy; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42203,""
"Platelets' morphology, metabolic profile, exocytosis, and heterotypic aggregation with leukocytes in relation to severity and mortality of COVID-19-patients","Roles of platelets during infections surpass the classical thrombus function and are now known to modulate innate immune cells. Leukocyte-platelet aggregations and activation-induced secretome are among factors recently gaining interest but little is known about their interplay with severity and mortality during the course of SARS-Cov-2 infection. The aim of the present work is to follow platelets' bioenergetics, redox balance, and calcium homeostasis as regulators of leukocyte-platelet interactions in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with variable clinical severity and mortality outcomes. We investigated COVID-19 infection-related changes in platelet counts, activation, morphology (by flow cytometry and electron microscopy), bioenergetics (by Seahorse analyzer), mitochondria function (by high resolution respirometry), intracellular calcium (by flow cytometry), reactive oxygen species (ROS, by flow cytometry), and leukocyte-platelet aggregates (by flow cytometry) in non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Non-ICU, n=15), ICU-survivors of severe COVID-19 (ICU-S, n=35), non-survivors of severe COVID-19 (ICU-NS, n=60) relative to control subjects (n=31). Additionally, molecular studies were carried out to follow gene and protein expressions of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes (ETC) in representative samples of isolated platelets from the studied groups. Our results revealed that COVID-19 infection leads to global metabolic depression especially in severe patients despite the lack of significant impacts on levels of mitochondrial ETC genes and proteins. We also report that severe patients' platelets exhibit hyperpolarized mitochondria and significantly lowered intracellular calcium, concomitantly with increased aggregations with neutrophil. These changes were associated with increased populations of giant platelets and morphological transformations usually correlated with platelets activation and inflammatory signatures, but with impaired exocytosis. Our data suggest that hyperactive platelets with impaired exocytosis may be integral parts in the pathophysiology dictating severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Yasseen, Elkhodiry, El-Messiery, El-Sayed, Elbenhawi, Kamel, Gad, Zidan, Hamza, Al-Ansary, Abdel-Rahman, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1022401","20221208","COVID-19 severity; Critically ill COVID-19 patients; exocytosis; leukocyte-platelet aggregation; metabolism; mitochondrial function; platelet activation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42204,""
"The study of psychological traits among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 campus lockdown","To investigate the prevalence of interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, depression symptoms and associated risk factors among a large-scale sample of college students in China during the COVID-19 campus lockdown. The survey was conducted among undergraduate students at a university in eastern part of China in April 2022. The Chi-square test was used to compare the different variable groups and multivariable analysis was performed for the risk factors associated with interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, and depression symptoms. A total of 12,922 college students were included, with an average age of (20.96&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.66) years. The prevalence of interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety and depression symptoms in this study was 58.1, 22.7, and 46.8%, respectively. Male (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.16, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), 22-23 years (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.40, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), freshman (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.35, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and non-only child (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.15, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were positively associated with interpersonal sensitivity.

"It's time to talk fathers: The impact of paternal depression on parenting style and child development during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to understand the relationship between paternal depression, parenting behavior and child developmental outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) pandemic. In addition, the paternal experience of the pandemic, such as the impact of lockdowns, was explored. Fathers of children aged 6-11 years old (<i>n</i> = 87) were recruited for an online cross-sectional survey. Data was collected through questionnaires and open-ended comments. Regression analysis indicated a higher level of self-reported depressive symptomology in fathers more severely impacted by the pandemic across financial, familial and health domains. Further, COVID-19 impact, but not paternal depression, was linked to fewer authoritative parenting behaviors, characterized as lower warmth and responsiveness. Paternal pandemic impact and depression symptoms were independently predictive of child cognitive scores, and both were associated with emotional and behavioral outcomes. A content analysis of open-ended responses from fathers noted that concerns for their children, work and mental health were most prevalent during the pandemic. However, several responders also reported no change or positive facets of lockdowns related to the pandemic. These finds are discussed in the context of a possible behavioural mechanism of action accounting for the effect of these factors on child development. Clinical implications include targeted interventions for at risk groups as well as psychoeducation for fathers that acknowledge difference in paternal coping and support seeking.","Roberts, Satherley, Iles","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1044664","20221208","COVID-19; child development; lockdown; parenting; parenting style; paternal depression; paternal parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42206,""

"Impact of mental health, job insecurity, and COVID-19 symptoms on protective behavior changes among White, Black, and other minorities in the US","Job insecurity such as loss of jobs or reduced wages has become a serious social problem in the US since COVID-19 started. Combined with psychological distress and experience of COVID-19 symptoms, the changes of people's protective behaviors vary across states in the US. This research investigated racial differences in the COVID-19 related factors among White, Black, and other minorities in the US, and examined how mental health mediated the impact of job insecurity on protective behaviors, and how the COVID-19 symptoms moderated the mediation effect of mental health. The 731 valid responses in a cross-sectional survey from May 23 to 27, 2020, in the US were analyzed with independent sample t-tests, Pearson's chi-square tests, and path analysis. The findings showed that there were significant differences in job insecurity and Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) practice among White, Black, and other minorities. Job insecurity was significantly negatively associated with NPIs practice and was significantly positively associated with mental health. Mental health significantly partially mediated the effect of job insecurity on NPIs practice, in that job insecurity is a better predictor of NPIs practice for individuals with worse mental health than that for individuals with better mental health. Experience of COVID-19 symptoms moderates the mediation effect of mental health on the relationship between job insecurity and NPIs practice, in that mental health is a better predictor of NPIs practice for individuals with a higher experience of COVID-19 symptoms than for individuals with a lower experience of COVID-19 symptoms. The findings in this study shed lights on psychological and behavioral studies of people's behavior changes during a pandemic. The study indicates the importance of treating mental health to promote protective behaviors during a pandemic, as well as advocating for employees by identifying the needs for those whose jobs were negatively impacted the most.","Sun, Wang, Tang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1040413","20221208","COVID-19 symptoms; job insecurity; mental health; protective behavior; race","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42208,""
"Burdens and psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for Austrian children and adolescents","The negative psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are becoming increasingly apparent. Children and adolescents in particular, were affected and torn away from their daily life routines. The aim of our survey is to evaluate the psychosocial burden and impairments of children and adolescents in Austria during the COVID-19 pandemic by using cross-sectional analysis. An Austrian-wide online survey was conducted from 21 February to 19 April 2021 for children and adolescents. The questionnaire was distributed widely using the national press agency and public media. Using an online questionnaire, 5,483 children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age were sampled. Quantitative responses to questions regarding the children's feelings, worries, and needs concerning the COVID-19 pandemic were measured. Furthermore, the children were sampled for subjective risk perception as well as their sleep quality. Most children reported a high degree of fear due to the pandemic, especially female (48.1%) participants being under more emotional strain than their male (35.9%) counterparts. Associated with this, we found a strong overestimation of COVID-19-associated hospitalization likelihood (&gt;100-fold) across all age groups. In addition, an alarming lack of positive perspective during the ongoing pandemic is evident across all age groups, including the youngest participants aged 6-10 years. Feelings of anger and annoyance (58.2%), loneliness (46%), and sadness (42.7%) are reported much more frequently than before the pandemic. On the other hand, only 15.6% reported feeling well (or even better; 2%) since the COVID-19 pandemic. Last but not least, our study shows an alarming 37% of children and adolescents who now report poorer sleep quality than before the pandemic. The results of this survey indicate the high burden and emotional strain for children and adolescents during the pandemic.

"Post COVID-19 condition diagnosis: A population-based cohort study of occurrence, associated factors, and healthcare use by severity of acute infection","The occurrence and healthcare use trajectory of post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate these aspects in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals with and without a PCC diagnosis. We conducted a population-based cohort study of adults in Stockholm, Sweden, with a verified infection from 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2021, stratified by the severity of the acute infection. The outcome was a PCC diagnosis registered any time 90-360 days after a positive test. We performed Cox regression models to assess baseline characteristics associated with the PCC diagnosis. Individuals diagnosed with PCC were then propensity-score matched to individuals without a diagnosis to assess healthcare use beyond the acute infection. Among 204,805 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, the proportion receiving a PCC diagnosis was 1% among individuals not hospitalized for their COVID-19 infection, 6% among hospitalized, and 32% among intensive care unit (ICU)-treated individuals. The most common new-onset symptom diagnosis codes among individuals with a PCC diagnosis were fatigue (29%) among nonhospitalized and dyspnea among both hospitalized (25%) and ICU-treated (41%) individuals. Female sex was associated with a PCC diagnosis among nonhospitalized and hospitalized individuals, with interactions between age and sex. Previous mental health disorders and asthma were associated with a PCC diagnosis among nonhospitalized and hospitalized individuals. Among individuals with a PCC diagnosis, the monthly proportion with outpatient care was substantially elevated up to 1 year after acute infection compared to before, with substantial proportions of this care attributed to PCC-related care. The differential association of age, sex, comorbidities, and healthcare use with the severity of the acute infection indicates different trajectories and phenotypes of PCC, with incomplete resolution 1 year after infection.","Hedberg, Granath, Bruchfeld, Askling, Sj&#xf6;holm, Fored, F&#xe4;rnert, Naucler","https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13584","20221208","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; long-term outcomes; post COVID-19 condition; sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42213,""

However, little research has been carried out on older adults' experiences of engaging with online psychological therapy, and specifically mindfulness therapy. to understand the experience of older adults engaging with online mindfulness therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. a qualitative analysis of four community-based focus groups. thirty-six community dwelling older adults aged between 65 and 85 years were recruited via older adult organisations, charities and the local press. Nineteen percent had long-term physical health conditions, 25% had severe and enduring mental health difficulties and 19% had mild to moderate mental health difficulties. there was a strong sense of group cohesion and community from the participants.Three main themes were identified: reasons for applying, experience of the mindfulness therapy and connecting at home. the majority of participants were positive about attending a mindfulness group online. This extended to the perceived psychological and social benefits as well as practical considerations. While some participants noted technological hurdles at the beginning of the course, the findings challenge previous studies that suggest older adults are reluctant to engage in online psychological therapies and has important implications for the future provision of psychological therapies to this population.","Pacini, Stickland, Kupeli","https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afac270","20221208","COVID-19; mental health; mindfulness; older people; qualitative paper","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42214,""
"Possible contribution of COVID-19 vaccination to the subsequent mental well-being in Japan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a severe impact on mental well-being. Vaccination may have played a pivotal role in enduring this mental health crisis. The present study aimed to longitudinally investigate the association between COVID-19 vaccination and mental health status among Japanese population in 2021. Longitudinal data of 17,089 individuals aged 15-79&#xa0;years who participated in a nationwide online study were analyzed. Baseline and follow-up mental health statuses were assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). General linear and multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline levels of mental distress were used to examine the association between vaccine receipt and follow-up levels of mental health. Mean K6 scores were lower in the vaccinated than in the non-vaccinated participants. Those who had received one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccines were associated with improved mental health at follow-up in subjects with psychological distress at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 1.31 and 1.35, respectively) and were inversely associated with deteriorated mental health status at follow-up in subjects without psychological distress at baseline (OR 0.66 and 0.70, respectively) compared with no vaccination groups, respectively. The present study would indicate that one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccinations contributed to mental well-being in Japan. This finding might provide evidence for promoting vaccination against COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Chiang, Morita, Hirakawa, Priya, Matsumoto, Ota, Yatsuya, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-25357-1","20221208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42215,""
"Certified Peer Support Specialists Training in Technology and Delivery of Digital Peer Support Services: Cross-sectional Study","When the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures were instituted, the wide-scale necessity for remote mental health care increased among professional clinicians, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and certified peer support (CPS) specialists. Factors contributing to increased demand include concern for the safety of loved ones, the safety of oneself, overall well-being, unemployment, and loneliness for older individuals. While demand continues to increase and a shortage of mental health professionals persists, understanding the training, technology, media, and delivery of digital peer support services can facilitate community-based support services to assist patients in coping with mental health symptoms between clinical encounters with licensed professionals. Digital peer support consists of asynchronous and synchronous, live or automated, peer support services such as applications, social media, and phone calls. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine how digital peer support is delivered, by which technologies it is delivered, and how certified digital peer supporters are trained within the United States to inform future delivery of digital peer support. We used an online cross-sectional self-report survey developed alongside certified peer specialists. The study included questions regarding the types of peer support training and the delivery methods used within their practices. We advertised the survey through a certified peer support specialist listserve, Facebook, and Twitter. Certified peer specialists provide mutual social emotional support to those with a similar mental health condition. Of certified peer specialists trained in CPS, the majority of CPS specialists were trained in peer support (418/426, 98.1%). Peer support specialists deliver services via telephone calls (182/293, 62.1%), via videoconference-based services (160/293, 54.6%), via SMS text messages (123/293, 42%), via smartphone apps (68/293, 23.2%), and via social media (65/293, 22.2%). Certified peer specialists deliver services through virtual reality (11/293, 3.8%) and through video games (6/293, 2%). Virtual reality and video games may represent emerging technologies to develop and deliver community-based support. This study examined the modes of digital peer support intervention as well as the training and demographic background of peer supporters. Given the demand for mental health care, digital peer support emerges as one option to increase access. These results suggest that CPS specialists commonly use SMS text messaging, phone calls, and videoconferences to engage in peer support. Less frequently, they may use diverse modes such as apps, social media, and video games. It is important to consider the backgrounds of peer supporters and the mediums of communication to best accommodate areas where access to peer support is emerging. Larger longitudinal studies and a variety of experimental designs may be considered to understand the efficacy of digital interventions and digital peer support training to direct optimal care.","Fortuna, Hill, Chalker, Ferron","https://doi.org/10.2196/40065","20221208","COVID-19; digital peer support; mHealth; mental health; peer support; psychological health; remote mental health; remote service; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42216,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, acceptance and informational needs in an Australian cancer population: a cross-sectional survey","ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, acceptance, and unmet informational needs in a cancer population during the first phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rollout in Australia.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in a large tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia, between 10 May and 31 July 2021. The survey assessed health beliefs, experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and informational needs.ResultsCOVID-19 was perceived to be a significant threat to both physical and mental health. While 57.9% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;110) of respondents believed the COVID-19 vaccines were safe and 64.2% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;122) believed they were effective, more than half (52.6%; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) agreed that they worried about vaccine side effects. Most respondents (84.2%; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;160) planned to receive the COVID-19 vaccine; however, feelings of hesitancy remained. There was a statistically significant association between those aged under 60&#x2009;years (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), those with previous vaccine hesitancy (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000), those who felt they had not received adequate information (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000) and vaccine hesitancy. Requested information pertained to interactions with cancer treatments, those with a history of blood clotting and information for those undergoing bone marrow transplantation.ConclusionsThere is a need for tailored COVID-19 vaccine communication that is responsive to the concerns of people with cancer. This will be beneficial during current and future vaccination rollouts.","Scanlon, Wyld, Firman, Nakagaki, Durham, Kennedy, Moran, Smith, Gavin","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH22142","20221208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42217,""
"The impact of working in COVID-19 hospital on indonesian nurses' mental health and wellbeing: a qualitative study","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of more than 580 million people and killed more than six million people globally. Nurses are one of the most impacted groups as they are at the frontline to fight against the virus and to try to save the lives of everyone affected. The present study aimed to explore the impact of working in COVID-19 wards on the mental health and wellbeing of nurses in the early stage of the pandemic in a hospital in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. A qualitative study was conducted with 22 nurses, recruited using purposive sampling. Data collection was conducted from April to May 2022 and data analysis was guided by qualitative framework analysis. The findings show that nurses experienced a range of mental health impacts including fear of being infected and infecting loved ones; fear of early death; psychological distress related to the conflict between the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and both professionalism and moral responsibility for patients; stress due to long waiting period to know the result of the COVID-19 tests; stress and worry due to public indifference and lack of role models; the negative impact of community doubt and distrust around COVID-19; and distress due to stigma and discrimination towards nurses caring for COVID-19 patients and their families. The current findings indicate further psychological intervention programs to support nurses, especially the ones in resource poor settings and enhance their psychological resilience.","Asa, Fauk, Ratu, Ward, Gaa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-01131-6","20221208","COVID-19; Indonesia; Mental health; Nurses; Resource poor settings; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42218,""
"A cross-sectional student survey of the impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns on clinical placement in England","Clinical placement is an essential aspect of student radiographers' training. The Covid-19 pandemic proved challenging for diagnostic radiography students disrupting clinical placements. This study aims to explore the impact of Covid-19 on first and second year student diagnostic radiographers' in clinical practice during the Covid-19 lockdown periods and Covid-19 waves in England. A cross-sectional online survey was used to attain quantitative attitudinal 5-point Likert and qualitative free-text response data. Descriptive and inferential statistics data analysis applied the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test. The qualitative data were thematically coded and analysed for patterns of reoccurring themes. There were n&#xa0;=&#xa0;85 responses from n&#xa0;=&#xa0;9 different counties within England. Students reported missing between n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1-14 weeks of placement. There was a lack of (41%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;35) or limited radiography staff (21%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;18) in the clinical departments and a lack of a range of X-ray examinations available (67%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;57) during the Covid-19 lockdowns, which affected completing practice assessments. Negative effects included stress, anxiety and worry (68%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58); positive effects included team working (16.4%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14), learning to work under pressure (12.9%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11), and preparation for qualifying (8.2%; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7). This study identified that students needed more support in this critical aspect of their training. There were both positive and negative responses; notably, the results highlight how the Covid-19 lockdowns have strained the National Health Service (NHS) and adversely affected radiography students. The findings underscore the need for university educators and student liaison radiographers within hospitals to have an awareness of the mental health and practical learning needs of the students they are instructing post-Covid-19 lockdown.","Hinds, Lockwood","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2022.11.006","20221208","Clinical placement; Covid-19; Radiography education; Student experience; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42219,""
"An online behavior change intervention to promote physical activity in adults with asthma: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial","Behavior change interventions have been the focus of recent studies, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of online interventions. However, no previous studies have investigated behavior change techniques to improve physical activity in adults with asthma through online intervention. This double-blind clinical trial will investigate the effectiveness of an online behavior change intervention in increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in adults with asthma, as well as in improving other clinical outcomes in short and medium terms. Patients with clinically stable moderate to severe asthma, who are physically inactive and do not have cardiovascular and/or osteoneuromuscular impairments will be randomized into control or intervention groups (23 in each). Both groups will carry out an online educational program (1 h). Additionally, the intervention group will receive weekly individual online sessions for 12 weeks of motivation-based behavior change intervention to promote an increase in physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior based on both self-determination theory and transtheoretical model. The intervention group will also receive an activity monitor with specific strategies related to it. Both groups will be reassessed immediately after the intervention and 6 months after that. The primary outcomes are physical activity and sedentary behavior, which will be objectively assessed by a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X-BT). Secondary outcomes are Asthma Control Questionnaire, Incremental Step Test, Sit-To-Stand, Timed Up-and-Go, 4-Metre Gait Speed, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Actiwatch 2, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The intervention is unprecedented and was carefully developed to joint most characteristics and techniques of both behavioral strategies (transtheoretical model and self-determination theory). Therefore, this intervention has the potential to improve physical activity levels and asthma management and reduce sedentary behavior. As a consequence, this novel intervention will improve global health in this population and support its use in clinical practice. The intervention will be carried out online with direct weekly contact with the therapist. Consequently, it has low implementation costs, might improve patient's attendance, and has the potential to be largely offered elsewhere. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05241223 .

"Mental health, economic well-being and health care access amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods study among urban men who have sex with men in India","Scant empirical research from Asia has addressed the impact of COVID-19 on sexual minority health. We aimed to explore and understand the impact of COVID-19 on income security, mental health, HIV risk and access to health services among men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. We conducted a concurrent mixed methods study from April to June 2020, including a cross-sectional survey and in-depth semi-structured interviews with MSM recruited from three non-governmental organisations providing HIV prevention services in Chandigarh, India. We examined the associations of sexual minority stressors (sexual stigma, internalised homonegativity), economic stressors, and stress due to social distancing, with depression and anxiety, HIV risk, and access to health services. Survey findings (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;132) indicated that internalised homonegativity and stress related to social distancing were significantly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results also showed reduced access to condoms, HIV testing and counselling services. Qualitative findings (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) highlighted adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, including loss of employment/wages and engaging in survival sex work, which contributed to psychological distress and HIV risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable psychological and financial distress among low socioeconomic status MSM in India, including those involved in sex work - communities already marginalised in economic, family and healthcare sectors. Structural interventions to improve access to mental health and HIV services and decrease financial burden are critical to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.","Chakrapani, Newman, Sebastian, Rawat, Mittal, Gupta, Kaur","https://doi.org/10.1080/26410397.2022.2144087","20221208","COVID-19; MSM; anxiety; depression; income security; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42221,""
"Effects of a concurrent training, respiratory muscle exercise and self-management recommendations on recovery from post-COVID-19 conditions: the RECOVE trial","The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of physical exercise, respiratory muscle training and the self-management WHO recommendations leaflet on the recovery of physical fitness, quality of life and symptom status in people with post COVID-19 conditions. Eighty non-hospitalized adults with a post-COVID-19 condition were randomly assigned to one of four 8-week parallel intervention groups: multicomponent exercise program based on concurrent training- CT (n= 20; 3 resistance and endurance supervised sessions per week at low-moderate intensity); b) inspiratory muscle training- RM (n= 17; 2 standardized daily sessions); c) a combination of both of the above- CTRM (n= 23); d) control group- CON (n= 20; following the WHO guidelines for post-COVID-19 related illness rehabilitation). No significant differences between groups were detected at baseline. While no significant differences between interventions were detected in the VO<sub>2max</sub>, significant individual improvements were identified in the CT (7.5%; ES=0.38) and CTRM (7.8%; ES=0.28) groups. Lower body muscle strength significantly improved in the CT and CTRM (14.5-32.6%; ES=0.27-1.13) groups compared to RM and CON (-0.3-11.3%; ES=0.19-0.00). The CT and CTRM groups improved significantly for dyspnea and fatigue, as did the health status. In addition, significant differences between interventions were described in fatigue and depression scales favouring CT and CTRM interventions. An individualized and supervised concurrent training with or without respiratory muscle training was safer and more effective than self-care recommendations and inspiratory muscle training alone, to regain cardiovascular and muscular fitness, improve symptom severity and health status in outpatients with post-COVID-19 conditions.","Jimeno-Almaz&#xe1;n, Buend&#xed;a-Romero, Mart&#xed;nez-Cava, Franco-L&#xf3;pez, S&#xe1;nchez-Alcaraz, Courel-Ib&#xe1;&#xf1;ez, Pallar&#xe9;s","https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00489.2022","20221208","fatigue; long COVID; physical activity; post-COVID-19 syndrome; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42222,""
"Psychological stress and coping strategies among frontline healthcare workers supporting patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective study and literature review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak might have a psychological impact on frontline healthcare workers. However, the effectiveness of coping strategies was less reported. We aimed to investigate the sources of stress and coping strategies among frontline healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19. We also performed a literature review regarding the effects of coping methods on psychological health in this population. We included frontline healthcare workers who completed an online survey using self-made psychological stress questionnaires in a cross-sectional study. We evaluated the association between potential factors and high-stressed status using a logistic regression model. We performed the principal component analysis with varimax rotation for factor analysis. We also performed a systematic review of published randomized controlled studies that reported the effects of coping methods on psychological health in COVID-19 healthcare workers. We included 107 [32 (29-36) years] respondents in the final analysis, with a response rate of 80.5%. A total of 41 (38.3%) respondents were high-stressed. Compared with the low-stressed respondents, those with high-stress were less likely to be male (46.3% <i>versus</i> 72.7%, <i>p</i>&#x2004;=&#x2004;0.006), nurses (36.6% <i>versus</i> 80.3%, <i>p</i>&#x2004;&lt;&#x2004;0.001), and more likely to have higher professional titles (<i>p</i>&#x2004;=&#x2004;0.008). The sources of high-stress in frontline healthcare workers were categorized into 'work factor', 'personal factor', and 'role factor'. A narrative synthesis of the randomized controlled studies revealed that most of the coping methods could improve the psychological stress in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that some frontline healthcare workers experienced psychological stress during the early pandemic. Effective coping strategies are required to help relieve the stress in this population.","Ding, Jian, Xu, Lin, Chen, Zhang, Huang, Chen, Xia, Zhang, Du","https://doi.org/10.1177/17534666221130215","20221208","coping strategies; coronavirus disease 2019; frontline healthcare worker; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42223,""
"Identifying Core Competencies for Remote Delivery of Psychological Interventions: A Rapid Review","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid shift toward remote delivery of psychological interventions and transition to voice-only and video communication platforms. However, agreement is lacking on key competencies that are aligned with equitable approaches for standardized training and supervision of remote psychological intervention delivery. A rapid review was conducted to identify and describe competencies that could inform best practices of remote services delivery during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Scopus, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched for literature published in English (2015-2021) on competencies for synchronous, remote psychological interventions that can be measured through observation. Of 135 articles identified, 12 met inclusion criteria. Studies targeted populations in high-income countries (11 in the United States and Canada, one in Saudi Arabia) and focused on specialist practitioners, professionals, or trainees in professional or prelicensure programs working with adult populations. Ten skill categories were identified: emergency and safety protocols for remote services, facilitating communication over remote platforms, remote consent procedures, technological literacy, practitioner-client identification for remote services, confidentiality during remote services, communication skills during remote services, engagement and interpersonal skills for remote services, establishing professional boundaries during remote services, and encouraging continuity of care during remote services. These 10 skills domains can offer a foundation for refinement of discrete, individual-level competencies that can be aligned with global initiatives promoting use of observational competency assessment during training and supervision programs for psychological interventions. More research is needed on identification of and agreement on remote competencies and on their evaluation.","Pedersen, Pfeffer, Brown, Carswell, Willhoite, Schafer, Kohrt","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100677","20221208","Competence; Coronavirus/COVID-19; Mental health; Psychological intervention; Research/service delivery; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-09","",42224,""
