"Love in the time of COVID-19: A brief report on relationship and individual functioning among committed couples in the United States while under shelter-in-place orders","The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has changed many aspects of people's daily life, including increased time at home in response to shelter-in-place orders, heightened stress about health effects of COVID-19, and shifts in other domains of life (e.g., employment). These lifestyle changes are likely to impact the well-being of individuals and their romantic relationships. This investigation examined how COVID-19 influenced couple and individual well-being in real-time during the early phase of the pandemic. Data were collected in early May 2020 during shelter-in-place orders in the United States. Participants in committed relationships (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 332) completed an online survey assessing their experiences currently and before the pandemic. Results suggested that while couple functioning overall maintained or even improved, individual well-being was more negatively impacted by the pandemic. Moreover, some groups who are at higher risk of a poor health outcome from COVID-19 or experience unique challenges as a result of COVID-19 reported worse outcomes (e.g., those whose employment changed) while others did not decline in their psychological and couple functioning (e.g., Black individuals and older individuals). These findings suggest that the pandemic has had varied impacts on couples and individuals, as well as across different virus-related risk factors. Further research is needed to understand the nuanced effects of this pandemic on couples and individuals across time. La pandemia de la COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos ha cambiado muchos aspectos de la vida diaria de las personas, por ejemplo, el aumento del tiempo que pasan en sus hogares en respuesta a ÃƒÂ³rdenes de confinamiento, un estrÃƒÂ©s mÃƒÂ¡s elevado por los efectos de la COVID-19 en la salud, y cambios en otros aspectos de la vida (p. ej.: en el empleo). Estos cambios en el estilo de vida probablemente repercutan en el bienestar de las personas y en sus relaciones amorosas. En esta investigaciÃƒÂ³n se analizÃƒÂ³ cÃƒÂ³mo la COVID-19 influyÃƒÂ³ en el bienestar de las parejas y de los individuos en tiempo real durante la primera fase de la pandemia. A principios de mayo de 2020 se recopilaron datos durante las ÃƒÂ³rdenes de confinamiento en los Estados Unidos. Los participantes que estaban en relaciones de pareja estables (n=332) contestaron una encuesta en lÃƒÂ­nea donde se evaluaron sus experiencias de ese momento y las anteriores a la pandemia. Los resultados indicaron que, si bien el funcionamiento de la pareja en general se mantuvo o incluso mejorÃƒÂ³, la pandemia afectÃƒÂ³ mÃƒÂ¡s negativamente el bienestar individual. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, algunos grupos que tienen mayor riesgo de resultados desfavorables en la salud como consecuencia de la COVID-19 o enfrentan dificultades singulares como resultado de la COVID-19 informaron peores resultados (p. ej.: aquellos cuyos empleos cambiaron), mientras que otros no tuvieron un empeoramiento de su funcionamiento psicolÃƒÂ³gico y de pareja (p. ej.: las personas de color y las personas mayores). Estos resultados sugieren que la pandemia ha tenido efectos variados en las parejas y en los individuos, asÃƒÂ­ como entre los diferentes factores de riesgo relacionados con el virus. Se necesitan mÃƒÂ¡s investigaciones para comprender los efectos sutiles de esta pandemia en las parejas y en los individuos con el transcurso del tiempo.

"Longitudinal associations with alcohol consumption during the first COVID-19 lockdown: Associations with mood, drinking motives, context of drinking, and mental health","Coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in lockdown measures in the UK, which has impacted alcohol use. Alcohol is often used as a coping mechanism and there are public health concerns regarding excessive consumption due to the pandemic. We aimed to longitudinally assess drinking behaviors, and associated factors, during the first UK government-mandated lockdown. An online survey was distributed through social media (8<sup>th</sup> April 2020, onwards). Fortnightly follow up surveys were emailed to participants. The primary outcome measure was 'weekly unit consumption' and data was collected on a range of potentially related factors: demographics, factors relating to COVID-19 (e.g., health, work status), drinking motives, context of drinking, drinking intentions, mood, depression and anxiety. A total of 539 self-selected participants completed the baseline survey, with 186 completing at least 3 follow up surveys for multilevel modelling analysis. Personal coping motives, anxiety, drinking at home alone, and drinking at home with others were positively associated with alcohol consumption during lockdown. The following baseline measures also predicted increased consumption: male gender, lower education, and higher AUDIT scores (based on behavior prior to lockdown). Findings were consistent when utilizing an inverse probability weight to account for predictors of attrition (female, younger age, higher baseline AUDIT scores). Those already drinking at hazardous levels were more likely to increase their consumption, as were those who were drinking to cope. As we recover from the pandemic, there is a need for widespread alcohol support, and certain groups may need targeted support.","Irizar, Jones, Christiansen, Goodwin, Gage, Roberts, Knibb, Cooke, Rose","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108913","20210727","Alcohol behavior; Coping; Covid-19; Motives; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16583,""
"Loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic: change and predictors of change from strict to discontinued social distancing protocols","The COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing protocols designed to impede transmission of the corona virus have severe mental health consequences. This study examine changes in loneliness in the general adult population when the corona-related social distancing protocols were largely discontinued (T2) following a period of strict protocols (T1), predictors and correlates of these changes, and the associations between loneliness and depression and anxiety symptoms. In an online survey, 10,061 responded at T1. At T2, these respondents were asked to complete the survey again, and 4936 (49.1%) of them responded. Loneliness decreased from T1 to T2, but only to a minor extent. Using a multilevel approach, younger age was found to be related to more reduction of loneliness from T1 to T2. Higher health anxiety was found to predict less reduction of loneliness across time. Reduction of maladaptive coping strategies and negative metacognitive beliefs from T1 to T2 were both associated with reduction in loneliness. In turn, reductions in loneliness were associated with reductions of depression and anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that health anxiety, maladaptive coping strategies and negative meta-beliefs are potential targets of intervention to alleviate loneliness.

"Examining risk and protective factors for psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly impacted people's lives, with significant mental health consequences emerging. In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19 specific factors, psychological risk and protective mechanisms likely influence individual differences in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined associations between a broad set of risk and protective factors with depression, anxiety, alcohol problems, and eating pathology, and investigated interactions between objective stress due to COVID-19 and risk/protective variables in predicting psychopathology. Participants were 877 adults (73.7% female) recruited via internet sources from around the globe, but primarily residing in North America (87.4%). Structural equation modelling revealed that certain risk and protective factors (e.g., loneliness, mindfulness) were broadly related to psychopathology, whereas others showed unique relations with specific symptoms (e.g., greater repetitive thinking and anxiety; low meaning and purpose and depression). COVID-19 objective stress interacted with risk factors, but not protective factors, to predict greater anxiety symptoms, but not other forms of psychopathology. Findings contribute to our understanding of psychological mechanisms underlying individual differences in psychopathology in the context of a global stressor. Strategies that reduce loneliness and increase mindfulness will likely impact the greatest number of mental health symptoms.","Racine, Miller, Mehak, Trolio","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1958789","20210727","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; mindfulness; protective factors; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16585,""

"Voices from the COVID-19 frontline: Nurses' trauma and coping","To describe the experiences of frontline nurses who are working in critical care areas during the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on trauma and the use of substances as a coping mechanism. A qualitative study based on content analysis. Data were collected from mid-June 2020 to early September 2020 via an online survey. Nurses were recruited through the research webpage of the American Association of Critical Care Nurses as well as an alumni list from a large, public Midwest university. Responses to two open-ended items were analysed: (1) personal or professional trauma the nurse had experienced; and (2) substance or alcohol use, or other mental health issues the nurse had experienced or witnessed in other nurses. For the item related to psychological trauma five themes were identified from 70 nurses' comments: (1) Psychological distress in multiple forms; (2) Tsunami of death; (3) Torn between two masters; (4) Betrayal; and (5) Resiliency/posttraumatic growth through self and others. Sixty-five nurses responded to the second item related to substance use and other mental health issues. Data supported three themes: (1) Mental health crisis NOW!!: 'more stressed than ever and stretched thinner than ever'; (2) Nurses are turning to a variety of substances to cope; and (3) Weakened supports for coping and increased maladaptive coping due to ongoing pandemic. This study brings novel findings to understand the experiences of nurses who care for patients with COVID-19, including trauma experienced during disasters, the use of substances to cope and the weakening of existing support systems. Findings also reveal nurses in crisis who are in need of mental health services. Support for nurses' well-being and mental health should include current and ongoing services offered by the organization and include screening for substance use issues.","Foli, Forster, Cheng, Zhang, Chiu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14988","20210727","COVID-19; content analysis; mental health; nursing; psychological trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16588,""
"Consultant psychiatrists' perspectives on occupational stress in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS)","Occupational stress is increasingly recognised as key factor contributing to service quality, safety, and worker wellbeing, with clinician providers most at high risk. To explore work-related stressors among consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists working in CAMHS. Fifty-two consultants completed an online questionnaire with free-text entries describing factors contributing to occupational stress in CAMHS in Ireland. Content analysis indicated that consultants' perception of working conditions revolved around six factors: organisational factors, human resources, adequacy of services, professional relationships, socio-political factors, and public perception. Both adequate skilled staff and funding, identified by 54% and 34% of respondents, were viewed as essential factors associated with occupational wellbeing, the most often cited concern (raised by 56% consultants) which contributed to occupational stress was of widespread public misunderstanding of CAMHS' remit. Given decades of under-resourcing, ensuring adequate levels and expertise of staffing in the post-COVID-19 era must become a reality. However, less obvious and equally important is that of correcting any public misperceptions regarding CAMHS ""core"" business to ensure that available scarce resources are utilised most effectively, and that staff stress levels are minimised. To achieve this, active engagement between service users, providers and planners must be undertaken.","Doody, O'Connor, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02648-6","20210727","Burnout; COVID-19; Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS); Occupational stress; Public perceptions; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16589,""
"Individual- and Institutional-level Concerns of Health Care Workers in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis","Mental health and coping difficulties among health care workers (HCWs) have been reported during pandemics and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. To examine sources of distress and concern for HCWs in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this qualitative study, a critical discourse analysis was performed of questions posed by HCWs to hospital senior leadership between March 16, 2020, and December 1, 2020, through an online employee forum as part of a larger mixed-methods evaluation of a stepped-care mental health support program for HCWs at 1 of Canada's largest health care institutions. Questions could be submitted online anonymously in advance of the virtual forums on COVID-19 by any of the University Health Network's 21Ã¢â‚¬Â¯555 employees, and staff members were able to anonymously endorse questions by upvoting, indicating that an already posed question was of interest. Themes, text structure, and rhetorical devices used within the questions were analyzed, taking into consideration their larger institutional and societal context. Unique individual views of the forums ranged from 2062 to 7213 during the study period. Major individual-level concerns related to risks of contamination and challenges coping with increased workloads as a result of the pandemic intersected with institutional-level challenges, such as feeling or being valued within the health care setting and long-standing stratifications between types of HCWs. Concerns were frequently reported in terms of calls for clarity or demands for transparency from the institutional leadership. The findings of this qualitative study suggest that larger institutional-level and structural concerns need to be addressed if HCWs are to be engaged in support and coping programs. Potential service users may be dissuaded from seeing their needs as being met by workplace mental health interventions that solely relate to individual-level concerns.","Berkhout, Sheehan, Abbey","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18425","20210728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16590,""
"Adolescents' Exposure to and Experiences of Weight Stigma During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the proliferation of pediatric obesity amidst significant changes in weight-related health functioning (e.g., compromised physical activity, limited food access, increased stress). The present cross-sectional study investigated adolescents' feelings about their bodies and perceived changes in weight stigma from peers, parents, and social media during the pandemic. Four hundred fifty-two adolescents (11-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) completed an online survey during the Fall of 2020. Measures assessed perceived changes in exposure to weight stigmatizing social media content (stress eating jokes, weight gain memes) and experiences of weight stigma (weight-based bullying, teasing, hurtful comments) by parents and peers, as well as body dissatisfaction, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weight status and gender were examined as individual difference variables. The majority (53%) of adolescents reported increased exposure to at least one form of weight stigmatizing social media content during the pandemic. Additionally, pandemic-related increases in body dissatisfaction were prevalent (41%), especially among girls with higher body mass index (Ã¢â€°Â¥85th percentile; 67%). On average, the extent to which adolescents experienced weight-based mistreatment from parents and peers remained consistent with their pre-pandemic experiences. Overall, these findings highlight changes in the social messages that adolescents receive about their bodies, as well as their subjective body satisfaction, during the pandemic. Results underscore the need for healthcare providers and mental health professionals to be aware of the potential rise in weight stigma during the pandemic, and encourage families and schools to engage in supportive, rather than stigmatizing, weight-related communication with youth.","Lessard, Puhl","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab071","20210727","COVID-19; adolescence; body dissatisfaction; overweight; weight stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16591,""
"Association Between Mental Health Disorders and Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19 in 7 Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Heterogeneous evidence exists for the association between COVID-19 and the clinical outcomes of patients with mental health disorders. It remains unknown whether patients with COVID-19 and mental health disorders are at increased risk of mortality and should thus be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19. To determine whether patients with mental health disorders were at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality compared with patients without mental health disorders. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to February 12, 2021. Bibliographies were also searched, and the corresponding authors were directly contacted. The search paradigm was based on the following combination: (mental, major[MeSH terms]) AND (COVID-19 mortality[MeSH terms]). To ensure exhaustivity, the term mental was replaced by psychiatric, schizophrenia, psychotic, bipolar disorder, mood disorders, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, alcohol abuse, alcohol misuse, substance abuse, and substance misuse. Eligible studies were population-based cohort studies of all patients with identified COVID-19 exploring the association between mental health disorders and mortality. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO. Pooled crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association of mental health disorders with mortality were calculated using a 3-level random-effects (study/country) approach with a hierarchical structure to assess effect size dependency. In total, 16 population-based cohort studies (data from medico-administrative health or electronic/medical records databases) across 7 countries (1 from Denmark, 2 from France, 1 from Israel, 3 from South Korea, 1 from Spain, 1 from the UK, and 7 from the US) and 19 086 patients with mental health disorders were included. The studies covered December 2019 to July 2020, were of good quality, and no publication bias was identified. COVID-19 mortality was associated with an increased risk among patients with mental health disorders compared with patients without mental health disorders according to both pooled crude OR (1.75 [95% CI, 1.40-2.20]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) and adjusted OR (1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.65]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). The patients with severe mental health disorders had the highest ORs for risk of mortality (crude OR: 2.26 [95% CI, 1.18-4.31]; adjusted OR: 1.67 [95% CI, 1.02-2.73]). In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 observational studies in 7 countries, mental health disorders were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality. Thus, patients with mental health disorders should have been targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19, requiring enhanced preventive and disease management strategies. Future studies should more accurately evaluate the risk for patients with each mental health disorder. However, the highest risk seemed to be found in studies including individuals with schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorders.","Fond, Nemani, Etchecopar-Etchart, Loundou, Goff, Lee, Lancon, Auquier, Baumstarck, Llorca, Yon, Boyer","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2274","20210727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16592,""
"Big data-based analysis to characterise and identify variations in the type of Primary Care visits before and during COVID in Catalonia","The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the care model of health systems around the world upside down, abruptly cancelling face-to-face visits to avoid contagion and redirecting the model towards telemedicine. Digital transformation boosts information systems, which, the more robust they are, the easier it is to monitor the healthcare system in a highly complex state and allow for more agile and reliable analysis. To analyse diagnoses from primary care visits and distinguish between those that had higher and lower variations, relative to the 2019 and 2020 periods (roughly pre- and during COVID), to identify clinical profiles that may have been most impaired and diagnoses least visited during the pandemic. A database from the Primary Care Services Information Technologies Information System of Catalonia is used. The object of the analysis is the register of visits (2,824,185) and their diagnostic codes (3921974, mean 01.38 per visit) as approximators of the reason for consultation, registered according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) at three different grouping levels. The data is represented by a term frequency matrix and analysed recursively in different partitions aggregated according to date. In number of visits, the increase in non-face-to-face (+267%) does not compensate for the decrease in face-to-face visits (-47%), with an overall reduction in the total number of visits (-1.36%) despite the notable increase in nursing visits (10.54%). The visits with the largest increase in 2020 are those with diagnoses related to COVID-19 (codes Z20-Z29, 2.540%), along with codes related to economic and housing problems (Z55-Z65, 44.40%). Most of the rest of the codes visited decrease in 2020 relative to 2019. Those that have presented the most important reductions have been some chronic pathologies such as arterial hypertension (I10-I16; -32.73%) or diabetes mellitus (E08-E13; -21.13%), but also obesity (E65-E68; -48.58%) and bodily injuries (T14; -33.70%). Visits with mental health related diagnosis codes have decreased, but less than average. Both for children and adolescents and for adults, there was a decrease in consultations for respiratory infections (J00-J06; -40.96%). The results show very significant year-on-year variations (in absolute terms, an average of 12%), a sign of the strong shock to the health system. The disruption in the primary care model in Catalonia has led to an explosion in the number of non-face-to-face visits. There has been a reduction in the number of visits for diagnoses related to chronic pathologies, respiratory infections, obesity and bodily injuries. Instead, visits for diagnoses related to socio-economic and housing problems have increased, which emphasizes the importance of Social Determinants of Health in this pandemic context. Big data-based approaches built with routine care data, as the one presented in this analysis, are consistent with intuitions from everyday clinical practice and can help inform decision making by health planners in order to use the next few years to focus on the least treated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lopez Segui, Hernandez Guillamet, PifarrÃƒÂ© Arolas, Marin Gomez, Ruiz Comellas, Ramirez Morros, Adroher Mas, Vidal-Alaball","https://doi.org/10.2196/29622","20210727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16593,""
"Exploring the experience of acute inpatient mental health care from the perspective of family and carers of people experiencing psychosis: A qualitative thematic analysis study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic","Family and carers play an important role in supporting service users who are in receipt of acute mental health inpatient care, but they can also be significantly emotionally and physically impacted. The aim of this study was to examine their needs and priorities during this time. Fourteen family and carers of inpatients experiencing psychosis completed semi-structured interviews examining their experiences of inpatient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Four key themes were identified: 'A turbulent journey to hospital admission', 'I need information and support', 'Maintaining my relationship with my loved one' and 'Inpatient care is a mixed bag'. Each theme comprised four or five subthemes. The findings demonstrated that family and carers feel excluded from inpatient care and struggled to maintain contact with their loved ones, which was exacerbated by COVID-19 related restrictions. Communication and being regularly informed about their loved one's care, as well as visiting loved ones, was particularly problematic. Inpatient care needs to be more inclusive of family and carers and ensure they are kept in mind at every stage of the admission.","Wood, Constant, Byrne","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12915","20210727","carer; family; inpatient mental health; psychosis; qualitative; semi-structured interview","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16594,""
"Self-Injury and Domestic Violence in Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Trajectories, Precursors, and Correlates","We examined the longitudinal course of, and pre- and during-pandemic risk factors for, self-injury and domestic physical violence perpetration in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data came from a Swiss longitudinal study (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 786, age ~22 in 2020), with one prepandemic (2018) and four during-pandemic assessments (2020). The prevalence of self-injury did not change between April (during the first Swiss national lockdown) and September 2020 (postlockdown). Domestic violence perpetration increased temporarily in males. Prepandemic self-injury was a major risk factor for during-pandemic self-injury. Specific living arrangements, pandemic-related stressor accumulation, and a lack of adaptive coping strategies were associated with during-pandemic self-injury and domestic violence. Stressor accumulation had indirect effects on self-injury and domestic violence through negative emotions.","Steinhoff, Bechtiger, Ribeaud, Murray, Hepp, Eisner, Shanahan","https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12659","20210727","COVID-19; domestic violence; longitudinal; self-injury; young adulthood","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16595,""
"Psychological distress, loneliness, alcohol use and suicidality in New Zealanders with mental illness during a strict COVID-19 lockdown","People with pre-existing mental health conditions may have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions. In this study, we compared psychological outcomes, experiences and sources of stress over the pandemic lockdown in New Zealanders with and without a previous diagnosis of mental illness. Two online surveys were conducted in New Zealand over the level 4 lockdown in April 2020 measuring psychological distress, anxiety, well-being, suicidality, alcohol use and subjective experiences. They included 3389 participants, of whom 18.4% reported having been previously diagnosed with a mental illness. During the lockdown, people previously diagnosed with a mental illness had about twice the risk of reporting moderate-high levels of psychological distress (K10Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Â©Â¾Ã¢â‚¬â€°12), at least moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Â©Â¾Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) and poor well-being (WHO-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Â©Â½Ã¢â‚¬â€°12). They reported increased alcohol use and were about four times as likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts with 3% reporting having made a suicide attempt over the lockdown period. They reported less satisfaction with, and poorer relationships with people in their 'bubble', reduced social contacts and greater loneliness. They also reported higher levels of health and financial concerns. During the COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand, people with a previous diagnosis of a mental illness were at increased risk of detrimental psychological outcomes. This highlights the importance of recognising this and the challenges people face in pandemics.","Bell, Williman, Beaglehole, Stanley, Jenkins, Gendall, Rapsey, Every-Palmer","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211034317","20210727","COVID-19; Mental illness; lockdown; suicide, anxiety; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16596,""

"The Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety and Associated Factors among the General Public during COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-sectional Study in Korea","Since its first case confirmed on January 20, 2020, Korea has been through three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fears of the fourth wave persist as new cases continue to emerge. In such unpredictable times, the mental well-being of people is of crucial importance. This study examined the levels of depression and anxiety and their predictors among the Korean general public in Busan, Korea, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study via a self-reported questionnaire administered to 2,288 adult residents (aged 19-60 years) of Busan, Korea. Participants' depression and anxiety were assessed using the Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which consists of PHQ-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), with the cutoff score of 3. The mean age of the participants was 39.71 years. COVID-19 had several psychosocial impacts on people. It was revealed that 80.3% had restrictions in outside activities, 47.3% reported financial difficulties, and 53.6% had a fear of death or fatal outcome when infected with COVID-19. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with depression and anxiety. A total of 30.7% participants were classified as at risk of depression based on cutoff score of 3 on PHQ-2. Logistic regression analysis revealed that changes in sleep pattern due to COVID-19 were most strongly associated with depression, followed by restrictions in outside activities due to social distancing and increased family conflicts due to COVID-19. Also, 22.6% participants were classified as at risk of anxiety based on a cutoff score of 3 on GAD-2. Analysis revealed that changes in sleep pattern due to COVID-19 were most strongly associated with anxiety, followed by spending a lot of time searching for COVID-19-related information and having a fear of death or fatal outcome when infected with COVID-19. The results are alarming; 30.7% had a PHQ-2 score of 3 or higher, indicating depression, and 22.6% had a GAD-2 score of 3 or higher, indicating anxiety. Changes in sleep pattern had the strongest association with both depression and anxiety. Our results can be used to formulate mental health policies tailored to the context of the city. Our findings suggest the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in the society during the COVID-19 pandemic, which places growing importance on early intervention for mental health problems during these times.","Kim, Bang, Kim, Park","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e214","20210727","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental Health; Pandemic; Public","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16598,""
"Saffron for <i>""toning down""</i> COVID-19-related cytokine storm: Hype or hope? A mini-review of current evidence","To assess the potential role of saffron in downregulating inflammation and cytokine storm during COVID-19. Three main compounds of saffron, i.e., crocetin esters, picrocrocin, and safranal, present strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action for several disease states (e.g., Alzheimer's, cancer, and depression) but have also been studied in COVID-19. In particular, based on our comprehensive review of both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> studies, saffron's essential oils and other constituents appear to have both immunomodulatory and anti-asthmatic actions; these actions can be particularly helpful to treat patients with respiratory symptoms due to COVID-19. Moreover, crocin appears to reduce the COVID-19-related cytokine cascade and downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (<i>ACE2</i>) gene expression. Last, <i>in silico</i> studies suggest that saffron's astragalin and crocin could have inhibitory actions on SARS-CoV-2 protease and spike protein, respectively. Saffron represents a promising substance for toning down cytokine storm during COVID-19, as well as a potential preventive treatment for COVID-19. However, appropriate randomized clinical trials, especially those using biomarkers as surrogates to assess inflammatory status, should be designed in order to assess the clinical efficacy of saffron and allow its use as an adjunct treatment modality, particularly in resource-poor settings where access to drugs may be limited.","Mentis, Dalamaga, Lu, Polissiou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2021.100111","20210728","COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Saffron; Traditional medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16599,""
"Psychosocio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on gastroenterology and endoscopy practice","Beyond posing a major health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted profound psychological, social, and economic impacts on populations worldwide. Mass quarantines and social isolation have affected the mental health of the wider population, exacerbating other stressors, including fear of the virus and its repercussions, general uncertainty, and financial insecurity. The pandemic has challenged the broader delivery of healthcare--ranging from the need to triage limited hospital resources to balancing risk mitigation with maintaining medical care. Specific to gastroenterology, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not only been associated with complicating extant medical conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but has also forced a shift in the practice of gastroenterology by patients, families, and healthcare providers alike. The gastroenterology field has been required to adapt its practices to minimize the possibility of viral spread while still upholding patient care. Healthcare practitioners in GI have helped to treat COVID-19 patients, stratified inpatient and outpatient visits and procedures, and shifted to telemedicine. Still, as is the case with much of the general population, healthcare providers working in GI practice or endoscopy have faced personal and professional stressors, mental health difficulties, social isolation, financial pressures, and familial burdens--all of which can take a toll on practitioners and, by extension, the provision of GI care overall. This article will highlight how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological wellbeing, social engagement, and economic conditions of the public, healthcare providers, and GI professionals specifically. Recommendations for strategies that can continue GI services while maintaining safety for both caregivers and patients are put forth to help uphold critical GI care during this worldwide crisis.","Shen","https://doi.org/10.1093/gastro/goab012","20210728","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; economic impact; endoscopy; gastroenterology; healthcare professionals/providers; psychosocial impact; social impact; stress; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16600,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and learning of college and university students: a protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 has a serious impact on people's physical health and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic forced college and university students to take online classes, which may have bad impacts on students' learning. In addition, the students lost many job opportunities during the pandemic. Faced with employment and study pressure and worried about the epidemic, college and university students were prone to increased overall negative emotion, anxiety and depression. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and learning of college and university students. We will conduct electronic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Two researchers will independently screen the studies, extract data and assess the quality of the included studies. Any disagreement will be resolved by the third investigator. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and other tools will be used to assess the risk of bias, according to the study design of included studies. OR, risk ratio, mean difference and 95% CI will be considered as the effect size. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by subgroup and sensitivity analysis, and publication bias will be detected by funnel plots, Begg's test and Egger's test.

"Anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital staff: systematic review plus meta-analysis","This study was conducted to systematically review the existing literature examining the prevalence of anxiety among hospital staff and identifying the contributing factors to address the complications of this disorder and develop effective programmes for reducing the complications of this mental health problem. We searched the electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar from January 2020 to February 2021. To perform meta-analysis, the random effects model was used. To assess the statistical heterogeneity of the included studies, the I<sup>2</sup> index was used, and 95% CI was estimated. Data analysis was performed by R software. In the final analysis, 46 articles with the total sample size of 61Ã¢â‚¬â€°551 hospital staff members were included. Accordingly, anxiety prevalence among healthcare workers (HCWs) was 26.1% (95% CI 19% to 34.6%). The prevalence rates of anxiety in health technicians and medical students were 39% (95% CI 13% to 73%) and 36% (95% CI 15% to 65%), respectively, indicating a much higher prevalence than other hospital staff members. Furthermore, a positive significant relationship between prevalence of anxiety among HCWs and their age was approved (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence rate of anxiety was higher among women 37.7% (95% CI 25.4% to 51.8%) than men 27.2% (95% CI 18.2% to 38.6%). The findings show a moderately high prevalence rate of anxiety in hospital staff. Due to the high prevalence of this mental health problem in health technicians, medical students and frontline health workers, it is highly suggested that healthcare institutions offer mental health programmes for these working groups in order to appropriately manage anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Raoofi, Pashazadeh Kan, Rafiei, Khani, Hosseinifard, Tajik, Masoumi, Raoofi, Ahmadi, Aghalou, Torabi, Dehnad, Hoseinipalangi, Rezaei, Shabaninejad, Ghashghaee","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-003125","20210727","COVID-19; depression; hospital care; psychological care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16602,""
"Spectrum of Suspected Cardiomyopathy Due to COVID-19: A Case Series","The effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system remains understudied given the early stage of the pandemic. Several case series and case reports have been published on COVID-19 related cardiomyopathies; however, there is often a lack of baseline echocardiographic data confirming a normal cardiac health prior to infection. Here we examine four patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function on prior echocardiogram who developed de novo cardiomyopathies which following COVID-19 infection. The study comprised of four individuals with an average age of 80.5 years, 75% of which were white males. 50% of cases were suspected to have Takotsubo CM vs. myocarditis while the remaining half were diagnosed as myocarditis. Left ventricular systolic function dropped from a normal range to an average of 30% during COVID-19 infection in these individuals. Moreover, half of the cases later died. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated its ability to cause several serious cardiovascular complications with associated worsening of prognosis. Repeat TTE showed recovery of systolic function in 50% of the patients included. There does not appear to be any correlation between COVID-19 related treatments, age, or level of inflammatory markers in those who recovered systolic function versus those who remained depressed. Given the minimal literature on this topic, it is evident more information is needed to help advance treatment and understanding of COVID-19 induced cardiomyopathies; particularly if the vaccination fails to protect against novel strains of COVID-19 and the virus becomes endemic.","Tutor, Unis, Ruiz, Bolaji, Bob-Manuel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2021.100926","20210727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16603,""

This study was performed as a systematic review on the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on sexual function and domestic violence in the world. Accordingly, all English-language studies conducted from the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to the end of 2020 were extracted by searching in the Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed (including Medline), Cochrane Library, and Science Direct databases and then reviewed. The quality of the articles was assessed using the STROBE checklist. A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review. Accordingly, domestic violence during the exposure to COVID-19 had increased. Moreover, the mean scores of sexual function and its components had reduced at the time of exposure to the pandemic compared to before.

All in all, our findings suggest that healthcare workers are under enormous stress during this pandemic, however, in order to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda, it is important to understand their challenges and sources of these challenges. The government thus has the reasonability to address most of the sources that were highlighted (long working hours, lack of proper equipment, lack of sleep, exhaustion, and experiencing high death rate under their care).

"Medical student wellness in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey","As United States (US) medical students suffer higher rates of depression and anxiety than the general population, the wellness of medical students is particularly salient. One definition describes wellness as having eight dimensions: Intellectual, emotional, physical, social, occupational, financial, environmental, and spiritual. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses unique challenges for medical students, we aimed to compare medical student wellness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. An informal survey was created to assess eight wellness dimensions and was distributed via Survey Monkey to US allopathic and osteopathic medical students via email and social media. The survey was administered from March 29, 2020 to June 23, 2020. Univariable and multivariable linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the change in students' overall wellness using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (least well) to 10 (most well). Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the change in students' responses to the eight dimensions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. On multivariable analysis, students reported a decline in their overall wellness during COVID-19 (M<sub>diff</sub> = -1.08; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Asian respondents reported little change in overall wellness (M = -0.65) when compared to White respondents (M = -1.16) and Black respondents (M = -1.57). Students felt less supported and comfortable with their social (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.47) and daily (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.45) environments and expressed decreased satisfaction with their exercise (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85), sense of purpose (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.33), and financial status (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75).

"A qualitative study about the mental health and wellbeing of older adults in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this study was to examine factors that threatened and protected the wellbeing of older adults living in the UK during social distancing restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured telephone or video interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Participants described potential threats to their wellbeing during the pandemic, including fears for mortality, grieving normal life, and concerns for the future. Participants also described activities and behaviours that helped to protect their mental health, including adopting a slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and using past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs. This study provides UK-based evidence that while someÃ‚Â older adults experienced challenges during the first wave of COVID-19, many were resilient throughout social distancing restrictions despite early reported concerns of mental health consequences among the older adult population. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining access to essentials to promote feelings of normality and use of social support to help reduce uncertainty in times of pandemics.","McKinlay, Fancourt, Burton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02367-8","20210727","Covid-19; Mental health; Older adults; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16607,""
"ENNAVIA is a novel method which employs neural networks for antiviral and anti-coronavirus activity prediction for therapeutic peptides","Viruses represent one of the greatest threats to human health, necessitating the development of new antiviral drug candidates. Antiviral peptides often possess excellent biological activity and a favourable toxicity profile, and therefore represent a promising field of novel antiviral drugs. As the quantity of sequencing data grows annually, the development of an accurate in silico method for the prediction of peptide antiviral activities is important. This study leverages advances in deep learning and cheminformatics to produce a novel sequence-based deep neural network classifier for the prediction of antiviral peptide activity. The method outperforms the existent best-in-class, with an external test accuracy of 93.9%, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.87 and an Area Under the Curve of 0.93 on the dataset of experimentally validated peptide activities. This cutting-edge classifier is available as an online web server at https://research.timmons.eu/ennavia, facilitating in silico screening and design of peptide antiviral drugs by the wider research community.","Timmons, Hewage","https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab258","20210723","Neural network; antiviral drugs; in silico screening; machine learning; peptides","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16608,""
"Social Isolation and Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Weight","Social isolation and loneliness have long been identified as risk factors for poorer physical and mental health and increased mortality. These factors have also been shown to impact dietary behavior and physical activity which play a role in precipitating and maintaining obesity. Less is known about the impact of social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in which social distancing is a major component of public health initiatives. This narrative review will examine the existing literature on the relationships between social isolation, loneliness, mental health, and weight as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with obesity are at very high risk for worsening course of COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. This population may also be more significantly impacted by the dietary and physical activity consequences resulting from lockdown, social distancing, and isolation. The pandemic has led to significant lifestyle disruptions. However, early studies have largely relied upon cross-sectional studies or convenience samples. Future research will need to study the impact more rigorously, particularly among populations at greatest risk.","Heinberg, Steffen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-021-00447-9","20210723","COVID-19; Loneliness; Obesity; Social isolation; dietary behavior; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16609,""
"Mental health and quality of life for people with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis in Aotearoa New Zealand following the COVID-19 national lockdown","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lockdown on the mental health (anxiety and depression) and quality of life (QOL) of people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures instituted at a national level by the New Zealand Government. The present cohort was 104 individuals with RA (73.1%) and AS (26.9%) who had previously completed surveys for the Patient Opinion Real-Time Anonymous Liaison (PORTAL) project in 2018. Participants completed an online survey between July and September 2020 assessing their experiences over the first national COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand (March-May, 2020). Fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection, baseline anxiety, and being younger in age were all predictors of participants' current anxiety levels. Current QOL scores were significantly lower than prior to lockdown and were predicted by baseline QOL and current depression. No variables predicted current depression other than baseline levels. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have had an impact on QOL and anxiety levels, but not depression for people with RA and AS in New Zealand. These novel findings imply that appropriate screening of mental health issues should be included in planning within the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and for future pandemics to optimise the wellbeing of people with RA and AS.","Johnstone, Treharne, Fletcher, Lamar, White, Harrison, Stebbings","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04952-x","20210723","Anxiety; Cohort study; Depression; Infection; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16610,""
"The pandemic is not occurring in a vacuum: The impact of COVID-19 and other disasters on workforce mental health in Australia","Prior to COVID-19, many Australians experienced extreme bushfires, droughts and floods. A history of experiencing these events might be a risk factor for increased psychological distress during COVID-19. This study aimed to provide insight into the mental health of Australian workers during the initial COVID-19 outbreak, with an additional focus on whether previous disaster exposure and impact from that disaster is a risk factor for increased psychological distress. A snowball recruitment strategy was used. Participants (n = 596) completed an online survey, which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21, and questions related to mental health and disaster exposure. Overall, 19.2%, 13.4% and 16.8% of participants were experiencing moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress symptoms respectively. Multiple regression found that higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were associated with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis; only higher stress symptoms were associated with having experienced a disaster, with impact, in addition to COVID-19. People who have experienced impact from an additional disaster might need additional support to protect their mental health during COVID-19. A focus on the cumulative mental health impacts of multiple disasters, and the implications for organisational communities where recovery work is undertaken, such as schools and workplaces, is needed.","Podubinski, Glenister","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.238","20210723","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; disasters; mental health; psychological distress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16611,""

"Potential Adverse Effects of Dexamethasone Therapy on COVID-19 Patients: Review and Recommendations","In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the global healthcare community has raced to find effective therapeutic agents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, dexamethasone is the first and an important therapeutic to significantly reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Due to powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, dexamethasone could attenuate SARS-CoV-2-induced uncontrolled cytokine storm, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Nevertheless, dexamethasone treatment is a double-edged sword, as numerous studies have revealed that it has significant adverse impacts later in life. In this article, we reviewed the literature regarding the adverse effects of dexamethasone administration on different organ systems as well as related disease pathogenesis in an attempt to clarify the potential harms that may arise in COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone treatment. Overall, taking the threat of COVID-19 pandemic into account, we think it is necessary to apply dexamethasone as a pharmaceutical therapy in critical patients. However, its adverse side effects cannot be ignored. Our review will help medical professionals in the prognosis and follow-up of patients treated with dexamethasone. In addition, given that a considerable amount of uncertainty, confusion and even controversy still exist, further studies and more clinical trials are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the parameters and the effects of dexamethasone on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chen, Hao, Zhu, Yang, Shi, Zheng, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-021-00500-z","20210723","COVID-19; Depression; Dexamethasone; Diabetes; Necrosis of the femoral head; Patients; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16613,""
"Mental health and loneliness in the German general population during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a representative pre-pandemic assessment","During the pandemic, the extent of subsequent mental health strains is an important issue. A representative face-to-face survey was conducted to assess mental health consequences in the general population and to identify mental health risk factors. In a representative German sample (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,503), we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms by the PHQ-4 and loneliness by a validated item. An earlier survey (2018) which used the same methods and had comparable response rates served as comparison. Scores of depression and anxiety symptoms increased from an average of 0.89 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.21) and 0.77 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.17) in 2018 to 1.14 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.23) and 1.05 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31) in 2020. Loneliness did not increase (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.35, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.68 in 2018; MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.38, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.78 in 2020), affecting about one in four participants to some degree. Younger participants and women were most likely to report depression, anxiety, and loneliness. As in the previous survey, social inequality factors contributed to distress and loneliness. The small overall increase of distress was consistent with recent German panel studies. In future studies and mental health interventions female sex, younger age, and socioeconomic disparities need to be considered as vulnerability factors for distress.","Beutel, Hettich, Ernst, Schmutzer, Tibubos, Braehler","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94434-8","20210723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16614,""
"Rising incidence of interpersonal violence in Pennsylvania during COVID-19 stay-at home order","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated policies have had important downstream consequences for individuals, communities, and the healthcare system, and they appear to have been accompanied by rising interpersonal violence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of injuries owing to interpersonal violence after implementation of a statewide stay-at-home order in Pennsylvania in MarchÃ‚Â 2020. Using the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study registry, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with gunshot wounds, stab wounds, and blunt assault-related injuries attributable to interpersonal violence treated at Pennsylvania trauma centers from March 16 to July 31 of 2018, 2019, andÃ‚Â 2020. There were fewer total trauma admissions in 2020 (17,489) vs 2018 (19,290) and 2019 (19,561). Gunshot wounds increased in 2020 to 737 vs 647 for 2019 and 565 for 2018 (PÃ‚Â = .028), whereas blunt assault injuries decreased (PÃ‚Â = .03). In all time periods, interpersonal violence primarily impacted urban counties. African American men were predominantly affected by gunshot wounds and stab wounds, whereas Caucasian men were predominantly affected by blunt assault injuries. There were more patients with substance abuse disorders and positive drug screens during coronavirus disease than in comparison periods: (stab wound population 52.3% vs 33.9% vs 45.9%, coronavirus disease era vs 2018 vs 2019, respectively PÃ‚Â = .0001), (blunt assault injury population 41.4% vs 33.1% vs 33.5%, coronavirus disease era vs 2018 vs 2019, respectively P &lt; .0001). There was no correlation between the incidence of interpersonal violence and coronavirus disease 2019 rates at the county level. The implementation of a stay-at-home order was accompanied by rising incidence of gunshot and stab wound injuries in Pennsylvania. Preparedness for future resurgences of coronavirus disease 2019 and other pandemics calls for plans to address injury prevention, recidivism, and access to mental health and substance abuse prevention services.","Ratnasekera, Seng, Jacovides, Kolb, Hanlon, Stawicki, Martin, Kaufman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2021.06.024","20210723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-29","",16615,""
