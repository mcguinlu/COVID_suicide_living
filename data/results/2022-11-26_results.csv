"Substance use, psychiatric symptoms, personal mastery, and social support among COVID-19 long haulers: A compensatory model","Background: Substance use has become a critical health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, and emerging attention has been paid to people with the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 (COVID-19 long haulers) due to their high vulnerability. However, scant research has investigated their substance use and relevant psychosocial factors. The current study was to (1) examine substance use behaviors (i.e., legal drug use, illicit drug use, and non-medical use of prescription drugs); and (2) assessed their associations with psychiatric symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder) and psychosocial factors (i.e., personal mastery and social support) among COVID-19 long haulers. Methods: In January to March 2022, 460 COVID-19 long haulers (50% female), with an average age of 32, completed online surveys regarding their demographics, substance use, psychiatric symptoms, and psychosocial factors. Results: In the past three months, the most commonly used or non-medically used substances were tobacco (82%) for legal drugs, cocaine (53%) for illicit drugs, and prescription opioids (67%) for prescription drugs. Structural equation modeling suggested that psychiatric symptoms were positively associated with substance use behaviors (bs = .38 to .68, ps < .001), while psychosocial factors were negatively associated with substance use behaviors (bs = -.61 to -.43, ps < .001). Conclusion: Substance use is common in COVID-19 long haulers and psychiatric symptoms are the risk factors. Personal mastery and social support appear to offer protection offsetting the psychiatric influences. Substance use prevention and mental health services for COVID-19 long haulers should attend to personal mastery and social support.","Cheuk Chi Tam; Shan Qiao; Camryn Garrett; Ran Zhang; Atefeh Aghaei; Abhishek Aggarwal; Xiaoming Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.23.22282679","20221125","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41728,""
"The Nexus between Smart Sensors and the Bankruptcy Protection of SMEs","Transportation, logistics, storage, and many other sectors provide a wide space for applying Industry 4.0. This era, with its components, represents the equipment necessary to obtain a unique competitive advantage. Being smart through sensors, big data, and digitalization corresponds not only to evolution but also provides protection for businesses in the face of depression. The COVID-19 pandemic caused collapses and defects for very large enterprises and large enterprises, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This article focuses on SMEs and their profits from using smart sensors. Thus, the aim was to expose the striking effect of Industry 4.0 on earnings during the crisis in the Visegrad Four. The Mann-Kendall trend was used to map the consequences contrasting the period of 2016-2021. The investigation involved samples from 1221 Slovak, 259 Czech, 855 Polish, and 2156 Hungarian enterprises. The results showed that more than 80% of businesses did not have a negative trend in how their earnings changed over time. This fact was confirmed by a z-test for the comparison of one proportion for each analyzed country. The adaptation to Industry 4.0 strengthened the muscle for bankruptcy resilience during the crisis. In addition, it may encourage enterprises to be smart in the same or different sectors.","Durana, Valaskova","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22228671","20221126","COVID-19 pandemic; Industry 4.0; Visegrad Four; bankruptcy; earnings; small and medium-sized enterprises; smart sensors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41729,""
"A Year in the Life of US Frontline Health Care Workers: Impact of COVID-19 on Weight Change, Physical Activity, Lifestyle Habits, and Psychological Factors","Healthcare workers (HCWs) experienced significantly higher burdens and life demands due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to assess the longitudinal effects among HCWs throughout the pandemic. Qualtrics surveys collected self-reported data on weight changes, eating patterns, physical activity (PA), and psychological factors with data organized by timepoints prior to the pandemic (PP0-prior to March 2020), baseline (M0-January 2021), month 6 (M6-July 2021), and month 12 (M12-January 2022). Eating patterns were negatively impacted at the M0, with reported increases in snacking/grazing (69.7%), fast food/take-out consumption (57.8%), and alcohol (48.8%). However, by M6 and M12 there were no statistically significant differences in eating patterns, suggesting that eating patterns normalized over time. Mean weight increased from PP0 to M0 by 2.99 pounds (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, <i>n</i> = 226) and from PP0 to M6 by 2.12 pounds (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.027, <i>n</i> = 146), though the difference in mean weight from PP0 to M12 was not statistically significant (<i>n</i> = 122). PA counts decreased from 8.00 sessions per week PP0 to 6.80 by M0 (<i>p</i> = 0.005) before jumping to 12.00 at M6 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and 10.67 at M12 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Psychological factors comparing M0 to M12 found statistically significant differences for depression (<i>p</i>-value = 0.018) and anxiety (<i>p</i>-value = 0.001), meaning depression and anxiety were initially increased but improved by M12. Additionally, higher scores on depression and insomnia scales were associated with lower PA levels. These overall results imply that the COVID-19 pandemic had immediate effects on the eating patterns, weight changes, PA, and psychological factors of HCWs; however, routines and lifestyle habits appeared to have normalized one year later.","Oliver, Shenkman, Diewald, Bernhardt, Chen, Moore, Kaufmann","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14224865","20221126","COVID-19 pandemic; eating patterns; healthcare workers; lifestyle habits; physical activity; psychological factors; weight change","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41730,""
"Post-Intensive Care Syndrome in Non-COVID-19 ICU Survivors during the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study","A prospective observational cohort study investigated the prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) among non-COVID-19 ICU survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adults who had been admitted to the ICU for more than 24 h were enrolled, and followed-up at 3, 6, and 12 months post-discharge. PICS (mental health, cognitive, and physical domains) was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Posttraumatic Diagnosis Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Korean Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. Data were analyzed from 237 participants who completed all three follow-up surveys. The prevalence of PICS was 44.7%, 38.4%, and 47.3%, at 3, 6, and 12 months of discharge, respectively. The prevalence of PICS in the mental health and cognitive domains decreased at 6 and increased at 12 months. The prevalence of PICS in the physical domain declined over time. Changes in PICS scores other than ADL differed significantly according to whether participants completed follow-up before or after December 2020, when COVID-19 rapidly spread in South Korea. In the recent group, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and cognition scores were significantly worse at 12 months than at 6 months post-discharge. The COVID-19 pandemic may have adversely affected the recovery of non-COVID-19 ICU survivors.","Kang, Hong, Jeong","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11226653","20221126","COVID-19; South Korea; post-intensive care syndrome; prospective cohort study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41731,""
"Maternal Distress during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period: Underlying Mechanisms and Child's Developmental Outcomes-A Narrative Review","Maternal mental health may be considered a determining factor influencing fetal and child development. An essential factor with potentially negative consequences for a child's psychophysiological development is the presence of maternal distress during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The review is organized and presented to explore and describe the effects of anxiety, stress, and depression in pregnancy and the postpartum period on adverse child developmental outcomes. The neurobiology of maternal distress and the transmission mechanisms at the molecular level to the fetus and child are noted. In addition, the paper discusses the findings of longitudinal studies in which early child development is monitored concerning the presence of maternal distress in pregnancy and the postpartum period. This topic gained importance in the COVID-19 pandemic context, during which a higher frequency of maternal psychological disorders was observed. The need for further interdisciplinary research on the relationship between maternal mental health and fetal/child development was highlighted, especially on the biological mechanisms underlying the transmission of maternal distress to the (unborn) child, to achieve positive developmental outcomes and improve maternal and child well-being.","Jeli&#x10d;i&#x107;, Veselinovi&#x107;, &#x106;irovi&#x107;, Jakovljevi&#x107;, Rai&#x10d;evi&#x107;, Suboti&#x107;","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232213932","20221126","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; child development; depression; developmental outcomes; maternal distress; perinatal mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41732,""
"Long Chain N3-PUFA Decreases ACE2 Protein Levels and Prevents SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry","Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a target of interest for both COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease management. Even though lower ACE2 levels may be beneficial in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, maintaining the ACE1/ACE2 balance is also crucial for cardiovascular health. So far, reports describing conditions capable of altering ACE2 protein levels, especially via dietary components, are limited. In this study, the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) on the protein levels of ACE1 and ACE2 in rodent tissues, human endothelial and kidney cell lines, and human plasma were examined. The ability of n3-PUFA to affect the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into cells was also tested. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and in some cases eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not &#x3b1;-linoleic acid (ALA), reduced both ACE1 and ACE2 (non-glycosylated p100 and glycosylated p130 forms) in the heart, aorta, and kidneys of obese rats, as well as in human EA.hy926 endothelial and HEK293 kidney cells. Dietary supplementation with either DHA or ALA had no effect on plasma soluble ACE2 levels in humans. However, treatment of HEK293 cells with 80 and 125 &#xb5;M DHA for 16 h inhibited the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These results strongly suggest that DHA treatment may reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells via a mechanism involving a decrease in the absolute level of ACE2 protein as well as its glycosylation. Our findings warrant further evaluation of long-chain n3-PUFA supplements as a novel option for restricting SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the general population.","Huang, Taylor, Zahradka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232213825","20221126","ACE1; ACE2; SARS-CoV-2; long COVID; omega-3 fatty acids","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41733,""
"Predictors of Psychological Distress across Three Time Periods during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland","Since the onset of COVID-19, public health policies and public opinions changed from stringent preventive measures against spread of COVID-19 to policies accommodating life with continued, diminished risk for contracting COVID-19. Poland is a country that demonstrated severe psychological impact and negative mental health. The study aims to examine psychological impact and changes in levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among three cross-sectional samples of Polish people and COVID-19-related factors associated with adverse mental health. In total, 2324 Polish persons participated in repeated cross-sectional studies across three surveys: Survey 1 (22 to 26 March 2020), Survey 2 (21 October to 3 December 2020), and Survey 3 (3 November to 10 December 2021). Participants completed an online survey, including Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), demographics, knowledge, and concerns of COVID-19 and precautionary measures. A significant reduction of IES-R scores was seen across surveys, while DASS-21 scores were significantly higher in Survey 2. There was significant reduction in the frequency of following COVID-19 news, recent COVID-19 testing, and home isolation from Survey 1 to 3. Being emale was significantly associated with higher IES-R and DASS-21 scores in Surveys 1 and 2. Student status was significantly associated with higher DASS-21 across surveys. Chills, myalgia, and fatigue were significantly associated with high IES-R or DASS-21 scores across surveys. Frequency of wearing masks and perception that mask could reduce risk of COVID-19 were significantly associated with higher IES-R and DASS-21 scores. Conclusions: The aforementioned findings indicate a reduction in the level of the measured subjective distress andin the frequency of checking COVID-19 news-related information across three periods during the pandemic in Poland.","Chudzicka-Czupa&#x142;a, Chiang, Grabowski, &#x17b;ywio&#x142;ek-Szeja, Quek, Pude&#x142;ek, Teopiz, Ho, McIntyre","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215405","20221126","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fatigue; pandemic; policy; psychological impact; public health; social determinants; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41734,""

"Before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Physical Fitness Association with Mental Health among Higher Education Students: A Multi-Group Analysis Model","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), created a significant problem people's health around the world. The mental and physical health of entire populations has been negatively impacted due to the introduction of several restriction methods. Maintaining a specific physical activity and fitness level is crucial given the pandemic situation. The connection between physical fitness and mental health has recently received growing attention. In contrast to the message from physiological research, which lauds the general benefits of fitness for physical health, the corresponding psychological literature reveals a more complex relationship. This paper outlines the research evidence, focusing on the relationship between physical fitness and depression, anxiety, and stress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained from 390 higher education students (measuring their perception before and during the pandemic). They were analyzed by a structural equation modeling multi-group analysis to detect the variance in the test relationship before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Expanding the Focus of Occupational Safety and Health: Lessons from a Series of Linked Scientific Meetings","There is widespread recognition that the world of work is changing, and agreement is growing that the occupational safety and health (OSH) field must change to contribute to the protection of workers now and in the future. Discourse on the evolution of OSH has been active for many decades, but formalized support of an expanded focus for OSH has greatly increased over the past 20 years. Development of approaches such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s Total Worker Health<sup>&#xae;</sup> concept and the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Healthy Workplace Framework are concrete examples of how OSH can incorporate a new focus with a wider view. In 2019, NIOSH initiated a multi-year effort to explore an expanded focus for OSH. This paper is a report on the outputs of a three-year cooperative agreement between NIOSH and The University of Texas School of Public Health, which led to subject matter expert workshops in 2020 and an international conference of global interest groups in 2021. This article traces the background of these meetings and identifies and assesses the lessons learned. It also reviews ten thematic topics that emerged from the meetings: worker health inequalities; training new OSH professionals; future OSH research and practice; tools to measure well-being of workers; psychosocial hazards and adverse mental health effects; skilling, upskilling and improving job quality; socioeconomic influences; climate change; COVID-19 pandemic influences; and strategic foresight. Cross-cutting these themes is the need for systems and transdisciplinary thinking and operationalization of the concept of well-being to prepare the OSH field for the work of the future.","Schulte, Delclos, Felknor, Streit, McDaniel, Chosewood, Newman, Bhojani, Pana-Cryan, Swanson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215381","20221126","climate; expanding occupational safety and health paradigm; future of work; inequality; mental health; occupational safety and health; pandemic; psychosocial; research methods; socioeconomic; strategic foresight; training and education; transdisciplinary; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41737,""
"Well-Being and Mental Health in Teachers: The Life Impact of COVID-19","The impact of the pandemic on teachers' mental health has also been an important issue. The aim of the study was to analyze the vital impact of COVID-19, spirituality, and the use of social-emotional strategies on teacher well-being, mediated by mental health. The sample was non-random, inviting all teachers in a city North of Chile to participate in the study. The sample consisted of 624 teachers. A total of 74.4% were women and 25.6% were men. The mean age was 44.1 and the standard deviation was 11.9. A total of 56.4% belonged to public schools and 43.6% belonged to subsidized schools. Structural equations were used to analyze the data, finding a mental health mediating effect between the death of a close person, affected areas and family history with life satisfaction. Spirituality and the use of socio-emotional strategies self-applied by the teachers had no direct relationship with their mental health, so their mediating effect in relation to life satisfaction was discarded. Teachers who used social-emotional strategies, as well as those who reported higher levels of spirituality, obtained greater satisfaction with life, both general and specifically. Women had higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, but also higher levels of life satisfaction. The implications are discussed.","Flores, Caqueo-Ur&#xed;zar, Escobar, Irarr&#xe1;zaval","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215371","20221126","anxiety; depression; spirituality; stress; teachers; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41738,""
"Prospective Association between Smartphone Addiction and Perceived Stress and Moderation of Boredom during COVID-19 in China","Smartphone addiction (SPA) is prevalent in college students and harms their healthy development, and perceived stress (PS) has been a well-documented risk factor of SPA. People often experienced boredom during COVID-19; however, its effect on behavioral/mental health during the pandemic has been rarely tested. We investigated the prospective association between SPA and PS before and during COVID-19, as well as the moderation of boredom. A total of 197 college students participated in four-wave surveys from December 2018 to June 2020 in China. The cross-lagged model was developed to investigate the prospective association between SPA and PS from T1 to T4. Boredom was added to the model at T4 as a moderator to explore the moderating role of boredom during COVID-19. The results showed that the pandemic changed PS's prediction on SPA. During COVID-19, boredom significantly affected SPA and PS and moderated the link from PS at T3 to PS at T4. The results suggest that the prospective associations between SPA and PS varied before and during COVID-19. Prevention of SPA should be conducted for new students and should be used to enhance their stress coping capacity. Intervention programs for eliminating boredom may be effective for reducing stress and SPA during COVID-19.","He, Yang, Du, Zhao, Wang, Zhang, Peng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215355","20221126","COVID-19 pandemic; boredom; college students; perceived stress; smartphone addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41739,""
"Intervention of Physical Activity for University Students with Anxiety and Depression during the COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention and Control Period: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","(1) Background: Although physical activity has been widely recognized as an effective way to improve anxiety and depression, we lack a systematic summary of research on improving anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims to systematically analyze how physical activity impacts on this situation in college students during COVID-19. (2) Methods: Both Chinese and English databases (PubMed the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang) were analyzed. All the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about physical activity intervention for this were included. We received eight eligible RCT experiments before the retrieval time (4 October 2022) in the meta-analysis. (3) Results: Physical activity benefits for college students with significant anxiety were (SMD = -0.50; 95% CI = -0.83 to -0.17; I<sup>2</sup> = 84%; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001; Z = 2.98;) and depression (SMD = -0.62; 95% CI = -0.99 to -0.25; I<sup>2</sup> = 80.7%; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001; Z = 3.27). Subgroup analyses showed physical activity of different intensities significantly impacted on improving college students' depression and anxiety, but physical activity of 6 &amp;lt; 9 Mets intensity had a greater effect on anxiety than on depression. Interventions of eight weeks or less performed better than those of over eight weeks while interventions less than four times per week had a significant effect on improving the situation. The overall effect of a single intervention of 30 min was more effective than one of over 60 min.

"Mental and Sexual Health of Men in Times of COVID-19 Lockdown","Due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19, some restrictions were introduced which could lead to the development of distress and somatic symptoms. This survey aimed to study the mental and sexual health of men during the COVID-19 outbreak. An online questionnaire was conducted to collect data on contact with people suspected of infection/infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, use of stimulants, and perceived mental and sexual health during isolation among Polish men. They were also asked to answer the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaire. In total, 606 men with a mean age of 28.46 &#xb1; 9.17 years took part in the survey. Fear of contracting the COVID-19 infection had a negative impact on the mental health of 132 men (21.8%). Fear of the health condition of loved ones caused stress and a depressed mood in 253 men (41.7%), and media reports worsened the mental health of 185 men (30.2%). In the BDI, 71.95% of the respondents did not suffer from depressive symptoms, 17.33% were diagnosed with mild depression, 6.11% with moderate depression, and 4.62% had severe depression. The mean score in the IIEF-15 questionnaire in the erectile function domain was 22.27, orgasm-7.63, desire-8.25, satisfaction-10.17, and general satisfaction-6.84. Depressive symptoms indicated more severe sexual functioning disorders (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001).

"Prevalence and Relationships between Alexithymia, Anhedonia, Depression and Anxiety during the Belgian COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","Alexithymia and anhedonia are associated with psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic lead to a significant deterioration in the mental health of the population. It is therefore important to examine the effects of lockdown on alexithymia and anhedonia and their relationships with anxiety and depression. We compared the scores and characteristics of 286 patients divided into two groups: one before lockdown (group 1, <i>N</i> = 127), the other during the progressive lockdown release (group 2, <i>N</i> = 159). The groups were homogeneous in terms of age, sex ratio, socio-professional categories, and somatic and psychiatric comorbidities. The groups were compared on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) measuring alexithymia, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) measuring depression, the anhedonia subscale of the BDI-II measuring state-anhedonia and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measuring state and trait anxiety. The ratio of alexithymic subjects in group 1 is 22.83% to 33.33% in group 2 (<i>p</i>-value = 0.034). This suggests a significant increase in the number of alexithymic patients after lockdown. We did not observe any difference in the proportion of depressed and anxious subjects before or after lockdown. Among the different scales, higher scores were only found on the cognitive factor of alexithymia on group 2 comparatively to group 1. This study indicates an increase in the proportion of alexithymic subjects following lockdown. Unexpectedly, this was unrelated to depression, anxiety or anhedonia levels, which remained stable. Further studies are needed to confirm this result and to evaluate precisely which factors related to the lockdown context are responsible for such an increase.","Damerdji, Rotsaert, Wacquier, Hein, Loas","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215264","20221126","COVID-19; alexithymia; anhedonia; anxiety; depression; lockdown; state anhedonia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41742,""
"Evolution of Global Health and Psychosocial Factors among Hospital Workers during First Year of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","To assess trends in overall health (mental and physical) and psychosocial factors in a population of workers (both healthcare and non-healthcare) in a French teaching hospital during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. A validated version of the SATIN questionnaire with adapted scoring was used to collect data on health and impacts of work stressors. This questionnaire was sent to all workers at the hospital in T1 (July-August 2020) and T2 (July-August 2021) and self-administered online. A total of 1313 participants who completed the questionnaire at T1 and 826 at T2 were included. Overall, 568 workers completed the questionnaire at T1 and T2. We found a deterioration in overall health and especially stress and mental health in hospital workers and healthcare workers (HCWs), with a negative impact of the workload and work environment. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impacted negatively the mental health, work stressors, and psychosocial perceptions of both HCW and non-HCW in a French hospital.

"A Treatment Model for Young Adults with Severe Mental Disorders in a Community Mental Health Center: The Crisalide Project and the Potential Space","In line with priorities set by the Italian Ministry of Health and international literature, the ""Crisalide project"" provides specific care pathways aimed at young adults (YA) with severe mental disorders (SMD). As described in Materials and Methods, it consists of three lines of activity: transition to adult mental health services (TSMREE/CSM 17-19); Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Assistance Pathways for Young Adults (PDTA-YA); high-intensity treatment center for young adults ""Argolab2 Potential Space"". The aim of the study is to assess the results relating to the first three years of implementation of this clinical-organizational model (2018/2020) according to the process indicators identified by the ministry. Among the population aged 18-30 under treatment, results show increased prevalence (30%) and incidence (26%); 0% treatment conclusions due to the expiration of the conventional time limit; 0% involuntary hospitalizations (TSO); 0% STPIT hospitalizations; 0% repeated hospitalizations; 0% hospitalizations in the common mental disorders diagnostic group. Among the population of Argolab2 Potential Space, 45.4% have resumed studies; 40.9% have had a first work experience; 22.7% have obtained educational or training qualifications, and 18.2% live in independent houses.

"Perceptions of Health Needs among Venezuelan Women Crossing the Border in Northern Chile during the COVID-19 Pandemic","In parallel to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chile has experienced a significant influx of international migrants, many of whom are Venezuelan women who have entered the country through unauthorized crossing points. In this context, gender and migration intersect as the social determinants of health, leading to their experiencing a range of adverse events. This poses important challenges in terms of short- and long-term health outcomes, the social determinants of health, and access to healthcare. This study aims at describing Venezuelan women's perceptions of their health needs as they migrate to Chile via an unauthorized crossing point, with a focus on adverse events throughout the migration cycle, self-reported health needs, and responses. A qualitative case study was carried out with 22 participants in the Antofagasta region of Chile, including Venezuelan migrant women, healthcare professionals, and social workers from the public healthcare system, stakeholders from non-governmental and international organizations, and local government officials. The semi-structured, individual interviews were analyzed thematically. The results show that Venezuelan women face a range of adverse events throughout the migration cycle. The perceived health needs that are reported are sometimes linked to these adverse events or existed prior to migration and were exacerbated throughout the migratory cycle. Addressing these physical and mental health needs is essential for short- and long-term individual and public health; however, despite substantial efforts to ameliorate the situation, persisting gaps in access to care are reported.","Blukacz, Carre&#xf1;o Calderon, Obach, Cabieses, Peroncini, Oliva","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215175","20221126","inequities; international migration; women&#x2019;s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41745,""
"Caregiving Responsibilities and Mental Health Outcomes in Young Adult Carers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","This study investigated caregiving responsibilities and associated mental health outcomes in young adult carers during the COVID-19 pandemic and had three aims: (1) to investigate differences in caregiving responsibilities across two groups of young adult carers (parental illness context vs. ill non-parent family member context) relative to non-carers, (2) to identify COVID-19/lockdown correlates of caregiving responsibilities, and (3) to examine the longitudinal associations between caregiving responsibilities and mental health outcomes. Of the 1048 Italians aged 18-29 (<i>M</i>age = 24.48, <i>SD</i>age = 2.80; 74.33% female) who consented to complete online surveys at Time 1, 813 reported no ill family member (non-carers). Young adult carers included 162 with an ill parent and 73 with an ill non-parent family member. The study included 3 time points: 740 participants completed Time 2 assessment (<i>M</i>age = 24.35, <i>SD</i>age = 2.81; 76.76% female), while 279 completed Time 3 assessment (<i>M</i>age = 24.78, <i>SD</i>age = 2.72; 79.93% female). Key variables measured were 13 COVID-19/lockdown factors at Times 1 and 2, caregiving responsibilities at Time 2, and mental health outcomes at Time 3 (fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, wellbeing). Two COVID-19/lockdown factors were significantly correlated with higher caregiving responsibilities: insufficient home space, and greater time spent working and learning from home. As predicted, young adult carers reported higher caregiving responsibilities than non-carers, and this effect was greater in young adults caring for an ill parent compared to young adults caring for an ill non-parent family member. As expected, irrespective of family health status, caregiving responsibilities were longitudinally related to poorer mental health outcomes, operationalised as higher fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression, and lower wellbeing. Elevated young adult caregiving is an emerging significant public health issue that should be addressed through a multipronged approach that includes education about young adult carer needs for personnel across all relevant sectors and flexible care plans for ill family members that include a 'whole family' biopsychosocial approach.","Landi, Pakenham, Cattivelli, Grandi, Tossani","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215149","20221126","caregiving responsibilities; emerging adulthood; mental health; pandemic; parental illness; wellbeing; young adult carers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41746,""
"Post-COVID-19 Syndrome in Outpatients and Its Association with Viral Load","The COVID-19 pandemic is the result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused more than 100 million infections and more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide, representing a serious public health problem. The gold method for detecting this virus is qRT-PCR, which is a semiquantitative technique where the viral load can be established through its cycle threshold (Ct). It has also been reported that COVID-19 generates long-term symptoms (post-COVID-19). After three months, a survey was performed on 70 COVID-19 confirmed patients; subsequently, we divided them into four groups (persistent symptoms, chemo-sensitive, cognitive issues, and changes in habit) in order to determine the correlation between viral load and post-COVID-19 symptoms. Data show that fatigue, nervousness, anosmia, and diet changes are common long-term symptoms; in addition, a negative correlation was found between viral load and the number of post-COVID-19 symptoms.

"Comparative Study on International Research Hotspots and National-Level Policy Keywords of Dynamic Disaster Monitoring and Early Warning in China (2000-2021)","For more than 20 years, disaster dynamic monitoring and early warning have achieved orderly and sustainable development in China, forming a systematic academic research system and top-down policy design, which are inseparable from the research of China's scientific community and the promotion of government departments. In the past, most of the research on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning focused on specific research in a certain field, scene, and discipline, while a few studies focused on research review or policy analysis, and few studies combined macro and meso research reviews in academia with national policy analysis for comparative analysis. It is necessary and urgent to explore the interaction between scholars' research and policy deployment, which can bring theoretical contributions and policy references to the top-down design, implementation promotion, and academic research of China's dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. Based on 608 international research articles on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning published by Chinese scholars from 2000-2021 and 187 national policy documents published during this period, this paper conducts a comparative analysis between the knowledge maps of international research hotspots and the co-occurrence maps of policy keywords on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. The research shows that in the stage of initial development (2000-2007), international research articles are few and focused, and research hotspots are somewhat alienated from policy keywords. In the stage of rising development (2008-2015), after the Wenchuan earthquake, research hotspots are closely related to policy keywords, mainly in the fields of geology, engineering disasters, meteorological disasters, natural disasters, etc. Meanwhile, research hotspots also focus on cutting-edge technologies and theories, while national-level policy keywords focus more on overall governance and macro promotion, but the two are gradually closely integrated. In the stage of rapid development (2016-2021), with the continuous attention and policy promotion of the national government, the establishment of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the gradual establishment and improvement of the disaster early warning and monitoring system, research hotspots and policy keywords are integrated and overlapped with each other, realizing the organic linkage and mutual promotion between academic research and political deployment. The motivation, innovation, integration, and transformation of dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning are promoted by both policy and academic research. The institutions that issue policies at the national level include the State Council and relevant departments, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Ministry of Water Resources, and other national ministries and commissions. The leading affiliated institutions of scholars' international research include China University of Mining and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, and other institutions. The disciplines involved are mainly multidisciplinary geosciences, environmental sciences, electrical and electronic engineering, remote sensing, etc. It is worth noting that in the past two to three years, research and policies focusing on COVID-19, public health, epidemic prevention, environmental governance, and emergency management have gradually increased.","Gao, Zhang, Yang, Wang, Shao, Li, Zhang, Li, Liu, Si","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215107","20221126","disaster prevention and mitigation; dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning; emergency management; knowledge map visualization; policy document quantification; policy keyword; research hotspot","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41748,""
"The Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Hong Kong Nursing Students' Mental Health and Quality of Life","Evidence shows that university students, especially healthcare students, experienced considerable health impacts during COVID-19. This study examined Hong Kong general nursing students' mental health and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire composed of personal demographics, the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short version (DASS21), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) was used for data collection in early 2021. Among 380 respondents, 170 (45%) did not attend clinical practicum during the pandemic. Students who did not participate in clinical training scored lower in FCV-19S but higher in WHOQOL-BREF than those who participated (<i>p</i> = 0.001 or <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). FCV-19S and WHOQOL-BREF were negatively correlated (r = -0.623 to -0.446, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Slight negative correlations were found between the FCV-19S and DASS-21 scores. Although there were no significant differences in DASS21 (<i>p</i> = 0.294-0.931) between these two student groups, there was a considerably high prevalence rate of depression (57.1%), anxiety (47.6%), and stress (39.5%).

"The Dissemination of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in West Virginia during the Opioid Epidemic and COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","The devastating impact of the opioid crisis on children and families in West Virginia was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and brought to light the critical need for greater mental health services and providers in the state. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based treatment for child externalizing symptoms that teaches parents positive and appropriate strategies to manage child behaviors. The current qualitative study details barriers and facilitators to disseminating and implementing PCIT with opioid-impacted families across West Virginia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therapists (<i>n</i> = 34) who participated in PCIT training and consultation through a State Opioid Response grant were asked to provide data about their experiences with PCIT training, consultation, and implementation. Almost all therapists (91%) reported barriers to telehealth PCIT (e.g., poor internet connection, unpredictability of sessions). Nearly half of therapists' cases (45%) were impacted directly by parental substance use. Qualitative findings about the impact of telehealth and opioid use on PCIT implementation are presented. The dissemination and implementation of PCIT in a state greatly impacted by poor telehealth capacity and the opioid epidemic differed from the implementation of PCIT training and treatment delivery in other states, highlighting the critical importance of exploring implementation factors in rural settings.","Druskin, Han, Phillips, Victory, Aman, Tiano, Stokes, McNeil","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215085","20221126","PCIT; Parent&#x2013;Child Interaction Therapy; dissemination; implementation; opioid crisis; rural populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41750,""
"Incident and Recurrent Depression among Adults Aged 50 Years and Older during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging","The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying public health measures have exacerbated many risk factors for depression in older adulthood. The objectives of the current study are: (1) to determine the risk of incident and recurrent depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among those with, or without, a history of depression; and (2) to identify factors that were predictive of depression in these two groups. The study population included 22,622 participants of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging who provided data at baseline (2011-2015), follow-up (2015-2018), and twice during the pandemic (April-May 2020, September-December 2020). The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) was used to classify individuals with depression. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of depression during COVID across a series of risk factors. Individuals with a history of depression had four times the risk of depression during the pandemic when compared to those without a history of depression, even after controlling for relevant covariates. Other factors associated with depression during the pandemic include being female, having fewer savings, and experiencing COVID-19 related stressors, such as health stressors, difficulties accessing resources, and family conflict. Clinicians working with older adults should consider interventions to support high-risk groups, such as those with recurrent depression.","MacNeil, Birk, Villeneuve, Jiang, de Groh, Fuller-Thomson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215032","20221126","CLSA; COVID-19; depression; longitudinal study; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41751,""

"'I Doubt Myself and Am Losing Everything I Have since COVID Came'-A Case Study of Mental Health and Coping Strategies among Undocumented Myanmar Migrant Workers in Thailand","Migrant populations have always been vulnerable to a high burden of social exclusion, mental disorders, physical illnesses, and economic crises. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further created a frantic plight among them, particularly for undocumented migrant workers in the global south. We have conducted a mixed method study among the undocumented Myanmar migrant workers (UMMWs) in Thailand to explore how the COVID-19 disruption has impacted their mental health and what coping strategies they have adopted. Following the onset of COVID-19 and the recent coup d'&#xe9;tat in Myanmar, our current study is the first attempt to understand the mental health status and predicament of this neglected migrant group. A total of 398 UMMWs were included in the online survey, of which 23 participated in qualitative interviews. The major mental health issues reported by the study participants were depression, generalized anxiety disorder, frustration, stress, and panic disorders, while loss of employment, worries about the pandemic, social stigma, lack of access to healthcare, lockdown, and fear of detention were the predominant contributing factors. In response, we identified two key coping mechanisms: coping at a personal level (listening to music, playing online game, praying, and self-motivation) and coping at a social level (chatting with family and friends and visiting religious institutions). These findings point to the importance of policy and intervention programs aimed at upholding mental health at such humanitarian conditions. Sustainable institutional mental health care support and social integration for the migrant workers, irrespective of their legal status, should be ensured.","Khai, Asaduzzaman","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215022","20221126","COVID-19; Myanmar; Thailand; coping strategy; mental health; migrant health; mixed method; undocumented migrants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41753,""
"Telemedicine Interventions as an Attempt to Improve the Mental Health of Populations during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Narrative Review","Published reports indicate the need for psychological interventions and the integration of psychiatric care into crisis management plans in people with mental health issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems crucial to identify the root causes of the health-social-economic crisis and identify potential opportunities for widely implemented psychological assistance. This narrative literature review aims to identify the types of interventions deployed as telemedicine-based mental health support and their effectiveness. The PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were searched. From a total of 48 articles, 46 were analysed after removing duplicates. From these, thirty-seven records were excluded according to the inclusion criteria and nine (eight RCT and one cross-over) were assessed as full texts. The included publications were randomised clinical trials or cross-over studies focused on remote mental support interventions. In all studies, participants represented both sexes and had an average age range of 6-64. Studies included participants from seven countries and the overall number of participants in the included studies was 687. The content of these intervention programmes includes both established psychotherapeutic programmes, as well as new interventions. Remote support was implemented through three approaches: phone/video calls, mobile applications, and internet-based programs. The results of the included studies indicate a higher or equal efficacy of telemedicine interventions compared to traditional forms. The review also revealed a relatively wide range of targeted research groups: from children with social anxiety through to their caregivers; adolescents with neurological disorders; and from college students to adults with psychiatric or orthopaedic disorders. Analysis of the included papers found that telemedicine interventions show promising results as an attempt to improve population mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rutkowska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214945","20221126","COVID-19; mental health; preventive medicine; telemedicine; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41754,""
"What Is Next for Public Health after COVID-19 in Italy? Adopting a Youth-Centred Care Approach in Mental Health Services","Although endeavours to protect mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic were taken at national and regional levels, e.g., mental support in school, a COVID-19 emergency toll-free number for psychological support, these were sporadic conjunctural financing interventions. In this Communication, the authors conducted a systematic search for programmatic and policy documents and reports with a solid literature and policy analysis concerning the main objective, which is to analyse the appropriateness in implementing gender- and age-sensitive, integrated, youth-centred mental health services in Italy. The Italian National Action Plan for Mental Health reports a highly fragmented situation in the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry services, in terms of an integrated and comprehensive regional network of services for the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of neuropsychological disorders in young people. Wide-ranging interventions, systemic actions should be implemented, funded, and included in an overall structural strengthening of the healthcare system, including those dedicated to transition support services. In this context, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), may represent an opportunity to leverage specific funds for mental health in general, and for youth in particular. Finally, mental health service governance should be harmonized at both national and regional EU levels-with the adoption of best practices implemented by other Member States.

Thus, we aimed to analyze the effects of a pulmonary and functional rehabilitation program on the functional capacity, lung function and respiratory muscle strength in patients who were affected by COVID-19 syndrome. This is a pilot clinical trial, composed of post-COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate or severe involvement, in which, they underwent a pulmonary and functional rehabilitation program. Patients were evaluated for functional capacity by the 6 min walk test, pulmonary function by spirometry, respiratory muscle strength by manovacuometry, handgrip strength by dynamometry, quality of life by the COPD Assessment Test and functional status by the PCFS. After the initial assessments, the patients performed the rehabilitation protocol in 16 sessions (inspiratory muscle training, aerobic exercise and peripheral muscle strength) and, at the end, they were evaluated again. A total of 29 patients completed the program (12.7 &#xb1; 2.7 sessions). The functional capacity increased in meters walked from 326.3 &#xb1; 140.6 to 445.4 &#xb1; 151.1 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), with an increase in the predicted value from 59.7% to 82.6% (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). The lung function increased in liters from 2.9 &#xb1; 0.8 to 3.2 &#xb1; 0.8 (<i>p</i> = 0.004) for forced vital capacity and from 2.5 &#xb1; 0.7 to 2.7 &#xb1; 0.7 (<i>p</i> = 0.001) for forced expiratory volume in the first second. The respiratory muscle strength increased in cmH<sub>2</sub>O from 101.4 &#xb1; 46.3 to 115.8 &#xb1; 38.3 (<i>p</i> = 0.117) for inspiratory pressure and from 85.8 &#xb1; 32.8 to 106.7 &#xb1; 36.8 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) for expiratory pressure.

"Effect of Increased Depressive Feelings during the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Association between Depressive Mood and Suicidal Behavior: Using the 17th (2021) Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey (KYRBS)","This study investigated the impact of increased depressive feelings during the COVID-19 pandemic on the suicidal behavior of Korean high school students using the 17th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey (KYRBS). We classified the independent variables into four groups (""no depressive mood and no increase in depressive feelings [group A]"", ""no depressive mood and increase in depressive feelings [group B]"", ""depressive mood and no increase in depressive feelings [group C]"", and ""depressive mood and increase in depressive feelings [group D]""). Compared to group A, group D showed an odds ratio of 18.30 in men and 14.87 in women for suicidal behavior after accounting for demographic and health behavioral characteristics. We found that depressive mood and a relatively short-term increase in depressive feelings had a synergistic effect, rather than an additive one, on suicidal behavior. Based on this result, we claim that an appropriate intervention method is necessary to prevent adolescents' depressive mood from developing into suicidal behavior during the pandemic.","Yeo, Park, Shin, Seo, Ahn","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214868","20221126","COVID-19; depressive mood change; suicidal behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41757,""

"Cognitive Digital Intervention for Older Patients with Parkinson's Disease during COVID-19: A Mixed-Method Pilot Study","Mild cognitive impairment is frequent among people with Parkinson's disease. Cognitive training seems effective for cognitive status and for mitigating anxiety and depression. With the COVID-19 outbreak, such therapeutic interventions were delivered online. This longitudinal mixed-method study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an online cognitive treatment, carried out during COVID times and based on Parkinson's-Adapted Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, on cognitive domains and mood of 18 older people with Parkinson's disease. After screening, the cognitive status and mood were assessed three times by Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. At the follow-up, patients were also interviewed for understanding their experience with the technology. Such treatment was effective on the participants' cognitive functions, but not on their mood. Despite some initial problems with the technology, the online intervention was experienced as a way of not being 'left behind', staying in contact with others, and being safe during the lockdown. This suggests that online cognitive treatment can be adopted to integrate face-to-face interventions by increasing their efficacy, accessibility, and long-term outcomes.

"When COVID-19 Is Not All: Femicide Conducted by a Murderer with a Narcissistic Personality ""Masked"" by a Brief Psychotic Disorder, with a Mini-Review","Several cases of COVID-19-related mental disorders have emerged during the pandemic. In a case of femicide that occurred in Italy during the first phase of the pandemic, coinciding with a national lockdown, a discrepancy arose among forensic psychiatry experts, particularly toward the diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder (BPD) related to COVID-19. We aimed to discuss the evaluation of the case through an integration of information and a literature review on comparable reported cases. An analysis of the diagnosis of brief acute psychosis was then performed, as well as a mini-review on cases of COVID-19-related psychosis. Results showed that psychotic symptomatology was characterized by polythematic delusions that always involved a SARS-CoV-2 infection. To a lesser extent, the delusions were accompanied by hallucinations, bizarre cognitive and associative alterations, insomnia, hyporexia, dysphoria, and suicidal behavior. No particularly violent acts with related injury or death of the victim were described. Finally, we could hypothesize that our case was better represented by a diagnosis of personality with predominantly narcissistic and partly psychopathic traits. The present case highlighted the importance, in the context of forensic psychiatry, of integrating assessments with the crime perpetrators, namely through accurate clinical interviews, neuropsychological tests, diachronic observations, and comparison with similar cases present in the literature. Such an integrated approach allows precise evaluation and reduces the odds of errors in a field, such as forensic psychiatry, where a diagnostic decision can be decisive in the judgment of criminal responsibility. Moreover, discerning forensics from health cases represents an important issue in risk management.","Morena, Di Fazio, La Russa, Delogu, Frati, Fineschi, Ferracuti","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214826","20221126","Brief Psychotic Disorder; COVID-19-related psychosis; SARS-CoV-2; brief acute psychotic disorders; crime; femicide; forensic psychiatry; narcissistic personality; pandemic; psychopathy; risk management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41760,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women's Perinatal Mental Health: Preliminary Data on the Risk of Perinatal Depression/Anxiety from a National Survey in Italy","Increasing evidence suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety and depression during the perinatal period increased. The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of risk for both maternal depression and anxiety among women attending 18 healthcare centres in Italy during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and to investigate the psychosocial risks and protective factors associated. It was divided into a retrospective phase (2019, 2020, and the first nine months of 2021) and a prospective phase (which began in November 2021 and it is still ongoing), which screened 12,479 and 2349 women, respectively, for a total of 14,828 women in the perinatal period. To evaluate the risk of anxiety and depression, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and an ad hoc form were used to collect sociodemographic variables. In the prospective study, the average age of the women is 31 (range 18-52) years. Results showed that the percentage of women who had EPDS score &#x2265;9 increased from 11.6% in 2019 to 25.5% in the period ranging from November 2021 to April 2022. In logistic regression models, the variables associated with the risk of depression at a level &#x2264;0.01 include having economic problems (OR 2.16) and not being able to rely on support from relatives or friends (OR 2.36). Having the professional status of the housewife is a lower risk (OR 0.52). Those associated with the risk of anxiety include being Italian (OR 2.97), having an education below secondary school level (OR 0.47), having some or many economic problems (OR 2.87), being unable to rely on support from relatives or friends (OR 2.48), and not having attended an antenatal course (OR 1.41).

"Changes in Tobacco and Alcohol Consumption in France during the Spring 2020 Lockdown: Results of the Coviprev and Viquop Surveys","This study aims to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in France during the first COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 and its gradual lifting in May. The associated factors and the reasons reported explaining those changes are also studied. Data came from five waves of the CoviPrev online cross-sectional survey (approximately n = 2000 per wave) and the ViQuoP qualitative survey (n = 60), which took place between April and June. Most people self-reported stable consumption compared to before the lockdown, but 27% to 32% of smokers and 10% to 16% of drinkers had increased their consumption, depending on the wave of the survey. Boredom, stress and the search for pleasure were the main reasons reported. While the sociodemographic factors associated with an increase in tobacco and alcohol use differed according to the product and month, poor mental health was associated with an increase in both products in April and May. Between 10% and 19% of smokers and 22% to 25% of drinkers reported having reduced their consumption for their health or through constraints. The measures taken to manage the spring 2020 epidemic appear to have had contrasting impacts on tobacco and alcohol consumption in France.

Seven key themes were identified: the importance of outdoor space, changes in daily routine, COVID-19 restrictions prevented participation, perceived risks or threats to participation, the importance of physical health, the importance of physical activity for mental health and the use of technology. Future physical activity interventions could encourage people to walk outdoors, which is low cost, flexible, and accessible to many.

"Gender Differences of University Students in the Online Teaching Quality and Psychological Profile during the COVID-19 Pandemic","With the arrival of COVID-19, educational systems have had to adapt to the social and health situation immediately. This led to the appearance of the asynchronous teaching model. Throughout the pandemic, at the educational level, we can distinguish three phases, eminently online, hybrid, and finally, face-to-face. However, the perception of educational quality in these three educational moments, taking into account the psychometric profile and gender, has not been studied. Thus, 1093 university students from Ibero-American countries were analyzed. Through a questionnaire, demographic, academic, and psychological variables were analyzed at three moments during the evolution of the pandemic. Data suggest that, during the lockdown phase, while teaching was eminently online, students presented higher levels of stress and higher difficulty of learning; class attendance, convenience, preferred method of learning, grading score, and motivation were lower, compared to other phases of teaching (hybrid and face-to-face). During this period, females presented higher stress levels than males, as well as higher levels of anxiety and loneliness, without gender differences among the other studied variables. During the hybrid and face-to-face phases, male students presented higher values in the results of difficulty learning and demanding activities. No differences were seen regarding motivation, synchronous class attendance, learning level, grades, convenience, or preferred learning method. The results from the present study suggest that, despite the effect of the pandemic on mental health, asynchronous education is postulated as an effective teaching-learning alternative. Yet, a special focus should be given to female students.","Nomie-Sato, Condes Moreno, Villanueva, Chiarella, Tornero-Aguilera, Beltr&#xe1;n-Velasco, Clemente-Su&#xe1;rez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214729","20221126","COVID-19; gender differences; hybrid education; mental health; online teaching","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41764,""
"Teachers' Well-Being and Associated Factors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Hong Kong, China","School teachers have faced many challenges due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and public health-related containment measures. Recent studies have demonstrated high levels of stress and mental health issues among school teachers. To better understand teacher well-being and inform practices to support them in the face of the ongoing pandemic, we aimed to assess perceived stress, well-being and associated factors among school teachers in Hong Kong, China. For this cross-sectional study, we employed a self-reported questionnaire to assess teacher well-being as an indicator of mental health. Drawing on quantitative data obtained from 336 teachers in Hong Kong from April 2021 to February 2022, we assessed workloads, work-related sense of coherence, perceived stress, secondary burnout symptoms (i.e. intensification of work and exhaustion related to work situation), self-endangering work behaviours and satisfaction with work. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the associations between well-being, demographic and work characteristics. A high percentage (87.6%) of teachers had high levels of perceived stress, which was positively associated with extensification of work (<i>r</i> = 0.571, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), intensification of work (<i>r</i> = 0.640, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and exhaustion related to work situation (<i>r</i> = 0.554, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01). A multilinear regression model adjusted for age and gender was computed to detect predictors of teachers' well-being index values (F(12, 296) = 41.405, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.627). A higher WHO-5 score was associated with (1) higher teaching hours (B = 0.235, 95% CI = 0.093, 0.413, <i>p</i> = 0.002); (2) higher work-related sense of coherence (B = 2.490, 95% CI = 0.209, 4.770, <i>p</i> = 0.032); (3) higher work satisfaction (B = 5.410, 95% CI = 2.979, 7.841, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001); (4) lower level of exhaustion related to work situations (B = -9.677, 95% CI = -12.279, -7.075, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001); and (5) lower level of psychosomatic complaints (B = -4.167, 95% CI = -6.739, -7.075, <i>p</i> = 0.002). These findings highlight the critical need to allocate more attention and resources to improve the mental health of school teachers in Hong Kong. The findings can also inform the development of psychological and organisational interventions and support mechanisms for teachers during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future stressful scenarios. Safeguarding the well-being and mental health of teachers is important for improving the quality of teaching and learning environments and the mental health of school students.","Lau, Shum, Man, Cheung, Amoah, Leung, Okan, Dadaczynski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214661","20221126","Hong Kong; coping; mental health; occupational health; perceived stress; school closure; school teachers; sense of coherence; workplace well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41765,""
"Insights from Review and Content Analysis of Current COVID-19 Mobile Apps and Recommendations for Future Pandemics","A number of mobile health apps related to coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed, but research into app content analytics for effective surveillance and management is still in its preliminary stages. The present study aimed to identify the purpose and functions of the currently available COVID-19 apps using content analysis. The secondary aim was to propose directions for the future development of apps that aid infectious disease surveillance and control with a focus on enhancing the app content and quality. Prior to conducting an app search in the App Store and the Google Play Store, we reviewed previous studies on COVID-19 apps found in Google Scholar and PubMed to examine the main purposes of the apps. Using the five selected keywords based on the review, we searched the two app stores to retrieve eligible COVID-19 apps including those already addressed in the reviewed literature. We conducted descriptive and content analyses of the selected apps. We classified the purpose types of the COVID-19 apps into the following five categories: Information provision, tracking, monitoring, mental health management, and engagement. We identified 890 apps from the review articles and the app stores: 47 apps met the selection criteria and were included in the content analysis. Among the selected apps, iOS apps outnumbered Android apps, 27 apps were government-developed, and most of the apps were created in the United States. The most common function for the iOS apps (63.6%) and Android apps (62.5%) was to provide COVID-19-related knowledge. The most common function among the tracking apps was to notify users of contact with infected people by the iOS apps (40.9%) and Android apps (37.5%). About 29.5% of the iOS apps and 25.0% of the Android apps were used to record symptoms and self-diagnose. Significantly fewer apps targeted mental health management and engagement. Six iOS apps (6/44, 13.6%) and four Android apps (4/24, 16.7%) provided behavioral guidelines about the pandemic. Two iOS apps (2/44, 4.5%) and two Android apps (2/24, 8.3%) featured communication functions. The present content analysis revealed that most of the apps provided unilateral information and contact tracing or location tracking. Several apps malfunctioned. Future research and development of COVID-19 apps or apps for other emerging infectious diseases should address the quality and functional improvements, which should begin with continuous monitoring and actions to mitigate any technical errors.","Kim, Choi, Ji, Woo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214652","20221126","COVID-19; contact tracing; corona; coronavirus; outbreak detection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41766,""
"Concerns about Household Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Evidence about how the pandemic affected household violence in Canada is mixed, but inarguably, the risk factors increased. This study used data from the 2020 Canadian Perspective Survey Series and the 2020 and 2021 Surveys of COVID-19 and Mental Health to examine the following: changes in the prevalence of concern about violence in individuals' own homes during the pandemic; the characteristics of those who expressed concern; and the prevalence of concerns for specific household members. Among Canadians, the prevalence of concern about violence in individuals' own homes decreased significantly between July and Fall 2020 (5.8% to 4.2%). Among women, the characteristics that were significantly associated with higher adjusted odds of concern about household violence included larger household size and lower household income. Lower education among women was associated with lower adjusted odds of concern. The associations with higher adjusted odds of concern among men included: being an immigrant, larger household size, and lower household income. From Fall 2020 to Spring 2021, the prevalence of concerns for oneself and for a child/children increased (1.7% to 2.5% and 1.0% to 2.5%, respectively), but concern for other adults in the household decreased (1.9% to 1.2%).

"Exploration of Despair Eccentricities Based on Scale Metrics with Feature Sampling Using a Deep Learning Algorithm","The majority of people in the modern biosphere struggle with depression as a result of the coronavirus pandemic's impact, which has adversely impacted mental health without warning. Even though the majority of individuals are still protected, it is crucial to check for post-corona virus symptoms if someone is feeling a little lethargic. In order to identify the post-coronavirus symptoms and attacks that are present in the human body, the recommended approach is included. When a harmful virus spreads inside a human body, the post-diagnosis symptoms are considerably more dangerous, and if they are not recognised at an early stage, the risks will be increased. Additionally, if the post-symptoms are severe and go untreated, it might harm one's mental health. In order to prevent someone from succumbing to depression, the technology of audio prediction is employed to recognise all the symptoms and potentially dangerous signs. Different choral characters are used to combine machine-learning algorithms to determine each person's mental state. Design considerations are made for a separate device that detects audio attribute outputs in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested technique; compared to the previous method, the performance metric is substantially better by roughly 67%.","Hasanin, Kshirsagar, Manoharan, Sengar, Selvarajan, Satapathy","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12112844","20221126","audio features; deep learning; depression prediction; mental imbalance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41768,""
"Cancer Patients and the COVID-19 Vaccines: Considerations and Challenges","Few guidelines exist for COVID-19 vaccination amongst cancer patients, fostering uncertainty regarding the immunogenicity, safety, and effects of cancer therapies on vaccination, which this review aims to address. A literature review was conducted to include the latest articles covering the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with solid and hematologic cancers receiving various treatments. Lower seropositivity following vaccination was associated with malignancy (compared to the general population), and hematologic malignancy (compared to solid cancers). Patients receiving active cancer therapy (unspecified), chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunosuppressants generally demonstrated lower seropositivity compared to healthy controls; though checkpoint inhibition, endocrine therapy, and cyclin dependent kinase inhibition did not appear to affect seropositivity. Vaccination appeared safe and well-tolerated in patients with current or past cancer and those undergoing treatment. Adverse events were comparable to the general population, but inflammatory lymphadenopathy following vaccination was commonly reported and may be mistaken for malignant etiology. Additionally, radiation recall phenomenon was sporadically reported in patients who had received radiotherapy.

The study recruited 1187 UK adults living with obesity who completed an online survey, that examined mental health, and associations with food insecurity, loneliness, and health-related behaviours from July 2020 (end of the first UK lockdown) to the point they completed the survey in 2021. Regression analyses were used to examine relationships between outcome variables and demographic factors, and hierarchical linear regression models were used to assess levels of loneliness, depression, and wellbeing. Participants reported worse loneliness, depression, wellbeing, and food insecurity compared to pre-COVID. However, participants reported attempting to lose weight, healthier food shopping, diet, and increased physical activity. Quality and quantity of sleep deteriorated compared to prior to COVID-19. Adult living with obesity in the UK report a continued negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon their mental health together with increased loneliness and food insecurity. However, our findings suggest that UK adults living with obesity have increased their engagement in positive health behaviours and were attempting to lose weight.

"Longitudinal analyses of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation highlight greater prevalence in the northern Dutch population during the COVID-19 lockdowns","The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an increased burden on mental health. To investigate the development of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and suicidal ideation in the Netherlands during the first fifteen months of the pandemic and three nation-wide lockdowns. Participants of the Lifelines Cohort Study -a Dutch population-based sample-reported current symptoms of MDD and GAD, including suicidal ideation, according to DSM-IV criteria. Between March 2020 and June 2021, 36,106 participants (aged 18-96) filled out a total of 629,811 questionnaires across 23 time points. Trajectories over time were estimated using generalized additive models and analyzed in relation to age, sex, and lifetime history of MDD/GAD. We found non-linear trajectories for MDD and GAD with a higher number of symptoms and prevalence rates during periods of lockdown. The point prevalence of MDD and GAD peaked during the third hard lockdown at 2.88&#x202f;% (95&#x202f;% CI: 2.71&#x202f;%-3.06&#x202f;%) and 2.92&#x202f;% (95&#x202f;% CI: 2.76&#x202f;%-3.08&#x202f;%), respectively, in March 2021. Women, younger adults, and participants with a history of MDD/GAD reported significantly more symptoms. For suicidal ideation, we found a significant linear increase over time in younger participants. For example, 20-year-old participants reported 4.14&#xd7; more suicidal ideation at the end of June 2021 compared to the start of the pandemic (4.64&#x202f;% (CI: 3.09&#x202f;%-6.96&#x202f;%) versus 1.12&#x202f;% (CI: 0.76&#x202f;%-1.66&#x202f;%)). Our findings should be interpreted in relation to the societal context of the Netherlands and the public health response of the Dutch government during the pandemic, which may be different in other regions in the world. Our study showed greater prevalence of MDD and GAD during COVID-19 lockdowns and a continuing increase in suicidal thoughts among young adults suggesting that the pandemic and government enacted restrictions impacted mental health in the population. Our findings provide actionable insights on mental health in the population during the pandemic, which can guide policy makers and clinical care during future lockdowns and epi/pandemics.","Ori, Wieling, van Loo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.040","20221125","COVID-19; Generalized additive models; Generalized anxiety disorder; Lifelines biobank; Major depressive disorder; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41771,""
"Relationship between depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in health professionals and their perceptions about the quality of the health services in the context of COVID-19 pandemic","The health emergency caused by COVID-19 revealed the shortcomings of health services (HS), but little is known about how this has impacted the mental health of health professionals (HP). Data were collected through an online survey administered to HP in Lima (Peru) between May and July 2020. Instruments were applied to evaluate anxiety, depression, perceived stress (PS), and perceived quality of health services (PQHS). A total of 507 HP completed the survey. In the multivariate analysis, younger age and female gender were related to anxiety, depression, and PS (all with p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). The most relevant unfavorable PQHS associated with anxiety were competence of other HP to care for HP if infected (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.002) and support for HP or their families in the event of becoming infected (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001); the most relevant unfavorable PHQS associated with depression were equipment to care for HP and their families if infected (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003); support for HP or their families if infected (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001); fear of HP and/or family members being infected or dying (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.006); and HP' recognition of their competencies (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001); and the most relevant unfavorable PHQS associated with PS were support for HP or their families if infected (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001) and instability of knowledge (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.027). There was an association between impaired mental health and PQHS scores among HP. This study shows the need for HP to express their concerns about how HS are supporting their safety and that of their family during health emergencies.","Ol&#xf3;rtegui-Yz&#xfa;, Vega-Dienstmaier, Fern&#xe1;ndez-Arana","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2816","20221125","COVID-19; health professionals; health services; mental health; perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41772,""
"Is SARS-CoV-2 the only cause of long-COVID?","Around 10% of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 that survive a first episode of COVID-19 appear to experience long-term clinical manifestations. The signs and symptoms of this post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) include fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, myalgia, chest pain, cough, anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, depression, anxiety, memory loss, concentration difficulties, and insomnia. These sequelae remind the constellation of clinical manifestations previously recognized as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This condition has been described following distinct infectious events, mostly acute viral illnesses. In this way, the pathophysiology of PACS might overlap with mechanisms involved in other post-infectious fatigue syndromes. The risk of PACS is more frequent in women than men. Additional host genetic factors could be involved. There is a dysregulation of multiple body organs and systems, involving the immune system, the coagulation cascade, endocrine organs, autonomic nervous system, microbiota-gut-brain axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, etc. Hypothetically, an abnormal response to certain infectious agents could trigger the development of postinfectious fatigue syndromes.","Pintos-Pascual, Moreno-Torres, Ib&#xe1;nez-Est&#xe9;llez, Corrales-Rodriguez, Trevi&#xf1;o, Corpas, Corral, Soriano, de Mendoza","https://doi.org/10.24875/AIDSRev.22000025","20221125","COVID-19; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Long-COVID; Myalgic encephalomyelitis; Persistent COVID; Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; Post-infectious fatigue syndrome; Post-viral fatigue; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","",41773,""
