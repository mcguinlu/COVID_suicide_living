"Unamuno on suffering and Frankl's 'will to meaning': a philo-logotherapeutic advice to humankind here and beyond and the role of social relations towards mental fitness","Humankind is both historically and existentially exposed to various traumatic and disastrous experiences including the COVID-19 pandemic. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno argued that part of humans' consciousness is the awareness of death and suffering. He argued that the latter is an essential feature of existence. Whereas Viktor Frankl's logotherapy stresses that humans' primary motivational force is to find meaning in life particularly in the midst of suffering. This paper attempts to enrich Unamuno and Frankl's contentions on persons' nature to suffer and discover meaning. Through this construction, the author believes it could help individuals to properly embrace and adapt to the inevitable sufferings of the world and bolsters mental health like in the current pandemic.","Pacaol","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab270","20210712","COVID-19; logotherapy; suffering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15876,""
"Patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic: Depressive symptoms and their association with healthcare access","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacted the lives of worldwide people with epilepsy (PWE) in various aspects, particularly in those countries most significantly affected by this pandemic, such as Brazil. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in PWE and their correlation with epilepsy features and access to treatment. PWE were invited to answer a cross-sectional online-based survey to assess and rate depressive symptoms using the NDDI-E during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its relation to multiple lifestyles epilepsy clinical aspects. A total of 490 PWE were recruited. The prevalence of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was 35.3% (cutoff scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯15 on NDDI-E). The factors associated with higher NDDI-E scores were: female sex, increased seizure frequency, barriers to access to their treating physician and antiseizure medication, and unemployment. Regarding the pandemic impact on PWE healthcare, 29.2% reported restricted access to their medication, 46.1% barriers to access their physicians, 94.2% had their consultations canceled due to the pandemic, and 28.4% had seizure worsening in this period. The COVID-19 pandemic affected PWE access to the healthcare system. Depressive symptoms were more severe in patients with higher seizure frequency who had difficulties obtaining proper medical care. The COVID-19 pandemic may impact the healthcare and mental wellbeing of patients with chronic diseases such as epilepsy. Nevertheless, prospective studies on epilepsy and COVID-19 are still lacking.","Dos Santos Lunardi, Marin de Carvalho, Alencastro Veiga Domingues Carneiro, Giacomini, Valente, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108178","20210712","Antiseizure medication; COVID-19; Depression; Epilepsy; Healthcare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15877,""
"Bereavement from COVID-19, Gender, and Reports of Depression among Older Adults in Europe","The COVID-19 pandemic has left older adults around the world bereaved by the sudden death of relatives and friends. We examine if COVID-19 bereavement corresponds with older adults' reporting depression in 27 countries, and test for variation by gender and country context. We analyze SHARE COVID-19 data collected between June-August 2020 from N=51,383 older adults (age 50-104) living in 27 countries, of whom 1,363 reported the death of a relative or friend from COVID-19. We estimate pooled-multilevel logit regression models to examine if COVID-19 bereavement was associated with self-reported depression and worsening depression, and we test whether national COVID-19 mortality rates moderate these assocations. COVID-19 bereavement is associated with significantly higher probabilities of both reporting depression and reporting worsened depression among older adults. Net of one's own personal loss, living in a country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate is associated with women's reports of worsened depression but not men's. However, the country's COVID-19 mortality rate does not moderate associations between COVID-19 bereavement and depression. COVID-19 deaths have lingering mental health implications for surviving older adults. Even as the collective toll of the crisis is apparent, bereaved older adults are in particular need of mental health support.","Wang, Verdery, Margolis, Smith-Greenaway","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab132","20210712","Bereavement; COVID-19; Depression; Disaster; Gender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15878,""
"Burden of post-COVID-19 syndrome and implications for healthcare service planning: A population-based cohort study","Longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming an important burden to societies and healthcare systems. Data on post-COVID-19 syndrome in the general population are required for the timely planning of healthcare services and resources. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of impaired health status and physical and mental health symptoms among individuals at least six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to characterize their healthcare utilization. This population-based prospective cohort study (Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort) enrolled 431 adults from the general population with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to health authorities between 27 February 2020 and 05 August 2020 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. We evaluated the proportion of individuals reporting not to have fully recovered since SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the proportion reporting fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnea (mMRC dyspnea scale) or depression (DASS-21) at six to eight months after diagnosis. Furthermore, the proportion of individuals with at least one healthcare contact after their acute illness was evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with these main outcomes. Symptoms were present in 385 (89%) participants at diagnosis and 81 (19%) were initially hospitalized. At six to eight months, 111 (26%) reported not having fully recovered. 233 (55%) participants reported symptoms of fatigue, 96 (25%) had at least grade 1 dyspnea, and 111 (26%) had DASS-21 scores indicating symptoms of depression. 170 (40%) participants reported at least one general practitioner visit related to COVID-19 after acute illness, and 10% (8/81) of initially hospitalized individuals were rehospitalized. Individuals that have not fully recovered or suffer from fatigue, dyspnea or depression were more likely to have further healthcare contacts. However, a third of individuals (37/111) that have not fully recovered did not seek further care. In this population-based study, a relevant proportion of participants suffered from longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection. With millions infected across the world, our findings emphasize the need for the timely planning of resources and patient-centered services for post-COVID-19 care.","Menges, Ballouz, Anagnostopoulos, Aschmann, Domenghino, Fehr, Puhan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254523","20210712","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15879,""

"Stressors Among Chinese Frontline Health Care Workers Exposed to COVID-19 and Associated Mental Health Outcomes","The current study aimed to identify the main stressors inherent to caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated mental health outcomes among frontline health care workers. Data were collected via an online questionnaire from 651 frontline health care workers providing direct medical services for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Participants reported the stressors inherent to caring for patients with COVID-19, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The most common stressors were ""Worry about being negligent and endangering coworkers"" (76.2%), ""Worry about getting infected"" (74.7%), and ""Protective gear causing physical discomfort"" (73.6%). ""Conflict between duty and safety"" and ""Protective gear causing physical discomfort"" were linked to high risk of depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

"COVID-19 as a context in suicide: early insights from Victoria, Australia","To examine how the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its consequences may have influenced suicide in Victoria, Australia. A mixed methods study of consecutive Victorian suicide cases spanning 1 January 2015 to 31 January 2021. Interrupted time series analysis examined whether suicide frequency changed following the pandemic onset. Thematic analysis was undertaken of police reports in suicides linked with COVID-19 to try to understand how COVID-19 acted as a stressor. The frequency of Victorian suicides did not change following the onset of COVID-19. Sixty COVID-linked suicides were identified, featuring three recurring themes: COVID-19 as a disturbance in the self, in relationships with others and institutions. While COVID-19 has not led to an increase in Victorian suicide frequency to date, it is an important background stressor that can erode one's wellbeing, sense of agency and connectedness to others. Implications for public health: Clinical interventions that serve to reconnect people with a sense of agency and seek to re-establish contact with significant others are indicated. Clinicians should ensure they are familiar with pathways for their patients to access government social and economic supports. A better understanding of how government interventions may be lessening psychological distress is needed.","Dwyer, Dwyer, Hiscock, O'Callaghan, Taylor, Millar, Lamb, Bugeja","https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13132","20210712","COVID-19; mixed-methods; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15883,""

"Evaluation of the Mental Health of Care Home Staff in the Covid-19 Era What price did care home workers pay for standing by their patients?","The characteristics of this pandemic increase the potential psychological impact on care homes workers (CHWs). The aims of this study were to analyze the mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of a broad sample of CHWs in Spain and to identify potential factors that have a significant effect on their mental health and HRQoL. This descriptive study comprised 210 CHWs who completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Impact Event Scale-Revised, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. Sociodemographic and clinical data in relation to COVID-19 were also recorded. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis and multivariable linear regression models were applied to identify factors associated with mental health and HRQoL. 86.19% of participants were female; 86.67% were aged under 55 years; 11% were physicians and 64.19% were nurses or auxiliaries; 77.62% have themselves tested positive for Covid-19, and 67.94% of CHWs have directly treated patients with Covid-19. 49.28% had clinical depression; over half (58.57%) had clinical anxiety; 70.95% had clinical stress; and 28.57% had clinical insomnia. Increased use of tranquilizers/sedatives appears to be an explanatory variable of suffering greater anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia, and of having a worse HRQoL amongst our CHWs.

"Brain Stress Mapping in COVID-19 Survivors Using MR Spectroscopy: New Avenue of Mental Health Status Monitoring","Coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged as a human catastrophe worldwide, and it has impacted human life more detrimentally than the combined effect of World Wars I and II. Various research studies reported that the disease is not confined to the respiratory system but also leads to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders suggesting that the virus is potent to affect the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, the damage to CNS may continue to rise even after the COVID-19 infection subsides which may further induce a long-term impact on the brain, resulting in cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging techniques provide the ability to detect and quantify pathological manifestations in the brain of COVID-19 survivors. In this context, a scheme based on structural, spectroscopic, and behavioral studies could be executed to monitor the gradual changes in the brain non-invasively due to COVID-19 which may further help in quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the survivors. Extensive research is required in this direction for identifying the mechanism and implications of COVID-19 in the brain. Additionally, longitudinal follow-up studies are also needed to perform for monitoring the effects of this pandemic on individuals over a prolonged period.","Samkaria, Punjabi, Sharma, Joon, Sandal, Dasgupta, Sharma, Mandal","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-210287","20210712","Brain; COVID-19; cognition; gamma-aminobutyric acid; glutathione; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15886,""

"Effects of social prescribing pilot project for the elderly in rural area of South Korea during COVID-19 pandemic","Older adults-classified as a high-risk group-are highly likely to experience increased loneliness due to the implementation of various policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Accordingly, this study aims to examine the effects of a pilot social prescribing project for elderly people in rural area of South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, the effectiveness of the pilot project was verified through pre- and post-impact and outcome evaluation. According to the results of the impact evaluation, <i>loneliness</i> reduced significantly, while the <i>social participation attitude</i> score increased. Although the average score of <i>self-efficacy</i> increased, it was not statistically significant. Moreover, it was found that <i>self-esteem</i> increased significantly. In the outcome evaluation, <i>depression</i> reduced considerably. To conclude, the pilot social prescribing project was effective in reducing depression and loneliness for the elderly in rural areas of Korea. It was also confirmed that there is potential to develop a new health promotion project that can improve the self-esteem of the elderly, and expand their social activities. Second, the pilot project was carried out in an integrated manner by utilizing resources in communities with good accessibility. Therefore, it is expected to be used as a new ""Integrated community care model"" to improve the mental health of the elderly in rural areas. Third, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly tend to experience increasing feelings of depression, isolation, and loneliness due to ""social distancing.""

"Social media exposure and mental health problems during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Indonesia","Several preventive measures were used by governments around the world to suppress the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including quarantine. During quarantine more people are at risk of developing mental health problems as social media exposure was increasing. The objective is to investigate the impact of social media exposure during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on depression, anxiety, and stress. A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020 during the large scale social restriction in Indonesia using online questionnaire Indonesian citizens over 18 years of age were invited to take part by answering online questionnaire through Google forms (http://bit.ly/duniamayaCOVID). Data gathered were demographic data, depression, anxiety, and stress that were assessed using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, duration of social media usage, and social media platforms used during COVID-19 pandemic. Data was analysed using Pearson Chi-square and ANOVA. Statistically significant variables and additional risk factors was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. The median age was 24 years (range 17-56 years), 121 (55,0%) samples were female. The three most frequent social media platforms used by participants were Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube. Female were more likely to suffer from mild-moderate depression compared to male (odds ratio [OR]: 2.344; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.105-4.972; <i>P</i> = 0.026) and more likely to suffer from severe-extremely severe anxiety (OR: 2.066; 95% CI: 1.019-4.187; <i>P</i> = 0.044).

"Existential anxiety amid COVID-19 pandemic in Kashmir: A cross-sectional study","Existential anxiety (EA) revolves around the question of ultimate concern related to life and death. It gets more prominent when there is an exposure to stressful experiences where the stress is profound and resources seem insufficient. The objective was to measure the prevalence and magnitude of EA in the study population from the Kashmir valley during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, data were collected through social media. All the participants belonging to the Kashmir valley were included. EA questionnaire developed by Weems <i>et al</i>. was used. A total of 132 subjects were included. The prevalence of EA concerns was death 55%, fate 62%, emptiness 73%, meaninglessness 32%, guilt 55%, and condemnation 64%. The mean EA score was 5.0. EA was higher in those who had been diagnosed with mental illness ever in their life by a psychiatrist than those who had no such history. EA score was much higher in those who had ever felt a need to visit a psychiatrist than those who had not. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean scores of EA for those who never felt this need and those who felt this need since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a high prevalence of EA in the study population from the Kashmir valley. Relative concerns were more prevalent than absolute concerns. EA score was higher among those who had mental health issues compared to others.","Ain, Gilani","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_1102_20","20210712","Anxiety; death; existentialism; life; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15892,""
"Psychological and Demographic Determinants of Substance Use and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Alcohol consumption and distress have increased among Canadians since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> We examined whether sociodemographic and COVID-19-related worries are associated with various combinations of alcohol consumption and comorbid psychological distress variables among a Canadian sample of adults. Data were derived from a sample of Canadian adults (<i>N</i> = 1,005, 49.6% female) who participated in an online survey in May 2020. Four multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of binge drinking, increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic, and psychological distress. Predictor variables used in the analyses included self-reported sociodemographic characteristics, financial worries, COVID-19 impact on work, and worrying about getting ill. <b>Results:</b> Women were found to have higher odds of increased drinking and anxiety. Also being divorced, separated, or widowed was associated with higher odds of binge drinking and anxiety, and binge drinking and depression. Furthermore, being 60 or older was associated with lower odds of binge drinking and depression and increased drinking and depression, as well as lower odds of increased drinking and depression and increased drinking and anxiety. High income groups were associated with higher odds of binge drinking, increased drinking, and mental distress. Compared to those less worried, being very worried about finances were associated with higher odds of binge drinking and anxiety, increased drinking and anxiety, and increased drinking and depression. Also, being very worried about getting ill with COVID was associated with higher odds of binge drinking and anxiety and increased drinking and anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings identify several demographic and COVID-related worries for increased odds of alcohol intake and co-morbid psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, including identifying as a woman, high income groups, being divorced, separated or widowed, and experiencing financial worries and COVID illness worries. These characteristics should be considered when developing prevention and treatment programs for adults with problematic alcohol use and comorbid anxiety and depression.","Mougharbel, Sampasa-Kanyinga, Heidinger, Corace, Hamilton, Goldfield","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.680028","20210712","COVID-19; alcohol use and alcohol problems; anxiety; binge drinking; concurrency; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15893,""
"The Psychological Effect of Forming WeChat Groups Between Medical Staff and Patients With COVID-19","<b>Background:</b> This study was conducted in order to explore the effect of psychological intervention based on the use of WeChat with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 65 patients with COVID-19, from two wards, were divided into an experimental group and a control group with the ward as the basic unit. Communication concerning routine treatment and nursing was established between the medical staff and patients in the experimental group <i>via</i> WeChat groups. Within 48 h of admission, at 7 days, and on discharge, all 65 patients completed two self-evaluation questionnaires: the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Hospital stay statistics and a satisfaction survey on discharge were also collated for both groups of patients. <b>Results:</b> The PANAS scores of the experimental group were 26.61 Ã‚Â± 7.99 points on admission, 20.81 Ã‚Â± 5.48 points at 7 days, and 19.58 Ã‚Â± 6.61 points on discharge (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The scores of HADS in the experimental group were 27.74 Ã‚Â± 9.35 points on admission, 12.19 Ã‚Â± 1.92 points at 7 days, and 11.71 Ã‚Â± 3.64 points on discharge (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The differences in the PANS and HADS scores between the experimental and control groups at 7 days and on discharge were statistically significant. The discharge satisfaction ratings of the two groups of patients were 99.87 Ã‚Â± 0.34 and 98.68 Ã‚Â± 1.09 points, the difference being statistically significant (<i>t</i> = 5.827, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Establishing WeChat groups between medical staff and patients with COVID-19 and building a bridge for better communication improved patients' positive mentality and their compliance with doctors, shortened their hospital stay, and promoted their recovery.","Yuan, Yu, Zhang, Zhang, Jin, Wang, Yang, Huang, Zhang, Tao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.586465","20210712","2019-nCoV; WeChat group; disease response; health education; pneumonia; psychological care; satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15894,""
"The Efficacy of Tracheotomy for Covid-19 Pneumonia: Impacts on Survival and Prognostic Factors","The role of tracheotomy during the pandemic remains to be determined for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We evaluated the effect of tracheotomy on prognostic markers and assessed 4Ã‚Â weeks survival in terms of clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients and time and type (open or percutaneous) of the operation. We performed a retrospective study considering ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and tracheotomy, between May 30 and December 31, 2020. Four weeks survival postoperatively and alteration of biochemical markers were analyzed. 24 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and tracheotomy, included in this study. Median age was 68.3Ã‚Â years (range 38-90) with male:female ratio 16:8. All the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia considering clinical symptoms and COVID-19 specific CT findings. RT-PCR test results were positive in 58.3%. Prognostic markers were found to be increased postoperatively with both types of surgery (75%). 1Ã‚Â week and 4Ã‚Â weeks survival after the operation was 66.7% and 45.8%, respectively. 4Ã‚Â weeks survival was decreased significantly with NLRÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 compared to NLRÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 (15.3-81.8%). Nevertheless, 4Ã‚Â weeks survival differences between males and females (12.5% and 62.5%) and between ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°50 andÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°50 (100% and 35%) were also found to be statistically significant. Patients with younger age, male gender, and NLRÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10, were found to have longer survival after tracheotomy. Positive PCR results and preoperative critically increased biochemical markers were related to decreased survival. The number of comorbidities, time and type of surgery, and postoperative increment of prognostic markers seemed not to affect survival.","Tuna, Birdane","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-021-02717-3","20210712","Biochemical markers; Covid-19; Prognostic markers; Survival; Tracheotomy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15895,""
"Children and Adolescent Mental Health in a Time of COVID-19: A Forgotten Priority","Globally, 10-20% of children and adolescents experience mental health conditions, but most of them do not receive the appropriate care when it is needed. The COVID-19 deaths and prevention measures, such as the lockdowns, economic downturns, and school closures, have affected many communities physically, mentally, and economically and significantly impacted the already-neglected children and adolescents' mental health. As a result, evidence has shown that many children and adolescents are experiencing psychological effects such as depression and anxiety without adequate support. The consequences of not addressing the mental health conditions in children and adolescents extend through adulthood and restrict them from reaching their full potential. The effects of COVID-19 on children and adolescents' mental health highlight the urgent need for multisectoral home-grown solutions to provide early diagnosis and treatment and educate caregivers on home-based interventions and community outreach initiatives to address children and adolescents' mental health challenges during this pandemic and beyond.","Binagwaho, Senga","https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3330","20210712","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15896,""
"Parents' Perceived Impact of the Societal Lockdown of COVID-19 on Family Well-Being and on the Emotional and Behavioral State of Walloon Belgian Children Aged 4 to 13 Years: An Exploratory Study","This exploratory study assessed parents' perceptions of the emotional and behavioral impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on their children. The total sample included 749 children, aged 4 to 13 years old (353 girls, 396 boys); 524 parents took part. The emotional and behavioral changes observed during the societal lockdown, family coexistence, the impact of COVID-19 on family well-being, and the frequency of social contacts before and during this lockdown were investigated. Results show that the most frequently reported difficulties were worry, agitation, anxiety, sadness, loneliness, nervousness, arguing, anger, frustration, boredom, irritability, behavioral problems, and laziness. Family coexistence declined significantly during this lockdown, and parents mentioned that COVID-19 had an impact on family well-being. Various ordinal logistic regressions showed that family coexistence, children's nervousness due to COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on family well-being, age, and social contacts before and during this lockdown seemed to explain the various emotional and behavioral changes observed in children during the societal lockdown. These results are discussed and recommendations are made.","Stassart, Wagener, Etienne","https://doi.org/10.5334/pb.1059","20210712","COVID-19; children; psychological impact; societal lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15897,""

"Aspects of Epidemiology, Pathology, Virology, Immunology, Transmission, Prevention, Prognosis, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","Undoubtedly, COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest pandemics and one of the biggest international challenges for health-care system of various countries in the world. This is a narrative review study based on the studies published related with different aspects of COVID-19. The highest numbers of active cases are in the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, as well as Colombia and the disease surveillance system must operate more quickly, timely, effectively, and sensitively in these countries. What is clear is that the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is significantly higher than one and its transmission power is extremely high. In general, it can be stated that mortality and fatality risk due to COVID-19 in men, age increase, severity of disease, systemic disease, as well as inadequate access to the sufficient health-care services will increase. There is currently no specific treatment and effective vaccine for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus pandemic is more consistent with the epidemiological triangle model, which emphasizes that the disease is the result of the interaction of three factors of host, agent, and environment. Therefore, prevention and treatment activities should focus on cutting the virus transmission chain. The main way to deal with viral epidemics is prevention. The emerging of this ruthless virus has once again reminded us that communicable diseases should never be underestimated and forgotten. Considering the rapid transmission of COVID-19, the health-care authorities and workers should consider timely detection and safeguards to prevent the transmission to healthy individuals.","Rahimi Pordanjani, Hasanpour, Askarpour, Bastam, Rafiee, Khazaei, Mazaheri, Vaziri, Sabour","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_469_20","20210712","COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious; narrative review; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15899,""
"COVID-19 unmasked: preschool children's negative thoughts and worries during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","<b>Background</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences are stressful for many children and their families. Previous research with school-aged children has shown that negative thoughts and worries can predict mental health symptoms following stressful events. So far preschool children have been neglected in these investigations. <b>Objective</b>: The aim of this study was to explore negative thoughts and worries that preschool aged children are having during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Method</b>: As part of a larger mixed-method study, caregivers of <i>NÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 399 preschoolers aged between 3 and 5Ã‚Â years (<i>M</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.41) answered open-ended questions about their COVID-19 related thoughts and worries. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify relevant themes from the qualitative data. A theoretical model of child thoughts and worries was developed based on these qualitative findings and the existing empirical and theoretical literature. <b>Results</b>: Caregivers gave examples that indicated that preschoolers had difficulties understanding causality and overestimated the risk of COVID-19 infection. Caregivers reported that their children expressed worries about getting sick and infecting others as well as about changes in daily life becoming permanent. Caregivers observed their children's preoccupation with COVID-19 and worries in conversations, play and drawings as well as in behavioural changes - increased arousal, cautiousness, avoidance and attachment-seeking behaviour. <b>Conclusion</b>: Preschool children can and do express negative thoughts and worries and have also experienced threat and increased vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. A theoretical model is proposed that could inform assessments, interventions and future research in the field. <b>Antecedentes</b>: la pandemia de COVID-19 y sus consecuencias son estresantes para muchos niÃƒÂ±os y sus familias. Investigaciones previas con niÃƒÂ±os en edad escolar han demostrado que los pensamientos negativos y las preocupaciones pueden predecir sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental luego de eventos estresantes. Hasta ahora, los niÃƒÂ±os en edad preescolar han sido desatendidos en estas investigaciones.<b>Objetivo</b>: El objetivo de este estudio fue explorar los pensamientos negativos y las preocupaciones que los niÃƒÂ±os en edad preescolar estÃƒÂ¡n teniendo durante la pandemia de COVID-19.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: Como parte de un estudio mÃƒÂ¡s amplio de mÃƒÂ©todos mixtos, los cuidadores de <i>NÃ‚Â </i>= 399 niÃƒÂ±os en edad preescolar de entre 3 y 5 aÃƒÂ±os (<i>M</i> = 4,41) respondieron preguntas abiertas sobre sus pensamientos y preocupaciones relacionados con COVID-19. Se utilizÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis temÃƒÂ¡tico reflexivo para identificar temas relevantes a partir de los datos cualitativos. Se desarrollÃƒÂ³ un modelo teÃƒÂ³rico de los pensamientos y preocupaciones de los niÃƒÂ±os, basado en estos hallazgos cualitativos como tambiÃƒÂ©n la literatura empÃƒÂ­rica y teÃƒÂ³rica existente.<b>Resultados</b>: Los cuidadores dieron ejemplos que indicaban que los niÃƒÂ±os en edad preescolar tenÃƒÂ­an dificultades para comprender causalidad, y sobrestimaban el riesgo de infecciÃƒÂ³n por COVID-19.

"The effect of COVID-19 on medical students' education and wellbeing: a cross-sectional survey","Canadian medical school curriculums have undergone major restructuring during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study's goal was to assess the perceived impact of COVID-19 on medical students' education and wellbeing. An online survey was distributed to Canadian medical students. Descriptive analyses and ANOVAs were used to assess changes in mental health, health habits and quality of education during the pandemic. 248 medical students from 13 schools across Canada participated in this study. 74% reported a reduction in the quality of their education since COVID-19. 58% of students found online to be inferior to in-person teaching. 65% of students had more time for wellness and leisure activities, about half of the cohort felt more depressed (48%) and lonelier (52%). Student's overall health habits worsened after the start of the pandemic (F=37.4, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Alcohol drinking, time spent seated, and screen time also increased since the pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). During the pandemic, students with a prior history of depression or anxiety expressed increased depressive symptoms (66% vs. 42%, <i>p</i> =0.003), increased anxiety (69% vs. 41%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001), worse sleep quality (34% vs. 18%, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and poorer quality of life (55% vs. 65%, <i>p</i> = 0.024) versus those with no prior history.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease: an observational cross-sectional study","The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on the population's behavior. In this context, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) remains unclear. To analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug treatment of patients with PAD and IC. In this cross-sectional, observational study, 136 patients with PAD and IC were recruited from our database and answered a questionnaire by telephone involving the following questions: a) precautions related to COVID-19; b) general health status; and c) treatment of diseases. Subsequently, patients were divided into two groups according to difficulty in obtaining their drugs (DOD: difficulty obtaining drugs, or NDOD: no difficulty obtaining drugs) and overall health was compared between groups. Seventeen percent of patients reported difficulties with obtaining drugs during the pandemic. A higher proportion of these patients reported being sadder (56.5% vs. 24.8%, P &lt; 0.01) and having more difficulty sleeping (56.5% vs. 24.8%, P &lt; 0.01) than of the patients in the NDOD group (P &lt;0.01).

"Gender Differences in Psychological Impact of the Confinement During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain: A Longitudinal Study","The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led the authorities to establish compulsory confinement for most of the Spanish population from March to May 2020. Severe isolation combined with the uncertainty and fear associated with the public health crisis can have a psychological impact on the general population. The aim of the current study was to compare possible gender differences in mental health and psychological measures throughout the confinement. One hundred and sixty-four Spanish participants (75% female; M<sub>age</sub> = 39.8; SD = 13.5) completed the surveys at the beginning, middle, and end of the forced confinement. The psychological variables were associated with depressive, anxiety, stress, and intrusive/avoidance symptoms, as well as a total score for overall mental health, and a positive/negative affect measure. The results showed that although females had significantly higher scores than males in almost all measures at the beginning of the confinement, the gender differences were quickly vanishing away over time. In fact, intra-group analysis showed that while the female group significantly improved their results on most psychological measures, the male group improved on only one single measure. In summary, the results showed that although the female group started the confinement with higher levels of negative emotions (particularly symptoms of stress and avoidance) than the male group, these differences were significantly reduced in the first few weeks due to the overall improvement in the results of the female group.","Fenollar-CortÃƒÂ©s, JimÃƒÂ©nez, Ruiz-GarcÃƒÂ­a, ResurrecciÃƒÂ³n","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.682860","20210712","COVID-19; coronavirusÃ¢â‚¬â€COVID-19; gender differences; longitudinal study; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15903,""
"Explanatory Model of Perceived Stress in the General Population: A Cross-Sectional Study in Peru During the COVID-19 Context","The COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impact mental health worldwide. High prevalence of stress had been previously reported in populations during this context. Many theoretical frameworks had been proposed for explaining the stress process, we aim to proposed and explanatory model for the genesis of perceived stress in Peruvian general population. We conducted an online survey in Peruvian general population assessing sociodemographic variables and evaluating mental health conditions by using The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and a numerical rating scale (NRS) for fear of COVID-19. Correlation analysis was conducted for the variables of interest. Two regression models were constructed to explore related factor to the dimensions of perceived stress. Finally, a structural regression model was performed with the independent variables. Data of 210 individuals was analyzed. Ages ranged from 15 to 74 years and 39% were women. Additionally, 65.2% of the participants had at least one mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms). Perceived self-efficacy and positive affect (PA) were correlated, as perceived helplessness with anxious symptoms and negative affect (NA). Regression analysis showed that sex, anxiety symptoms, and NA explained perceived helplessness while positive and NA explained self-efficacy. The structural regression model analysis identified that fear of COVID-19 (composed of fear of infecting others and fear of contagion), predicted mental health conditions (i.e., depressive or anxiety symptoms); also, mental health conditions were predicted by PA and NA. Perceived helplessness and Perceived self-efficacy were interrelated and represented the perceived stress variable. We proposed an explanatory model of perceived stress based on two correlated dimensions (self-efficacy and helplessness) in the Peruvian general population during the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with two out of three individuals surveyed having at least one mental health condition.","Boluarte-Carbajal, Navarro-Flores, Villarreal-Zegarra","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673945","20210712","COVID-19; Peru; general population; perceived stress; structural equation modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15904,""
"Dealing With the Pandemic of COVID-19 in Portugal: On the Important Role of Positivity, Experiential Avoidance, and Coping Strategies","The global COVID-19 pandemic crisis has caused an unprecedented impact on most areas of people's lives. Thus, framed within the scope of Existential Positive Psychology (PP2.0), this study aimed at assessing the psychological distress of adults living in Portugal during the first national lockdown, how they are coping with stress, as well to contribute to a deeper understanding about the role that positivity, experiential avoidance, and coping strategies have in psychological distress and well-being. For this purpose, 586 Portuguese adults (73% females) ranging between 18 and 78 years old (<i>M</i> = 38.96, <i>SD</i> = 12.20) completed an online survey during the initial phase of the pandemic crisis in Portugal. Findings suggest that experiential avoidance was the strongest predictor of a negative response (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and negative emotions), whereas positivity was a better predictor of psychological well-being and lower levels of depression. Additionally, self-blame, behavioral disengagement, and emotional venting were strong risk factors for psychological distress, whereas positive reframing, planning, and acceptance were associated with more positive outcomes. These findings highlight the critical role of experiential avoidance on individuals' psychological distress and the essential contribution of positive life orientation in promoting flourishing. By offering a better understanding of the complex navigation through the dialectics between positive and negative life features, this study provides important and useful cues for psychological interventions directed at promoting a more positive and adaptive human functioning even through such potential adverse and painful life events.","Ferreira, Sofia, Carreno, Eisenbeck, Jongenelen, Cruz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647984","20210712","COVID-19 pandemic; acceptance; coping; existential positive psychology; experiential avoidance; positivity; psychological distress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15905,""
"High Prevalence of Post-stroke Anxiety in Elderly Patients Following COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Objective:</b> Post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is a common affective disorder in patients with ischemic stroke. The elderly are more susceptible to mental health issues, however, few studies have so far focused on PSA in elderly patients, especially in the context of the COVID-19, causing psychological issues in the general population. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PSA in elderly patients following COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed 206 elderly inpatients with newly diagnosed acute ischemic stroke in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, from January 2020 to December 2020. Patients were categorized into the PSA group and the non-PSA group based on Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores at admission (within 1 week after stroke onset). Demographic and clinical data, mental state by Mini-Mental State Examination, depression by Hamilton Depression Scales (HAMD), and stroke severity and outcome by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale were compared between the two groups. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze risk factors associated with PSA. We determined the cutoff scores for significant predictors of PSA using the area under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating characteristic. <b>Results:</b> Of the 206 stroke patients, 62 (30.1%) developed anxiety. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that female gender [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.288, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.021-5.128, <i>P</i> = 0.044], high NIHSS scores [aOR: 1.264, 95% CI: 1.074-1.486, <i>P</i> = 0.005] and HAMD scores [aOR: 1.345, 95% CI: 1.215-1.490, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001] were independent risk factors for PSA. The cutoff threshold for the NIHSS scores was 3.5 points with an AUC of 0.64 and the cutoff threshold for HAMD scores was 5.5 points with an AUC of 0.89. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results showed a high incidence of PSA in elderly patients after the COVID-19 outbreak. Female gender, high NIHSS and HAMD scores were the independent risk factors for PSA.","Yao, Li, Luo, Li, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.699869","20210712","COVID-19; acute ischemic stroke; elderly patients; post-stroke anxiety; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15906,""
"Psychological Distress and Its Association With Quality of Life in Organ Transplant Recipients During COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have an impact on the psychological distress of organ transplant recipients. We aimed to assess the status of psychological distress and its association with quality of life (QoL) in organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 305 organ transplant recipients during March 30 and April 2, 2020, in Wuhan. Psychological distress comprised depression, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and Impact of event scale-revised. QoL was assessed using the Chinese version of the short Form 36-item health survey. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD in organ transplant recipients was 13.4, 6.9, 11.8, and 30.5%, respectively. Organ transplant recipients with depression had significantly lower scores in all eight dimensions of QoL compared with participants without depression (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Lower scores on the QoL dimensions of role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, role emotional, and mental health were found in organ transplant recipients with anxiety, insomnia, or PTSD compared with their counterparts without the respective disorder (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Limitation:</b> The cross-sectional study design limited us to make causal conclusion and the influence of potential confounders cannot be ruled out. <b>Conclusions:</b> Psychological distress was prevalent in organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and those with depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD had poorer QoL. Therefore, timely psychological counseling, COVID-19 related health education, and essential community medical services should be provided to organ transplant recipients to relieve their psychological distress, and to improve their QoL.","Cai, Cai, Song, Wang, Zhang, Ma, Tang, Bai, Tan, Li, Yao, Liu, Wang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.690295","20210712","coronavirus disease; cross-sectional study; organ transport; psychological distress; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15907,""
"One Year Into the Pandemic: A Systematic Review of Perinatal Mental Health Outcomes During COVID-19","Obstetric guidelines have rapidly evolved to incorporate new data and research on the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with data on perinatal mental health building over the last year. Our aim in the present manuscript is to provide a systematic review of mental health outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of neonatal and obstetric guidelines addressing symptoms and complications of COVID-19 during pregnancy, mother-to-neonate transmission, Cesarean-section delivery, neonatal prematurity, maternal/neonate mortalities, maternal-neonatal separation, and breastfeeding. We summarize data from 81 mental health studies of pregnant and postpartum women and underscore protective and risk factors identified for perinatal mental health outcomes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Data reviewed here suggest increased psychological symptoms, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms, in pregnant and postpartum women during COVID-19. Our systematic review integrates the most current obstetric and neonate guidelines, along with perinatal mental health outcomes associated with COVID-19, highlighting the best available data for the care of women and their neonates amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Iyengar, Jaiprakash, Haitsuka, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.674194","20210712","COVID-19; maternal; mental health; perinatal; postpartum; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15908,""
"INteractive Virtual Expert-Led Skills Training: A Multi-Modal Curriculum for Medical Trainees","<b>Background:</b> Internationally, pediatric depression and suicide are significant issues. Additionally, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric mental health needs are rising astronomically. In light of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatrist (CAP) subspecialist shortages in the United States (US), there is an increasing call for primary care physicians in Family Medicine and Pediatrics to address an increasingly broad variety of patient needs. Here we report on the development and preliminary evaluation of medical student and resident perceptions on the ""INteractive Virtual Expert-led Skills Training"" (INVEST) medical education curriculum, a virtual synchronous CAP curriculum employing active learning strategies, including expert-led discussion and video modeling, and discussion designed to meet those priorities. <b>Methods:</b> In a standardized 60-min training format, our curriculum leverages audience response system polling, video modeling of key clinical skills, and interactive discussion with an expert subspecialist, over a virtual video conferencing platform. The primary educational strategy relies on use of video modeling to demonstrate best practice with CAP led group discussion to solidify and explain important concepts. Five waves of medical students and residents (N = 149) participated in the INVEST curriculum and completed pre- and post-training surveys regarding knowledge and comfort in the management of pediatric patients with depression and suicidality. <b>Results:</b> Trainee participants reported significant positive gains in perceived likelihood of encountering pediatric suicidality as well as knowledge/comfort with depression screening and suicidality assessment in a primary care setting. Across some competency areas, there was an effect of medical learner level. Learners at lower levels generally reported the highest benefit. Medical students reported significant increases in their comfort interpreting and discussing positive depression screens and evidenced the greatest relative benefit in comfort with discussing suicidality. <b>Conclusion:</b> To our knowledge, INVEST is the first fully virtual, multimodal curriculum led by expert CAP subspecialists. Our findings suggest that INVEST shows promise for equipping medical learners with baseline knowledge for caring for patients with pediatric depression and suicidality. This synchronous, virtually delivered curriculum allows for critical training delivered to diverse medical learners regardless of geographic location, a particular benefit during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Curtin, Downs, Hunt, Coleman, Enneking, McNally Keehn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.671442","20210712","adolescent; depression; medical education; primary care; suicidality; underserved","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15909,""
"Impact of SARS-CoV-2-Pandemic on Mental Disorders and Quality of Life in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","<b>Background/Objective:</b> Covid-19 pandemic may affect mental health and quality of life (QoL) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We assessed changes in anxiety and depression, quality of life (QoL) and self-described impact of Covid-19 in patients with PAH during the Covid-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This study included 152 patients with PAH from two German referral centers. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D) at two different timepoints before and during the Covid-19 pandemic with a median of 232 days between baseline and follow-up. QoL was assessed using EQ-5D and emPHasis-10. Perceived impact of Covid-19 and related regulations and measures were assessed using a set of specific questions and statements. <b>Results:</b> More than two thirds of patients had an unsuspicious HADS-A and HADS-D. Median scores did not differ from baseline for both HADS-A and HADS-D (<i>p</i> = 0.202; <i>p</i> = 0.621). Overall, no significant changes in HADS-A or HADS-D categories from baseline to follow up were observed (<i>p</i> = 0.07; <i>p</i> = 0.13). QoL did not change between baseline and follow-up. The Covid-19 pandemic had little impact on access to medical care and established PAH therapy. Patients were in agreement with governmental measures and regulations and felt sufficiently safe. <b>Conclusion:</b> First waves of Covid-19 pandemic had little impact on anxiety, depression and QoL in patient with PAH.

"Psychological Distress Among Health Care Workers in Health Facilities of Mettu Town During COVID-19 Outbreak, South West Ethiopia, 2020","<b>Background:</b> During any of the infectious disease outbreak, health care workers were at increased risk of being infected, and psychological distress was a common phenomenon. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the psychological distress related to COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Mettu town. <b>Methods:</b> A cross sectional study was conducted from May 1-15, 2020 using convenient sampling techniques among 127 health care providers during COVID-19 pandemic in the Mettu town. Self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information. Depression and anxiety were evaluated as subscales from the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Psychological distress related to COVID-19 was measured using the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Data analysis were done using SPSS version 24. Chi-square test was used to find the association between the outcome and demographic variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the significance of the association at <i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.05. <b>Result:</b> Using IES-R scale, 40.2% of the participants reported to have the symptoms of psychological distress. The majority of the participants reported mild psychological distress (37%) followed by moderate psychological distress (29%). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of psychological distress were found to be higher among health care providers who reported to have depressive symptoms, and those who used alcohol, khat and tobacco in the past 3 months shows a significant association with psychological distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had exerted major psychological distress on health care providers.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Traumatic Stressors on Mental Health: Is COVID-19 a New Trauma Type","COVID-19 is a new type of trauma that has never been conceptually or empirically analyzed in our discipline. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 as traumatic stress on mental health after controlling for individuals' previous stressors and traumas. We utilized a sample of (N = 1374) adults from seven Arab countries. We used an anonymous online questionnaire that included measures for COVID-19 traumatic stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and cumulative stressors and traumas. We conducted hierarchical multiple regression, with posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety as dependent variables. In the first step, in each analysis, we entered the country, gender, age, religion, education, and income as independent variables (Kira, Traumatology 7(2):73-86, 2001; Kira, Torture, 14:38-44, 2004; Kira, Traumatology, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1037/trm0000305). In the second step, we entered cumulative stressors and traumas as an independent variable. In the third step, we entered either COVID-19 traumatic stressors or one of its subtypes (fears of infection, economic, and lockdown) as an independent variable. Finally, we conducted structural equation modeling with PTSD, depression, and anxiety as predictors of the latent variable mental health and COVID-19 as the independent variable. Results indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stressors, and each of its three subtypes, were unique predictors of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Thus, COVID-19 is a new type of traumatic stress that has serious mental health effects.

"Moving Beyond Narcan: A Police, Social Service, and Researcher Collaborative Response to the Opioid Crisis","The opioid crisis is the most persistent, long-term public health emergency facing the United States, and available evidence suggests the crisis has worsened during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Naloxone is an effective overdose response that saves lives, but the drug does not address problematic drug use, addiction, or the underlying conditions that lead to overdoses. The opioid crisis is at its core a multidisciplinary, multisystem problem, and an effective response to the crisis requires collaboration across those various systems. This paper describes such a collaborative effort. <i>The Tempe First-Responder Opioid Recovery Project</i> is a multidisciplinary partnership that includes police officers, social workers, substance use peer counselors, public health professionals, police researchers, and drug policy/harm reduction researchers. The project, 10Ã‚Â months underway, trained and equipped Tempe (AZ) police officers to administer Narcan. In addition, a 24/7 in-person ""Crisis Outreach Response Team"" rapidly responds to any suspected overdose and offers follow-up support, referrals, and services to the individual (and loved ones) for up to 45Ã‚Â days after the overdose. We present preliminary project data including interviews with project managers, counselors, and police officers, descriptions of Narcan administrations in the field, and aggregate data on client service engagement. These data highlight the complexity of the opioid crisis, the collaborative nature of the Tempe project, and the importance of initiating a multidisciplinary, comprehensive response to effectively deal with the opioid problem.","White, Perrone, Watts, Malm","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-021-09625-w","20210712","Collaborative response; Naloxone; Opioid crisis; Police","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15913,""
"Risk and protective factors for psychological distress during COVID-19 in Israel","The purpose of the present study was to identify the protective and risk factors related to psychological distress during COVID-19 in an Israeli sample. An online survey was administered from April 19 to May 2, 2020, while a strict lockdown was in place. Participants were recruited by snowball sampling. Psychological distress was evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Risk and protective factors for psychological distress were assessed on the Multi-dimensional Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the coping strategies (COPE), the Life Orientation Test (LOT), and the Gratitude questionnaire. Out of the 655 valid questionnaires collected (from participants ranging in age from 18 to 86, 246 males, 409 females), 138 (21.3%) were positive for moderate to very severe depression and 87 (13.2%) for moderate to extremely severe anxiety. Participants who were screened for depression and anxiety were more likely to be women and young adults (18-24). After adjusting statistically for gender, age, and socioeconomic status, depression and anxiety remained significantly associated with both emotion-focused (PHQ-ÃŽÂ² =.437, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001, GAD-ÃŽÂ²=.441, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001) and problem-focused (PHQ-ÃŽÂ² =-.219, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001, GAD-ÃŽÂ²=-.143, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001) coping strategies, as well as on the social support (PHQ-ÃŽÂ² =-.167, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001, GAD-ÃŽÂ²=-.155, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001), life orientation (GAD-ÃŽÂ²=-.09, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001), and gratitude scales (PHQ-ÃŽÂ² =-.07, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Levels of anxiety and depression were generally associated with gender (women), age (younger population), socioeconomic status (low), and an emotion-focused strategy as risk factors. A problem-focused strategy, social support, life orientation, and gratitude served as protective factors above and beyond personal background.","Oryan, Avinir, Levy, Kodesh, Elkana","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02031-9","20210712","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping strategies; Depression; Life orientation; Protective factor; Psychological distress; Risk factor; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15914,""
"Depth-wise dense neural network for automatic COVID19 infection detection and diagnosis","Coronavirus (COVID-19) and its new strain resulted in massive damage to society and brought panic worldwide. Automated medical image analysis such as X-rays, CT, and MRI offers excellent early diagnosis potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy to fight against COVID-19. However, the identification of COVID infected lungs X-rays is challenging due to the high variation in infection characteristics and low-intensity contrast between normal tissues and infections. To identify the infected area, in this work, we present a novel depth-wise dense network that uniformly scales all dimensions and performs multilevel feature embedding, resulting in increased feature representations. The inclusion of depth wise component and squeeze-and-excitation results in better performance by capturing a more receptive field than the traditional convolutional layer; however, the parameters are almost the same. To improve the performance and training set, we have combined three large scale datasets. The extensive experiments on the benchmark X-rays datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by achieving 96.17% in comparison to cutting-edge methods primarily based on transfer learning.","Qayyum, Razzak, Tanveer, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04154-5","20210712","COVID19; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15915,""
"Mental health difficulties in students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms and students without suspected COVID-19 symptoms: A cross-sectional comparative study during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Mental health problems are taking a heavy toll on students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to compare the level of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and, fear of COVID-19 between students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms and students without any suspected symptoms during the pandemic in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted online among Bangladeshi students from May to July 2020. Anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, PTSS, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, the Impact of Event Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale, respectively. College and University students were the participants of the study. Among 3777 students, 1259 had suspected COVID-19 symptoms and 2518 had no suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Students who experienced suspected COVID-19 symptoms had higher prevalence (moderate to severe) of depressive symptoms (61.15% vs. 47.62%), anxiety symptoms (44.96% vs. 36.97%), and PTSS (48.3% vs. 39.75%) compared to those who had no such symptoms. The study identified having suspected COVID-19 symptoms as a significant associated factor for anxiety symptoms (ÃŽÂ²1'=1.39; 95% CI: 1.03-1.74), depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²1'=1.88; 95% CI: 1.43-2.32), PTSS (ÃŽÂ²1'=3.66; 95% CI: 2.66-4.65) and fear of COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²1'=0.48; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.94). Students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms thought more that they would be better off dead, or of hurting themselves (P&lt;.01) and felt more afraid as if something awful might happen (P&lt;.01) than their counterparts. Mental health difficulties are more prevalent among students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms than the students without having such symptoms.

This was cross sectional survey, that targeted 1011 Egyptians aged 18 years and above, from 24 governorates, during the period from 7 January 2021, to 30 March 2021. Using a convenient sampling technique, the data were collected through an online self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was composed of two main sections, that involved sociodemographic and health related factors, intentions, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. The mean age of participants was 29.35 Ã‚Â± 10.78 years, (16.6 %) of them had COVID-19. (54%) of respondents, reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and 21% of them reported vaccine non-acceptance while (27.1%) of participants preferred receiving Pfizer vaccine. (51.8%) of the respondents expressed strong worries about unforeseen effects of the vaccine which was associated with younger age groups, married, females, absence of history of allergy to food or drugs, perceived susceptibility to COVID 19 and never having flu vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with female sex, urban residence, university/post graduate, married respondents, those never had flu vaccine, and those did not have confidence in the ability of health system to control the epidemic. Female sex, urban residence and having concerns about unforeseen effects were predictors for vaccine hesitancy and vaccine non-acceptance. The observed high level of worries about unforeseen effects of COVID-19 vaccines and widespread vaccine hesitancy amongst Egyptians and its predictors should be considered during implementation of public health intervention campaigns to change negative attitudes and improve acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Egypt.","Omar, Hani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.06.019","20210712","COVID-19 vaccine; Egyptians; Intentions; Negative attitude","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15919,""
"Nurses' pandemic lives: A mixed-methods study of experiences during COVID-19","The US healthcare settings and staff have been stretched to capacity by the COVID-19 pandemic. While COVID-19 continues to threaten global healthcare delivery systems and populations, its impact on nursing has been profound. This study aimed to document nurses' immediate reactions, major stressors, effective measures to reduce stress, coping strategies, and motivators as they provided care during COVID-19. Mixed-methods, cross sectional design. Participants responded to objective and open-ended questions on the COVID-19 Nurses' Survey. The survey, was sent to nurses employed in health care settings during the pandemic; 110 nurses participated. Immediate reactions of respondents were nervousness and call of duty; major stressors were uncertainty, inflicting the virus on family, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and protocol inconsistencies. Effective measures to reduce stress identified were financial incentives and mental health support. Most frequently used coping strategies were limiting televised news about the virus, talking with family and friends, and information, Motivators to participate in future care included having adequate PPE and sense of duty. Bivariate analysis of outcomes by age group, education, work setting, and marital status was performed. Nurse respondents with higher advanced degrees had significantly less fear than those with BSN-only degrees (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05).Of respondents who were married/living with a partner, 85.9% listing ""uncertainty about when the pandemic will be under control"" as a major stressor (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05), while 62.8% of those who were single/divorced/widowed (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .015) did so. Further, 75% of respondents working in critical care listed ""mental health services"" as important (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .054). Four major qualitative themes emerged: What is going on here?; How much worse can this get?; What do I do now?; What motivates me to do future work? The study found nurses were motivated by ethical duty to care for patients with COVID-19 despite risk to self and family, leaving nurses vulnerable to moral distress and burnout.

"Moderating effect of people-oriented public health services on depression among people under mandatory social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in China","Public health measures, such as social isolation, are vital to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but such measures may increase the risk of depression. Thus, this study examines the influencing and moderating factors of depressive symptoms among individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data from people under mandatory home or centralized social isolation in Shenzhen, China, from February 28 to March 6, 2020. The perceived risk of infection with COVID-19, perceived tone of media coverage, perceived quality of people-oriented public health services, and their depressive symptoms were assessed. Three rounds of stepwise multiple regression were performed to examine the moderating effects after controlling various variables, such as demographics, duration and venue of mandatory social isolation, infection and isolation status of family, time spent on COVID-related news, and online social support. Among the 340 participants, 57.6% were men, the average age was 35.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.37), and 55.6% held a bachelor's degree or above. Individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation generally reported low levels of depressive symptoms. Perceived susceptibility to infection was relatively low, whereas perceived tone of media coverage was mainly positive. In terms of perceived quality of public health services, 12 (3.5%), 103 (30.3%), and 225 (66.2%) participants reported low, medium, and high quality of people-oriented services, respectively. Perceived susceptibility was positively associated with depression, whereas perceived tone of media coverage was negatively associated. The quality of people-centered public health services moderated the association between perceived risk and depressive symptoms and between perceived tone of media coverage and depressive symptoms. This study revealed the depressive symptoms among individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted that frontline public health workers play a critical role in protecting public mental health.","Cao, Wang, Wang, Hall, Wu, Wu, Ma, Tucker, Lv","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11457-6","20210712","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Mental health; Public health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15922,""
"The impact of COVID-19 related lockdown measures on self-reported psychopathology and health-related quality of life in German adolescents","The impact of school-closings on adolescents' mental health and well-being in the management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is subject to ongoing public debate. Reliable data to inform a balanced discussion are limited. Drawing on a large ongoing multi-site project in Germany, we assessed differences in self-reported psychopathology in a matched convenience-sample of adolescents assessed pre- (November 26, 2018 to March 13, 2020; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°324) and post the first lockdown (March 18, 2020 to August 29, 2020; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°324) early 2020 in Germany. We found no evidence for an increase in emotional and behavioral problems, depression, thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts, eating disorder symptoms, or a decrease in general health-related quality of life. Reported suicide plans significantly decreased from 6.14 to 2.16%. Similarly, conduct problems decreased in the post-lockdown period. Family risk-factors did not moderate these findings. The influence of socioeconomic status on emotional and behavioral problems as well as depression decreased during the lockdown. Based on the present findings, the first school-closing in Germany had no immediate and severe impact on adolescents' well-being. However, caution is warranted as our data covers a fairly small, affluent sample over a limited time-span and long-term consequences cannot be ruled out.","Koenig, Kohls, Moessner, Lustig, Bauer, Becker, Thomasius, Eschenbeck, Diestelkamp, GillÃƒÂ©, Hiery, Rummel-Kluge, Kaess, Kaess, Bauer, Moessner, Koenig, Bonnet, Hammon, Lustig, Richter, Bertsch, Brunner, Feldhege, Gallinat, Parzer, Sander, Thomasius, Diestelkamp, Schulz, Rummel-Kluge, Baldofski, Kohls, Peter, Rogalla, Klemm, Eschenbeck, GillÃƒÂ©, Lehner, Becker, Hiery, Karl, Salize, Voss, Luntz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01843-1","20210711","Adolescents; COVID-19; Germany; Lockdown; Psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15923,""
"Clinical Course of Migraine during Strict Quarantine due to SARS-CoV-2: Effect of Psychiatric Comorbidities in a Clinical Cohort","During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression. This study sought to establish the probability of migraine progression by comparing data from week 0 with week 12 of quarantine. A retrospective cohort study. Three hundred ten patients were included, 238 with episodic migraine and 33 with chronic migraine; they all completed a self-administered questionnaire with demographic, clinical, and psychiatric symptom information. A multivariate statistical analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with the progression of migraine. This study demonstrated a 22.5% progression probability from episodic migraine to chronic migraine with an RR 2.7 and CI (1.92-3.95, p &lt; 0.001). The increase in depression scores (p &lt; 0.005), anxiety (p &lt; 0.001), and alteration in sleep quality (p &lt; 0.003) were associated with the worsening of migraine.

"The evolution and social determinants of mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Luxembourg","Studies have been showing a negative impact of pandemic control measures on mental health. However, few studies assessed these effects longitudinally during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goals of this study were to explore whether differential effects of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health could be observed by sex and age in a Luxembourgish nationally representative sample during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether there are differences in risk and protective factors longitudinally at two assessment times. A total of 1,756 respondents aged 18 years and older (50.74% women) reported sociodemographic and socio-economic characteristics, depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness. Women and younger respondents reported higher rates of severe depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting higher vulnerability to the pandemic control measures. This study contributes to the investigation of mental health consequences of the pandemic and the pandemic control measures, particularly related to shifts in care task responsibilities, gender and socio-economic inequalities, as well as younger groups' uncertainty about the future.","Ribeiro, SchrÃƒÂ¶der, KrÃƒÂ¼ger, Leist","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114090","20210711","Anxiety; Depression; Loneliness; Pandemic control measures; Sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15925,""

"Maternal thoughts of self-harm and their association with future offspring mental health problems","Depression and self-harm are leading causes of disability in young people, but prospective data on how maternal depression and self-harm thoughts contribute to these outcomes, and how they may interact is lacking. The study sample consisted of 8,425 mothers and offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an ongoing birth cohort study. Exposures were maternal self-harm ideation and depression measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, collected at eleven time points over the period 18 weeks' gestation to 18 years post-partum. Outcomes were offspring past-year major depressive disorder and lifetime self-harm assessed at age 24. Nearly one-fifth (16.7%) of mothers reported thoughts of self-harm on at least one of the eleven assessment points. The frequency of maternal self-harm ideation was related to both outcomes in a dose-response manner. Young adults whose mothers had self-harm ideation on 5-11 occasions were over three times more likely (Odds ratio (OR), 3.32; 95% CI, 1.63-6.76) to be depressed and over 1.5 times as likely (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.73, 3.29) to have self-harmed than their peers whose mothers had never reported self-harm thoughts. Maternal self-harm thoughts remained associated with both offspring outcomes independent of maternal depression, and no evidence was found for an interaction between the two exposures. Clinicians collecting data on maternal depression may consider paying attention to questions about self-harm ideation in assessments. Examining accumulated maternal self-harm ideation over time may provide insights into which children are most at risk for later self-harm and depression.","Paul, Kwong, Moran, Pawlby, Howard, Pearson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.058","20210711","ALSPAC; COVID-19; Child development; Longitudinal studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15927,""
"Quantifying the mental health burden of the most severe covid-19 restrictions: A natural experiment","The COVID-19 pandemic, and the restrictions required to halt spread of the infection, are associated with increased population burden of moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. The aim was to quantify the mental health burden of the most severe COVID-19 related restrictions. A natural experiment in which differences between Australian states and territories in the severity of restrictions for pandemic control, divided the population. People in Victoria experienced the most severe, and people in all other states and territories less severe or negligible restrictions. Data were collected in national, anonymously completed, online surveys (in April and in July / August 2020) of adults in Australia. Outcomes were, in the previous fortnight, experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥10); or symptoms of generalised anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale 7 score Ã¢â€°Â¥10). In total, 23,749 eligible respondents contributed complete data. There were no differences in the population burden of mental health problems between Victoria and the other states and territories at Survey One. By Survey Two prevalence rates of clinically significant depressive (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.96; 95% CI 1.62; 2.37) and anxiety (aOR 1.87; 95%CI 1.53; 2.29) symptoms were substantially and significantly higher in Victoria than in other states and territories. Online surveys are less accessible to some groups of people. The data are self-report and not diagnostic. The most severe COVID-19 restrictions are associated with near double the population prevalence of moderate to severe depressive and generalised anxiety symptoms.","Fisher, Tran, Hammarberg, Nguyen, Stocker, Rowe, Sastri, Popplestone, Kirkman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.060","20210711","Mental health; Population burden; Severe COVID-19 restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15928,""
"A systematic review of the prevalence of anxiety among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on the mental health of population worldwide. This study was conducted to systematically review the existing literature to identify the individuals at higher risk of anxiety with a view to provide targeted mental health services during this outbreak. In this study, the studies focusing on anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar from the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic to February 2021. 103 studies constituting 140732 people included in the review. The findings showed that anxiety prevalence was 27.3% (95% CI, 23.7%; 31.2%) among general population while the prevalence in COVID-19 patients was 39.6% (95% CI, 30.1%; 50.1%). Anxiety was significantly higher among females and older adults (pÃ¢â€°Â¤0.05). In addition Europe revealed the highest prevalence of anxiety 54.6% (95% CI, 42.5%; 66.2%) followed by America 31.5% (95% CI, 19%; 47.5%) and Asia 28.3% (95% CI, 20.3%; 38%). In the general population the highest prevalence of anxiety was in Africa 61.8% (95% CI, 57%-66.4%) followed by America 34.9% (95% CI, 27.7%-42.9%), Europe 30.7% (95% CI, 22.8%-40%) and Asia 24.5% (95% CI, 20.7%-28.9%).

"IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC UPON PATIENTS WITH BURNING MOUTH SYNDROME","The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in the daily life of people, with a particularly relevant impact upon certain groups of individuals that have difficulties in facing stress. A study is made of the impact of the pandemic upon patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). A total of 40 patients with BMS diagnosed in the Unit of Oral Medicine (University of Murcia, Spain) were included. In all cases the study comprised a standardized clinical interview by the same professional and an exploration of the oral cavity. The first visit took place before the pandemic and consisted of the evaluation of anxiety (Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS]), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]) and sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), while the second visit took place one and a half months after the start of lockdown due to the pandemic in Spain. The study sample consisted of 36 women (90%) and four men (10%) aged between 39-86 years. Statistically significant differences were recorded between the two visits in terms of anxiety (p&lt;0.001), sleep quality (p&lt;0.001) and pain intensity (p&lt;0.001).

"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health, financial worries, and perceived organizational support among people living with disabilities in Canada","Individuals with physical or mental health disabilities may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 on their health and employment. We examined COVID-19-related concerns for health, finances, and organizational support among workers with no disability, a physical, mental health, or both physical and mental health disability, and factors associated with COVID-19 perceptions. An online, cross-sectional survey was administered to a sample of Canadians in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions asked about COVID-19 perceptions, demographics (gender, age, education), work context (e.g., sector, contract work) and employment conditions (e.g., job stress, control, accommodation needs). Descriptive, multivariable, and nested regression analyses examined factors associated with COVID-19 perceptions. A total of 3066 participants completed the survey. Workers with both a physical and mental health disability reported significantly greater health and financial concerns and less organizational support than those with no disability. Workers with a physical disability reported more health concerns and those with a mental health disability reported more financial concerns and less organizational support. Respondents with disabilities also reported significant differences in employment conditions (e.g., more contract work, stress, unmet accommodation needs) than those with no disability. Employment conditions were consistently significant predictors of COVID-19 perceptions and attenuated the significance of disability type in analyses. Concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on one's health, finances, and organizational support reflected existing disability inequities in employment conditions and highlight the importance of creating more inclusive employment opportunities for people living with physical and mental health disabilities.","Gignac, Shahidi, Jetha, Kristman, Bowring, Cameron, Tonima, Ibrahim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101161","20210711","COVID-19; Employment; Mental health disabilities; Physical disabilities; Work conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-13","",15931,""

Thoracic oncologic patients who underwent these therapeutic changes in our center during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave were included. Their quality of life was assessed using the Quality of Life Questionnaire-30, their psychological state by the Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) scale. We also reported the preferred administration schedule, as well as adverse events. Thirty patients were included. The overall quality of life was preserved. Rates on HAD scale were low. Tolerance was acceptable. In majority, patients preferred the new procedure. They had a significantly better quality of life compared to those who preferred the old one.
