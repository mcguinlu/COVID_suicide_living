"The Effects of Long COVID-19, its Severity, and the Need for Immediate Attention: Analysis of Clinical Trials and Twitter data","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The infection pathway follows symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and severe cases that lead to hospitalization, emergency life support, and even death. Identifying the disease progression and predicting patient outcomes early, precisely predicting the possibility of long-term adverse events through effective modeling, and use of real-world data such as longitudinal clinical trial data, electronic health records data, and health insurance data are of immense importance to effective treatment, resource allocation, and prevention of severe adverse events (SAE) of grades four or five. The main goal of the study is threefold. Firstly, we raise awareness about the different clinical trials that are being conducted concurrently on Long covid-19, and how these are beneficial. Secondly, we analyze the recent tweets on Long haul covid-19 and give an overview of the sentiments of the opinion of the people. Finally, we analyze the sentiment scores and find if they are associated with the demographics of the tweeters via a negative binomial regression model. The trials were selected with long Covid-19 available in ClinicalTrials.Gov. Also, the tweets obtained with the term #long covid-19 consisted of 8436 tweets. We utilized the NRC Emotion Lexicon method for sentiment analysis is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive) (11). We obtained a matrix of sentiment scores, as well as retweet counts and favorite counts which were analyzed. We regressed the retweet counts and the favorite counts with the sentiment scores and find if they are associated with the emotions and sentiments of the tweeters via a negative binomial regression model since the outcome variable is count data. Our results find that there are two types of clinical trials (a total of 298) being conducted 1)observational and b) interventional. The details about enrollment, time to completion, clinical trial phases, etc., are discussed. Sentiment analysis with the NRC method of the tweets shows that there are both positive and negative sentiments. The retweet counts and favorite counts are associated with the sentiments and emotions such as disgust, joy, sadness, surprise, trust, negative, positive, etc. Finally, to conclude we need resources, and further research needs to be conducted in this area of long Covid-19.","Arinjita Bhattacharyya; Anand Seth; Shesh Rai","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.13.22279833","20220914","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37500,""
"Assessing the Impacts of COVID-19 and Social Isolation on Mental Health in the United States of America","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world at large with over 500 million cases and over 6 million deaths reported thus far. Of those, over 85 million cases and 1 million deaths have occurred in the United States of America (USA). The mental health of the general population has been impacted by several aspects of the pandemic including lockdowns, media sensationalism, social isolation, and spread of the disease. In this paper, we examine the effect that social isolation and COVID-19 infection and related death had on the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general population of the USA in a state-by-state multiple time-series analysis. Vector Error Correction Models are estimated and we subsequently evaluated the coefficients of the estimated models and calculated their impulse response functions for further interpretation. We found that variables related to COVID-19 overall led to an increase both anxiety and depression across the studied period, while variables related to social isolation had a varied effect depending on the state being considered. Both conclusions have important implications for future pandemics.","Alexander Fulk; Raul Saenz-Escarcega; Hiroko Kobayashi; Innocent Maposa; Folashade Agusto","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.09.22277383","20220914","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37501,""
"THE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL-BASED EXERCISE MODEL VIA TELEREHABILITATION in PATIENTS with INFLAMMATORY and NON-INFLAMMATORY RHEUMATIC DISEASES: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the patients with rheumatic disease in the biopsychosocial perspective have been adversely affected by social isolation, uncertainty, and the thought that their chronic disease will worsen and increase in their symptoms. ACR/EULAR (American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism) defnes recommendations about continuing current pharmacotherapy and the signifcance of the biopsychosocial approach and exercise for patients with rheumatic diseases during a COVID-19 infection 1, 2. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the biopsychoso-cial exercise performed by telerehabilitation on biopsychosocial status, general health status, and anxiety-depression levels in the patients with infammatory and non-infammatory rheumatic diseases. Methods: Fourteen patients with infammatory rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis: 4;ankylosing spondylitis: 4;sjogren's syndrome: 3;polymyalgia rheumatica: 2;and vasculitis: 1) and eight patients with non-infammatory rheumatic diseases (fbromyalgia: 6;and osteoarthritis: 2) performed a biopsychoso-cial-based exercise model (named as 'Bilissel Egzersiz Terapi Yaklasimi'-(BETY) in original;'Cognitive Exercise Therapy Approach' in English) via telerehabilita-tion continued for three sessions per week for 12 months 3. Outcome measures were Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire (BETY-BQ) 4. All outcomes were measured baseline and at the 12th month. The Wilcoxon's test was used for statistical analysis. Results: All of the 22 patients were female. The mean age was 57.4 and 55.8 years in the infammatory and non-infammatory rheumatic diseases groups respectively, and they had a mean BMI of 25.9 and 25.3 kg/m2. There was no signifcant difference by time for HAQ score (p = 0.125), HADS anxiety and depression (p = 0.916 and p = 0.663, respectively), and BETY-BQ score (p = 0.753) between the baseline and at the 12th month follow-up in the patients with infammatory rheumatic diseases. Similarly, in the patients with non-in-fammatory rheumatic diseases, there was no signifcant difference by time for HAQ score (p = 0.546), HADS anxiety and depression (p = 0.343 and p = 0.527, respectively), and BETY-BQ score (p = 0.068) between the baseline and at the 12th month follow-up. Conclusion: This study showed that biopsychosocial-based exercise through real-time telerehabilitation was able to maintain their conditions before pandemic in biopsychosocial status, general health, and anxiety-depression levels on the patients with infammatory and non-infammatory rheumatic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic period in one-year follow-up.","Nacar, N.

"FOOD COMMUNITIES","Background: In recent years the focus on healthy food and lifestyle has become a more important part of everyday life for many-with or without RMD. Many NGO-initiatives engaging citizens cooking and eating together has seen the light of day;people meet to talk, laugh and have a good time while making a healthy meal. The kitchen is an often discussed topic among the volunteers and members of The Danish Rheumatism Association. 'Simple' tasks as opening a can of beans or cutting bread can be complicated for people with RMDs. The fundamentals of cooking are different for this group of people;hence the idea of communities around 'arthritis friendly' food unfolded during fall 2019. Objectives: The main objective is to create 'food communities' for people with RMDs, helping them to get a better understanding of how to make 'arthritis friendly food', dispel the myth that it is expensive and hard, and to give them inspiration to better working positions with assistive devices-resulting in a healthier lifestyle which is important to keep the infammation low and the quality of life high. Methods: To obtain these objectives, a dietitian is facilitating 6 three hour 'courses' guiding the participants through healthy cooking-each course with a different theme/subject which is introduced through a short presentation. Two volunteers are responsible for booking kitchen facilities (often school kitchens which is free of charge), coordination with the dietitian and making sure everything runs smoothly and that the atmosphere is top-notch. An occupational therapist is joining the group one time to ensure optimal working positions and introducing and demonstrating assistive devices. One of our main goals is to create sustainable and longer lasting (more than 6 facilitated courses) communities, which is why an important part of the volunteer's responsibility is to initiate a talk about the opportunity of meeting without a dietitian. The 6 facilitated courses aim to give the group the ability to fnd recipes (provided by DRA) and being comfortable cooking with ingredients that the average Dane might not use very often. Furthermore, our assumption is that the group creates social bonds and therefore an interest in keeping these relations. Results: About twenty groups all around Denmark has been a part of the course so far. The feedback from the participants is extremely good-they feel they are learning in an inspiring environment while having a great time with their new acquaintances. Unfortunately, only one of the groups has become a community that exists after the facilitated courses. One of the reasons is, without a doubt, that most of the groups have been affected by different Covid-19 restrictions which has had an impact on the level of social bonding and feeling of ownership. But most participants feel that the dietitian is crucial for further engagement. Conclusion: The concept has been very successful in terms of creating a course that imparts useful knowledge about 'arthritis friendly' food and lifestyle for people with RMD's. It seems we need to make corrections to create the basis for sustainable communities;small changes that helps the group visualizing how to overcome the challenge of the absence of a dietitian, the logistics of grocery shopping for a group etc. We plan to leave out the dietitian from the ffth of the six courses to prepare the group to establish their own 'food community' with lots of healthy food, learning experiences and high spirit.","Del Pin, P.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.5012","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:135, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37503,""
"SARILUMAB in PATIENTS with RELAPSING POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA: A PHASE 3, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL (SAPHYR)","Background: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is elevated in patients with active polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and is associated with disease activity, relapse and severity. Clinical trials with IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) inhibitors in PMR showed higher remission rates and reduced glucocorticoid (GC) use vs GC alone.1-4 Objectives: The SAPHYR study (NCT03600818) assessed the efficacy and safety of sarilumab (SAR), a fully human anti IL-6Ra monoclonal antibody, with a 14 week (wk) GC taper in patients with steroid resistant active PMR who fared on =7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent. Methods: Patients were randomized (1:1) to 52 wks of treatment with SAR 200 mg every 2 wks (Q2W) + 14 wk GC tapered regimen (SAR arm) OR placebo Q2W + 52 wk GC tapered regimen (comparator arm). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission at wk 52, defned as disease remission by wk 12, absence of disease fare, CRP normalization from wks 12 to 52 and adherence to the per protocol GC taper from wks 12 to 52. Results: The study was terminated early due to protracted recruitment timelines during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in 118 of the intended 280 patients recruited between Oct 2018 and Jul 2020, and 117 were treated (SAR n=59, comparator n=58). The demographics were balanced;patients were primarily female, Caucasian, and a median age of ~70 years (Table 1). Overall, 78 patients completed the treatment (SAR n=42;comparator n=36). Primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were adverse events (AEs;SAR n=7, comparator n=4) and lack of efficacy (SAR n=4, comparator n=9). Sustained remission rate was signifcantly higher in the SAR arm vs the comparator arm (28.3% vs 10.3%;P=0.0193). Results of a sensitivity analysis excluding CRP from the sustained remission defnition was consistent with the primary analysis (31.7% vs 13.8%;P=0.0280). All sustained remission components favored SAR (Figure 1). Patients in the SAR arm were 44% less likely to have a fare after achieving clinical remission vs the comparator arm (16.7% vs 29.3%;HR 0.56;95% CI 0.35-0.90;P=0.0158). The comparator arm required more additional GCs vs the SAR arm, mainly due to PMR fare (median difference in actual and expected cumulative dose 199.5 mg vs 0.0 mg;P=0.0189). The cumulative GC toxicity index scores numerically favored SAR but the difference was not statistically signifcant. PMR activity scores improved in the SAR arm vs the comparator arm (LS mean-15.57 vs-10.27, nominal P=0.0002). Patient reported outcomes (eg, physical and mental health component scores, disability index, etc) favored SAR (Figure 1). Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) was numerically higher in the SAR arm vs the comparator arm (94.9% vs 84.5%) and included neutropenia (15.3%) and arthralgia (15.3%) in the SAR arm, and insomnia (15.5%) in the comparator arm. Conversely, the frequency of serious AEs was higher in the comparator arm vs the SAR arm (20.7% vs 13.6%). No deaths were reported. Conclusion: SAR + 14 wk GC taper demonstrated signifcant efficacy vs the comparator arm in steroid refractory PMR patients, including clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. Safety was consistent with the known safety profile of SAR.","Dasgupta, B.; Unizony, S.; Warrington, K.

"COVID-19 HAD DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS on RA SYMPTOMS and FUNCTION by SEX and AGE: RESULTS from the CANADIAN EARLY ARTHRITIS COHORT (CATCH)","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians with RA faced considerable uncertainty due to greater risk of infection, hospitalization, changing access to RA medications, and very limited access to in-person RA care. Further, to reduce transmission of the virus and COVID-related hospitalizations, stringent mitigation measures were implemented across the country to greatly reduce social contacts including curfews, limits on private gatherings and business closures. Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation efforts in RA. We hypothesized that women and younger adults with RA would report greater impairments in HRQL. Objectives: To compare changes in HRQL prior-to and during the COVID-19 pandemic by sex and age groups in real-world RA patients seen in routine practice settings. Methods: Data were from patients in the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort (CATCH) who completed a study visit in the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Mar 2019 through Feb 2020) and a repeat assessment during the pandemic period (Mar 2020-Jan 2022). RA disease activity was assessed using the RA Flare Questionnaire, a validated patient-reported measure of current RA disease symptoms (pain, stiffness, fatigue) and function (physical, participation). An RA-FQ score = 20 was used to classify RA symptoms consistent with an RA infammatory fare. HRQL was assessed using PROMIS-29 Adult Profiles. We compared changes in mean Physical (PHS) and Mental Health (MHS) scores, and the proportion of patients with impairments in each domain (i.e., scores = 55 for pain interference, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep and =45 for physical function and participation) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic across sex and age groups (&lt;40, 40-64, =65 years). Results: The 938 CATCH participants in the analytic sample with data available at both time periods had a mean (SD) age of 60 (13) and RA symptom duration of 5.8 (3.7) years;72% were women, 88% were white, and 64% reported &gt;high school education. Most (80%) were in CDAI REM/LDA at the most recent visit prior to start of pandemic. The proportion of patients with RA-FQ =20 were similar at both time periods. While physical and emotional RA symptom impacts remained stable in men prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, women reported signifcant increases in anxiety and depression during the pandemic period. Younger RA patients &lt;40 reported increases in depression, and older RA patients (65+) reported increases in anxiety and greater impacts on participation. Conclusion: Our results illustrate that while the proportions of patients with high infammatory disease activity were similar prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed disproportionate impacts on HRQL by sex and age with a higher proportion of women, adults &lt;40, and those =65 years of age experiencing greater impairments in several HRQL domains.","Bartlett, S.

"IMPACT of COVID-19 on the CLINICAL COURSE of GOUT and the OVERALL USAGE of MEDICATION in PATIENTS with GOUT","Background: Data on the course and outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with gout are scarce, as gout is underrepresented in leading COVID-19 and rheumatological Scientific publications [1]. Objectives: To describe clinical changes, quality of life, therapy of gout before and after COVID-19, and the clinical course of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection in the cohort of patients with gout. Methods: In total, 84 males with gout were examined before the pandemic, during COVID-19 (March 2020 to December 2021) and 6 months after SARS-Cov-2 infection. The severity of COVID-19 in our cohort was determined. We conducted a comparative analysis of clinical and laboratory data, Gout Activity Score (GAS), urate-lowering (UST) and symptomatic therapy, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Questionnaire. Statistical difference of qualitative indicators was carried out using the Pearson Chi-square test (<U+03C7>2), quantitative indicators using the Student's or the Wilcoxon test between groups. Results: The mean age (meanÂ±SD) of the study patients was 51.07Â±7.45 years and the disease duration was 9.84Â±6.02 years. Most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with gout exhibited a moderate illness (40.48%), almost every third (28.57%) had mild, 21.43% had severe and 9.52% had critical illness. Comparison of pre-COVID-19 vs 6-month post-COVID-19 data demonstrated an increase of gout fares in preceding 6 months (0.7Â±0.59 vs 4.35Â±2.25, p&lt;0.001), serum uric acid level (5.9Â±1.54 vs 7.62Â±1.99, p&lt;0.01), GAS (3.83Â±0.4 vs 6.1Â±1.63, p&lt;0.01), non-steroidal anti-infammatory drug intake (19.05% vs 72.62%, p&lt;0.001), colchicine (27.38% vs 53.6%, p&lt;0.001), and corticosteroid use (5.95% vs 34.52%, p&lt;0.001), but decreased intake of ULT (88.09% vs 77.38%, p&gt;0.05), SF-36 PCS (43.7 Â± 6.19 vs 36.08Â±6.54, p&lt;0.01) and SF-36 MCS (48.35Â±5.89 vs 40.13Â±6.84, p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: The current study identifed the majority of patients with gout had a moderate course, every ffth had a severe course and 9.52% had a critical course of COVID-19. In the post-COVID-19 period, we found a six-fold increase in gout fares, rising gout activity by 59.3%, more frequent medication use for symptomatic therapy of gout, decreased physical and mental health in the cohort of patients with gout.","Smiyan, S.; Makhovska, O.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4995","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:916, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37506,""
"THE COMPARISON of EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS of RECOVERED COVID-19 PATIENTS with HEALTHY CONTROLS","Background: The epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 patients are currently well characterized. However the subacute and long-term effects of COVID-19 are not clear. Cognitive disturbance is one of the residual effects of COVID-19 infection besides fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, arthralgia, and decline in quality of life. It has been stated that patients with COVID-19 may have cognitive dysfunction, but it still remains unknown whether the COVID-19 infection is associated with cognitive impairment. Objectives: The aims of this study were to compare the executive functions of recovered COVID-19 patients with healthy controls, and to evaluate the relation of the executive functions with sleep quality, emotional status, disease severity, and post COVID-19 duration in these patients. Methods: Twenty-five patients aged 18-60 with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and 25 gender-age matched healthy individuals as a control group participated this study. The executive functions of participants were evaluated by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), Stroop Test-TBAG Form, and N-back test. Data on sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality-Index (PSQI), depression by Beck Depression-Inventory (BDI), anxiety by Worry and Anxiety Questionnaire were collected in all participants. In patients, disease severity, COVID symptoms, and post-covid duration were noted. Data were analyzed by SPSS using Kolmogorov Smirnov test, chi-square test, Student-t test, and Pearson correlation analysis. Results: In terms of WCST;patients' number of trials administered, total errors, and nonperseverative-errors scores were statistically higher;categories achieved and percentage of conceptual-level responses scores were statistically lower than controls (p&lt;0.05). Patients' N-back test scores were statistically lower than controls (p=0.012). BDI, PSQI total, sleep quality, sleep latency, duration of sleep scores were signifcantly different in patients and controls (p&lt;0.05). Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of the disease and there was no signifcant difference between the three groups in terms of WCST, Stroop test, and N-back test (p&gt;0.05). There were negative correlations between WCST-total errors and duration of sleep, WCST-number of trials administered and sleep efficiency, Stroop-number of errors and total PSQI scores. No correlation was found between the executive functions and emotional status of the patients (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, executive functions may be effected in the patients recovered from COVID-19. After COVID-19 infection patients may have sleep problems, and executive dysfunctions may be correlated with sleep disorders in these patients. Since the executive functions were not associated with clinical fndings of COVID-19 infection in this study, we suggest that it is not predicted in which patients executive functions will be impaired. Regardless of the COVID-19 infection severity, executive functions should be considered in the follow-up of these patients.","Cakir, C.; Ulus, Y.; Bilgici, A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4939","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1703-1704, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37507,""
"SEXUALITY, FAMILY PLANNING and MENTAL HEALTH among REPRODUCTIVE-AGE WOMEN with RHEUMATIC DISEASE during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: Women with rheumatic disease are more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction, infertility, depression, and anxiety. The pandemic may have affected these constraints. Objectives: To investigate the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on sexuality, family planning and mental health in a sample of women with rheumatic disease. Methods: Women aged 18-50 with a rheumatic disease and women in an age-matched healthy control group received questionnaires featuring: 1) demographic information, sexual frequency, family planning;2) the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI);3) the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21);and 4) the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). Recruitment took place 3/21-12/21. Patients with rheumatic conditions were recruited at the Vienna University Clinic (AKH) and the control group through social media. Parameters were compared between the patients and the healthy control group, and with data on sexuality from women with rheumatic disease from 2019. Results: A preliminary analysis was conducted with 83 patients with rheumatic disease and 124 healthy controls. The rheumatic disease group exhibited lower levels of stress (6.46 vs. 8.36 p&lt;0.01) and Coronavirus Anxiety (6.27 vs 7.50 p&lt;0.01) than the control group and was less likely to report that the pandemic led to a reduction of their sexual frequency (p&lt;0.01). The control group cited 'stress' frequently the decrease of sexual frequency. The FSFI analysis revealed that patients with rheumatic disease experienced higher levels of pain (p&lt;0.001) during sex than the control group but were more satisfed with their relationships (p&lt;0.05). In comparison to 58 patients with rheumatic conditions, whose data was collected in 2019, the 2021 cohort reported reduced FSFI values in the domains of desire (p&lt;0.01), arousal (p&lt;0.05), lubrication (p&lt;0.05), and orgasms (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Consistent with research on female sexuality during the pandemic among healthy women, we found that patients with rheumatic conditions reported lower FSFI values in 2021, in comparison to 2019. Our fnding that the pandemic had less impact on the patient group than a healthy control group, is consistent with research on MS and IBD patients, who showed surprising resilience in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Puchner, A.; Rosenberg, N.; Valenta, N.; Ritschl, V.; Stamm, T.; Mandl, P.; Aletaha, D.; Rosta, K.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4937","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1703, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37508,""
"CORRELATION between the ATTITUDE of PATIENTS SUFFERING from CHRONIC RHEUMATIC DISEASES TOWARDS REMOTE CONSULTATIONS by RHEUMATOLOGIST and the HEALTH LOCUS of CONTROL","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic telemedicine has become an important and safe means for patients suffering from chronic diseases to control their condition with the assistance of a physician [1]. In order to ensure that treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases is effective, it is important that patients develop a favorable attitude towards telerheumatology [2] as well as disease-related individual behavior, which signifcantly depends on the patients' health locus of control [3]. Objectives: To analyze the attitude of patients suffering from chronic rheumatic diseases towards peculiarities of remote consultations by a rheumatologist and their correlation with health locus of control. Methods: To reveal the patients' attitude towards remote consultations by a rheumatologist, an original questionnaire has been prepared, which contains: reasons for choosing remote consultations, fears about such consultations and their advantages. Health locus of control was evaluated using a Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scale, which consists of three subscales: Internal, Chance, and Powerful Others. Demographical questions and questions related to health are also included in the questionnaire. 207 subjects participated in the study: 177 (85.5 %) women and 30 (14.5 %) men, (Mage=39.4, SD=11.76). The majority of subjects were diagnosed with spondyloarthritis (n=83), connective tissue diseases (n=53), rheumatoid arthritis (n=49), and osteoarthritis (n=20), 42 subjects were diagnosed with some other rheumatic diseases. 111 (53.6%) patients had the previous experience of remote consulting by a rheumatologist. Results: It has been determined that the attitude of patients with rheumatic diseases is related to various demographic characteristics of patients, e.g., gender, etc., and the peculiarities of the disease, e.g., strength of the symptoms, etc. It has been found that patients without experience of remote consultations have more fears about such consultations (p=0.024). When comparing the average of statements revealing a positive attitude M=66.4% with the average of statements revealing a negative attitude M=27.3%, it becomes clear that the overall attitude of subjects toward remote consultations of a rheumatologist is favorable. To assess correlations between positive or negative attitude of patients with rheumatic diseases and health locus of control correlational analysis was performed. The results did not confrm the expected correlations between the positive attitude of patients with the internal locus of control. However, it has been obtained that negative attitude towards remote consultations by a rheumatologist positively correlates with two indicators of health locus of control-Chance (r=0.203, p=0.0001) and Powerful Others (r=0.194, p=0.01), although the said correlation is not strong, but statistically signifcant. Conclusion: The study has revealed the major fears and satisfaction sources related to remote consultations of Lithuanian patients with rheumatic diseases. In addition, it has shown that personal convictions of a patient that health depends on the circumstances and the influence of other people exacerbates the attitude towards remote consultations.","Antinis, D.; Sabaliauskiene, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4831","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1814, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37509,""
"DRIVING IMPROVEMENT in AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS SERVICES: The USE of QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACHES and TOOLS","Background: Quality Improvement (QI) methods have been used in healthcare since the late 1980s across a wide range of healthcare settings. However, in the UK they have not been applied widely within rheumatology including axial Spon-dyloarthritis (axial SpA). In 2017, the UK healthcare regulator, NICE, produced a national clinical guideline for axial SpA, but there was no mechanism to encourage uptake of its recommendations. The National Axial Spondyloarthritis Society created a programme to use QI approaches to help encourage uptake of the Guidelines and act as a catalyst for wider improvement in axial SpA care. Objectives: To encourage service improvement in axial Spondyloarthritis care through the use of quality improvement theory and methods. Methods: In late 2019 six rheumatology departments were selected to participate in the frst cohort. The programme design was underpinned by: A framework for management grounded in systems theory1 A learning system that brings healthcare organisations together2 A set of tools to develop, test and implement changes: the Model for Improvement3. The teams met four times for training in QI methods, plus team-based online coaching. They had time to develop their projects and networking opportunities to share their data and experiences of implementation. We conducted a qualitative review of the programme in year one. We interviewed 31 programme participants and reviewed programme documentation. Results: The review found that: A proven QI framework provides a strong basis to build improvement A competitive programme helps foster motivation and accountability The programme provides the time to use tools to understand the problem and construct improvement aims Measurement is key to understand improvement and to create a story of change Collaboration and engagement is key within the team and with other stakeholders. The teams have: â€¢ Trained community-based physiotherapists, leading to improved rheumatology referrals Implemented an infammatory back pain pathway from primary care Introduced an MRI spine IBP protocol to reduce variation in imaging Established a tertiary referral service which has improved time to diagnosis Implemented mental health interventions for patients and reduced the percentage of patients with abnormal scores Established a pathway for physiotherapy self-referral and reduced Did Not Attend rates Used audit to make the business case for an extended scope practitioner Conclusion: Despite the challenges of posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, a structured QI programme has enabled clinicians to stay engaged and implement projects to reduce diagnostic delay and improve care.","Webb, D.; Barnett, R.; Davies, L.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4749","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:262-263, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37510,""
"IMPACT in PRENATAL EVALUATION of PREGNANT WOMEN with RHEUMATIC DISEASES by the SARS-COV2 PANDEMIC","Background: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an increase in stress, anxiety, and depression has been seen, as well as greater use of substances and a decrease in prenatal care in pregnant women. (1) Women of childbearing age with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) experience greater psychological stress, which can negatively influence behavior. (2) Objectives: This study aims to compare changes in prenatal laboratory and ultrasound tests by trimester, as well as the detection of anxiety and depression in pregnant women with ARDs due to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: This study was carried out on pregnant patients with ARDs from the Pregnancy and Rheumatic Diseases clinic of the rheumatology department of the University Hospital 'Dr. JosÃ© Eleuterio GonzÃ¡lez' during the period from February 2018 to August 2021. Two standardized evaluations of anxiety and depression were carried out using the Inventory of Trait and State Anxiety (IDARE) and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) respectively in the third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal report of alcohol consumption during any trimester of pregnancy, as well as adherence to routine laboratory studies such as structural ultrasound and gesta-tional diabetes screening, was addressed. Positive COVID-19 nasopharynx PCR results were evaluated during pregnancy beginning in the pandemic period (March 2020). The pre-pandemic recruited group was compared with the pandemic group. The comparison of the groups was carried out using the Chi-Square and Fisher tests. A significant value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS v.25 program. Results: 50 pregnant patients with ARDs were recruited, of which 24 were included in the pre-pandemic group and 26 in the pandemic group. Compared with the pre-pandemic group, pregnant women recruited during the pandemic had a statistically signifcant higher positivity for state anxiety (p=0.023), likewise trait anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were detected more frequently, but the difference was not statistically signifcant, a higher rate of adherence to laboratory and cabinet studies was found, being signifcant for laboratories performed in the 1st and 2nd trimesters (0.005 and 0.025 respectively). See Table 1. Conclusion: A higher frequency of positivity for state anxiety was demonstrated in pregnant women with ARDs recruited during the pandemic, as well as higher trait anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation, although this increase was not statistically signifcant. On the other hand, concern about the pandemic and health status could positively influence better adherence to screening and routine studies during pregnancy.","Lujano Negrete, A.

"EXPLORING the IMPACT of the PANDEMIC on ITALIAN RHEUMATIC DISEASE PATIENTS: A PATIENT ADVOCACY SURVEY","Background: Patients with rheumatic diseases show impaired quality of life (QoL): disease activity, comorbidities and treatment-related side effects contributes to decrease physical, emotional, and social functioning. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged health care systems and patients with chronic conditions: hospital and outpatient clinics delayed access, unpredictable changes like non-adherence to medication, but also negative emotions, psychological conditions recognized as risk factors for the poor QoL [1-2]. Objectives: To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Qol of Italian patients with rheumatic diseases in the frst period of the national lockdown. Methods: APMARR (Associazione Nazionale Persone con Malattie Reu-matolgoche e Rare) invited Italian patients and caregivers to participate to an online structured survey in the period March-June 2020. Informed consent was retrieved. The questionnaire, promoted by the patient advocacy website, collected demographics, emotional and healthcare pattern information. Results: 87,44% (N=215) complete questionnaires were retrieved (96.3% patients;3.7% caregivers;87.77% female;2% aged &lt;18 years, 16% aged 18-30 years, 82% aged &gt;31 years;0.53% missing data). Respondents were illustrative of the Patient Advocacy regional distribution (Puglia Region predominant). Rheumatoid arthritis regarded 29% of respondents, ankylosing spondylitis 17%, psoriasis 16%, remaining 38% other rheumatoid diseases. 96% of respondents were employed, 39% of which had to discontinue/change working activity during pandemics. 60% of respondents reported being worried about their disease. The deriving sense of fragility was the main cause of anxiety, which was not controlled even by compliance to the treatment plan (88%). 30% of respondents was worried about virus infection. Irritability, appetite and sleep disorders were also reported: anxiety had effects on irritability (46% sometimes more irritable) and sleep quality (38% always disturbed). GPs visits access was limited (40% considered it absent and 76% had to postpone it). Only 32% of specialist centers provided facilitated patterns of care. Respondents suggested possible solutions to improve QoL during COVID-19 pandemic and over it. Psychologist support was suggested as useful by 44% of respondents to manage therapies and by 56% to effort daily life. The home infusion would be of support according to 44% of respondents (18% already got access to it). Patient Advocacy had a main role in the new care and life context: 80% would consider it useful to participate to and 81% was satisfed by the prompt and continuous support received during pandemics. Conclusion: Similar results as far as distress were reported by Italian and foreign evidence, which demonstrated considerable COVID-19 related psychosocial burden in rheumatic disease patients [3-5]. Potential solutions are also with EULAR recent guidelines, which underlined how psychological interventions were found to reduce pain and fatigue even in difficult-to-treat patients [6] and how mental health needs should be periodically assessed, due to the link between better emotional well-being and better self-management [7]. Besides, the reported picture of reorganised care during pandemic corresponded to the real-world experience of the Italian Regions [8]. New approaches of care like home infusions and telemedicine supported by patient organisations should become routinary and may therefore beneft patients.","Celano, A.; Cafero, D.; Lopatriello, S.; Tedone, F.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4404","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:432, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37512,""
"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS of POST-COVID SYNDROME in PATIENTS with RHEUMATIC DISEASES in the REPUBLIC of TATARSTAN","Background: The management of patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) after a new coronavirus infection (NCI) is an urgent and signifcant problem. Objectives: To study post-COVID manifestations in patients with RD in the Republic of Tatarstan. Methods: From June 2020 to January 2022, 154 cases of NCI with confrmed Sar-sCoV2 PCR and/or X-ray computed tomography (CT) of the lungs in patients with RD were followed up. The study included 100 patients with RA, 36 patients with AS, 18 patients with PsA. RD activity before NCI was low in 56 (36.4%) patients, moderate in 90 (58.4%) patients, and high in 8 (5.2%) patients. Among the patients, 110 (71.5%) were female, 44 (28.5%) were male, the average age was 58 [46;64]. 28% (43) of patients had asymptomatic or mild NCI, 66.2% (102) had moderate NCI, and 5.8% (9) of people had severe NCI. Bilateral polysegmental pneumonia was detected in 111 (72.0%) patients. The results of clinical and laboratory examinations for RD were assessed before and 3 and 6 months after NCI. Patients underwent an in-depth survey 3 and 6 months after undergoing NCI for the presence of various symptoms, including manifestations of asthenia. Additionally, the severity of depression and anxiety was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Hamilton Scale. Results: 90.3% of patients noted the persistence or appearance of symptoms after undergoing NCI, and all of them had a combination of at least 3 different groups of symptoms. The most common asthenic manifestations were in the form of a decrease in the quality of life and working capacity in 85% of patients: signifcant in 47.9% of people, insignifcant-in 38.7% of people. The second most frequent was the inten-sifcation/appearance of pain in the joints-80.5% of the respondents. Strengthening/appearance of muscle pain and/or headache and/or dysautonomia occurred in 47.4%. The appearance/intensifcation of shortness of breath and a decrease in exercise tolerance were noted by 30.5% of the respondents, while there was no connection with the severity of NCI, and half of the patients had a mild course of COVID 19. The appear-ance/intensifcation of chest pain and/or palpitations was noted by 20.8% of people. After 3 months, a decrease in the quality of life, manifestations of depression and anxiety were revealed: 32.2% of people had a mild depressive disorder of moderate severity, 22.3% had clinically expressed anxiety and depression. Six months after the NCI, no abnormalities were detected on the Hamilton scale, and subclinically expressed anxiety/depression on the HADS scale. Conclusion: In most patients with RD, post-covid manifestations persist, primarily due to general constitutional, articular and cognitive symptoms. Manifestations of NCI itself in the form of respiratory and cardiovascular manifestations persist in less than a third of patients.","Shamsutdinova, N.; Lapshina, S.; Mukhamadieva, V.; Abdrakipov, R.; Sukhorukova, E.; Kupkenova, L.; Abdulganieva, D.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.4314","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1695-1696, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37513,""
"INTERVAL HYPOXIC-HYPEROXIC TRAINING in REHABILITATION of PATIENTS with OSTEOARTHRITIS and POST-COVID SYNDROME","Background: Intermittent hypoxia conditioning reduces the levels of infam-matory parameters and cytokines (C-reactive protein, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8), increases the tolerance to acute hypoxia, the functional capacity and improves parameters of respiratory and cardiovascular systems [1-4]. Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency of the interval hypoxic-hyperoxic training (Reoxy therapy) in the rehabilitation of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and post-COVID syndrome. Methods: 36 patients with OA (78% females, age of 43 to 68 years, generalized OA, OA of the knee or hip joints) where included in the randomized placebo-controlled study. Coronavirus infection COVID-19 were diagnosed from 12 to 26 weeks before the study. The main symptoms of post-COVID syndrome were dry cough, smell loss, breathlessness, weakness, fatigue, sleep disorders, cognitive symptoms, memory problems, anxiety, depression, headache, dizziness, joint and muscle pain. All patients were randomized into 3 groups. 13 study group patients received 10 Reoxy therapy procedures, 9 placebo group patients-10 placebo procedures of Reoxy therapy, 14 control group patients-only standard rehabilitation. The patients of all groups underwent 2-week standard rehabilitation program: 10 procedures of electrostatic massage for muscles and periar-ticular tissues, 10 sessions of general magnetic therapy, 10 group sessions of physical exercises with elements of breathing exercises. All patients received NSAIDs and SYSADOA at standard dosages. Intra-articular corticosteroids was not used. The study group patients were breathing hypoxic (FiO2 13-15%) and hyperoxic (FiO2 up to 40%) gas mixture through the mask in the interval mode with biofeedback using device Â«ReOxyÂ» (Ai Mediq S.A., Luxembourg). 10-min hypoxic test (FiO2 12-13%) was performed before the frst and fourth procedures. The duration of 1-4 procedures was 30 min, 5-10 procedures-40 min. The placebo procedures were performed using the mask with the atmospheric air hole. Joint pain and general health on 100-mm VAS, Lequesne and WOMAC indexes, Spielberger-Khanin anxiety test, Beck depression inventory and breath-lessness on Modifed Borg scale were evaluated at baseline and at 2 weeks. Results: After 2 weeks in the study group pain on VAS decreased by 49,6% (p&lt;0,05), Lequesne index-by 39,3% (p&lt;0,05), WOMAC-by 1,4 times (p&lt;0,01), anxiety level on Spielberger-Khanin test-by 40,9% (p&lt;0,05), depression level on Beck depression inventory-by 64,1% (p&lt;0,01), general health on VAS improved by 69,3% (p&lt;0,01). The level of breathlessness on Modifed Borg scale in the study group initially was 2,5Â±0,9 score (moderate-slight breathlessness). After rehabilitation in the study group the level of breathlessness decreased to 0,3Â±0,4 score (extremely slight-no breathlessness). In the study group there were statistically signifcant differences from the placebo group (p&lt;0,05) and the control group (p&lt;0,05) in all parameters. Conclusion: 2-week complex rehabilitation program, including interval hypox-ic-hyperoxic training (Reoxy therapy), reduces pain, breathlessness, depression and anxiety, improves functional status and general health in patients with OA and post-COVID syndrome.","Orlova, E.; Lyamina, N.; Pogonchenkova, I.; Skorobogatykh, N.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.3861","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1071, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37514,""
"COGNITIVE and PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOME in CHILDREN with MULTISYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME FOLLOWING SARS-COV-2 INFECTION","Background: Despite the low rate of neurological defcits following the SARS-COV-2 infection in the pediatric population, children and adolescents who develop multisystem infammatory syndrome (MIS-C) after being infected with SARS-COV-2 are at a higher risk for neurological abnormalities and brain injury, increasing the risk of adverse cognitive and psychiatric outcome. Objectives: Given the increased risk of central nervous system impairment we chose to conduct a prospective study looking at the cognitive and psychosocial outcome of patients with MIS-C. Methods: Our study included 27 of the 29 patients between 2 to 18 years of age (M = 11.1, SD = 4.4) who were treated for MIS-C from the onset of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic until the beginning of May 2021 at the only tertiary care pedi-atric immunology center in Slovenia. We assessed these patients 6 months after diagnosis using the age-appropriate Wechsler intelligence scales and a battery of neuropsychological test measuring attention, executive function, memory and fne motor skills. We also asked parents to report on patients' psychosocial outcome using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. Results: By using Bayesian statistics to take into account parental education and any potential pre-morbid learning difficulties we found no evidence of impairment on measures of intelligence. However, the posterior distribution of scores on neuropsychological measures indicated that a signifcant proportion of patients scored 1SD bellow expected levels on measures of attention (31%), executive function (28%) and visual memory (35%). Increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and attention difficulties were also reported by parents, although their extent did not rise to a clinically signifcant level. Conclusion: The fndings from our cohort suggest that the cognitive and psychosocial outcome of patients with MIS-C is generally favorable, although up to 35% may experience specifc neuropsychological defcits more than 6 months after diagnosis. The most commonly impaired cognitive domains seem to be attention, executive function and visual memory.","Gosar, D.; Zajc Avramovic, M.; Emersic, N.; Å uÅ¡teric, M.; Å Ã¶men, M.

"MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AS A PART of the RHEUMATIC SPECTRUM in COVID-19","Background: Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1), our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is constantly evolving in order to explain the wide range of heterogenic clinical manifestations (2). Nevertheless, limited data are available for the severity and multifactorial causality of musculoskeletal pain in COVID-19 patients (3). Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and intensity of rheumatic pain symptoms-arthralgia and myalgia and their association with anxiety and depression in a cohort of COVID-19 patients, hospitalized at the COVID-19 rheumatology department of the University Hospital St. Marina, Varna, Bulgaria. Methods: In the present single-center cohort study, a prospective analysis was performed among COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized from 1 Oct 2021 to 20 Jan 2022 and self-reported for new-onset of musculoskeletal pain. All 226 patients (age 26-91 years) were treated for moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection confrmed by laboratory tests, including positive antigen test or polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR) test, and imaging modality. Detailed disease history and clinical examination were carried out by a fully certifed rheumatologist. All patients who reported new-onset of musculoskeletal pain during the acute phase of the infection, participated on a voluntary basis in a questionnaire survey, by completed Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for arthralgia and myalgia. The questionnaire form also elicited information on sociodemographic characteristics of the patients. In all patients, infammation and thrombotic biomarkers were assessed. The level of signifcance was set to 0.05. Results: Among all 226 COVID-19 patients with musculoskeletal pain, 46.5% (n =105) were women and 53.5% (n = 121), were men. Mean age was 65.6 years. We found a signifcant correlation of depression and anxiety scales scores with pain intensity (both arthralgia and myalgia), all &lt; 0.001. A multiple regression analysis found that SDS and SAS accounted for signifcant variance in the prediction of muscle pain (ÃŸ = 0.441, p &lt; 0.001;ÃŸ = 0.293, p = 0.003, respectively) while SDS signifcantly predicted joint pain (ÃŸ = 0.341, p = 0.043). On the other hand, musculoskeletal pain does not correlate with any of infammation and thrombotic biomarkers assessed in SARS-CoV-2 patients (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Rheumatic pain manifestations are part of the heterogeneous spectrum of COVID-19 disease. The pain intensity is signifcantly associated with anxiety and depression symptoms and does not correlate with infammation and thrombotic biomarkers.","Bogdanova-Petrova, S.; Georgiev, T.; Dimitrov, S.; Hristova, S.; Shivacheva, T.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.3715","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1688-1689, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37516,""
"INCIDENCE of PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS and FIBROMYALGIA in PATIENTS with RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS and PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS during COVID 19 PANDEMIC: The ROLE of TELEMEDICINE","Background: The management of patients with immuno-rheumatological diseases has profoundly changed during the COVID 19 pandemic and telemedicine has played an important role in the disease follow-up. In addition to monitoring disease activity and any adverse events, especially infectious events, assessing the psychological situation of the patient can be fundamental in particular considering that COVID-19 has also a serious impact on mental health and it has been demonstrated a signifcantly higher incidence of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms especially in younger people Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of depressive disorders, anxiety and fbromyalgia in our patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis during the lockdown period due to the COVID 19 pandemic and validate the use of telemedicine in the clinical management of these patients. Methods: Patients affected by rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis treated with biological disease-modifying drugs were contacted to evaluate the state of health and the presence of any adverse events and a nurse administered the clinimetric questionnaires assessment to evaluate the disease activity, the impact of rheumatic disease on the health status and the presence of anxiety, depression and fbromy-algia. In particular the following scales have been used: The Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID), the Psoriatic arthritis impact of disease (PsAID), Beck Depression Inventory BDI-II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and The Fibromy-algia Rapid Screening Tool questionnaire (FIRST), The VAS scale for the assessment of pain. Patients who reported disease fare-up or adverse events underwent an outpatient visit and during visit Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) and Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) were used. Results: 171 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 129 patients with psoriatic arthritis were enrolled. The incidence of fbromyalgia was increased in the two groups during the lockdown compared to the previous evaluations and in particular in patients with psoriatic arthritis (AR p =0.013, AP p= 0.001).Our analysis did not report signifcant differences between the two groups for the presence of fbromyal-gia and anxiety-related disorders during lockdown, but a prevalence of depressive disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was observed.During lockdown in RA patients, (n=50), no correlation was found between DAS28 and RAID score (r=0.112, p=0.438) and in PsA patients (n=34), no correlation was found between DAPSA and PSAID score (r=0.131, p=0.459) while median value of RAID was higher in STAI I and II positive and median value of PSAID was higher in STAI I and II positive. Patients positive at BDI had higher RAID score (median 6.28 vs 1.14) and PSAID (median 4.95 vs 2.85) score (Mann Whitney p&lt;0.001 and p=0.003) Conclusion: In conclusion, mental and physical stress during COVID-19 pandemic can greatly worsen FM symptoms and intensify the patients' suffering without a clinical fare of the infammatory disease for patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Telemedicine has allowed us to identify patients who needed a face-to-face approach for therapeutic reevaluation even if not related to a fare of the disease.","Foti, R.; Amato, G.; Dal Bosco, Y.; Gagliano, C.; Longo, A.; Falsaperla, R.; Foti, R.; De Lucia, F.; Speranza, S.; Visalli, E.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.3025","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1092, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37517,""
"IMPACT of the SARS-COV 2 PANDEMIC and RELATED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESTRICTIONS on the CARE of PATIENTS with OSTEOPOROSIS-EXPERIENCES of A HUNGARIAN CENTRE","Background: Treatment of patients with osteoporosis was inadequate even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only patients without fracture, but only a small proportion of patients with osteoporotic fracture have treated. In Hungary only 30% of patients with osteoporosis received adequate antiporotic treatment before the pandemic. Almost 90% of whom were women, less than 10% of men. The incidence of fractures is increasing dramatically worldwide. In 2010, the vertebral fracture rate was 3.5 million in Europe but it is expected to reach 4.5 million by 2025. In 1990, osteoporosis caused 1.26 million hip fractures and by 2025 this is estimated at 2.6 million worldwide. The care for patients with osteoporosis was further aggravated by the restrictions necessarily imposed due to the coronavirus. Objectives: The aim of the study was to explore the extent and consequences of diagnostic and therapeutic failure in patients with osteoporosis. Methods: I determined the number of osteoporosis examinations performed in our centre in 2019-2021 from the medical database. I surveyed how many patients were discontinued the antiporotic treatment during the pandemic according to the different drug groups in Hungary and also in our centre as well as the prevalence of wrist and hip fractures due to minor trauma in our county in the pre-and post-pandemic period. Results: In our centre an average of 30 DEXA examinations were performed daily in the pre-pandemic period. From the end of October 2021 to the end of May 2021 there was not perform any ODM examinations. It means 3.980 missed exams and at least 1.000 missed osteoporosis diagnoses and therapy starts. More than 20% of patient were lost from the antiporotic care in Hungary. Drop-out was mainly seen in patients treated with bisphosphonates. There were 20730 bisphosphonate-treated patient in 2019, 19813 in 2020 and 17315 in 2021. Antiporotic treatment was discontinued in 30% of patients treated with bisphosphonate+vitamin-D (7849 in 2019, 6950 in 2020, 5484 in 2021) or bisphosphonate+calcium+vitamin-D fxed combination products (3256-2876-2289). In our centre, the prescribing of bisphosphonates has also decreased more than half. Patients treated with iv. bisphosphonates were interrupted or switched to oral formulations. Denosumab therapy was continuous: 581 injections were prescribed in the 12 months before and 579 during the pandemic. However, no new treatment started. In case of teriparatide, the initiated therapies were continued and even the number of prescriptions increased. As a consequence, an increase in the occurrence of fractures due to minor trauma is expected. Although epidemiological restrictions in this regard, the curfew has had some positive effects. According to international data, the number of wrist fractures has almost halved, while the data for hip fractures are controversial. The decrease of wrist fractures can also be verifed in our county. The number of wrist fractures was 598 in April-May 2019, 393 in the same period in 2020, and 372 in 2021. After a signifcant reduction in hip fractures in 2020, there is already an upward trend in 2021 (470 in 2019, 358 in 2020, 393 in 2021). The real consequences of failure to treat osteoporosis are expected only after years. Conclusion: Missed doctor-patient appointments were associated with missed diagnoses and interruptions of ongoing treatments. Fear of the virus, immobilisation due to home office and curfews, lack of exercise, sun exposure, caused depressive symptoms, increased alcohol consumption and caloric intake are all increase the risk of osteoporosis. Thus, traditional risk factors for osteoporosis expanded with the direct effects and the introduced restrictions because of the pandemic.","Kardos, Z.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2961","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1807, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37518,""
"CHANGES in PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME SCORES during COVID-19 PANDEMIC: DATA from the ARTHRITISPOWER REGISTRY","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic causes concern among patients with autoimmune and rheumatic disease (ARD) due to increased risk of infection and heightened isolation from social distancing.1 Objectives: Examine how mean patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores for mental, social and physical health fuctuated after COVID-19 vaccine availability was widespread in US. Methods: We conducted and reported on2 an initial analysis of January 2020-April 2021 where US participants (pts) of the ArthritisPower (AP) registry completed PROMIS measures of physical health (Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance), mental health (Anger, Anxiety, Depression) and social health (Social Isolation, Emotional Support). Follow-up analysis was conducted May-December 2021. Only pts from initial analysis were included in follow-up. Null hypothesis was no change in monthly average scores across 23-month pandemic period. Analysis of means compared monthly assessment mean scores to overall mean score for each measure during study period. Pts with &lt; 2 assessment time points and osteoarthritis with no ARD were excluded from analysis. Results: Total of 49,940 PRO scores were contributed by 2,266 pts during 23-month period, with 8,393 of the scores contributed from May-December 2021. Mean (standard deviation, SD) number of observations per pt was 5.6 (12.5). Pts were 87.6% female, 86.7% white, mean age of 52.1 (12.7) years. Rheumatoid arthritis (n=1,131, 49.9%) was the most common condition. Most commonly reported measures were Pain Interference, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance and Physical Function, each with &gt;11,000 total results (Table 1). Pts' mental and social health assessment scores improved then worsened during last 8 months of 2021 (Figure 1). Overall mean scores were: Anxiety 62.4 (12.5), Social Isolation 61.9 (10.5), and Anger 61.5 (12.8). From July-August, Social Isolation decreased by 1 SD. Compared to overall assessment mean, Anger declined by &gt; / SD (53.3 [19.4]) in August and Anxiety declined by / SD (57.7 [11.3]) in September. By December, Anger rose by &gt; / SD (68.6 [5.0]) of assessment mean. Pain Interference (mean: 63.3 [7.8]), Fatigue (62.6 [9.5]), and Sleep Disturbance (58.1 [9.0]) scores were signifcantly lower in May, June, July and August compared to the assessment mean, though none decreased by &gt; / SD. Conclusion: ARD members of AP had mental, social and physical health scores improve during summer of 2021, corresponding with widespread availability of vaccines. However mental and social health scores worsened by December as US faced new variants of the virus.","Gavigan, K.; Rivera, E.; Curtis, J. R.; Venkatachalam, S.; Stradford, L.; Curtis, D.; Nowell, W.

"ONLINE COUNSELLING for PATIENTS with ARTHRITIS","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives. Perhaps the biggest changes have been in medical services. Institutes specializing in RMD in Serbia were part of the covid system and patients only had access in emergency cases, there was no regular examinations. Objectives: The paper will show how the 'Online Counselling for Arthritis Patients (OCAP)' worked during the pandemic, how many rheumatologists and patients were involved and were patients satisfed with the service provided. Methods: Through the platform 'Lekarinfo' ORS,1 in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, organized an OCAP. Patients were informed about the possibility of using online consultations with rheumatologists via social networks, viber groups. email. and they were given instructions how to use it, they were advised to send medical documentation before, so the doctor has time to look at it, which gives more time for conversation. Consultations were held by phone or online, depending of patient's wishes and abilities. The time set aside with a rheumatol-ogist was 20 minutes and with a psychologist 30 minutes. One psychologist and 23 rheumatologists were available. The ORS distributed cards to rheumatogists with all necessary data about OCAP to inform their patients. Results: ORS conducted a Survey about OCAP. It was completed by 100 respondents, aged 20 to 75 of whom 75% were women. The 44% of respondents were from Belgrade, but it also included respondents from all over the country. RA have 61% of respondents, but patients with other types of arthritis were also included. 4/5 of patients are non-smokers and half of them are on biological therapy. All but one respondents are ORS's members. The results of Survey are the following: OCAP was used by 27% of respondents and all of them were satisfed except one. Everyone would use it again and would advise others to do so. Online consultation can replace live examination, when the disease is in remission, thinks 62% of respondents. The majority (90%) found it technically easy to use it, but also the majority of respondents felt that there is a space for improvement (70%). One third prefers to have online consultations with their rheumatologist, Half of them understand the importance of telemedicine, 61% think that C-19 pandemic has increased the need for it and 64% think that digital solutions are our perspectives and it should be further developed. Conclusion: It is desirable to continue with this kind of telemedicine. Patients and their families should be encouraged and educated about using digital platforms, aim is to explain them the benefts of telemedicine and that consultations do not necessarily have to be with their rheumatologists. Regardless of the pandemic, digitalization is in every aspect of our life, it is inevitable, but also it is a great advantage that should not be missed. Investments in the development of online platforms, that will facilitate patients access to doctors are an investment in self-control of chronic diseases in extraordinary circumstances, but also in normal conditions when because of the overscheduled doctors, lack of time for employed patients or other reasons, it is not possible for frequent examinations. Telemedicine is an investment not only in physical health but also in mental health of patients, having a doctor 'just a step from you' has calming and positively affects for patients. And without positive attitude it's hard to keep a chronic disease under control.","Dordevic, S.; Lapcevic, M.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2899","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1132, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37520,""
"STRESS-ASSOCIATED INCREASES in RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS DISEASE ACTIVITY and FLARES during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spurred global action. Beginning in March of 2020, the Southern California COVID-19 pandemic response to limit virus transmission was characterized by mandated lockdowns and quarantines, resulting in signifcant stressors for rheumatology patients and potentially threatening their disease. Objectives: To examine factors associated with changes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and fares in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: RA patients identifed by ICD-9/10 codes and active email addresses within a University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Rheumatology database were sent surveys via email in July and November of 2020. The survey was UCLA Institutional Review Board approved and included electronic consent and questions related to: perceptions of disease activity/remission via Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), fare frequency, RA fare questionnaire (RA-FQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and pandemic impact on stress (I.e. emotional state, apprehension, panic, helplessness, work, home, fnancial, and social distancing stress). Demographics were extracted from electronic medical records. Results were examined via descriptive analyses, Pearson correlations, and chi-square test for comparisons plus linear stepwise regressions where appropriate to evaluate the relationship between stress measures, RA disease activity, and fare frequency and severity. Results: Among 5037 patients surveyed, 361 in July and 4676 in Novem-ber,1128 (22.4%) responded. The study population demographics were: mean age of 57.5 Â± 15.1 years, 79.4% female, racially diverse (69.6% Caucasian, 13.7 % LatinX, 9.5 % Asian, and 4.9% Black), and 62% seropositive (CCP and/or RF). Perceived disease activity and remission remained stable in most patients with 719 reporting no fares, and 409 in current fares at the time of the survey (Table 1). A minority reported perceived increases in disease activity which were associated with multiple aspects of perceived stress. At survey completion, 346 had not experienced fares, 290 had experienced one fare, and 492 had experienced multiple fares. Use of DMARDs was associated with lack of fare versus current fare (77.8% versus 71.6%, p = 0.02). The use of conventional synthetic, biologic, or targeted synthetic DMARDs were not associated with fare while current corticosteroid use was associated with fare (9.3% without fare and 20.8% with fare, p &lt; 0.0001). Current fare was associated with increased PSS-4 scores (odds ratio (OR): 1.17 (95% confdence interval: 1.12-1.22, p &lt; 0.0001). Figure 1 describes the odds ratio of experiencing aspects of stress with the presence of RA fare. Conclusion: In a large survey population of RA patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple aspects of stress were found to correlate with RA disease activity and fare.","Furst, D.; Morris, N.

"SLEEP DISORDERS ARE FREQUENT in SPONDYLOARTHRITIS, ASSOCIATED with REDUCED QUALITY of LIFE and DEPRESSION and MORE PREVALENT in FEMALE PATIENTS","Background: Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) may have a profound impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and sleep despite effective treatment. Objectives: To assess sleep and HRQoL in SpA and determine associated factors. Methods: Monocentric questionnaire-based assessment of HRQoL, function, sleep and depression in 314 SpA patients (n=168 PsA, n=146 axSpA). Results: Under effective treatment 138 SpA patients (46.5%) demonstrated abnormal sleep behaviour. 49.3% reported not being able to sleep through the night, with 6.1 % needing sleeping pills. 11.9% indicated feeling unrefreshed most mornings. Abnormal sleep behaviour was associated with female sex (p=0.005), HLAB27 (p=0.034), functional impairment (p=0.001) and depression (p&lt;0.001). Patients reporting unrestful sleep had signifcantly more depressive symptoms (p&lt;0.001) and highly reduced physical and mental HRQoL (p&lt;0.001). Satisfaction with health was rated signifcantly lower (p&lt;0.001). Patients with axial involvement (axSpA/axPsA) reported worse sleep quality (p=0.002) and waking too early (p=0.038) despite 73.7% receiving biologics. Sleep quality and early awakening correlated with BASDAI (p&lt;0.001). Smokers had a reduced HRQoL (p=0.018) despite younger age (p=0.008). Female patients had worse sleep quality (p&lt;0.001), needing more time to fall asleep (p=0.022), not being able to sleep through the night (p=0.026) and feeling unrefreshed in the morning (p&lt;0.001). They had a reduced physical (p=0.019) and mental HRQoL (p=0.003), more depressive symptoms (p=0.040) and lower functional capacity (p=0.002). Functional capacity was associated with younger age (p&lt;0.001), sex (p=0.042), smoking (p=0.008), sleep quality (p&lt;0.001) and depression (p&lt;0.001). 66.2% of patients have been assessed longitudinally, before and 3y later during COVID19 pandemic. Physical and mental HRQoL were stable over time. Functional capacity had decreased slightly. Subjective QoL during the COVID19 pandemic was not reduced compared to before. Regarding depressive symptoms, there was a mild but signifcant improvement over time (p=0.019). Furthermore, we observed an improvement of environmental QoL (p=0.034) during COVID pandemic. Overall subjective QoL as well as satisfaction with health did not change signif-cantly. Patients who had changed therapy (37% of the cohort) still had a reduced physical HRQoL (p=0.022) as well as signifcantly more depressive symptoms (p=0.010) and perceived their overall QoL as being worse (p=0.016). Conclusion: Despite treatment many SpA patients have a reduced HRQoL and impaired sleep quality with signifcant differences between male and female patients.

"WORKING from HOME in PATIENTS with RMDS during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC in EUROPE RESULTS from the REUMAVID STUDY (PHASE 1 and 2)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced signifcant changes in the workplace, implementing teleworking as an effective solution to reduce contagion Objectives: We sought to explore the impact of working from home on people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: REUMAVID is an international cross-sectional study collecting data through an online survey in seven European countries led by the Health & Territory Research group of the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient representatives, rheumatologists, and health researchers. Data were collected in two phases, the frst (P1) between April-July 2020 and the second (P2) between February-April 2021. Demographics, health behaviors, employment status, access to healthcare services, disease characteristics, WHO-5 Well-Being Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were collected. Workplace conditions including internet connection, computer, workstation, webcam, telephone, light, noise, calmness, and temperature were assessed (on a scale of 0 to 5, being 5 the best condition). Pearson's Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test were used to explore association with working from home. Results: There were a total of 3,802 participants across both phases (mean age 52.6 (P1) vs. 55.0 years (P2);80.2% female (P1) vs 83.7% (P2);69.6% married (P1) vs 68.3% (P2), 48.6% university educated (P1) vs 47.8% (P2), 34.7% employed (P1) vs 38.1 (P2)). Most prevalent RMD was axial spondyloarthritis in P1 (37.2%), and rheumatoid arthritis in P2 (53.1%). Rates of working from home were consistent (P1: 39.8% vs P2: 39.9%). In P2, 37.4% of those working from home had a home office, while 38.5% worked from their living room or kitchen. Work-related aspects at home were assessed, with the worst rated being the workplace (3.2) and the best being the computer (4.0). Compared to patients with good well-being and without anxiety and depression, patients with poorer well-being and at higher risk of anxiety or depression reported more frequently poorer rating of work from home issues, such as workplace (3.0 vs. 3.5;2.9 vs. 3.6;2.9 vs. 3.4;p&lt;0.001), light (3.6 vs. 4.0;3.6 vs. 4.0;3.5 vs. 4.0;p&lt;0.001), noise (3.3 vs. 3.8;3.2 vs. 3.9;3.2 vs. 3.8;p&lt;0.001) and calmness (3.3 vs. 4.0;3.2 vs. 3.9;3.1 vs. 3.9;p&lt;0.001;Table 1). Conclusion: Patients with poorer well-being, at higher risk of anxiety or depression reported poorer ratings of workspace-related aspects. Therefore, although work from home has helped to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conditions under which RMD patients work from home must be considered, as these may affect the well-being and mental health of an already vulnerable group. It is necessary to assess the conditions of home-based workspaces-especially for workers with chronic diseases such as RMD patients-to ensure that it is feasible to work from home and that employers provide the necessary equipment for healthy work.","Garrido-Cumbrera, M.; Navarro-CompÃ¡n, V.; Christen, L.; Correa-FernÃ¡ndez, J.; Marzo-Ortega, H.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2720","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:950-951, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37523,""
"IMPACT of the COVID-19 PANDEMIC on HEALTHCARE UTILIZATIONS of RMD PATIENTS in EUROPE RESULTS from the REUMAVID STUDY (PHASE 1 and 2)","Background: The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a collapse of healthcare systems that was difficult to manage. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RMD patients' healthcare utilization. Methods: REUMAVID is an international cross-sectional study collecting data through an online survey on RMD in seven European countries led by the Health & Territory Research group of the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient representatives, rheumatolo-gists, and health researchers. Data were collected in two phases, the frst (P1) between April-July 2020 and the second (P2) between February-April 2021. Demographics, health behaviours, employment status, access to healthcare services, disease characteristics, WHO-5 Well-Being Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were collected in the survey. Healthcare utilization includes scheduled appointments and attendance at the rheumatol-ogist, consultation of possible treatment effects if COVID-19 is contracted with the rheumatologist, primary health care and psychological care. Descriptive analysis and Mann-Whitney test was used to explore association with healthcare utilization in both phases of REUMAVID. Results: There were a total of 2,002 participants across both phases with comparable demographic characteristics [mean age 52.6 (P1) vs. 55.0 years (P2);80.2% female (P1) vs 83.7% (P2);69.6% married (P1) vs 68.3% (P2), 48.6% university educated (P1) vs 47.8% (P2)]. Most prevalent RMD was axial spondyloarthritis in P1 (37.2%), and rheumatoid arthritis in P2 (53.1%). Only 39.2% could have a scheduled appointment with their rheumatologist during P1, compared to 72.5% of patients in P2 (p&lt;0.001). In this sense, only 41.6% of participants in the P1 attended such an appointment while in P2 this figure was 61.5% (p&lt;0.001). The majority of patients (83%) had their scheduled face-to-face appointment changed to an online or telephone phone in the P2, although this proportion was lower in the P1 (54.4%). The most frequent reason for canceling the face-to-face appointment was the alternative of making it by phone or online (54.4% in P1 vs. 83.0% in P2, p&lt;0.001). Although, in P1, 38.1% of participants could contact with their rheumatolo-gist by phone or online, this proportion was 64.3% in P2 (p&lt;0.001). In P1, 64.0% of patients were able to consult with their rheumatologist about the possible effects of treatment in case of contracting COVID-19 (vs. 41.2% in P2;p&lt;0.001). With respect to general practitioners, 57.6% of patients in P1 declared to had accessed primary care or general practitioner (vs. 77.5% in P2;p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, in P2, a higher proportion of participants (63.2%) were able to continue their psychological or psychiatric therapy either online or by phone (vs. 48.3% in P1;p&lt;0.001;Figure 1) Conclusion: During the frst year of COVID-19 pandemic, RMD patients had easier access to the healthcare system, specifcally to their rheumatologist.

Participants rated a series of fears (infection, medication consequences, lack of medication, impact on healthcare, lost job, civil disorder) on a scale from zero ('no concern at all') to five ('extremely concerned') and hopes (treatment/vaccine availability, going outside, travel, economic situation, treatment continuation, health status) on a scale from zero ('no hopeful at all') to five ('extremely hopeful'). Descriptive analysis and Mann-Whitney test were used to explore fears and hopes in both phases of REUMAVID. Results: A total of 3,802 participants were recruited across both phases in REU-MAVID with comparable demographic characteristics: mean age 52.6 (P1) vs. 55.0 years (P2), 80.2% female (P1) vs. 83.7% (P2), 69.6% married (P1) vs. 68.3% (P2), and 48.6% university educated (P1) vs. 47.8% (P2). Most prevalent RMD was axial spondyloarthritis in P1 (37.2%), and rheumatoid arthritis in P2 (53.1%). In P1 and P2 the major concern was the impact on healthcare in the future (3.1 and 3.2 out of 5, p=0.051). Compared to P1, patients in P2 had less fears about RMD medications not reaching the country (2.4 vs. 1.9, p&lt;0.001), civil disorders (2.0 vs. 1.8, p=0.001), or losing their jobs (1.4 vs. 1.5, p=0.003). Comparing hopes with P1, patients in P2 had greater hopes about availability of treatments or vaccines suitable for COVID-19 (3.2 vs. 3.9, p&lt;0.001), to be able to go out as before the pandemic (3.1 vs. 3.5, p&lt;0.001), to be able to travel as before the pandemic (2.8 vs. 3.3, p&lt;0.001), maintain and even improve the current economic situation after the pandemic (2.6 vs. 3.0, p&lt;0.001), and to be able to continue their treatment as usual (3.8 vs. 3.8, p=0.049;Table 1) Conclusion: During the frst phase of REUMAVID at the beginning of the pandemic, patients with RMDs were more fearful and less hopeful compared to the second phase. These fears were notable in terms of lack of medication for their RMD, while during the second phase, patients were hopeful of a treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, and of being able to go out and travel as before.","Garrido-Cumbrera, M.; Marzo-Ortega, H.; Christen, L.; Correa-FernÃ¡ndez, J.; Mateus, E.; Grange, L.; Webb, D.; Jacklin, C.; Irwin, S.; Mingolla, S.; Antonopoulou, K.; Makri, S.; Navarro-CompÃ¡n, V.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2685","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1677-1678, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37525,""
"DIFFICULTIES and MENTAL IMPACT of the SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC in PATIENTS with SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS: A NATIONWIDE PATIENT ASSOCIATION STUDY","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of the general population. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were particularly exposed due to many uncertainties linked to the virus and their immunosuppression as well as difficulties to access medical care and their treatment (eg, hydroxychloroquine) during the early pandemic. Objectives: To evaluate the difficulties encountered by SLE patients during the early COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluate their impact on patient mental health. Methods: We conducted a nationwide survey including SLE patients from France metropolitan and overseas territories, recruited by their treating specialist or through a patient association (AFL+). The survey was administered online or in paper form between November 2020 and April 2021, and included questions aiming at evaluating the difficulties encountered during the early COVID-19 pandemic (March to August 2020). The impact on mental health was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Results: 536 SLE patients (91.9% women) of mean age 50 (Â±14.1) years responded to the survey. The main reported difficulties were issues to access medical care (n = 136, 25.4%) or to obtain hydroxychloroquine treatment (n = 98/389, 25.2%), the loss of employment (n = 85/349, 24.4%) and fnancial dif-fculties (n = 75/536, 11%). Hydroxychloroquine shortage was responsible for difficulties in obtaining the drug for 25.2% (98/389) of HCQ-treated patients, and 57 had to interrupt HCQ treatment for a median of 7 days (IQR: 3-17). In the 342 patients with complete assessment, 161 (47.2%) screened positive for anxiety, 141 (41.2%) for depressive syndrome and 128 (38.7%) for PTSD. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex (OR=4.29 [95%CI: 1.39-13.24]), fnancial issues (OR=2.57 [1.27-5.22]), difficulties to access medical care (OR=2.15 [1.26-3.69]), or to obtain hydroxychloroquine treatment (OR=1.90 [1.06-3.40]) were independently associated with a positive screening for PTSD. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a severe burden in SLE patients, including difficulties in access to care and treatment along with high psychological distress. Better understanding these difficulties will allow better prevention and care in times of crisis.","Scherlinger, M.; Zein, N.; Gottenberg, J. E.; Riviere, M.; Kleinmann, J.

"RHEUMATIC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES (RMDS) during the FIRST WAVE of the COVID19 PANDEMIC: PATIENTS' POINT of VIEW on the ROLE of TELEMEDICINE","Background: The COVID19 pandemic has caused health problems in people's daily lives with a signifcant psychological impact. In fact, patients with RMDs have experienced diseases' fare and also psychological problems. The lockdown and the 'social quality changes' have impacted the life and the well-being of RMDs patients, influencing directly the implementation of telemedicine during daily practice. Objectives: A descriptive observational study was designed to analyse the short-term effect of the frst wave on RMDs patients on social quality changes and the usefulness of telemedicine. Methods: The survey was carried out by administering a questionnaire consisting of 30 questions, developed ad hoc using Likert scales. Items such as family and work environment, access to healthcare facilities, healthcare provided to the patient, disease activity and the mental health status of individuals (anxiety/depressive symptoms) were investigated. Preliminary data on the frst wave were collected between September and November 2021 through patient associations and social networks. Results: 40 RMDs patients (Rheumatoid Arthritis 57.5%, Psoriatic Arthritis 35%, Fibromyalgia and others 7.5%) prevalently women (97.5%) were included in the survey. During the pandemic, 72% of respondents reported cancellation or delays in scheduled appointments and 50% did not have alternative contacts (telephone consultations, e-mail prescriptions, telematics training) with the hospital. 40.5% of patients reported difficulty in fnding DMARDs and material for the treatment of ulcers, 28.2% reported difficulties in accessing the health facilities. In particular, 34.2% reported the total closure of the hospital facilities. Moreover, our data show a worsening of health status due to an increased anxiety concerning the management of their RMDs, an increased stress within the family, a reduced access to care facilities due to their closure or travel restrictions. In 57% of patients, a worsening of health status was reported, while in 90% stress and a feeling of abandonment was developed since the beginning of the pandemic. In this context, telemedicine was considered useful by 97.5% of patients, although patients felt that an improvement was necessary with an integration with the regular follow up. Conclusion: Patients with RMDs reported that the signifcant delays or cancellation of the outpatient visits provoked an increase of stress, worry and anxiety for their health. The majority was very concerned about the overall management of their RMDs. The worsening of symptoms in more than half of the patients was the most worrisome observation. Almost all patients agreed that Telemedicine might help the clinical evaluation of their RMDs, also providing a signifcant support to their psychological condition because of the direct contact with the caring physician and health professionals.","El Aoufy, K.; Melis, M.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT in PATIENTS with CHRONIC RHEUMATIC, SYSTEMIC AUTOIMMUNE, or AUTOINFLAMMATORY DISEASES PRESENTED with COVID-19: The MENTCOVRMD STUDY","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about its psychological effects. Sleep disturbances, anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms have been reported in general population. Patients with chronic rheumatism, systemic autoimmune disease or auto-infam-matory disease, due to immunosuppression, are at risk of severe forms of infection. Currently, there is little information on psychological impact of the pandemic on the mental health of these more vulnerable patients. Objectives: To compare psychological assessment between patients with chronic rheumatic, autoimmune and/or autoinfammatory diseases who presented with COVID-19 infection between March and September 2020, frst wave of French pandemic, and patients with same diseases who did not presented with infection to date. Methods: The MentCOVRMD study was a multicenter descriptive study. Cases were patients with chronic rheumatic, autoimmune and/or autoinfammatory diseases from the French RMD cohort who presented COVID-19 infection between March and September 2020. Controls were patients with same diseases who did not develop infection. The study is registered in Clinical Trials under number 2020-A02058-31. For participants, following criteria were collected: demographics (age, gender, smoking status);psychological assessment questionnaires: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI);Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist;Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) Depression;Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD7) Anxiety;Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)-12. Results: Between February and December 2021, 60 cases (46 (76.7%) women), median age 52.0 (39.0;63.0) were included, of which 15 (25%) had been hospitalized during infection, and 169 controls (148 (87.6%) women), median age of 52.0 (38.0;63.0). There were more smokers in the group of cases 12 (20%) than controls 14 (9.1%) (p=0.028) as well as more cases on ARA2 treatment (8 (13.3%)) than controls (7 (4.5%)) (p=0.035) with no statistically signifcant difference in others comorbidities or treatments. There was no statistically difference concerning the ISI scores between cases (11.83 Â± 7.31) of which 60% had sleep disorders and controls (11.64 Â± 6.82) of which 70.4% had sleep disorders. There was no statistically significant difference in PTSD scores of 15.5 (5.0 to 28.0) for cases and 18.0 (8.0 to 35.0) for controls, of which respectively 12 (20%) had values indicating possible PTSD for cases and 50 (29.6%) for controls. There was no statistically significant difference in PHQ-9 scores (5.5 (1.5 to 11.0)) of which 50% had depressive symptoms and controls (6.0 (2.0 to 11.0)) of which 54.5% had symptoms. There was no statistically significant difference in GAD-7 scores (3.5 (0.0 to 8.0)) of which 40% had anxiety symptoms and controls (4.0 (0.0 to 8.0)) of which 43.2% had symptoms. There was no statistically significant difference in PHQ-15 scores (11.4 Â± 6.7), 85% of whom reported presence of symptoms, and controls (10.9 Â± 6.2), 82.3% of whom reported symptoms. There was no statistically significant difference in SSD scores between cases (17.7 Â± 10.9) and controls (18.4 Â± 10.9). There was a statistically signifcant difference in reported VAS scores of pain related to infammatory rheumatism in cases with a median of 4.5 (3.0 to 6. 0) compared to controls with a median of 4.0 (1.0 to 6.0) (p=0.011). There was no statistically signifcant difference in any of the psychological assessment scores between the inpatient and outpatient COVID cases. Conclusion: There was no statistically signifcant difference between COVID cases and controls in the evaluation of these psychological parameters. Prevalence of all these variables were high in the whole study population, testifying to the need to manage these psychological aspects for patients with chronic rheumatisms, autoimmune and/or autoinfammatory diseases.","Farhat, M.

"A PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAM for the MANAGEMENT of FATIGUE in SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) at the TIME of PANDEMIC: A PILOT STUDY","Background: Fatigue in SLE has a multifactorial origin and disease activity seems to contribute only minimally to its genesis. Therefore, non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies should also be considered in the management of fatigue. There is some evidence on the effectiveness of aerobic exercise programs in improving fatigue, without a negative impact on disease manifestations. Objectives: the aim of this study was to analyze fatigue and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a monocentric cohort of patients with SLE, in a condition of stable remission or low disease activity, before and after a program of physical exercise, through the administration of validated Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs). Methods: this is a cross-sectional interventional study which included patients with SLE, aged between 18 and 55 years, in a condition of stable (=12 months) remission (DORIS)1 or low disease activity (LLDAS)2. Patients enrolled had a FACIT score =40 in the previous 6 months. Patients with other possible causes of fatigue (e.g.: anemia, hypothyroidism, severe vitamin D defciency), active arthritis or physical disabilities were excluded. For each patient, demographics, comorbidities, treatment, clinical and laboratory data were collected. Disease activity was evaluated with the SELENA-SLEDAI and organ damage with the SLICC/DI. Each patient completed the following PROs before and after the interventional program: SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, LIT, HADS. Due to the limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the physical exercise sessions were carried out using the Google Meet digital platform. Patients were asked to participate to at least 70% of the lessons. The physical exercise program included moderate intensity aerobic exercises (muscle strengthening, joint mobility, breathing, static and dynamic stretching, balance and neuro-dynamics);workouts were performed 3 times a week, consisting of 60 minutes each. The program lasted for 12 weeks. Results: we enrolled 12 female patients, regularly followed at the Rheumatology Unit of Pisa;only 9 of them completed the study (mean age 38.56 Â± 9.1 years;median disease duration 7 years (IQR 5,25-9,75)). 8/9 were in stable remission, while 1/9 was in LLDAS for the presence of leukopenia. 2/9 patients presented organ damage, one for cataract and one for renal insufficiency, while none presented damage in the musculoskeletal system. 33.3% of patients had fbromyalgia. 88.8% was on treatment with Hydroxy-chloroquine, 55.5% was on low dose steroids (2Â±1.9 mg/daily), 33.3% was on Mycophenolate Mofetil;only 1 patient was on Belimumab. All PROs showed a trend to improvement at the end of the 12-week program of physical activity (Table 1). We demonstrated a statistically signifcant improvement of: FACIT, LIT, depression score of the HADS and MCS of the SF-36. The items of role physical (RP), vitality (VT) and mental health (MH) of the SF-36 also showed a signifcant improvement. Conclusion: In a small cohort of SLE patients in remission but with severe fatigue, in the difficult context of COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that an online program of physical exercise may determine a signifcant improvement of fatigue, perception of disease burden and mental health. In the context of a multidisciplinary management, fnding effective intervention programs to improve fatigue and HRQoL in SLE patients appears of utmost importance, with the fnal aim of improving patients' health status.","Elefante, E.; Tani, C.; Signorini, V.; Stagnaro, C.; Lunardi, L.; Zucchi, D.; Trentin, F.; Carli, L.; Ferro, F.; Mosca, M.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2422","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1096, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37529,""
"MORE THAN HALF of RA PATIENTS with A LIFETIME HISTORY of MOOD DISORDERS WERE ANXIOUS and DEPRESSED during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS from the CANADIAN EARLY COHORT (CATCH) STUDY","Background: A growing number of studies indicate the considerable mental health impacts of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic in the general population as chronic stress is a risk factor for the development of depression and anxiety. Mood disorders are more prevalent in RA and a history of anxiety or depressive disorders increases the risk of recurrence in the future. Objectives: To compare trends in prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in RA patients with and without a lifetime history of mood disorders. Methods: Data were from RA patients diagnosed and treated for RA in rheumatology clinics across Canada enrolled in the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort (CATCH) Study. We estimated monthly trends in prevalence of clinically sig-nifcant levels of anxiety and depression (PROMIS Depression and Anxiety 4a score 55+) from all visits between Mar 2019 and Jan 2022 and compared monthly trends in anxiety and depression in the year prior to (Mar 2019-Feb 2020) and during the pandemic (Mar 2020 to Jan 2022) stratifed by lifetime history of mood disorders. Results: 4,148 visits were completed from Mar 2019 to Jan 2022 in 1,644 RA patients with a mean (SD) age of 60 (14) and disease duration of 6 (4) years. 73% were women, 84% white, 60% had completed some post-secondary education, and 77% were in CDAI REM/LDA at the visit closest to the start of pandemic. 253 (15%) reported a lifetime history of depression and 217 (13%) a lifetime history of anxiety;8% reported prior treatment for either. Patients with a history of mood disorders had higher levels of depression and anxiety prior-to and during the pandemic compared with patients without a history of mood disorders (Table 1). Proportions were highest during COVID waves in all and were substantially higher and more variable in people with a previous history of mood disorders as compared to those without a history (Figure 1). While depressive symptoms peaked early in the pandemic, anxiety increased with each wave, peaking in Wave 3 (May-Jun 2021). During the frst 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients with depression and anxiety increased in all groups. More than half of those with a history of emotional distress had clinically signifcant levels of depression and anxiety;proportions were highest during COVID waves in all and were substantially higher in people with previous history as compared to those without a history (see Figure 1). Whereas depressive symptoms peaked early in the pandemic, anxiety increased with each wave, peaking in Wave 3 (May-Jun 2021). Conclusion: Symptoms of anxiety and depression were common in Canadian adults with RA prior to and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas others have found that high levels of depression and anxiety occurred early in the pandemic but declined fairly rapidly in the general population1, emotional distress was not attenuated over time in this large cohort of RA patients. Individuals reporting lifetime history of mood disorders were more than twice as likely to report anxiety and depression, with depression peaking early in the pandemic and anxiety growing with each successive wave in the frst year. The results demonstrate the importance of applying a lifetime perspective as previous episodes of anxiety and depression may be an important marker of increased vulnerability and recurrence in RA patients, particularly during the pandemic.","Bartlett, S.

"THE PROPER STUDY: A 48-WEEK ANALYSIS of A PAN-EU REAL-WORLD STUDY of SB5 BIOSIMILAR FOLLOWING TRANSITION from REFERENCE ADALIMUMAB in PATIENTS with RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS or PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS","Background: SB5, a biosimilar to reference adalimumab (ADL), received EU marketing authorisation in 2017, based on pre-clinical and clinical phase I and III studies that demonstrated bioequivalence and comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity to ADL. Objectives: The real-world study 'PROPER' is designed to provide insights into outcomes of the transition from ADL to SB5 outside the randomised, controlled, clinical trial setting. Methods: Under an umbrella design, 1000 patients with immune-mediated infammatory disease were enrolled at centres in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK, and followed for 48 weeks post-transition. Eligible patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease had been transitioned to SB5 as part of routine treatment following a minimum of 16 weeks' treatment with ADL. Data were captured from patient charts retrospectively for 24 weeks prior to and prospectively and/or retrospectively up to 48 weeks after SB5 initiation. This analysis of the rheumatology cohort reports clinical characteristics, disease scores, persistence on SB5, clinical management and safety up to the closing date of November 30th, 2021. Results: Of the 496 patients included in this analysis, the majority were enrolled in UK (n=174), Germany (n=145) and Spain (n=73);Italy, Ireland and Belgium enrolled 45, 44 and 15 patients respectively. At study close, 487 patients had completed 48 weeks of follow-up;397 of those remained on SB5 throughout. Methotrexate was received as concomitant therapy by 37% of patients and 20% had received a biologic therapy prior to reference ADL. Most patients (89.3% of RA, 92.1% of axSpA, 97.3% of PsA) transitioned to SB5 at the same dose regimen received for ADL. Clinical characteristics, SB5 dose and fare are detailed in Table 1, disease scores in Figure 1. Fifteen patients each experienced one unrelated Serious Adverse Event (SAE): 2 in the axSpA cohort [tachycardia, intracranial haemorrhage];6 in the PsA cohort [myocardial infarct (2), breast carcinoma, COVID-19, gallbladder calculus, dyspnoea];7 in the RA cohort [facial numbness, depression, COVID-19, pneumonia, diverticulitis, parvovirus, coronary occlusion]. Tw o patients reported SAEs considered causally related to SB5: Herpes zoster and pneumonia (RA cohort), and ALS with worsening (PsA cohort). Conclusion: This analysis of a large, contemporary cohort of EU patients with established RA, axSpA or PsA shows treatment effectiveness maintained at 48 weeks after switching from ADL to SB5, with most patients continuing on SB5 Q2W throughout. Episodes of fare were uncommon, and the importance of patient-reported symptoms in recognition of fare is evident.

"CORRELATES of CANCELLED HEALTHCARE APPOINTMENTS in PATIENTS with SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: Rheumatologists have noted challenges in treating patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as patients on immunosuppressants and those with preexisting pulmonary issues.1 Also of potential concern was patients delaying treatment due to fears of COVID. Objectives: This study examined to what extent patients with SSc cancelled health-care appointments due to fears of COVID, how this correlated with their mental and physical functioning, and their levels of anxiety and depression. Methods: Participants were 60 people with SSc who had not had COVID-19 or been vaccinated for COVID. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD=11.5) and were primarily female (92%) and white (87%). Participants completed an online survey after learning about it from a sclero-derma organization newsletter or at their visit with a rheumatologist specializing in scleroderma in New York State, USA. Data were collected August 2020 through March 2021. Participants completed measures assessing health-related appointments attendance, Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures (anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain intensity, physical function), coping strategies to deal with the pandemic, and reported functioning relevant to SSc (hand, gastrointestinal, dyspnea, and Raynaud's disease). Results: Due to COVID-19 concerns, 28 respondents (47%) cancelled one or more appointments with their primary care physician, specialist, physical or occupational therapist, pulmonologist, or dentist. Compared to those who did not cancel appointments due to COVID concerns, participants who cancelled reported higher anxiety, t(58) = 2.46, p =.02, higher sleep disturbance, t(56) = 3.31, p =.002, worse physical functioning, t(56) = 2.00, p =.05, more constipation, t(55) = 2.05, p =.045, and lower positive reframing as a coping strategy, t(56) = 2.08, p =.04. Many participants reported moderate or severe anxiety (36%), depression (22%), fatigue (32%), sleep disturbance (28%), and physical dysfunction (40%). As shown in Table 1, anxiety scores were positively correlated with scores on measures of fatigue, sleep disturbance, physical dysfunction, diarrhea, and the coping strategies of substance use, self-distraction, emotional support, behavioral disengagement, and venting. Depression scores were positively correlated with scores on measures of fatigue, sleep disturbance, physical dysfunction, pain intensity, dyspnea, diarrhea, and behavioral disengagement as a coping strategy. Conclusion: Almost half of participants cancelled one or more health appointments due to COVID fears. This subgroup reported significantly higher anxiety, sleep disturbance, constipation, worse physical functioning, and less coping with the pandemic by looking for the positive. Anxiety and/or depression also played a role in 42% of SSc patients and were related to a variety of worse mental and physical health correlates. Future research should examine the extent to which changes in health-related care during the pandemic have implications for disease progression in patients with SSc.","Dorr, N.; Fennell, P.; Shapiro, L.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2312","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1804-1805, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37533,""
"THE EFFECTS of TELEREHABILITATION BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM in PATIENTS with SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS","Background: Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by skin fbrosis and vasculopathy [1]. Patients may experience a decrease in their daily activities, physical activity levels and quality of life, while psychological problems such as anxiety and depression may increase. In order to eliminate or reduce these symptoms and the consequences of symptoms, exercise programs for the patient, as well as medical treatment, are an important part of the treatment [2, 3]. Telerehabilitation increases overall health awareness, treatment adherence, and satisfaction by enabling patients to take an active role in decision-making and disease management [4]. Telerehabilitation replaces the traditional face-to-face treatment approach, allowing patients to access treatment remotely [5, 6]. In addition Telerehabilitation enabled patients with chronic diseases to access exercise during the COVID 19 pandemic [7]. Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of telerehabilita-tion-based exercise program in patients with SSc. Methods: Forty-six SSc patients were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups as telerehabilitation and control group. Youtube videos consisting of clinical pilates-based exercises were uploaded to the system so that only the patients in the telerehabilitation group could see it. In the telere-habilitation group;An exercise program was applied for eight weeks, twice a day. Video interviews were conducted with the patients once a week. To the control group;the same exercises were given to the telerehabilitation group. An eight-week exercise program was given in the form of a home program. Brochure introducing the exercises was given and exercises were taught. Pain, dyspnea, fatigue, physical activity, anxiety-depression, sleep and quality of life levels were evaluated in all patients at the beginning of the study and at the end of the eight weeks. Results: Demographic and clinical features of the patient groups were similar (p&gt;0.05). After the exercise program, pain, fatigue, anxiety-depression levels decreased in the telerehabilitation group compared to the control group, while sleep quality and quality of life increased (p&lt;0.05). The results of the study induced that both exercise programs improve pain, fatigue, anxiety-depression, physical activity, sleep quality and quality of life in SSc patients. The telerehabilitation-based treatment program are more and more effective than the home program. Conclusion: Our study shows that this innovative treatment program should be applied especially in SSc patients and it will be benefcial.","Sari, F.; Oskay, D.; Tufan, A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.2301","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1851-1852, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37534,""
"FACTORS ASSOCIATED with the OCCURRENCE of MENTAL DISORDERS in PATIENTS with AUTOIMMUNE RHEUMATIC DISEASES during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: Mental disorders constitute a serious and underestimated problem in Latin America and they could have worse features in comparison with Europe or North America (1);that was the case even before the COVID-19 epidemic ensued in 2020. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with the occurrence of mental health disorders (MHD) in patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD) from PerÃº, a high COVID-19 incidence country. Methods: Patients with ARD from a single center (Hospital Guillermo Almenara-EsSalud, Lima-PerÃº) were included during the frst and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (March to November 2020). Interviews, medical records reviews, and an electronic survey were performed. MHD explored were depression (assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9: PHQ-9), anxiety (ascertained with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7: GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress disorder: PTSD (evaluated with the Event Scale-Revised: IES-R). Variables examined were sociodemographic (age, gender, educational level, marital status, living alone, job status, religiosity), previous diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders, living with a COVID-19 patient, COVID-19 diagnosis (current or past), fear of COVID-19 (assessed with the COVID-19 Scale: FCV-19S) and the ARD type. Multivariable logistic regression models using backward elimination procedure were performed to determine the variables associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. (See Table 1). Results: Nine hundred and thirteen ARD patients were evaluated. The most frequent diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis in 446(48.8%) patients followed by systemic lupus erythematosus in 279 (30.6%). Depression, anxiety, and PTSD were observed in 128 (14.0%), 112 (12.30%) and 485 (53.1%) patients, respectively. In the multivariable analyses, previous treatment for mental disorders and fear of COVID-19 were associated with depression: OR=2.35 (95% CI 1.37-4.03;p=0.002) and OR=1.07 (95% CI 1.05-1.10;p&lt;0.001) respectively;also with anxiety: OR= 2.42 (95% CI 1.37-4.26;p=0.002) and OR=1.09 (95% CI 1.06-1.12;p &lt;0.01) and with PSTD: OR=2.42 (95% CI 1.39-4.21;p=0.002) and OR=1.41 (95% CI=1.11-1.17;p&lt;0.001). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with PTSD: OR=1.75 (95% CI 1.06-2.89, p=0.028), while being single was associated with a decreased probability of PTSD occurrence: OR=0.57 (95% CI=0.35-0.96;p=0.03). Finally, having a high educational level was associated with less anxiety: OR=0.43 (95% CI=0.82-0.21;p=0.009), for university/postgraduate studies and OR=0.52 (CI 95%=0.28-0.95;p=0.032) for secondary studies.

"ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS and TELE-YOGA during COVID-19 PANDEMIC: PRELIMINARY RESULTS of A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL","Background: Yoga is an ancient discipline that emerged thousandans of years ago in India to unite the mind, body and spirit. Yoga is widely used by patients with various rheumatic diseases. Although it is recommended for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients, there is no randomized controlled study on this subject in the literature. Due to Covid-19, which has changed the world and the people's lifestyle, tele-yoga practice can be considered as an alternative to traditional face-to-face yoga classes. The use of online platforms provides a safe environment for yoga training at home. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tele-yoga on disease activity, functional status, spinal mobility, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life in ankylosing spondylitis patients. Methods: Thirty-six volunteer AS patients (21 male, 15 female) who applied to Dokuz EylÃ¼l University, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology and Immunology were included in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to a tele-yoga (n=18, mean age 43.22 Â±8.54 years) or waiting-list control group (n=18, mean age 44.9 Â±8.01 years) by block randomization method. Patients in the tele-yoga group participated in 1-hour tele-yoga sessions with a maximum of 5 people in each group using Zoom (online video-conference method) 3 days a week for 8 weeks. Assessments were performed before and after 8 weeks of yoga training. The waiting list control group did not receive any intervention, participants were advised to maintain their usual activities and continue their routine medical treatments. Assessments were performed at baseline and after an 8-week waiting period. After assessments, patients who wished participated the tele-yoga program. The following inventory was used for assessment: Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) for disease activity, Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI) for functionality, Bath AS Mobility Index (BASMI) for spinal mobility, ASAS Health Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Short Form-36 (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age, height, weight, body mass index, gender and physical activity level (p&gt;0.05). While all parameters improved signifcantly in the tele-yoga group (p&lt;0.05), no change was observed in the control group after 8 weeks (p&gt;0.05). When the changes in the tele-yoga group and the control group were compared, the improvements in the BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, ASAS Health Index, SF-36 Physical Function, SF-36 Role Physical, SF-36-Bodily Pain, PSQI and PSS were found to be statistically signifcant in the tele-yoga group (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: According to our preliminary results, tele-yoga is benefcial in reducing disease activity and stress, improving functional level, spinal mobility, sleep quality and quality of life. Due to its therapeutic effects, tele-yoga can be considered as an alternative approach for AS patients.","Acar, Y.; Ilcin, N.; Sari, I.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.1930","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1095, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37536,""
"RHEUMATOLOGY PATIENTS TREATED with A BDMARD PERSPECTIVE TOWARDS THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING","Background: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is a tool to determine the optimal dose of a drug for individual patients using measurement of blood concentrations and, optionally, anti-drug antibodies (ADA). In the feld of rheumatology interest in applying TDM is increasing. A recent study by Syversen et al., the NOR-DRUM B trail, supports TDM as a treatment strategy. This study showed that treatment with proactive TDM was more effective then treatment without TDM. Applying TDM creates a more personalized treatment for individual patients, therefore it is relevant to understand the patients perspective towards TDM. Objectives: To study the perspective of rheumatology patients treated with a bDMARD in a personalized fashion using TDM. Methods: Adult rheumatology patients from the Amsterdam Rheumatology and immunology Center who participate in the COVID-19 prospective cohort study (Nederlands Trial Register, trial ID NL8513) received a digital questionnaire which comprised, in addition to demographic items, of three TDM topics: familiarity, attitude and risk assessment. Results: Participants were selected based on the following criteria: treatment with a bDMARD and a fully completed questionnaire (n=888). Table 1 shows characteristics of study population. Sixty-six percent (n=582) of the participants had never heard of the concept 'personalized dosing, using TDM'. After explaining the concept 60% (n=535) of the participants answered they have a positive attitude towards the concept (Figure 1). Participants with a positive attitude received a follow-up question. They were asked which of the following related aspects: individual dosing, costs, safety and other, they thought was most relevant regarding the concept. Multiple answers were possible. Ninety-four percent (n=502) reported as the main reason for having a positive attitude, that the treatment can be personally adjusted. The second and third reasons, respectively, were safety 43% (n=230) and costs 27% (n=142) of the treatment. Five percent (n=43) of the participants had a negative attitude towards the concept. Main reasons were;previous experience with unsuccessful dose reduction and unwillingness to change current treatment due to the fact that several previous treatments were ineffective. Participants were also asked what amount of risk they are willing to take when presented with five different situations;worsening rheumatologically symptoms: e.g. pain and swelling, increased fatigability, necessary treatment with prednisone, switching to another bDMARD or more frequent visits to rheumatologist. Majority of the patients reported for each of the five situations, respectively: 37% (n=330), 40% (n=359), 51% (n=453), 48% (n= 426) and 29% (n=262) that they would only be willing to take a negligible risk, &lt; 0.1%. Conclusion: Majority of participants was not familiar with the concept of personalized dosing using TDM. However, the majority had a positive attitude towards the concept. The main reason for a positive attitude is that the treatment can be personally adjusted. On the other hand, patients who are currently being treated with a bDMARD were only willing to take a negligible risk when it comes to their own treatment.","Leeuw, M.; Atiqi, S.; De Vries, F.; Boekel, L.; Hooijberg, F.; Nurmohamed, M.; Wolbink, G.

"A PHASE II RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL of ORAL PREDNISOLONE in EARLY DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (PREDSS)","Background: A highly controversial question is whether or not corticosteroids should be prescribed for patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). Although the painful and disabling features of early dcSSc (including tight itchy skin, contractures, fatigue) have an infammatory basis and are likely to respond to corticosteroids, corticosteroids are a risk factor for potentially life-threatening scleroderma renal crisis. Objectives: Our aim was to examine safety and efficacy of moderate dose prednisolone in patients with early dcSSc. Specific objectives were to evaluate whether moderate dose prednisolone reduced pain and disability, and improved skin score, and whether prednisolone was safe with particular reference to renal function Methods: PRedSS set out as a Phase II, multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trial, converted to open-label because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Patients were randomised to receive either moderate dose prednisolone (approximately 0.3 mg/kg) or matching placebo (or no treatment during open-label) for 6 months. The co-primary endpoints were the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and modifed Rodnan skin core (mRSS) at 3 months. Over 20 secondary endpoints included patient reported outcome measures refecting pain, itch, anxiety and depression, fatigue and helplessness. 72 participants randomised 1:1 were planned and anticipated to yield 60 evaluable, giving over 80% power for each co-primary outcome in ANCOVA analyses [assumptions;HAQ-DI (a = 0.025, Ã´ =-0.6, o = 0.9, p = 0.6), mRSS (a = 0.025, Ã´ =-5.5, a = 8.2, p = 0.6)]. Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (week 6, month 3, month 6) were ftted with covariates trial arm, baseline score, anti-Scl-70 and their interactions with time point. An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed with the primary focus being the trial arm effect at 3 months. Results: The study terminated early due to the Covid-19 pandemic and consequently did not meet the recruitment target of 72 patients. Thirty-five patients (Table 1) were randomised (17 to prednisolone and 18 to placebo/control, 25 during the double-blind phase), of whom 34 completed the 3 month assessment. The adjusted mean difference between treatment groups at 3 months in HAQ-DI score was-0.10 (97.5% CI-0.29 to 0.10), p=0.25, and in mRSS-3.90 (97.5% CI-8.83 to 1.03), p=0.070, both favouring prednisolone but not signifcantly. Patients in the prednisolone group experienced less pain, helplessness and anxiety than control patients at 3 months: mean difference in pain scores-0.49, 95%CI (-0.93 to-0.06), p=0.027, in Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) anxiety scores-2.05, 95%CI (-3.73 to-0.37), p=0.018, and in helplessness scores-1.54, 95%CI (-3.01 to-0.07), p=0.040. There were no renal crises. Conclusion: PRedSS exemplifed the challenges of running a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product potentially associated with increased infection risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. Because PRedSS was terminated prior to target recruitment, it was underpowered, and any conclusions have to be extremely cautious. Although PRedSS suggested some beneft from moderate dose predni-solone, the small sample indicates the need for a further randomised trial.","Griffiths-Jones, D.; Sylvestre Garcia, Y.; Ryder, D.; Pauling, J.; Hall, F.; Lanyon, P.; Mason, J.; Denton, C.

"VACCINATION AGAINST COVID-19 SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED in PATIENTS with RHEUMATIC DISEASE, AS MOST PATIENTS DEVELOP A SEROLOGICAL RESPONSE AGAINST the VACCINE and VACCINATION REDUCES SELF-IMPOSED ISOLATION and SHIELDING BEHAVIOR","Background: Vaccine trials of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were encouraging but excluded most patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) and patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy. However, reports of a more severe COVID-19 disease course in patients with RDs prompted strategies for expediting vaccination of RD patients in most countries. In addition to the impact experienced by most people of the pandemic, patients with RDs were adversely impacted by the potential risk of severe COVID-19 due to their disease and immunosuppressive treatment. Fear of COVID-19 led to disproportionate anxiety, self-isolation, and shielding behavior for many RD patients at the beginning of the pandemic. Objectives: We investigated antibody levels in serum against SARS-CoV-2 after a two-dose vaccination with an mRNA vaccine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Further, we examined the association between reactogenicity and immunogenicity and how vaccination influenced patient behavior concerning fear of COVID-19 and shielding. Methods: Patients with SLE or RA from the COPANARD (Corona PANdemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease)1 cohort received two doses of an mRNA vaccine between January and August 2021 and had total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 measured before vaccination and 2 and 9 weeks after the second vaccination. In addition, patients answered an electronic questionnaire before and eight weeks after vaccination concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-9). Results: Three-hundred-and-three patients and 44 blood donors (healthy controls) were included. Signifcantly fewer patients (90%) had measurable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 compared to blood donors (100%) after the second vaccination (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 1). Treatment with Rituximab was the strongest predictor of unfavorable vaccine response, as only 27% were seropositive after vaccination. We found a negative effect of prednisone and methotrexate but no effect of age, comorbidity, or pausing medication on seroconversion. Patients experienced signifcant improvement after vaccination in 10 out of 12 questions regarding behavior and fear of COVID-19, but no change was observed in symptoms of depression (p=0.62) or anxiety (p=0.46). Conclusion: The majority of patients with SLE or RA had a measurable sero-logical response to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine after two doses. Treatment with Rituximab was the strongest predictor of no seroconversion. Our fndings warrant encouragement of vaccination against COVID-19 for patients with RD, as most patients benefts with both a serological immune response and reduced isolation and shielding behavior.","AmmitzbÃ¸ll, C.; Thomsen, M.

"IMPACT of the COVID19 PANDEMIC on the SOCIAL BEHAVIOR of PATIENTS with RHEUMATIC DISEASES","Background: Depression in rheumatic diseases negatively influences the support network and the perception of company of these patients (1). Objectives: To describe how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the social activ-itiesn patients with chronic rheumatic diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erithematosus (SLE) and Spondyloarthritis (SpA). Methods: Design: Observational, longitudinal study of a series of patients. Patients: RA (ACR/EULAR 2010 classifcation), SpA (ASAS/EULAR 2010 criteria), and SLE (ACR 1997 criteria) patients, age = 18 years. Questionaries for the evaluation of participation in social activities is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) v2.0 Short-Form (8 items, PROMIS-APS) at baseline (OCT to DEC 2019) and after 18 months of pandemic (SEP to DEC 2021) were performed. Variables evaluated were: social activities in terms of various factors, such as satisfaction with social roles mobility, depression, companiony social isolation, emotional support, instrumental support, support via information and ability to participate in social activities. All the variables were evaluated using the PROMIS questionnaire with quantitative scores. We also recorded demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data. Statistical analysis: Multivariate Linear Regression (Dependent variable: PROMIS ability to participate in social activities 18 months COVID19) was performed. Results: We recruited 91 patients, 31 (34.1%) RA, 30 (33%) SpA y 30 (33%) SLE. The 3 groups were well balanced in terms of clinical-epidemiological characteristics, except that patients with SLE were younger (mean 45 years) than patients with RA (53 years) and SpA (55 years) (p = 0.004) and because most of the patients with RA and SLE were women (97%) compared to those with SpA (60%) (p &lt;0.001). There was a worsening after 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic in the mean scores of the PROMIS for: satisfaction of the social role (26.9 Â± 8.7 vs 25.3 Â± 8.4;0.046), depression (14.7 Â± 7, 6 vs 16.1 Â± 8.4;p = 0.044) and for the ability to participate in social activities (27.7 Â± 7. 2 vs 26.1 Â± 6.8;p = 0.020). By diagnoses, the ability to participate in social activities was very similarbetween the different groups except for worse mobility in patients with RA and SpA compared to SLE, both at baseline and at 18 months of the pandemic. SLE patients worsened more after 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic in social role satisfaction, depression, instrumental support and ability to participate in social activities. In the multivariate analysis, the ability to participate in social activities at 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic was inversely associated with the diagnosis of SLE compared to the rest (ÃŸ [95% CI],-2.60 [-4.62-0.58];p = 0.012) and depression (ÃŸ [95% CI],-0.23 [-0.39,-0.08];p = 0.004);and directly with social role satisfaction (ÃŸ [95% CI], 0.18 [0.10-0.35];p = 0.031), mobility (ÃŸ [95% CI], 0.13 [0.07-0.20];p = 0.001) and company (ÃŸ [95% CI], 0.32 [0.11-0.60];p = 0.023). Conclusion: At baseline evaluation, social activities were affected by the impact of rheumatic disease. After 18 months of the pandemic-COVID19, patients with RA and SPA remain stable but SLE patients signifcantly worsened their social role and depression.","Cano Garcia, L.; Manrique Arija, S.; Vera RodrÃ­guez, M.; Redondo, R.; Romero-Barco, C.

"PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACTS of the COVID-19 PANDEMIC on ETHIOPIAN and CANADIAN RHEUMATOLOGY PATIENTS","Background: The Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased psychosocial distress in the general population and in patients with rheumatic disease. Limited data exists on the impact of COVID-19 in rheumatology patients living in Africa. Objectives: To describe COVID-19 related illness and psychosocial impact in Ethiopian (ET) rheumatology patients attending the only public rheumatology clinic in Ethiopia (Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TAH) in Addis Ababa). To compare fndings in ET with fndings in Canadian (CA) rheumatology patients. Methods: Between May 1 and Oct 31 2021, 130 patients attending the TAH rheumatology clinic answered questions related to COVID-19 infection, symptoms and testing, and psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7;GAD7), COVID-19 stress factors and coping measures, Resilience (Brief Resilience Scale-BRS) and medication compliance (Morisky medication adherence scale-4 item;MAS4). Rheumatic disease severity was assessed with the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data-3 (RAPID-3). Questionnaires were translated to Amharic. Descriptive statistics are reported [mean (standard deviation), median (25%, 75%) number and percent.)] and compared to data of 97 CA patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus patients from Quebec1. Results: ET patients were mainly female (71%) with a mean (SD) age of 47 (16), and resided in the capital city (Addis Ababa) (72%). Half had RA or lupus. A quarter of patients had moderate to severe rheumatic disease severity desite good medication adherence [MAS4 score of 3(2,4)]. Most (89%) reported no COVID-19 symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic, were not tested for COVID-19 and reported few risk factors for COVID-19 exposure. Eight (6%) ETs were diagnosed with COVID-19;2 required hospitalization. Diagnosed patients reported a median of 2 COVID-19 symptoms (range 0-8;mainly cough, fever and malaise). Within the entire cohort, depression (PHQ9= 10 or above) and anxiety (GAD7=10 or above) were more frequent in ETs than CAs (depression 30% vs 3%;anxiety 16% vs 1%) yet nearly half (47%) of ETs had normal or high resilience levels. The most common COVID-19 stressors were risk of contracting COVID illness personally [ETs vs CAs risk ratio(95% confdence limits-CL);0.67 (0.5, 0.99)] or of loved one [0.56 (0.36, 0.86)]. More ETs reported COVID-19 related stress related to difficulty obtaining food, medicine or other essentials [1.74, (1.00-3.0)], and getting needed supports [1.97 (1.03, 3.77)] (Table 1). CAs and ETs used similar levels of problem solving [median (25%,75%) CA 3.3 (2.8, 3.3), ET 3.5 (3.0, 3.7)] and emotion-focus [CA 2.5 (2.2, 3.1);ET 3.3 (2.8, 3.7)] coping strategies. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, depression was more common in ETs compared to CAs with rheumatic disease. COVID-19-related stressors due to insecurity in obtaining the basic essentials and support were more pronounced in ETs. Differences between ETs and CA in these stressors may refect local public health and economic supports. There were no differences in coping strategies.","Hitchon, C.; Dacosta, D.; Abdissa Adugna, B.; Bernatsky, S.; Colmegna, I.; Demelash, B.; Fortin, P.; Meltzer, M.; Mendel, A.; Scuccimarri, R.; Melkie, A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.443","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases; 81:1663, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37541,""
"COVID-19 VACCINATION INTENTION among TUNISIAN HEALTH CARE WORKERS","Background: Health care workers (HCW) are the soldiers in the forefront of the fght against the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It is therefore a priority target group in the COVID-19 vaccination process. Objectives: Our purpose was to assess the COVID-19 vaccination intentions of Tunisian HCW and the reason for fear in case of hesitancy. Methods: We conducted an anonymous online questionnaire in the months of May and June 2021among HCW via social networks. The data collected included demographic characteristics, vaccination intentions, and reasons of hesitancy. Results: Five-hundred HCW were included in the study. Participants were divided as follows: 74% doctors (15% seniors, 37% juniors, 22% interns), and 26% nurses. The mean age was 34 Â± 5 years [24-58]. Seventy-three percent of participants were female. A history of chronic illness was noted 150 HCW (30%). A psychiatric disease was noted in 105 participants (21%): anxiety disorder (62%), depression (33%), and bipolar disorder (5%). A treatment was prescribed in 63% of cases: anxiolytics (84.2%), antidepressants (16.6%), and neuroleptics (10%). Psychotherapy was prescribed in 47% of cases. A personal and family history of COVID-19 infection was noted in 50.4 and 55% of cases, respectively. The infection was mild in 91.2% of cases. Four-hundred and five HCW (81%) had the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Twenty participants (4%) refused the vaccine, and 75 (15%) were still hesitant. Vaccination hesitancy was linked to concerns about the safety of a rapidly-developed vaccine in 92% of cases: adverse reactions (95.8%), tolerance (75%), and efficacy (25%). Sixteen percent of hesitant respondents expressed concerns about the involvement of policy in vaccine development. Vaccines to avoid according to participants were: Astra Zeneca (62%), Synovac (26%), Sputnik (8%), and Pfzer (4%). Conclusion: The intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 reached 81% among Tunisian HCW. Acceptance of the vaccine, even among medically informed individuals, is based on a personal perception of the risks and benefts of vaccine safety. Hence the need for campaigns targeting both the general population and the HCW.","Hamdi, O.; Boudokhane, M.; Teyeb, Z.; Abdelaali, I.; Jomni, T.; Belakhal, S.; Dogui, M.

"PREVALENCE of FIBROMYALGIA in the RHEUMATOLOGY OPDS during COVID19 LOCKDOWN: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY","Background: In the challenging times of Covid 19, anxiety increased among the general population. Fibromyalgia patients are more at risk of developing anxiety in these difficult times. This might result in more frequent visits to the rheumatology clinics with an exacerbation of their chronic pain syndrome. Objectives: The main objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of FM in the rheumatology outpatients' clinics during the Covid 19 lockdown period (2020) and during the same period in the previous year (2019). Methods: A cross-sectional study is conducted through 5 rheumatology clinics located in the 3 biggest emirates of the country (3 in Dubai, 1 in Abu Dhabi and 1 in Sharjah) to detect the number and charachteristics of fbromyalgia from March 15 to May 15th2019, and March 15 to May 15th2020. Results: Total number of patients seen from march to May 2019 was 3480 out of them 55 were fbromyalgia patients with frequency 0.0158%. While from march to May 2020 total number of patients seen were 1355 out of them 66 were fbromy-algia patients with frequency 0.0487%. Figure 1 Descriptive analysis of fibromyalgia patients seen in the lockdown time March to May 2020 shows that;gender was 64 females 97%, 2 males 3%, profession 36 unemployed 54.5%, 28 white collar 42.4%, 2 blue collar 3%, Age minimum was 25 years, maximum 77 years, with mean 48.3Â±13 years.

"ESTABLISHING THE SAFETY OF OUTPATIENT RETROPERITONEAL SACROSPINOUS LIGAMENT FIXATION - A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEWAT A LARGE ACADEMIC HEALTHCARE CENTER","Introduction: With the strain placed on the medical system by the ongoing surges of the Covid-19 pandemic, inpatient surgery is often suspended, and same day discharge rates are increasing. Sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) is an apical suspension procedure performed retroperitoneally;retroperitoneal hemorrhage and nerve injury are potential severe complications. Given these risks, providers vary in their preference for same day discharge vs. routine overnight admission after this procedure. Objective: To establish the safety of outpatient SSLF and evaluate the frequency of complications identified during the hospital stay. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent SSLF by Urogynecologists at our large, academic institution between March 2018 and October 2021. Patients were identified from the Gynecologic Enhanced Recovery Surgical database, which includes all surgical patients in the department of OBGYN. The data was collected from the electronic medical record (EMR) to track compliance and outcomes in real time for quality improvement purposes during implementation of our enhanced recovery protocol. Institutional IRB approval was obtained. Descriptive statistics were performed. Student's t-test and two-sample tests-of-proportions were used, with a p-value &lt;0.05 denoting statistical significance. Results: A total of 165 patients underwent SSLF;23 were outpatient, and 142 were admitted for at least one night. Over 90% of patients in both groups identified as white, non-Hispanic, and English-speaking. The mean BMI for both groups was 28.8 kg/m2. The outpatient group was younger (57.9 years compared to 64.7 years;P = 0.0051);outpatients were more likely to have commercial insurance (P = 0.0143) and inpatients to have Medicare (P = 0.0282). Almost double the proportion of those in the inpatient group had anxiety and depression, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Outpatients were more likely to be never smokers (P = 0.0175) and use narcotics preoperatively (P = 0.0385). They had a lower mean ASA score (P = 0.0067), Charleston Comorbidity Index score (P = 0.0452), total length of surgery (P &lt; 0.001), total length of anesthesia (P &lt; 0.001), and estimated blood loss (P = 0.0142). Those who went home the same day were more likely to have been the first case (P = 0.0123), and same-day discharge rates increased significantly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic (P = 0.0039). Both complications that required operative intervention were identified in the post-anesthesia care unit on the day of surgery. Notably, 30-day post-operative complications were proportionally lower in the outpatient group, but this did not achieve significance. Most of the complications were urinary tract infections, including the sole complication identified in the outpatient group. Conclusions: With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and rapidly evolving practice patterns, it is important to establish the safety of outpatient surgery. Our study demonstrates that outpatient SSLF is safe for appropriately selected patients after routine post-operative monitoring including serial vital signs and assessment of neuropathic pain. Severe complications requiring reoperation can often be identified immediately after surgery. Thirty-day post-operative complication rates did not significantly differ between patients undergoing outpatient versus inpatient SSLF.","Murarka, S.; Butler, B.; Baker, M.; Holt, E.; Adam, R.","https://doi.org/10.1097/SPV.0000000000001202","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery; 28(6):S266-S267, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37544,""

"Abuse of Marginalized Older Adults during COVID-19: Proxy Findings from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging","Child and spousal abuse rates tend to increase during various disasters. This study sought to determine the prevalence and determinants of older adults' experiences of increased verbal or physical conflict (+VPC) as a proxy for elder abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data stem from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a prospective cohort study of 51,338 Canadians aged 45-85 at baseline. We analyzed the data of participants aged 55 or older at core follow-up 1 who also participated in a CLSA COVID-19 substudy (n = 24,306). Experiencing +VPC was the main outcome variable;explanatory variables included gender identity, sexual orientation, age group, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, household income, working status, living arrangement (alone vs. with others), social support availability, cohesion in the community, self-rated health, anxiety, depression, and previous history of elder abuse. The overall weighted prevalence of +VPC was 7.4%. Gay/bisexual men, 55-64 age group, living with others, low social support, poor social cohesion, low self-rated health, poor mental health, and history of psychological or physical abuse were each significantly associated with +VPC. Weighted multivariable logistic regression revealed that male gender, living with others, higher depression and anxiety scores, and a history of psychological abuse were independent predictors of +VPC. Implications for postpandemic recovery and prevention strategies during future disasters include targeted outreach programs for the most vulnerable group, which included males and younger older adults between 55 and 64 years as well as those with mental health issues and/or history of elder psychological abuse.","Gutman, G.; Karbakhsh, M.; Stewart, H.

"Disentangling the cognitive, physical, and mental health sequalae of COVID-19","Summary As COVID-19 cases exceed hundreds of millions globally, many survivors face cognitive challenges and prolonged symptoms. However, important questions about the cognitive impacts of COVID-19 remain unresolved. In this cross-sectional online study, 478 adult volunteers who self-reported a positive test for COVID-19 (M=30 days since most recent test) perform significantly worse than pre-pandemic norms on cognitive measures of processing speed, reasoning, verbal, and overall performance, but not short-term memory â€“ suggesting domain-specific deficits. Cognitive differences are even observed in participants that did not require hospitalisation. Factor analysis of health- and COVID-related questionnaires reveals two clusters of symptoms: one that varies mostly with physical symptoms and illness severity, and one with mental health. Cognitive performance is positively correlated with the global measure encompassing physical symptoms, but not the one that broadly described mental health, suggesting that the subjective experience of â€œlong COVIDâ€ relates to physical symptoms and cognitive deficits, especially executive dysfunction.","Wild, Conor J.; Norton, Loretta, Menon, David K.; Ripsman, David A.; Swartz, Richard H.; Owen, Adrian M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2022.100750","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cell Reports Medicine;: 100750, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37548,""

"All-solid-state paper-based potentiometric combined sensor modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and molecularly imprinted polymer for monitoring losartan drug in pharmaceuticals and biological samples","A cost-effective, highly selective and sensitive paper-based potentiometric combined sensor for losartan potassium drug (LOS) is fabricated, characterized and used for the drug monitoring. The sensor consists of 2Â strips of filter paper (20Â Ã—Â 5Â mm each) as platform, each imprinted with 4Â mm diameter circular spot of carbon. One carbon spot is covered by a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for use as a substrate for the recognition sensor and the other without rGO is used for the reference electrode. LOS molecularly imprinted drug polymer (MIP) is applied onto the graphene oxide containing strip to act as a drug recognition sensing material and a solid-state polyvinyl butyral (PVB) is applied onto the second carbon spot to act as a reference electrode. Performance characteristics of the combined sensor are examined with chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Increase effect of rGO on the interfacial double-layer capacitance of the sensing membrane and consequently on the potential stability is confirmed. The developed combined sensor (strip cell) displays a Nernstian slope of -58.2Â Â±Â 0.3Â mV/decade (R2Â =Â 0.9994) over the linear range 8.5Â Ã—Â 10-7 - 6.9Â Ã—Â 10-2Â M with a detection limit of 2.7Â Â±Â 0.3Â Ã—Â 10-7Â M. The sensor shows remarkable selectivity toward various related compounds especially those commonly used by the COVID-19 patients such as paracetamol, ascorbic acid and dextromethorphan. The assay method is validated and proved to be satisfactory for direct potentiometric determination of LOS-K in some pharmaceutical formulations and in spiked human urine samples. An average recovery of 96.3Â Â±Â 0.3â€“98.7Â Â±Â 0.6% of the nominal or spiked concentration and a mean relative standard deviation of Â±0.6% are obtained. The use of an indicating and a reference electrodes combined into a single flexible disposable paper platform enables applications to a minimum sample volume due to the close proximity of the responsive membrane and the liquid junction. The efficiency of the proposed sensor in complex urine matrix suggests its application in hospitals for rapid diagnosis of overdose patients and for quality control/quality assurance tests in pharmaceutical industry.","Hassan, Saad S.

"â€œLife will go on with the beauty of the rosesâ€: The moral dimensions of coping with distress through autobiographical writing during Covid-19","This article is based on our analysis of a subset of data from the Pandemic Journaling Project-Phase 1 (PJP-1). The PJP, a collective, on-line journaling platform, was co-founded by anthropologists Dr. Sarah S. Willen and Dr. Katherine A. Mason in 2020. It has provided individuals with dedicated anonymous and confidential space to document and share their lived experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic over time (May 2020â€“May 2022). We employ a case study approach to closely analyze the journal entries of one Guatemalan woman, whom we call Crescencia, from our broader sample of 50 participants writing from within Latin America. Our analysis suggests that the PJP-1 platform provided a valuable space for Crescencia to cope with the distress of Covid-19 by fostering practices of self-reflection and social connectivity. We assert that the process of collective and anonymous online journaling through a platform like PJP-1 may not only provide space for some people to strengthen their sense of agency despite the uncontrollable conditions of crisis, but may also constitute an informal network of care through the sharing and preservation of one's experiences during the pandemic. Our findings point to the potential of PJP-type platforms in psychosocial interventions and mental health care practice to support individuals, families, and communities coping with hardship and trauma, which may be a particularly effective approach in resource-poor contexts where mental health care is scarce or stigmatized. PJP-1 may also provide a valuable model for future research approaches to understanding coping and resilience in similar conditions where in-person, in vivo research may not be viable, such as during armed conflict or the aftermath of environmental disaster.","Parson, Nia C.; Wurtz, Heather, Lowrey, Meghan, Santos, Citâ€™Clatli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100156","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100156, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37551,""
"Mental health and sleep habits during preclinical years of medical school","Objectives The purpose of this non interventional study was to define changes in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality of medical students in their first two years of medical school while considering potential risk factors of self-reported chronic disease, sleep quantity, year of medical school and exercise habits. Since this study was ongoing during the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect was also evaluated. Participants /METHODS: A cohort of 197 medical students was evaluated longitudinally using survey methods to quantify changes from pre-medical school and summer break to each semester in medical school throughout years one and two. This study was performed from July 2019 through June 2021. Data was analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) on the numeric responses of General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Sleep Quality (SQ-3) and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additional assessments evaluated exercise habits, chronic disease, and impact of COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 Pandemic was evaluated directly in the model (pre- and post-COVID-19 period variable), and through additional questions on their perceived effect. Results Depression, anxiety, and sleep habits displayed a cyclical change that was associated with the academic/seasonal cycle. The COVID-19 pandemic was never found significant. Medical students who had a chronic disease diagnosis and fewer hours of sleep had increased severity. Exercise did not play a role. Conclusion Based on our sample, the main driver for depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality appears to be the academic/seasonal cycle, while the COVID-19 pandemic did not have an impact on mental health.","McKinley, Blake, Daines, Bryan, Allen, Mitchell, Pulsipher, Kayd, Zapata, Isain, Wilde, Benjamin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2022.09.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37552,""
"Unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: Role of the neighborhood environment","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people's mental wellbeing. Few studies have investigated how the neighborhood environment might help to moderate the mental health impact in a natural disaster context. We aim to investigate the unequal impact of the pandemic on mental health between different population groups, and the role of the neighborhood environment in alleviating this impact. We collected survey data (n=2,741) on mental health, neighborhood environment, and pandemic-related behaviors in Beijing metropolitan region between July 10 and 28, 2020, and then applied the partial proportional odds model. Overall, we found that the pandemic has disproportionately affected the lower-income people. The lower-income residents experienced a greater psychological impact than the higher-income residents. We further found that distance to an urban park was a key built environment variable that moderates mental health impact. Residents who lived near urban parks were 4.2 to 4.6% less likely to report an increase in negative emotions, and therefore are more resilient to the mental health impact. In addition to the built environment, a cohesive neighborhood environment may have also helped to mitigate the negative mental health impacts. These findings can inform planning policies that aim to promote healthy and resilient communities.","Ma, L.; Huang, Y.; Liu, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.104162","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustain Cities Soc; 87:104162, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37553,""
"TELEPSIQUIATRÃA: EL FUTURO YA ES PRESENTE","Resumen Este trabajo de revisiÃ³n analiza el estado de los conocimientos sobre la TelepsiquiatrÃ­a (TP) tras la crisis provocada por el COVID y la consiguiente necesidad de utilizar nuevas modalidades de atenciÃ³n. Se abordan seis aspectos inherentes a la TP: la satisfacciÃ³n de los pacientes y del personal de salud mental, la fiabilidad diagnÃ³stica, la eficacia de la intervenciÃ³n de la TP, la rentabilidad en tÃ©rminos de coste-oportunidad (o eficiencia) y los aspectos legales inherentes a la confidencialidad y la privacidad en particular y la actitud de los profesionales hacia la TP. La satisfacciÃ³n con el TP es aceptable tanto entre los pacientes como entre los profesionales, siendo estos Ãºltimos los mÃ¡s reacios. La fiabilidad diagnÃ³stica estÃ¡ demostrada, pero requiere de mÃ¡s estudios que confirmen esta fiabilidad en diferentes diagnÃ³sticos y entornos sanitarios. La eficacia de los tratamientos con TP no es inferior a la atenciÃ³n presencial, como se ha comprobado en psicoterapias especÃ­ficas. Por Ãºltimo, hay que destacar que la actitud del psiquiatra es el elemento mÃ¡s decisivo que limita o facilita la implantaciÃ³n del TP. This review paper analyzes the state of knowledge on Telepsychiatry (TP) after the crisis caused by COVID and the resulting need to use new modalities of care. Six essential aspects of TP are addressed: patientâ€™s and mental health staff satisfaction, diagnostic reliability, effectiveness of TP interventions, cost-effectiveness in terms of opportunity cost (or efficiency), legal aspects inherent to confidentiality and privacy in particular and the attitude of professionals towards TP. Satisfaction with TP is acceptable among both patients and professionals, the latter being the most reluctant. Diagnostic reliability has been demonstrated, but requires further studies to confirm this reliability in different diagnoses and healthcare settings.

"ValoraciÃ³n GeriÃ¡trica Integral de pacientes mayores y factores asociados de frecuentaciÃ³n en servicios de urgencias en la Era pre-covid19 - Un estudio portuguÃªs","Resumen Objetivos: Identificar factores asociados con usuarios frecuentadores (=3 ingresos/aÃ±o) en un departamento de urgencias (DU), mediante valoraciÃ³n geriÃ¡trica integral (VGI) y describir las caracterÃ­sticas de los pacientes mayores de 65 aÃ±os que acuden a urgencias. MÃ©todos: El estudio transversal se realizÃ³ entre Agosto/2017 y Junio/2018 en un DU de Lisboa, Portugal. Se realizÃ³ una VGI ademÃ¡s de la historia clÃ­nica. Se crearon scores clÃ­nicas, funcionales, mentales, sociales basÃ¡ndose en el protocolo de cuestionario del grupo de geriatrÃ­a de la Sociedad Portuguesa de Medicina Interna y se desarrollÃ³ un modelo estadÃ­stico para identificar los factores asociados con la alta frecuentaciÃ³n. Resultados: Se realizÃ³ una VGI a 426 usuarios mayores de un DU. La edad media fue de 79.3 aÃ±os, siendo 53,8% mujeres con un 84.7% de multimorbilidad, 51,2% de dependencia de las actividades bÃ¡sicas (KATZ), 75,6% instrumentales (Lawton &lt; 5 en mujeres, &lt;3 hombres y 40% de dependencia de la marcha (Holden).

Un modelo de regresiÃ³n logÃ­stica fue dÃ©bil, pero mostrÃ³ que los pacientes con polifarmacia, Ã­ndice de comorbilidad de Charlson elevado y un estado nutricional adverso presentaban mayor riesgo de ser usuarios frecuentes. Conclusiones: El 97,1% de los pacientes tenÃ­an necesidades que justificarÃ­an un plan de intervenciÃ³n especÃ­fico. Si bien no proporciona un modelo sÃ³lido, nuestro estudio ha indicado problemas nutricionales, polifarmacia y un Ã­ndice de Charlson elevado como las caracterÃ­sticas que se asocian con ser frecuentador del servicio de urgÃªncias. Objectives: Identifying frequent usersâ€™ (=3 admissions/year) associated factors in an emergency department (ED), using a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), describing the characteristics of patients over 65 years of age. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed between August 2017 and June 2018 in an ED in Lisbon, Portugal. CGA was applied and completed with clinical records. Clinical, functional, mental and social scores were created based in Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine, and a statistical model was developed. Results: CGA was applied to 426 patients over 64 years old in an ED. The mean age was 79.3, 84.7% had multimorbidity. 51.2%, 75.6%, and 40% had dependence on basic, instrumental, and walking activities, respectively. 52% had depressive symptoms, 65.7% had cognitive impairment, 63% were undernourished/at risk for malnutrition. 33.1% were socially at risk. Polypharmacy was present with a use on average of 6.5 drugs daily. Social, clinical, functional, and mental scores were unfavourable in 48.6%, 79.6%, 54.9% and 83.1% of the population, respectively. There were 2.7 hospital admissions/year and 39.9% were frequent ED users (=3/year). The logistic regression model was weak, but showed that patients with polypharmacy, elevated Charlson Comorbidity index and an impairment nutritional status presented higher risk of being frequent users. Conclusions: This study showed that 97.1% of patients had needs that would justify an interventional care plan. This intervention should be extended to primary care and nursing homes. While not providing a robust model, our study has indicated nutritional problems, polypharmacy, and an elevated Charlson index as the features with more weight in frequent usersâ€™ admissions.","Pulido, Isabel, Nunes, Carla, Botelho, AmÃ¡lia, Lopes, Manuel, Martins, SÃ³nia, TomÃ©, Luis, Dinis, Francisco, Boto, Paulo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2022.08.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista EspaÃ±ola de GeriatrÃ­a y GerontologÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37555,""
"COVID-19 y telepsiquiatrÃ­a: un reto para el tratamiento de la salud mental","Resumen IntroducciÃ³n Debido a la pandemia de la COVID-19, la atenciÃ³n psiquiÃ¡trica presencial ha disminuido, pero las enfermedades mentales han aumentado, como es el caso del trastorno de estrÃ©s postraumÃ¡tico, la ansiedad, la depresiÃ³n, los sÃ­ntomas obsesivo-compulsivos o el insomnio, entre otros. El objetivo es describir la utilidad, las ventajas, las desventajas y las limitaciones de la telemedicina en la atenciÃ³n clÃ­nica de pacientes psiquiÃ¡tricos antes y durante la pandemia de la COVID-19. MÃ©todos Se realiza una bÃºsqueda crÃ­tica en plataformas como PubMed, Cochrane, Lilacs y Google acadÃ©mico, ademÃ¡s de una exhaustiva evaluaciÃ³n de todos los estudios primarios que dan respuesta a nuestras preguntas. Resultados La telepsiquiatrÃ­a puede ayudar a solventar la necesidad de atenciones psiquiÃ¡tricas de manera mÃ¡s integral;tiene ventajas como la disminuciÃ³n de costos, permite brindar atenciÃ³n a zonas rurales, su eficacia es comparable a la atenciÃ³n presencial y resulta adecuada en mÃºltiples Ã¡reas de la salud mental, permite la reducciÃ³n del estigma y realizar procesos de formaciÃ³n continua del personal mÃ©dico. En el contexto de la pandemia, permite disminuir el riesgo de contagio al mantener las medidas de bioseguridad. Pero tambiÃ©n tiene limitaciones, como el cobro de seguros mÃ©dicos, las consultas obligatoriamente presenciales por exÃ¡menes o procedimientos, la dificultad al formar la relaciÃ³n mÃ©dico-paciente, las dudas sobre cÃ³mo obtener el consentimiento informado y mantener la privacidad del paciente, la dificultad para controlar el ambiente donde el paciente tendrÃ¡ la consulta â€”que puede darse en lugares inadecuadosâ€”, ciertas poblaciones que no se beneficiarÃ­an de la telepsiquiatrÃ­a y zonas donde hay una mayor brecha digital, lo que tambiÃ©n la dificulta. Al analizar estas ventajas y desventajas, se puede realizar recomendaciones a la hora de considerar la telepsiquiatrÃ­a como una opciÃ³n de atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica. Introduction Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person psychiatric care decreased, but mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive symptoms and insomnia increased. Our objective was to describe the usefulness, advantages, disadvantages and limitations of telemedicine used in psychiatric patientsâ€™ clinical care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A critical search was carried out on platforms such as PubMed, Cochrane, Lilacs and academic Google, in addition to an in-depth assessment of all the primary studies that answer our questions. Results Telepsychiatry is a tool that can help resolve the need for psychiatric care in a more comprehensive way. Advantages include cost reduction, enabling care provision to rural areas, the fact that its effectiveness is comparable to in-person care and its use is suitable in a variety of scenarios, and also that it helps reduce stigma and enables continuous training processes among medical staff. In the context of the current pandemic, it reduces the risk of transmission by maintaining biosecurity measures. However, there are also limitations in its use, such as the collection of medical insurance payments, mandatory in-person visits for examinations or procedures, difficulty in developing a doctor-patient relationship, and uncertainty about how to give informed consent and maintain the patient's privacy. Additionally, there is the difficulty in controlling the patient's environment, with the risk of the consultation taking place somewhere inappropriate, and the fact that there are certain populations which would not benefit from the use of telepsychiatry and areas where its use is made difficult by a greater digital gap. Based on these advantages and disadvantages, recommendations can be made when considering telepsychiatry as a medical care option.","Romo, Damaris Urquizo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2022.08.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37556,""
"Prevalencia y factores asociados con las quejas cognitivas subjetivas del personal sanitario latinoamericano durante la pandemia de COVID-19","Resumen IntroducciÃ³n y objetivos: Se ha observado un incremento de alteraciones emocionales y quejas sobre el rendimiento cognitivo en el personal sanitario latinoamericano durante la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2;lo cual puede afectar a las capacidades de atenciÃ³n y aumentar los niveles de estrÃ©s y burnout de estos profesionales. El objetivo es analizar las quejas cognitivas subjetivas (QCS) y los factores asociados en el personal sanitario durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en 5 paÃ­ses de AmÃ©rica Latina. MÃ©todos: Estudio transversal multicÃ©ntrico que incluyÃ³ a 3.738 profesionales de Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia y PerÃº. Se utilizÃ³ la Escala de Trastorno de Ansiedad Generalizada (GAD-7) y el Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) para valorar la depresiÃ³n y el Mini-Z para evaluar el burnout. Para las QCS se usÃ³ un Ã­tem sobre preocupaciones cognitivas en atenciÃ³n y memoria. Resultados: Se observÃ³ una prevalencia de queja cognitiva del 69,2%. Los factores asociados con un mayor riesgo de QCS fueron las puntuaciones en GAD-7, PHQ y Mini-Z, ademÃ¡s de ser parte del personal de salud del Ecuador. Conclusiones: La prevalencia de QCS en el personal sanitario es alta y estÃ¡ modulada por estados emocionales y estrÃ©s. Background and objectives: An increase in emotional disturbances and complaints about cognitive performance has been observed in Latin American healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which can affect attention capacity and increase the levels of stress and burnout of these professionals. The objective was to analyse subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) and associated factors in health personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic in five Latin American countries. Methods: Multicentre cross-sectional study, which included 3,738 professionals from Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression, and the Mini-Z to assess Burnout. For the SCC, an item on cognitive concerns in attention and memory was used. Results: The prevalence of cognitive complaints was 69.2%. The factors associated with a higher risk of SCC were the scores in the GAD-7, PHQ and Mini-Z, in addition to being part of the Ecuadorian health personnel. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of SCC in health personnel, which is modulated by emotional states and stress.","Soto-AÃ±ari, Marcio, Rivera-FernÃ¡ndez, Claudia, Ramos-Vargas, Luis, Denegri-Solis, LucÃ­a, Herrera-Pino, Jorge, Camargo, Loida, Castillo, Edgar, DÃ­az, MarÃ­a, GaitÃ¡n-Quintero, Gustavo, Alonso, MÃ³nica, CÃ¡rdenas, Omar, Pabon-Moreno, Alexander, Caldichoury, Nicole, Ramos-Henderson, Miguel, Florez, Yuliana, Escorcia-Villarreal, Jahaira, Ripoll-CÃ³rdoba, Daniela, Quispe-Ayala, CÃ©sar, Gargiulo, Pascual A.; Porto, MarÃ­a F.; LÃ³pez, Norman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2022.07.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37557,""
"A rare case of catatonia associated with COVID-19 infection","COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has well-documented common symptoms such as cough and fever. There is extensive documentation on the more severe outcomes, such as sepsis and death. However, there is minimal literature regarding the neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19. This case report outlines a patient who presented with apparent psychosis shortly after COVID-19 infection. Shortly after hospitalization, she began to develop symptoms of catatonia. Her catatonia subsequently was recognized and resolved with appropriate treatment with lorazepam. There have been a handful of similar reports regarding patients with COVID-19 developing catatonia and responding well to lorazepam. Therefore, catatonia may be associated with COVID-19. Clinicians should consider catatonia diagnosis in patients with COVID-19 who have changes in behaviour, mental status, or motor function to prevent deterioration secondary to untreated catatonia. Furthermore, COVID-19 testing should be considered in patients with acute psychiatric presentations.","Styan, Tara, Lee, Julian, Wang, Jay","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycr.2022.100054","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Case Reports;: 100054, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37558,""
"Long-COVID or long before? Neurocognitive deficits in people with COVID-19","In connection with COVID-19 disease, evidence of persisting psychiatric and neurocognitive effects is accumulating. To examine long COVID symptoms, baseline data from 2015 and follow-up data from 2021 from 428 participants were compared. Participants with COVID-19 reported more subjective neurocognitive complaints in the follow-up, but this did not correspond to the test performance. Also, greater depressive symptoms compared with the no-COVID group were reported. However, these complaints must be put into perspective when considering the baseline data, since complaints were present before the COVID infection. Thus, premorbid performance as well as psychological factors should be considered when discussing long COVID.","Baumeister, Anna, GÃ¶ritz, Anja S.; Benoy, Charles, Jelinek, Lena, Moritz, Steffen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114822","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114822, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37559,""
"The risk of eviction and the mental health outcomes among the US adults","Although past studies establish a link between residential instability and poor mental health, studies investigating the association between perceived risk of eviction and mental health with nationally representative data are largely lacking. This study examines the association between self-reported risk of eviction and anxiety, depression, and prescription medication use for mental or emotional health reasons. This is a retrospective observational study using the repeated-cross sectional data (nÂ =Â 14548;unweighted) using the US Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey from July 2021 to March 2022. Survey respondents aged 18Â years and above who lived in rented residences and were not caught up with the rent payments at the time of the survey were included in the analysis. The descriptive summary shows a higher prevalence of depression (59.33Â % vs 37.01Â %), anxiety (67.01Â % vs 43.28Â %), and prescription medication use (26.57Â % vs 23.68Â %) among the respondents who are likely to face eviction in the next two months compared to the reference group not at the risk of eviction. When adjusted for demographic characteristics, family context, and socioeconomic setting, the odds of depression, anxiety, and prescription medication use in the at-risk eviction group were significantly higher than in the reference group. Specifically, odds ratios (ORs) [95Â % CI] for depression, anxiety, and prescription medication use are 2.366 [2.364, 2.369], 2.650 [2.648, 2.653], and 1.172 [1.171, 1.174], respectively. These results suggest that the perceived risk of eviction is associated with elevated mental health problems. Addressing the housing crisis may help decrease the mental health burden among rented households.","Acharya, Binod, Bhatta, Dependra, Dhakal, Chandra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101981","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports; 29:101981, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37560,""
"Autonomy support buffers the impact of self-criticism on depression","The current study examined the associations among self-criticism, perceptions of autonomy support, and depression prior to and during the onset of the Covid pandemic. 283 students at a large Canadian university participated in a goal related study, and completed questionnaires assessing personality, autonomy support, and depressive symptoms starting in September of 2019 and ending in May of 2020. The results showed that self-criticism was associated with increases in depressive symptomatology, and that autonomy support was inversely associated with depression. The results also showed that autonomy support moderated the effect of self-criticism on depression such that individuals with higher baseline self-criticism who perceived high levels of autonomy support reported lower levels of depression during the beginning of the pandemic. These results confirm the deleterious impact of selfcriticism and the potential benefits of autonomy support. The presence of autonomy support appears to buffer those who are high in self-criticism from increased depressive symptoms. These results have important clinical implications, suggesting the need to address the perniciousness of self-criticism and the need to develop innovative ways to enhance the delivery of autonomy support.","Powers, Theodore A.; Moore, Emily, Levine, Shelby, Holding, Anne, Zuroff, David C.; Koestner, Richard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2022.111876","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences; 200:111876, 2023.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37561,""
"Seafarersâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: an examination of current supportive measures and their perceived effectiveness","As the current COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting crew change crisis exacerbates the mental health problem faced by seafarers, various maritime stakeholders have mobilised their resources and strengths to provide a variety of supportive measures to address the issue. This paper aims to find out what measures have been adopted in the industry and how widely they have been experienced/received by seafarers and evaluate their effectiveness. To achieve this aim, this research employed a mixed methods design involving qualitative interviews with 26 stakeholders and a quantitative questionnaire survey of 817 seafarers. The research identified a total number of 22 mental health support measures, all of which were perceived to have contributed positively to seafarersâ€™ mental health. However, not all of them were widely available to or utilised by seafarers. The findings also highlighted the importance of family, colleagues, shipping companies, and government agencies, as they are associated with the most effective support measures, namely communication with family, timely crew changes, being prioritised for vaccination, being vaccinated, and a positive and collegial atmosphere on-board. Based on the findings, recommendations are provided.","Tang, Lijun, Abila, Sanley, Kitada, Momoko, Malecosio, Serafin, Montes, Karima Krista","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105276","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Marine Policy;: 105276, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37562,""

"How the COVID-19 pandemic divides society: Towards a better understanding of differences between supporters and opponents of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Germany","Implemented COVID-19 containment measures have been fiercely discussed in Germany and corona-related protests have emerged. We assessed mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany and aimed at detecting factors differentiating opponents and supporters of the COVID-19 containment measures. Using a cross-sectional online survey (nÂ =Â 1219) with a mixed-methods approach, we found increased levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms (PHQ-4 and GAD-7), overall lower well-being (WHO-5), worsened sleep, increased prevalence of interpersonal violence (5.2%) as well as more pronounced irritability including anger and aggression compared to pre-COVID-19 times for all participants. Moreover, opponents demonstrated a more pronounced mental burden with more depression and anxiety, more anger and coping difficulties compared to supporters. In line with previous research, we found opponents to be well-educated, financially stable and strongly estranged by their political institutions. Additionally, applying regression analysis, we found anxiety and negative self-concept to differentiate between opponents and supporters of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Qualitative data confirms an increase in mental burden. Taken together, we identify a more vulnerable group opposing COVID-19 containment measures. Our results inform the public about opponents' motives, concerns and needs and open another perspective on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related containment measures.","Jung, Stefanie, KrÃ¼ger, Tillmann H.

"Perceived Discrimination and Mental Health: The Role of Immigrant Social Connectedness during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 public health emergency has led to changes in people's attitudes towards minority groups, increasing prejudice and discriminatory behaviors, especially towards migrants. These prejudicial attitudes and discrimination negatively influence migrantsâ€™ mental health increasing anxiety and depression and loneliness. However, the sense of belonging can be beneficial in mitigating these mental health issues especially in adverse social situations. Within this context, the aim of the study was to examine to what extent overall social connectedness plays a role in immigrant mental health during the COVID-19 crisis, hypothesizing that reduced sense of belonging to the social world will be part of the pathway from the negative effects of perceived discrimination on mental health during the pandemic. We recruited 104 immigrants from Greece who completed online self-report measures of perceived discrimination, social connectedness, depression, anxiety, paranoia, and loneliness, and conducted mediation analyses to test our predictions. Mediation models indicated that perceived discrimination has a negative impact on sense of belonging, which in turn increases anxiety and paranoia symptoms. Findings suggest that while perceived discrimination has a negative impact on mental health, this effect is less severe if participants remain socially connected. Results are discussed with regard to the need for social inclusion practices.","Brance, K.; Chatzimpyros, V.; Bentall, R.

"Managing two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern emergency departments in Paris: COVIDORG II","Summary Context At the end of the 1st lockdown, we thought the COVID-19 pandemic was over. Yet, we had to deal with other successive waves. Objective To analyze our strategies for managing the 2nd and 3rd waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Descriptive and observational study in two emergency departments in the North of Paris (Bichat and LariboisiÃ¨re hospitals) over the period from May 01, 2020, to May 31, 2021. Results Analysis of our activity during the study period revealed that less than 5% of patients treated for COVID-19 pneumonia in our 2 hospitals had died. Two explanations for this observation: on the one hand, a better knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of the disease;And on the other hand, a weapon to effectively prevent severe forms, hospitalizations, and deaths: the vaccine. Yet, 1 year after the pandemic, we continued to see sustained activity partly related to COVID-19, but also for other consultation reasons. And unlike the first wave, the number of caregivers has been significantly reduced due to exhaustion. It is also important to highlight the psychological impact of COVID-19 with a number of suicide attempts doubling during our study period. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has weakened the buildings of our health care system. Today, the burden of emergency care rests on a limited number of professionals.

RÃ©sultats Lâ€™analyse de notre activitÃ© au cours de la pÃ©riode dâ€™Ã©tude a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© que moins de 5Â % des patients traitÃ©s pour une pneumonie Ã  COVID-19Â dans nos 2Â hÃ´pitaux Ã©taient dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©s. Deux explications Ã  ce constatÂ : dâ€™une part, une meilleure connaissance des mÃ©canismes physiologiques de la maladieÂ ;et dâ€™autre part, une arme pour prÃ©venir efficacement les formes graves, les hospitalisations, et les dÃ©cÃ¨sÂ : le vaccin.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cataract surgery wait times in the Alberta Health Servicesâ€™ Edmonton Zone were studied by examining the wait times before and during the pandemic. Methods : This study was conducted based on a retrospective population-based design. Data was compiled from a centralized database related to hospital-based cataract surgery (Royal Alexandra, Fort Saskatchewan, and Westview Health Centre) between April 2019 and March 2022 (i.e., three fiscal years). Results : The average wait time for cataract surgery increased from 14.4Â±1.4 weeks in 2019/20 to 18.2Â±2.7 weeks in 2020/21 (p=0.005) and then decreased to 11.5Â±1.3 in 2021/22 (p&lt;0.001). The completed surgeries decreased from 13,103 in 2019/20 to 9,308 (p=0.09) and 10,365 (p=0.1) during the next two years. The annual operating room time for scheduled cases was reduced to 4,463 hours (p=0.42) and 4,552 hours (p=0.15) during the pandemic compared to 5,541 hours before the pandemic. However, the average waitlist size decreased from 6,629 at the end of 2019/20 to 6,122 (p=0.029) and 4,011 (p&lt;0.001) during the next two years. Conclusion : The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significantly increased average wait times for elective cataract surgery during the first year of the pandemic. Due to the reduction of the waitlist size, the wait times decreased during the second year of the pandemic.","Eshghi, Saeed Reza Toghi, Cheema, Marvi, Damji, Karim F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjo.2022.09.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37567,""
"The impact of psychological flexibility on family dynamics amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal perspective","Background Health risks associated with contracting COVID-19, stay-at-home orders, and pandemic-related economic and social hardships created unique challenges for individuals throughout the pandemic, and in particular for families whose daily routines were disrupted at the start of the pandemic. This study applied a contextual behavioral science lens to Family Systems Theory to examine the impact of COVID-19 stressors on family and individual functioning. Methods A sample of 742 coparents (86% married/engaged;84% Caucasian;71% female;MÂ =Â 40.7 years old, SDÂ =Â 8.1;MincomeÂ =Â $82,435, SDincomeÂ =Â $27,604) of school-aged children (5â€“18 years old) completed a baseline survey from late March to late April 2020. Of the initial sample, 556 coparents completed weekly diaries for 8 weeks. Results Mediation models were tested within a multilevel path modeling framework to evaluate both the stable, between-family differences (i.e., at level 2) and the within-family changes from week to week (i.e., at level 1). Across both levels of the model, parent psychological inflexibility was robustly linked to poorer functioning across all levels of the family system, showing direct links to a majority of the processes assessed. The results further supported a top-down spillover cascade in which parent inflexibility was proximally linked to greater COVID-19 related stress and parent depressive symptoms, which were proximally linked to poorer romantic functioning (greater negative conflict, lower satisfaction), which were proximally linked to poorer family functioning (greater coparent discord and family chaos), which were proximally linked to poorer parenting (greater angry/reactive parenting), which was proximally linked to greater child distress. Multi-group models suggested that the results were largely stable across (1) parent race (white vs non-white), (2) family size (1 child vs 2 or more), (3) child age (less than 10 years old vs 10 or older), (4) parent age (under 40 vs. 40 or older), (5) perceived COVID-19 risk, (6) parent gender (mothers vs fathers), (7) household income groups (less than $100k vs $100k or more), and (8) perceived economic stress/uncertainty (low vs high). However, a handful of moderated effects emerged from those multi-group models suggesting that fathers might be slightly more prone to negative spillover effects across the family systems and that wealthier families might have experienced the stress of new demands (e.g., homeschooling, remote working) as more disruptive. Conclusions Results highlight the crucial role parental psychological flexibility and inflexibility play in families managing the stress of COVID-19, as well as key mechanisms for how those stressors may either reverberate or become dampened throughout the family system.","Daks, Jennifer S.; Peltz, Jack S.; Rogge, Ronald D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.08.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37568,""
"Concern About Past Trauma Among Nursing Home Admissions: Report From Screening 722 Admissions","Objective Major life changes can trigger a traumatic stress response in older adults causing trauma symptoms to resurface. In 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the requirement, without specific guidance, for trauma-informed care (TIC) as part of person-centered care in long-term care. Design Observational, cross-sectional. Setting and Participants A total of 722 new admissions at one nursing home in metro Atlanta between November 2019 and JulyÂ 2021. Methods We developed a â€œTRAUMAâ€ framework for TIC screening based on Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration resources. The admissions nurse conducted TIC screening within 48Â hours of new admissions, including reported trauma and necessary modifications to care plans. Demographic information was derived from electronic records. Analysis included independent sample t-tests, binary logistic regression, and <U+03C7>2 tests. All data were analyzed using SPSS v.Â 28. Results Of 722 new admissions, 45 (6.2%) indicated experiencing trauma. There was no significant association with being Black or non-White and experiencing trauma, but there was a significant association with being female and experiencing trauma (<U+03C7>2 (1)Â = 5.206, PÂ = .022). Only men reported child physical abuse and war trauma and only women reported adult sexual assault, child sexual assault, adult domestic violence, school or community violence, adult nonintimate partner violence, and other trauma. There was a small, significant negative association of age and trauma (ÃŸÂ =Â -0.037;SEÂ = 0.11;P &lt; .001). The most-reported trauma category was medical trauma, including COVID-related trauma. More than half (51%) requested spiritual intervention and only 2 requested medical intervention with medication as initial interventions. Conclusions and Implications Our experience suggests that knowing the patient and their trauma history allowed the admissions nurse and interdisciplinary care team to modify the person-centered care plan to best meet the patient's needs. Our results also emphasize the need for using universal trauma precautions in all interactions.","Bender, Alexis A.; Chozom, Tashi, Saiyed, Sahebi A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2022.06.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association; 23(9):1499-1502, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37569,""
"Adolescent US Poison Center Exposure Calls During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose The objective of this study was to evaluate trends and characteristics in adolescent poison center (PC) exposure calls before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A retrospective review of PC calls for adolescents aged 13â€“17Â years from January 1, 2018 through June 30,Â 2021. Results During the pandemic, US PCs had a higher proportion of adolescent exposure calls managed in a healthcare facility (71.9% vs. 67.4%) and hospital admissions (27.2% vs. 25.7%) than prior to the pandemic. There was a higher proportion with suicide intent (55.8% vs. 48.8%), moderate/major clinical effects (22.8% vs. 20.1%), and deaths (0.07% vs. 0.05%). Monthly calls significantly increased from 30 calls/month to 204 calls/month (p &lt; .001). The slope of hospital admissions significantly increased (0.19% per month, p &lt; .001) during the pandemic. Discussion During the COVID-19 pandemic, US PCs observed an increase in adolescent suicidal intent exposure calls with more severe outcomes, hospitalizations, and deaths.","Wang, George Sam, Leonard, Jan, Cornell, Anastasia, Hoyte, Christopher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.07.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37570,""
"Online consultations in mental healthcare: Modelling determinants of use and experience based on an international survey study at the onset of the pandemic","Introduction While online consultations have shown promise to be a means for the effective delivery of high-quality mental healthcare and the first implementations of these digital therapeutic contacts go back nearly two decades, uptake has remained limited over the years. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered this relative standstill and created a unique turning point, with a massive amount of both professionals and clients having first hands-on experiences with technology in mental healthcare. Objective The current study aimed to document the uptake of online consultations and explore if specific characteristics of mental health professionals across and beyond Europe could predict this. Methods An international survey was designed to assess mental health professionals' (initial) experiences with online consultations at the onset of the pandemic: their willingness to make use of them and their prior and current experiences, alongside several personal characteristics. Logistic mixed-effects models were used to identify predictors of the use of online consultations, personal experience with this modality, and the sense of telepresence. Results A total of 9115 healthcare professionals from 73 countries participated of which about two-thirds used online consultations during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. The current study identifies multiple determinants relating to the use and experience of online consultations, including the professionals' age, experience with the technology before the outbreak, the professional context, and training. Conclusions Despite strong evidence supporting the relevance of training in digital mental health, this is clearly still lacking. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presented a first, and potentially transformative, experience with online consultations for many healthcare professionals. The insights from this study can help support professionals and, importantly, (mental) healthcare organisations to create optimal circumstances for selective and high-quality continued use of online consultations.","Van Daele, Tom, Mathiasen, Kim, Carlbring, Per, Bernaerts, Sylvie, Brugnera, Agostino, Compare, Angelo, Duque, Aranzazu, Eimontas, Jonas, Gosar, David, Haddouk, Lise, Karekla, Maria, Larsen, Pia, Lo Coco, Gianluca, Nordgreen, Tine, Salgado, JoÃ£o, Schwerdtfeger, Andreas R.; Van Assche, Eva, Willems, Sam, De Witte, Nele A.

"Prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and objective The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a traumatic impact on the whole world in all aspects including physical health, economic condition, and mental health. Psychological problems are commonly neglected for their inconspicuous symptoms. Little is known about the medical studentsâ€™ psychological status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Two thousand and two medical students were investigated in this cross-sectional study. Zung's self-rating anxiety scale was used to evaluate their anxiety symptoms. A total of 1917 questionnaires were collected, and the response rate was 95.8%. Results There were 1735 (90.5%) complete and valid questionnaires. The average SAS standard score was 42.8 Â± 11.0. The results indicated that the prevalence of anxiety in medical students was 25.9%. Less social support (OR = 1.4, 95%CI 1.2â€“1.7) is an independent risk factor of anxiety syndrome, while the female (OR = 0.6, 95%CI 0.5â€“0.8) is less likely to have anxiety syndrome. Conclusion The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Male students and students with less social support are more likely to have anxiety syndrome. Medical educators and students themselves should take serious steps to prevent, recognize and deal with the anxiety prevalence.","Liu, Hui, Liu, Xin, Xu, Weixian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10487","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon; 8(9):e10487, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37572,""
"Risk for postpartum depressive symptoms among pregnant women in a tertiary care setting with and without a positive COVID-19 test","Objective This study systematically examines risk for postpartum depressive symptoms based on COVID-19 positivity status during pregnancy. Methods This is a retrospective matched cohort study of pregnant patients admitted to labor and delivery units from March through December 2020. Patients were administered three depression screening questions followed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results 129 patients with positive COVID-19 tests (most with mild symptoms) were matched with 516 COVID-19 negative controls. We found no significant differences in rates of positive responses to screening questions (14/129, 10.9% vs. 72/516, 14.0%;pÂ =Â .35) or EPDS scores &gt;9 (6/97, 6.2% vs. 42/410, 10.2%;pÂ =Â .22). Prior history of psychiatric illness was the only significant predictor of an EPDS scoreÂ &gt;Â 9 (adjOR 2.57, pÂ =Â .002) or a positive brief screen for postpartum depressive symptoms (adjOR 2.93, pÂ &lt;Â .001). Conclusions No significant differences in the rates for postpartum depressive symptoms were observed among pregnant women with and without a positive COVID-19 test during pregnancy, suggesting that testing positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk for the development of depressive symptoms during the acute postpartum period. Overall rates of postpartum depression symptoms were low, perhaps owing to the higher socioeconomic status of the sample.","Taljan, Katherine E.; Cantu-Weinstein, Ashley, McKenna, Madeline, De Souza, Larissa, Meng, Yao, Gonsalves, Lilian, Goje, Oluwatosin, Viguera, Adele C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.08.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37573,""
"Exercise and Lifestyle Education program for Brazilians living with prediabetes and diabetes: A pilot randomized trial","Aims To test the Diabetes College Brazil Study feasibility, the acceptability of study interventions and their preliminary effectiveness, and describe the study protocol modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Single-center, double-blinded pilot randomized trial with two parallel groups, Exercise and Lifestyle Education (ExLE;12-week exercise and educational interventions) and Exercise (Ex;12-week exercise intervention only) involving patients with prediabetes or diabetes. Feasibility (eligibility, recruitment, retention, completeness of variables measures and participation rates), acceptability (satisfaction), and preliminary effectiveness of interventions (variables: functional capacity, physical activity (PA), exercise self-efficacy, diabetes knowledge, health literacy, adherence to Mediterranean food pattern, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), anthropometric measures, cardiac autonomic control, depression, and quality of life (QofL)). Results Eligibility, recruitment, retention, participation in exercise sessions, and education classes rates were 17%, 93%,82%, 76%, and 71%, respectively. Missing data in the post-intervention assessment (PA, HbA1c, cardiac autonomic control, anthropometric measures, depression, and QofL) were mainly related to research procedure modifications. The interventions were highly acceptable, and most variables improved farther in the ExLE, with moderate effect sizes for PA, diabetes knowledge, health literacy, cardiac autonomic control, and QofL. Conclusions The Diabetes College Brazil Study is feasible, and the ExLE may benefit Brazilians living with prediabetes and diabetes.","Seixas, Mariana Balbi, Pereira, Danielle Aparecida Gomes, Ghisi, Gabriela Lima de Melo, Batalha, Ana Paula Delgado Bomtempo, Santos, Carolina Vargas de Oliveira, Ponciano, Isabela Coelho, Oh, Paul, Silva, Lilian Pinto da","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2022.102614","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews;: 102614, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37574,""
"Person-centered patterns of substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associations with COVID-related impacts on health and personal finances in young Black and White women","Background Population-level statistics on pandemic-related change in substance use can obscure patterns of use (e.g., polysubstance use) within individuals. This longitudinal study used a person-centered approach to identify subgroups with respect to patterns of substance use prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine profile correlates (e.g., socio-demographic characteristics), which can inform tailored intervention. Methods The two youngest age cohorts of the Pittsburgh Girls Study (n=938;59.1% Black, 40.9% White;mean age=26.2 (SD=0.8)), a longitudinal community sample, provided data on past year frequency of cigarette/e-cigarette use, binge drinking (&gt;4 drinks per occasion), and cannabis use prior to and during the pandemic, and perceived change in use. Latent profile analysis identified subgroups. Profile correlates were examined (e.g., sociodemographics, COVID-19 infection status and reported exposure, COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and finances). Results Seven profiles were identified: â€œLow useâ€, â€œOccasional binge drinkingâ€, â€œCannabis useâ€, â€œCigarette/e-cigarette & binge drinkingâ€, â€œOccasional binge drinking & cannabisâ€, â€œBinge drinking & cannabisâ€, and â€œPolysubstance useâ€. Black women were overrepresented in â€œLow useâ€, which was associated with fewer pandemic effects on health. Profiles associated with more frequent binge drinking were more likely to report COVID-19 infection, whereas â€œCannabis useâ€ had lower reported infection prevalence. â€œPolysubstance useâ€ had more COVID-related depression and income loss, on average, than â€œLow useâ€. Conclusions Distinct subgroups representing single substance use, co-use, and polysubstance use prior to and during the pandemic were identified. The profiles show differential response to COVID-19 impacts, ranging from relative hardiness to specific needs to guide personalized treatment.","Chung, Tammy, Sartor, Carolyn, Hipwell, Alison E.; Grosso, Ashley, Jiang, Yanping","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109620","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109620, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37575,""
"Machine Learning Models to Detect Anxiety and Depression through Social Media: A Scoping Review","Despite improvement in detection rates, the prevalence of mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression are on the rise especially since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Symptoms of mental health disorders have been noted and observed on social media forums such Facebook. We explored machine learning models used to detect anxiety and depression through social media. Six bibliographic databases were searched for conducting the review following PRISMA-ScR protocol. We included 54 of 2219 retrieved studies. Users suffering from anxiety or depression were identified in the reviewed studies by screening their online presence and their sharing of diagnosis by patterns in their language and online activity. Majority of the studies (70%, 38/54) were conducted at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2020). The studies made use of social media data from a variety of different platforms to develop predictive models for the detection of depression or anxiety. These included Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Sina Weibo, and a combination of different social sites posts. We report the most common Machine Learning models identified. Identification of those suffering from anxiety and depression disorders may be achieved using prediction models to detect user's language on social media and has the potential to complimenting traditional screening. Such analysis could also provide insights into the mental health of the public especially so when access to health professionals can be restricted due to lockdowns and temporary closure of services such as we saw during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic","Ahmed, Arfan, Aziz, Sarah, Toro, Carla T.; Alzubaidi, Mahmood, Irshaidat, Sara, Serhan, Hashem Abu, Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A.; Househ, Mowafa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpbup.2022.100066","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine Update;: 100066, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37576,""

Ao todo, 118.232 (77,2%) pacientes estavam em terapia antirretroviral (TARV), sendo que 12 estudos nÃ£o forneciam o dado. O nÃºmero de Ã³bitos foi de 25.396 (15,7%), segundo 34 estudos. ConclusÃ£o A maioria dos estudos aponta que os pacientes vivendo com a coinfecÃ§Ã£o HIV - SARS-CoV-2 nÃ£o apresentam maior risco de mortalidade pela COVID-19 se comparados aos pacientes sem HIV, quando estudados de forma isolada, possivelmente por se tratar de uma populaÃ§Ã£o em tratamento, com sua imunidade compensada. Em geral, as caracterÃ­sticas e sintomas dos pacientes com coinfecÃ§Ã£o nÃ£o diferiram dos pacientes nÃ£o portadores de HIV. A taxa de mortalidade de pacientes co-infectados tambÃ©m foi similar Ã  da populaÃ§Ã£o em geral de 50 a 59 anos.","da Silva, JÃºlia Gomes, Trigueiro, Ana Paula Knorr, Almeida, Gabriela de Nardi, Toscano, Sophia Haddad Cur, Chehter, Ethel Zimberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2022.102453","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases; 26:102453, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37578,""
"MUDANÃ‡A NO PERFIL CLÃNICO, EPIDEMIOLÃ“GICO E DE PROGNÃ“STICO DOS PACIENTES COM COVID-19 INTERNADOS EM HOSPITAL UNIVERSITÃRIO NO PERÃODO PANDÃŠMICO","IntroduÃ§Ã£o A pandemia de Covid-19 expÃ´s o sistema de saÃºde Ã  necessidade de manejo de uma nova doenÃ§a associada a um colapso do sistema hospitalar. Entretanto, durante esses 26 meses, ocorreram mudanÃ§as relacionadas ao manejo clÃ­nico, Ã  organizaÃ§Ã£o dos serviÃ§os, Ã s medidas de isolamento social, Ã s variantes virais e, principalmente, Ã  vacinaÃ§Ã£o, que se iniciou e se consolidou no paÃ­s no perÃ­odo. Esses fatores alteraram o perfil dos pacientes com Covid-19 no ambiente hospitalar. Objetivo Comparar as mudanÃ§as no perfil dos pacientes internados por Covid-19 em relaÃ§Ã£o Ã  faixa etÃ¡ria, letalidade e comorbidades nesses trÃªs anos de pandemia (2020, 2021 e 2022). MÃ©todo Estudo descritivo dos casos notificados pelo NÃºcleo de VigilÃ¢ncia EpidemiolÃ³gica de um hospital universitÃ¡rio e referenciado. IncluÃ­dos pacientes internados com Covid-19 e comparados quanto Ã  faixa etÃ¡ria, letalidade e comorbidades nos trÃªs anos de pandemia. Resultados Foram internados 2.565 pacientes com Covid-19 de marÃ§o de 2020 a abril de 2022. A faixa etÃ¡ria das crianÃ§as (0-9) e jovens (20-29) aumentou proporcionalmente de 2% para 9% e de 4% para 10%, respectivamente, de 2020 a 2022. JÃ¡ a faixa de 50-59 anos teve uma reduÃ§Ã£o proporcional importante de 25% para 16% no perÃ­odo. A letalidade de 2020 e 2021 foi de 21% e 20%, sendo que em 2022 reduziu para 16%. A letalidade foi maior na faixa etÃ¡ria acima de 60 anos e no sexo masculino, nos trÃªs anos avaliados. As comorbidades mais comuns foram doenÃ§as cardiovasculares (43,7%) e diabetes mellitus (22,3%), sendo que a prevalÃªncia entre os infectados diminuiu no perÃ­odo. Por outro lado, a proporÃ§Ã£o de pacientes imunodeprimidos e com neoplasias aumentou de 6% para 12% e de 8,8% para 12% respectivamente.

"An exploratory analysis of leukocyte telomere length among pregnant and non-pregnant people","Background Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker that is affected by older age, psychosocial stress, and medical comorbidities. Despite the relevance of these factors to obstetric practice, little is known about LTL in pregnancy. Our study explored longitudinal LTL dynamics in pregnant and non-pregnant people. Objective This pilot study compares changes in LTL between pregnant and non-pregnant people over time, explores potential correlations between LTL and mental health measures, and investigates associations between short first-trimester LTL and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Study design This was a prospective pilot cohort study of nulliparous pregnant and non-pregnant people between ages 18 and 50 who presented for care at a single institution from January to November 2020. Pregnant people were enrolled between 10 and 14 weeks gestation. Participants had two blood samples drawn for LTL;the first on the day of enrollment and the second on postpartum day 1 (pregnant cohort) or 7 months later (non-pregnant cohort). LTL was measured using quantitative PCR. The primary outcome was the difference between pregnant and non-pregnant people in LTL change between the two timepoints (basepair difference per 30-day period). Secondary outcomes included differences in responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and a survey about stress related to COVID-19. Differences in LTL were tested using t-tests and linear regression models, both crude and adjusted for age. A subgroup analysis was conducted within the pregnant cohort to examine whether shorter first-trimester LTL was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted t-tests to compare LTL between people with and without each categorical outcome and computed Pearson correlation coefficients between LTL and continuous outcomes such as gestational age at delivery. Results 46 pregnant and 30 non-pregnant people were enrolled;44 pregnant and 18 non-pregnant people completed all LTL assessments. There were no between-group differences in LTL change (-4.2Â Â±Â 22.2 bp per 30 days pregnant versus -6.4Â Â±Â 11.2 bp per 30 days non-pregnant, adjusted beta 2.1, 95% CI -9.0-13.2, pÂ =Â 0.60). The prevalence of depression and pandemic-related stress were both low overall. The two groups did not differ in PHQ-9 scores, and no correlations were significant between LTL and PHQ-9 scores. Among the 44 pregnant people, shorter first-trimester LTL was significantly correlated with earlier gestational age at delivery (rÂ =Â 0.35, pÂ =Â 0.02). Conclusion In this exploratory pilot cohort of reproductive-aged people with low levels of psychological stress, we described baseline changes in LTL over time in pregnant and non-pregnant participants. We found a correlation between shorter first-trimester LTL and earlier gestational age at delivery, which warrants further investigation in a larger cohort.","Panelli, Danielle M.; Diwan, Mira, Cruz, Giovanna I.; Leonard, Stephanie A.; Chueh, Jane, Gotlib, Ian H.; Bianco, Katherine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100506","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health; 25:100506, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37580,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on visitors' wayfinding within healthcare centers","The novel COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial calamities in developing countries such as Iran, which initially suffered from inadequate infrastructure essential for the pandemic control. Due to the ongoing development of this malady, healthcare centers are recognized as one of the most significant hotspots within public settings so they are directly pertinent to the physical and mental health of visitors. The main objective for conducting the present study is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the visitors' wayfinding procedure within Qa'em hospital, located in Rasht, northern Iran. The adopted methodology in the present study is based on a comparison between the collected data regarding the wayfinding behavior of visitors before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic using mixed methods, namely Space Syntax, gate counting, people following, and semi-structured interviews. The obtained empirical results displayed that visitors were significantly confused and hesitant throughout their wayfinding process after the outbreak of the pandemic. Indeed, spatial accessibility and legibility were not found to be adequate for facilitating the wayfinding of the visitors. Moreover, the requirements for the reconfiguration of furniture layout in the waiting areas, according to the underlying notions of social distancing, became conspicuous as the pragmatic implications for the post-pandemic healthcare centers.","Mehrinejad Khotbehsara, Elham, Askarizad, Reza, Mehrinejad, Maryam, Nourmusavi Nasab, Sara, Somasundaraswaran, Kathirgamalingam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asej.2022.101957","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ain Shams Engineering Journal;: 101957, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37581,""
"Psychosocial difficulties experienced by parents of babies treated in a neonatal intensive care unit during the coronavirus pandemic","Aim This study had two objectives: (1) to investigate the psychosocial difficulties experienced by parents of babies treated in a neonatal intensive care unit during the coronavirus pandemic and (2) to determine parent-infant attachment. Materials and methods This study adopted phenomenology, a qualitative research design in order to answer the research questions design. The sample consisted of 20 parents of babies treated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a City Hospital in Turkey between July and August 2021. Participation was voluntary. Data were collected using a sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire and a semi-structured qualitative interview form. Each participant was interviewed face to face. Each interview was recorded and transcribed. The data were analyzed using content analysis. Results Participants had a mean age of 32.2Â Â±Â 3.61Â years and at least secondary school degrees. Babies were admitted to the NICU for congenital anomalies (nÂ =Â 3) or preterm birth (nÂ =Â 7). Participants experienced anxiety, worry, and loneliness and produced less milk because they could not see and touch their babies. Their greatest source of support was their spouses. Conclusion Parents of babies treated in the NICU during the COVID-19 pandemic experience anxiety, sadness, unhappiness, and loneliness. The preventive measures against the pandemic affect parents psychosocially. Healthcare professionals should plan and implement care practices and establish effective communication with parents to identify their physiological, psychological, and social needs and help them produce breastmilk and bond with their babies.","Tasgit, Asena, Dil, Sati","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.08.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37582,""

"Using Environmental Sampling to Enable Zoonotic Pandemic Preparedness","The current pandemic caused by the SARS CoV-2, tracing back its origin possibly to a coronavirus associated with bats, has ignited renewed interest in understanding zoonotic spillovers across the globe. While research is more directed towards solving the problem at hand by finding therapeutic strategies and novel vaccine techniques, it is important to address the environmental drivers of pathogen spillover and the complex biotic and abiotic drivers of zoonoses. The availability of cutting-edge genomic technologies has contributed enormously to preempt viral emergence from wildlife. However, there is still a dearth of studies from species-rich South Asian countries, especially from India. In this review, we outline the importance of studying disease dynamics through environmental sampling from wildlife in India and how ecological parameters of both the virus and the host community may play a role in mediating cross-species spillovers. Non-invasive sampling using feces, urine, shed hair, saliva, shed skin, and feathers has been instrumental in providing genetic information for both the host and their associated pathogens. Here, we discuss the advances made in environmental sampling protocols and strategies to generate genetic data from such samples towards the surveillance and characterization of potentially zoonotic pathogens. We primarily focus on bat-borne or small mammal-borne zoonoses and propose a conceptual framework for non-invasive strategies to tackle the threat of emerging zoonotic infections.","Sanyal, Avirup, Agarwal, Sanskriti, Ramakrishnan, Uma, Garg, Kritika M.; Chattopadhyay, Balaji","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41745-022-00322-z","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Indian Institute of Science;: 1-20, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37587,""
"Addressing the Syndemics of HIV, Mental Health, and COVID-19 Using the Health and Human Rights Framework among Youth Living with HIV, in Uganda: an Interpretive Phenomenological Study","Stigma and discrimination negatively impact the prevention, treatment, and care of HIV. The COVID-19 pandemic increased this complexity and created a cluster of synergistic health contexts, wherein the physiological aspects of HIV and the social and environmental conditions increased the vulnerability in health outcomes for youth living with HIV (YPLHIV) in Kampala, Uganda. We used interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and the syndemics framework to understand the lived experiences of YPLHIV. From December 2020 to May 2021, six qualitative focus groups were held with 31 youth living with HIV to understand the lived experiences of YPLHIV. The guided questions used wereÂ audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for thematic analysis. Findings highlight the complexity of intersecting stigma of HIV and COVID-19 that have worsened antiretroviral treatment adherence and mental health issues due to lack of access to critical needs such as fears of food insecurity, health-related worries, the fear of perishing due to COVID-19, and human rights concerns related to gender and sexual identity. The study recommends addressing human rightsâ€“related concerns in addition to health-related concerns to comprehensively mitigate the syndemics of HIV and COVID-19 for YPLHIV in Uganda.","Sharma, Bonita B.; Small, Eusebius, Okumu, Moses, Mwima, Simon, Patel, Mansi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41134-022-00221-4","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Human Rights and Social Work;: 1-14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37588,""
"The influence of pessimism on adverse network behavior during COVID-19: the mediating effect of negative affect and risk perception","There had been an information epidemic during the COVID-19, which led to a lot of adverse network behavior among Internet users. From the perspective of cognition and emotion, this study focused on exploring the influence mechanism of pessimism on undergraduatesâ€™ adverse network behavior, and introduced the mediating variable of negative affect and risk perception. In this study, a cross-sectional questionnaire was used to evaluate pessimism, negative affect, risk perception and adverse network behavior of undergraduates to explore the characteristics of network behaviors of undergraduates during the COVID-19. 600 undergraduates from three universities in a city in China were selected as participants, among whom 312 students are female and 288 students are male. The results are as follows: (1) Pessimism is positively correlated with adverse network behavior, and pessimism has a significant positive effect on adverse network behavior. (2) Pessimism is positively correlated with negative affect, and negative affect is positively correlated with adverse network behavior. The mediating effect analysis shows that the mediating effect of negative affect on the relationship between pessimistic personality and adverse network behavior has statistical significance. (3) Pessimism is positively correlated with risk perception and risk perception is positively correlated with adverse network behavior. The mediating effect analysis shows that the mediating effect of risk perception on the relationship between pessimistic personality and adverse network behavior has statistical significance.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12144-022-03584-z.","Wu, Shuman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03584-z","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Current Psychology;: 1-10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37589,""
"Getting Connected: a Retrospective Cohort Investigation of Video-to-Home Telehealth for Mental Health Care Utilization Among Women Veterans","Background: Increasingly, women are serving in the military and seeking care at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Women veterans face unique challenges and barriers in seeking mental health (MH) care within VHA. VA Video Connect (VVC), which facilitates video-based teleconferencing between patients and providers, can reduce barriers while maintaining clinical effectiveness. Objective: Primary aims were to examine gender differences in VVC use, describe changes in VVC use over time (including pre-COVID and 6 months following the beginning of COVID), and determine whether changes over time differed by gender. Design: A retrospective cohort investigation of video-to-home telehealth for MH care utilization among veterans having at least 1 MH visit from October 2019 to September 2020. Participants: Veterans (236,268 women;1,318,024 men). Interventions (if applicable): VVC involves face-to-face, synchronous, video-based teleconferencing between patients and providers, enabling care at home or another private location. Main Measures: Percentage of MH encounters delivered via VA Video Connect. Key Results: Women veterans were more likely than men to have at least 1 VVC encounter and had a greater percentage of MH care delivered via VVC in FY20. There was an increase in the percentage of MH encounters that were VVC over FY20, and this increase was greater for women than men. Women veterans who were younger than 55 (compared to those 55 and older), lived in urban areas (compared to those in rural areas), or were Asian (compared to other races) had a greater percentage of MH encounters that were VVC since the start of the pandemic, controlling for the mean percentage of VVC MH encounters in the 6 months pre-pandemic. Conclusions: VVC use for MH care is greater in women veterans compared to male veterans and may reduce gender-specific access barriers. Future research and VVC implementation efforts should emphasize maximizing patient choice and satisfaction.","Lindsay, J. A.; Caloudas, A.; Hogan, J.; Ecker, A. H.; Day, S.; Day, G.; Connolly, S.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the sustainability of the environment, animal health and food security, and safety","COVID-19 pandemic influenced the environment, animal health, and food security. Due to reduced human mobility, the air and water quality increased. Other environmental consequences were the personal protective types of equipment and their haphazard disposal. Atmospheric pollution could be a cofactor leading to an increased COVID-19 mortality rate. Lockdown, however, caused a reduction in air and water pollution. Noise pollution affects the health of individuals and communities in terms of cardiovascular disorders and sleeping problems. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 lockdown controls human activities that reduce noise pollution. Municipal waste affects the environment. Recycling has been reduced in some countries but not in Saudi Arabia. COVID-19 had a drastic effect on livestock production on national, regional, and global levels, affecting countries' capacities to prevent and control diseases of animals and increasing global poverty, becoming a threat to the sustainability of global food security and safety. Many lessons have been learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is wise to study and analyze the previous lessons and shed some light on past pandemics such as the Spanish flu to understand the readings and earn experiences.

"Robinson Crusoe: less or more depressed? With whom and where to live in a pandemic if you are above 50","Did the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic and the various lockdown measures taken by European governments in the spring of 2020 impact individuals aged 50 and over differently according to their living arrangements and housing conditions? Focusing on three indicators of mental well-being, depression, loneliness and trouble sleeping, this paper answers the question using data on Europeans interviewed in the SHARE Corona Survey, fielded right after the first wave of the pandemic in summer 2020, linked longitudinally with two previous waves of SHARE (2013 and 2015). We find that the first wave of the pandemic changed the association between mental health and living arrangements and housing conditions. New to this pandemic period, the mental well-being of those who lived only with a spouse declined relative to the general population aged 50+. Relatedly, there was a protective impact for parents of having (adult) children in the same building as opposed to children, however close, who were not co-residing. Finally, living in cities and in multi-unit housing also led to a decrease in mental well-being relative to the general population aged 50+.","Berniell, InÃ©s, LaferrÃ¨re, Anne, Mira, Pedro, Pronkina, Elizaveta","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11150-022-09624-8","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Review of Economics of the Household;: 1-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37592,""
"Development and Preliminary Validation of the Pandemic Avoidance and Concern Scales (PACS)","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to radical disruptions to the routines of individuals and families, but there are few psychometrically assessed measures for indexing behavioural responses associated with a modern pandemic. Given the likelihood of future pandemics, valid tools for assessing pandemic-related behavioral responses relevant to mental health are needed. This need may be especially salient for studies involving families, as they may experience higher levels of stress and maladjustment related to school and business closures. We therefore created the Pandemic Avoidance and Concern Scales (PACS) to assess caregiversâ€™ and youthsâ€™ adjustment to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Concern and Avoidance factors derived from exploratory factor analyses were associated with measures of internalizing symptoms, as well as other indices of pandemic-related disruption. Findings suggest that the PACS is a valid tool for assessing pandemic-related beliefs and behaviors in adults and adolescents. Preliminary findings related to differential adjustment between caregivers and youths are discussed.","Daoust, Andrew R.; Stanton, Kasey, Vandermeer, Matthew R.

"FÃ¶rderung der mentalen Gesundheitskompetenz im Jugendalter","Background: Internationally as well as nationally there is aÂ strong call to anchor health promotion in schools, not only but especially in connection with the growing rate of psychological problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In recent years the promotion of mental health literacy has received increasing attention as aÂ possible approach. Objective: What evidence is there for promoting mental health literacy in adolescents in the school setting and how is it practically implemented in Germany? Method: Literature review, search in databases on programs to promote mental health literacy in aÂ school setting (lower secondary level). Results: The promotion of mental health literacy appears to be aÂ promising approach, especially when implemented in the school context. Initial programs exist and meta-analyses point to significant effect sizes in the lower and middle range;however, there is aÂ need for further research (e.g. with respect to distal endpoints) and there are difficulties in the practical implementation. Conclusion: AÂ theory-based and evidence-based implementation has the potential to sensitize schools to this important topic and motivate them to take further steps in health promotion. Consideration of barriers specific to the German school system appears to be decisive for aÂ successful implementation.","Edelmann, Annika, Eppelmann, Lena, Wessa, MichÃ¨le","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00278-022-00622-w","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Die Psychotherapie;: 1-8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37594,""
"Work-life balance and women's health in times of COVID-19","Introduction: COVID-19 imposes challenges on contemporary society and one of them is the reconciliation of work-family life. By converging in the same space work and family, women, fundamentally, have faced situations of stress and overload that hinder the work-family balance and their health. Objective: Systematize knowledge about the reconciliation of work-family life and women's health in times of COVID-19. Methods: A bibliographic and documentary review was carried out in the period between January and October 2020. For the selection of the publications, the following criteria were taken into account, being linked to the themes of gender, work-life balance and health related to COVID-19, accessible through the Internet. Documents were retrieved in Spanish and English as the main language of the edition and in full text. Conclusions: The reconciliation of work life-family life of women becomes more difficult in times of COVID-19 due to the overload in health work and essential services, the closure of educational centers and the transfer of productive work to the domestic space. The deterioration of women's health in times of COVID-19 is the response to society's allocation of domestic and care roles. In addition, they are on the front line of the fight against the disease, both in health services and in the care of patients at home because of the new coronavirus, which also makes them more vulnerable to infection. Confinement increases violence against women and girls, chronic stress, as well as affecting their physical and mental health.","Sotomayor, Y. R.; FernÃ¡ndez, A. P.; Abascal, I.

"An APOL1 genotype associated with adverse Covid- 19 outcomes: UK-Biobank data, September 2021","Introduction/ Background: The risk of hospitalisation/death from Covid-19 in the UK is disproportionately high in black populations. In people of African ancestry, variants of the APOL1 gene (G1 and G2) are associated with risk of noncommunicable diseases, and sleeping sickness. We hypothesise that adverse Covid-19 outcomes are also associated with these variants. Methods: The UK Biobank contains genetic, lifestyle, and health information from 7,643 individuals who self-report as being of black ethnicity. Within this cohort there had been 142 hospitalisations and 36 deaths attributed to Covid-19 as of September 2021. Taking risk factors previously associated with poor Covid-19 outcomes (age, sex, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and Townsend deprivation index) as covariates, we used Firth's Bias Reduced Logistic Regression in R to identify APOL1 genotypes that were associated with hospitalisation and death. Results: Individuals who are heterozygous for variants at both the G1 and the G2 loci are termed G1/G2 compound heterozygotes. G1/G2 compound heterozygosity was associated with hospitalisation (odds ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-4.5, p = 0.010) and death (odds ratio = 5.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-15.4, p = 0.004). This association has not previously been detected in genome wide association studies, as they usually examine individual loci separately rather than considering combinations of loci. Impact: This has implications at the individual and population level by identifying those at higher risk of severe Covid-19 who would benefit from early vaccination and treatment. This is especially relevant to geographical regions where APOL1 G1 and G2 variants are common, such as West and Central Africa and their diaspora. Conclusion: This data supports hypotheses proposing APOL1 genotype (and specifically G1/G2 compound heterozygosity) as a significant contributory factor in the increased rates of poor Covid-19 outcomes observed in people of African ancestry.","Adamson, W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+APOL1+genotype+associated+with+adverse+Covid-+19+outcomes:+UK-Biobank+data,+September+2021","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Public Health in Africa; 13:23-24, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37596,""
"Strengthening public mental health in Africa in response to COVID-19","Introduction/ Background: The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted health systems all over the world. 93% of countries worldwide reported disruption in mental health services. In a survey conducted by the WHO, about 75% of the responding countries reported the lack of funding to implement their COVID-19 mental health response plans. Methods: This research was designed and implemented with the mental health leads from African public health institutions (Africa CDC, WHO AFRO and EMRO, WAHO, ECSA-HC). It assessed the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in African countries. A web-based survey was sent to mental health focal points in 55 African countries. The survey assessed the perceived degree of implementation of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) â€œ14 Globally Recommended Activitiesâ€ for mental health response to COVID-19. In-depth interviews with 17 respondents followed the survey to explore barriers and enablers to mental health integration into the current pandemic response. Results: Responses were received from 28 countries. The degree of implementation of the recommended mental health activities was less than half in about 70 % of the respondent countries. Lack of political will, poor funding, limited human resources, and weak pre-existing mental health systems were key challenges faced in addressing mental health needs during the COVID-19 crisis. Participants highlighted the need to capitalize on the increased attention to mental health and strengthen new partnerships initiated through the COVID-19 pandemic response. Impact: Extracting lessons from the current pandemic response will help to improve the preparedness and response to future disease outbreaks. This is a formative research that will be used in the second phase of the project which aims to improve mental health response to disease outbreaks in Africa. Conclusion: National mental health should be strengthened in advance of potential future outbreaks. International agencies and local NGOs have significant roles in encouraging national uptake of mental health in health systems by developing agendas and recommendations, organizing stakeholder meetings, and drawing political attention towards the importance of mental health.","Abdulaziz, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Strengthening+public+mental+health+in+Africa+in+response+to+COVID-19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Public Health in Africa; 13:44, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37597,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health-Related School-Nurse Visits in US Schools","No studies have examined school-nurse visits related to mental health (MH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined changes in the rate of MH-related school-nurse visits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed school-nurse visit data (n=3,445,240) for subjects Grade K-12 in U.S. public schools using electronic health record software (SchoolCare, Ramsey, NJ). Data between January 1-December 31 in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) vs. January 1-December 31 in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic) were compared. For each year, total visits to a school-nurse were calculated for general MH, anxiety, and self-harm. The exposure was number of school-nurse visits in each time period (2019 vs. 2020). The main outcome was change in the rate of general MH, anxiety, and self-harm visits in 2019 vs. 2020. There were 2,302,239 total school-nurse visits in 2019 vs. 1,143,001 in 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of visits for general MH increased by 30% (4.7 to 6.1 per 10,000 visits, 95%CI [18%,43%]; p&lt;0.001), and visits for anxiety increased by 25% (24.8 to 31 per 10,000 visits, 95%CI [20%,30%]; p&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in self-harm visits across all ages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study found a significant increase in the rate of school-nurse visits for MH and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting the pediatric population is at-risk for increased negative MH-effects associated with the pandemic and highlights a critical role of school-nurses in identifying youth with potential MH-needs.","Banzon, Sheehan, Petty, Hauptman, Flanagan, Bell, Shamosh, Bartnikas, Phipatanakul","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2022.09.002","20220913","COVID-19; mental health; pediatrics; school-nurse; schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37598,""
"THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON RECOVERY FROM CARDIAC SURGERY: 1 YEAR OUTCOMES","The outbreak of COVID-19 was potentially stressful for everyone, and possibly heightened in those having surgery. We sought to explore the impact of the pandemic on recovery from cardiac surgery. A prospective observational study of 196 patients who were Ã¢â€°Â¥18years old undergoing cardiac surgery between 23rd March and 4th July 2020 (UK lockdown) was conducted. Those too unwell or unable to give consent/complete the questionnaires were excluded. Participants completed (on paper or electronically) the impact of event (IES-R) (distress related to COVID-19), depression (CES-D) and EQ-5D-5L (quality of life, HRQoL) questionnaires at baseline, one week after hospital discharge, and six weeks, six months and 1-year post-surgery.Questionnaire completion was &gt;75.0% at all timepoints, except at one week (67.3%). Most participants were male (147 (75.0%)), white British (156 (79.6%)) with an average age 63.4years. No patients had COVID-19. IES-R sand CES-D were above average at baseline (indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression) decreasing over time. HRQoL pre-surgery was high, reducing at one week but increasing to almost pre-operative levels at six weeks, and exceeding pre-operative levels at six months and 1-year. IES-R and CES-D scores were consistently higher in women and younger patients with women also having poorer HRQoL up to 1-year after surgery. High levels of distress were observed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with women and younger participants particularly affected. Psychological support pre- and post-operatively in further crises or traumatic times, should be considered to aid recovery.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic, Racism, and Sleep Among Chinese Immigrants in the United States","The current study aimed to investigate Chinese immigrants' sleep quality and associations between the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic's impact and racism and sleep disruption using a cross-sectional online survey. A total of 507 Chinese immigrants were recruited via social network sites. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality. The pandemic's impact and racism were measured using questions developed for this study. More than 42% of participants reported poor sleep quality. Those who reported having been affected by the pandemic had poorer subjective sleep quality, longer sleep latency, and greater daytime dysfunction. Those who experienced racist incidents were more likely to use sleep medication and exhibit poor subjective sleep quality, long sleep latency, short sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction. Chinese immigrants' sleep health warrants particular consideration by health care professionals. Timely, effective interventions, such as relaxation techniques and online psychoeducation, need to be delivered in the Chinese community.

"Psychological Distress and Risk Factors in Frontline Nurses Confronting COVID-19 in Less Severely Affected Areas","The current study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of somatization, depression, and anxiety among 374 frontline nurses in less severely affected areas during the initial period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The prevalence of somatization, depression, and anxiety among frontline nurses was 41.4%, 40.1%, and 37.4%, respectively. Nurses from provincial-level hospitals were less likely to report somatization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50; <i>p</i> = 0.018), depression (OR = 0.52; <i>p</i> = 0.024), and anxiety (OR = 0.35; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than those from county-level hospitals. Longer service duration was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of reporting somatization (OR = 1.06; <i>p</i> = 0.008) and depression (OR = 1.06; <i>p</i> = 0.006). Psychological distress exists in frontline nurses in less severely affected areas, and hospital levels and service duration are independent risk factors for psychological stress in these nurses. Maintaining nurses' mental health is an important issue in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to sufficient distribution of medical resources between hospitals at different levels.

"Disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized and minoritized early-career academic scientists","Early research on the impact of COVID-19 on academic scientists suggests that disruptions to research, teaching, and daily work life are not experienced equally. However, this work has overwhelmingly focused on experiences of women and parents, with limited attention to the disproportionate impact on academic work by race, disability status, sexual identity, first-generation status, and academic career stage. Using a stratified random survey sample of early-career academics in four science disciplines (N = 3,277), we investigated socio-demographic and career stage differences in the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic along seven work outcomes: changes in four work areas (research progress, workload, concern about career advancement, support from mentors) and work disruptions due to three COVID-19 related life challenges (physical health, mental health, and caretaking). Our analyses examined patterns across career stages as well as separately for doctoral students and for postdocs/assistant professors. Overall, our results indicate that scientists from marginalized (i.e., devalued) and minoritized (i.e., underrepresented) groups across early career stages reported more negative work outcomes as a result of COVID-19. However, there were notable patterns of differences depending on the socio-demographic identities examined. Those with a physical or mental disability were negatively impacted on all seven work outcomes. Women, primary caregivers, underrepresented racial minorities, sexual minorities, and first-generation scholars reported more negative experiences across several outcomes such as increased disruptions due to physical health symptoms and additional caretaking compared to more privileged counterparts. Doctoral students reported more work disruptions from life challenges than other early-career scholars, especially those related to health problems, while assistant professors reported more negative changes in areas such as decreased research progress and increased workload. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately harmed work outcomes for minoritized and marginalized early-career scholars. Institutional interventions are required to address these inequalities in an effort to retain diverse cohorts in academic science.","Douglas, Settles, Cech, Montgomery, Nadolsky, Hawkins, Ma, Davis, Elliott, Cheruvelil","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274278","20220913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37602,""
"The Incidence of Post-infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Anxiety, and Depression in Iranian Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Irritable bowel syndrome refers to a subgroup of disorders of gut-brain interaction associated with stress-related symptoms, but gastrointestinal infection can also be considered the leading risk factor. It is well reported that coronavirus disease 2019 can also result in gastroenteritis. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and stressful status among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted on adults with coronavirus disease 2019 referred to the Infectious Disease Clinic in Iran from November 2020 to February 2021. Patients who met all eligibility criteria were included in the study. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, Rome IV criteria questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Totally, the data obtained from 233 eligible patients (136 women, 97 men; mean age 38.41) 11.52 (years) were collected and analyzed, and 53.2% of the cases had a moderate coronavirus disease 2019. The analysis showed that 27 (11.6%) patients suffered from irritable bowel syndrome symptoms based on Rome IV criteria after the recovery from the infection. Also, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-based symptoms of depression and anxiety that occurred with coronavirus disease 2019 were reported in 27.4% and 36.9%, respectively. Our finding illustrated that irritable bowel syndrome symptoms based on Rome IV could occur in post-infected coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

"Long COVID in children and adolescents","Although acute COVID-19 has been milder in children and young people compared with adults, there is a concern that they may suffer persistent symptoms. There is a need to define the clinical phenotype, determine those most at risk, the natural course of the condition and evaluate preventive and therapeutic strategies for both mental health and physical symptoms. More recent studies with control groups reported a lower prevalence of persistent symptoms in children and young people exposed to SARS-CoV-2. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the frequency of the majority of reported persistent symptoms is similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and controls. Children and young people infected with SARS-COV-2 had small but significant increases in persisting cognitive difficulties, headache and loss of smell. Factors associated with persisting, impairing symptoms include increased number of symptoms at the time of testing, female sex, older age, worse self-rated physical and mental health, and feelings of loneliness preinfection. This review highlights the importance of a control group in studies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the need for case definitions and research to understand the outcomes of long COVID in children and young people.","Stephenson, Shafran, Ladhani","https://doi.org/10.1097/QCO.0000000000000854","20220913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37604,""

"Participants' experiences of mental health during a COVID-19 tailored ACT-based behavioural weight management intervention: a qualitative study","We aimed to explore participants' experiences of mental health during an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based guided self-help intervention to support weight management in adults with overweight or obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic (SWiM-C: Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19). We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with twenty participants and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify patterns of meaning across the dataset relevant to mental health. Four themes were conceptualized: i) Mental health changes associated with SWiM-C, ii) External factors negatively impacted mental health and intervention engagement, iii) Use and impact of coping responses, and iv) Intervention preferences based on psychological needs. Findings suggest that participants were exposed to multiple factors, both related to and external to the intervention, that negatively impact their mental health, yet ACT-based aspects of the SWiM-C intervention appeared to support participants to adaptively manage the decline in their mental health. The findings can be used to inform the development of future weight management interventions, such as through intervention personalization and the inclusion of more strategies that target emotional regulation.<b>Trial registration</b>: ISRCTN 12107048, https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12107048.","Jones, Richards, Palat, Hughes, Hill, Vincent, Griffin, Ahern, Duschinsky","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2022.2123093","20220913","COVID-19; interventions; mental health; obesity; psychological therapies; weight management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37606,""
"A review of mental health disparities during COVID-19: Evidence, mechanisms, and policy recommendations for promoting societal resilience","Social and economic inequality are chronic stressors that continually erode the mental and physical health of marginalized groups, undermining overall societal resilience. In this comprehensive review, we synthesize evidence of greater increases in mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among socially or economically marginalized groups in the United States, including (a) people who are low income or experiencing homelessness, (b) racial and ethnic minorities, (c) women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) communities, (d) immigrants and migrants, (e) children and people with a history of childhood adversity, and (f) the socially isolated and lonely. Based on this evidence, we propose that reducing social and economic inequality would promote population mental health and societal resilience to future crises. Specifically, we propose concrete, actionable recommendations for policy, intervention, and practice that would bolster five ""pillars"" of societal resilience: (1) economic safety and equity, (2) accessible healthcare, including mental health services, (3) combating racial injustice and promoting respect for diversity, equity, and inclusion, (4) child and family protection services, and (5) social cohesion. Although the recent pandemic exposed and accentuated steep inequalities within our society, efforts to rebuild offer the opportunity to re-envision societal resilience and policy to reduce multiple forms of inequality for our collective benefit.","Parenteau, Boyer, Campos, Carranza, Deer, Hartman, Bidwell, Hostinar","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579422000499","20220913","COVID-19; intersectionality; mental health; resilience; social determinants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37607,""
"Evaluation of Telehealth in Child Behavioral Health Services Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The authors quantified the impact of the use of telehealth services on patient-level clinical outcomes among children with complex behavioral and emotional needs in Idaho during the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing data collected in 2020 with data for the same months in 2019. Longitudinal statewide data of Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) assessments were extracted from Idaho's mental and behavioral health system. Prepandemic assessments were matched to midpandemic assessments. A linear mixed-effect model was used to explore four child-level outcomes: psychosocial strengths-building rate, rate of need resolution within a life-functioning domain, rate of need resolution within a behavior-emotional domain, and rate of need resolution within a high-risk behaviors domain. The number of new patients admitted to Idaho's state-funded mental and behavioral health program decreased almost twofold from April-December 2019 to April-December 2020 (N=4,458 vs. 2,794). For most children with complex needs, the use of telehealth was as effective in terms of strengths building and needs resolution as in-person services; for children whose caregivers had issues with access to transportation, availability of telehealth services improved outcomes for the children. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was associated with a dramatic drop in the number of children served by Idaho's mental health program. Telehealth may effectively bridge mental health service delivery while patients and providers work toward the resolution of transportation issues or may serve as a more acceptable permanent format of service delivery for some populations.","Riley, Cordell, Shimshock, Perez Figueroa, Lyons, Vsevolozhskaya","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.20220141","20220913","Adolescents; Behavior therapy; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Psychosocial outcome; Transportation needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37608,""
"Brief Video Intervention to Increase Treatment-Seeking Intention Among US Health Care Workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Many health care workers avoid seeking mental health care, despite COVID-19-related increases in risk of psychopathology. This study assessed the effects of two versions (distinguished by the race of the protagonist) of a brief social contact-based video on treatment-seeking intention and stigma toward mental health services among U.S. health care workers. Participants (N=1,402) were randomly assigned to view a 3-minute video in which a Black or White female nurse described struggles with COVID-19-related anxiety and depression, barriers to care, and how therapy helped, or to view a control video unrelated to mental health. Half of the participants receiving the intervention watched the same video (i.e., booster) again 14 days later. Treatment-seeking intention and treatment-related stigma were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 14- and 30-day follow-ups. Both intervention videos elicited an immediate increase in treatment-seeking intention in the intervention groups (p&lt;0.001, effect size [ES]=21%), with similar effects among those who watched the booster video (p=0.016, ES=13%) and larger effects among those who had never sought treatment (p&lt;0.001, ES=34%). The increased effects were not sustained 14 days after the initial video or at 30-day follow-up. The results showed an immediate reduction in stigma, but with no booster effect. The race of the protagonist did not influence outcomes. This easily administered intervention could increase the likelihood of care seeking by proactively encouraging health care workers with mental health challenges to pursue treatment. Future studies should examine whether the inclusion of linkable referrals to mental health services helps to increase treatment-seeking behavior.","Amsalem, Wall, Lazarov, Markowitz, Fisch, LeBeau, Hinds, Liu, Fisher, Smith, Hankerson, Lewis-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Dixon, Neria","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.20220083","20220913","Coronavirus/COVID-19; Health care; Stigma; Stigma/discrimination; Treatment-seeking intentions; Video","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37609,""
"Effects of COVID-19 epidemic on mental health of dental students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2020","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed panic and fear among people in the community, and has endangered the mental health of people, including students. The purpose of this study was to determine the psychological effects of COVID-19 outbreak on dental students of our university in 2020. The present cross-sectional and descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 133 dental students from the fifth and 11th semesters in our University. Data collection tools included the Demographic Information Questionnaire, the 28-item Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to measure the psychological aspects, the BarOn Emotional Quotient-Inventory (BarOn EQ-i) to determine emotional intelligence, and the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS) of students during the epidemic. The reliability and validity of the questionnaires had already been reviewed and confirmed. The correlation of the scores of the questionnaires was evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficient and the effects of different variables in predicting the scores of the questionnaires by regression model. Among the tested students, the mean GHQ-28 score was 35.73%, the mean BarOn EQ-i score was 59.94%, and the mean CAS score was 25.27%. There was a significant and direct correlation between GHQ-28 and BarOn EQ-i scores and also a significant and negative correlation between GHQ-28 and CAS scores and between BarOn EQ-i and CAS scores. Despite limited CAS scores and high BarOn EQ-i scores, psychological disorders were observed in a significant number of students during the COVID-19 pandemic period; there is a need for therapeutic and counseling interventions to mitigate the effects of these disorders.","Tonkaboni, Razi-Avarzamani, Sadrzadeh-Afshar","https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.13095","20220913","COVID-19; anxiety; emotional intelligence; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37610,""
"Serological response after COVID-19 mRNA-1273 booster dose in immunocompromised patients, Taiwan, July to August 2021","Whether immunocompromising conditions affect the immunogenicity of COVID-19 booster vaccination remains a concern, which impedes the vaccination campaign in people most vulnerable to COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the effect of immune dysfunction on immunogenicity of homologous and heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination. Between July and August, 2021, 399 participants were randomized to receive ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 8 weeks apart, ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 8 weeks apart, ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart, and mRNA-1273/mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titers on the day before booster vaccination and 4 weeks after booster vaccination were compared between participants with and without immunocompromising conditions. Among ChAdOx1-primed participants, a trend of lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers before booster vaccination were found in participants with autoimmune diseases (geometric means, 34.76 vs. 84.25 binding antibody units [BAU]/mL, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.173), compared to those without. Participants receiving immunosuppressants and/or immunomodulators had significant lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers before booster vaccination than those without (geometric means, 36.39 vs. 83.84Ã‚Â BAU/mL; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). Among mRNA-1273-boosted participants, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers 4 weeks after booster vaccination were similar across all the strata. Participants with autoimmune diseases and receiving immunosuppressants and/or immunomodulators, had numerically lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers 4 weeks after booster vaccination compared to those without (geometric means, 1474.34 vs. 1923.23 and 1590.61 vs. 1918.38Ã‚Â BAU/mL; PÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.05).

"The Relationship Between Mental and Physical Health and Walking During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 policies such as quarantining, social isolation, and lockdowns are an essential public health measure to reduce the spread of disease but may lead to reduced physical activity. Little is known if these changes are associated with changes in physical or mental health. Between September 2017 and December 2018 (baseline) and March 2020 and February 2021 (follow-up), we obtained self-reported demographic, health, and walking (only at follow-up) data on 2042 adults in primary care with multiple chronic health conditions. We examined whether the perceived amount of time engaged in walking was different compared with prepandemic levels and if this was associated with changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 mental and physical health summary scores. Multivariable linear regression controlling for demographic, health, and neighborhood information were used to assess this association. Of the 2042 participants, 9% reported more walking, 28% reported less, and 52% reported the same amount compared with prepandemic levels. Nearly 1/3 of participants reported less walking during the pandemic. Multivariable models revealed that walking less or not at all was associated with negative changes in mental (ÃƒÅ¸ = -1.0; 95% CI [-1.6, -0.5]; ÃƒÅ¸ = -2.2; 95% CI [-2.9, -1.4]) and physical (ÃƒÅ¸ = -0.9; 95% CI [-1.5, -0.3]; ÃƒÅ¸ = -3.1; 95% CI [-4.0, -2.3]) health, respectively. Increasing walking was significantly associated with a positive change in physical health (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.3; 95% CI [0.3, 2.2]). These findings demonstrate the importance of walking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Promotion of physical activity should be taken into consideration when mandating restrictions to slow the spread of disease. Primary care providers can assess patient's walking patterns and implement brief interventions to help patients improve their physical and mental health through walking.","Bonnell, Clifton, Wingood, Gell, Littenberg","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.AP.220090","20220912","COVID-19; Follow-Up Studies; Linear Models; Mental Health; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Self-Report; Walking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37612,""
"Association of Gender, Race, Mechanism of Injury on Alcohol Use, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and Depression in Trauma","There is a paucity of literature documenting whether trauma patients with different mechanisms of injury have different rates of hazardous alcohol use and/or risk for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. The purpose of this article is to determine whether there are associations between mechanism of injury, hazardous drinking, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Secondary objectives were to examine associations prior to and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective cohort study of 5 years of trauma registry data of adult trauma patients (older than 18 years) admitted to a Midwestern Level I trauma center conducted from January 2016 to November 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the association of gender, race, and mechanism of injury on hazardous drinking and posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. A total of 9,392 trauma patients completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Items to identify hazardous drinking, and 5,012 completed the Injured Trauma Survivor Screen to identify risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder and/or depression. The proportion of patients screening positive for hazardous drinking was higher for motor vehicle collisions (21.9%) than for gunshot wounds (17.6%) or falls (18.8%; Ãâ€¡2(2) = 14.311, p &lt; .001). Those involved in motor vehicle collisions were also at a higher risk for the development of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (54.5%) relative to falls (33.5%) but not gunshot wounds (50.7%; Ãâ€¡2(2) = 200.185, p &lt; .001). The impact of COVID-19 revealed increased hazardous drinking, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder in patients with falls and motor vehicle collisions but not gunshot wounds. Motor vehicle collision patients are at most risk for hazardous drinking concomitant with risk for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. These results help focus future research efforts toward interventions that can reduce these risks.","Trevino, Shorey, Bergner, Brandolino, deRoon-Cassini, France","https://doi.org/10.1097/JTN.0000000000000669","20220912","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37613,""
"Obesity Is Associated with Attenuated Tissue Immunity in COVID-19","Obesity affects 40% of US adults, is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, and presents a significant risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19. To date, there is limited information on how obesity might affect immune cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To determine the impact of obesity on respiratory tract immunity in COVID-19 across human lifespan. We analysed single cell transcriptomes from bronchiolar lavage in three ventilated adult cohorts with (n=24) or without COVID-19 (n=9), from nasal immune cells in children with (n=14) or without COVID-19 (n=19), and from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in an independent adult COVID-19 cohort (n=42), comparing obese (Ob) and non-obese subjects (N-Ob). Surprisingly, we found that adult Ob subjects had attenuated lung immune/inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with decreased expression of interferon (IFN)ÃŽÂ±, IFNÃŽÂ³ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha response gene signatures in almost all lung epithelial and immune cell subsets, and lower expression of <i>IFNG</i> and <i>TNF</i> in specific lung immune cells. Peripheral blood immune cells in an independent adult cohort showed a similar, but less marked, reduction in type I IFN and IFNÃŽÂ³ response genes, as well as decreased serum IFNÃŽÂ± in Ob patients with SARS-CoV-2. Nasal immune cells from Ob children with COVID-19 also showed reduced enrichment of IFNÃŽÂ± and IFNÃŽÂ³ response genes. These findings show blunted tissue immune responses in Ob COVID-19 patients, with implications for treatment stratification, supporting the specific application of inhaled recombinant type I IFNs in this vulnerable subset.

"Chronic pain experience through COVID-19: a comparison of reports prior and during the early stages of the pandemic","The impacts of COVID-19 and imposed restrictions on individuals with chronic noncancer pain continue to emerge, varying across countries. More recent research (including with longitudinal designs) suggests that the pandemic may not have such a disproportionate effect on chronic noncancer pain and its management as first thought. This longitudinal study, with assessments before the pandemic (2019) and early during the pandemic (May-July 2020), examined changes in validated measures of pain severity, pain interference, prescription opioid misuse, and mental health symptoms. Patients (N = 236) self-reported significant improvements in pain severity, pain interference, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, prescription opioid misuse, depression, and anxiety symptoms over time. Approximately 30% and 33% of patients achieved minimally important reductions (10% change) in pain severity and pain interference, respectively. In follow-up exploratory analyses, prepandemic sociodemographic and psychological factors predictive of 10% improved (vs 10% worse) pain severity and interference were investigated in logistic regressions. Reduction in pain interference was predicted by current employment, older age, and higher pain self-efficacy. There were no significant predictors of reduction in pain severity. The impact of COVID-19 on patients' pain experience and mental health was negligible in the early stages of the pandemic, and findings suggest improvements through the period. Targeted interventions that promote the protective factor of pain self-efficacy and build resilience may buffer patients' future response to the pandemic because it evolves as a part of our new normal. Targeted social determinants of health interventions that direct resources toward maintaining employment could also be important.","Buckley, Sterling, Elphinston","https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002724","20220912","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37615,""

We compared the expected and observed numbers of suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic. The total numbers of suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic did not deviate from projections based on the pre-pandemic period. However, the number of suicides among women and those under the age of 34 years significantly exceeded the expected level. The COVID-19 pandemic did not increase the overall suicide rate significantly. However, suicides among women and young people increased, suggesting that the pandemic might drive more members of these groups to suicide.

"Factors associated with changing alcohol consumption during the first UK lockdown","In response to COVID-19 there have been lockdowns and restrictions to hospitality services. Drinking behaviours often change in response to traumatic events and changes in the drinking environment, and this is influenced by a range of factors. This study explores self-reported changes in alcohol consumption in the third month of the UK lockdown, associations with socio-demographics factors and with COVID-19-related concerns, and mental health and wellbeing. The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study was a longitudinal, online, three-wave survey of 1958 UK adults. Data were collected during the first UK lockdown; wave 1 launched 23 March 2020, wave 2 was 1 month after and wave 3 2 months after completion of wave 1A hierarchical multinomial regression model was estimated to investigate factors associated with changes in perceived alcohol consumption in the third month of the lockdown. The majority of participants reported changes in drinking (62%) with over one-third indicating increased consumption. Student status and worries about the financial implications of COVID-19 were associated with lower odds of decreased alcohol consumption. Those with above average income and those with children in the household had lower odds of increased alcohol consumption, while younger adults had higher odds of increased alcohol consumption. This study adds to the growing body of research showing changes in alcohol consumption behaviours during the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, and identifies risk and protective factors which can aid in targeting intervention at those most in need of support.","McAloney-Kocaman, McPherson, McGlinchey, Armour","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac124","20220912","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37617,""
"Comparing the COVID-19-related PTSD symptoms between psychiatric patients and healthy subjects: an observational retrospective study from Northern Italy","COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact on mental health, both in the general population and psychiatric patients. Little is known about the difference between these two populations in perceiving the pandemic as a traumatic event. The aim of the study was to compare psychiatric patients and healthy controls (HC) in terms of change over time of post-traumatic (PTSD) symptoms. Demographic and clinical variables were collected. Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) scores were registered at T1 as lockdown period (March-April 2020) and T2 as restarting (May-June 2020). Descriptive analyses and linear regression models were performed. A total of 166 outpatients and 57 HC were recruited. Time (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15.76; p &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and diagnosis (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.94; p &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) had a significant effect on the change of IES-R scores, which resulted T1 &gt;Ã‚Â T2 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), except for subjects affected by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Overall, IES-R scores were &lt; in patients than in HC (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02), particularly in the schizophrenia (SKZ) subgroup (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). IES-R scores of subjects with personality disorders (PDs) resulted to be &gt; HC, although not statistically significant. The lockdown period was perceived as more traumatic than the reopening phase by both groups, with the exception of OCD patients, probably because of the clinical worsening associated with the urge of control against risks of contamination. Overall, HC reported more PTSD symptoms than psychiatric patients did, particularly SKZ ones. PD patients, in contrast, may be more vulnerable to PTSD symptoms probably as a result of poor coping skills. Together with OCD patients, subjects with PDs may need closer monitoring during the different phases of the pandemic.

"Identifying Women with Post-Delivery Posttraumatic Stress Disorder using Natural Language Processing of Personal Childbirth Narratives","Maternal mental disorders are considered a leading complication of childbirth and a common contributor to maternal death. In addition to undermining maternal welfare, untreated postpartum psychopathology can result in child emotional and physical neglect, and associated significant pediatric health costs. Some women may experience a traumatic childbirth and develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following delivery (CB-PTSD). Although women are routinely screened for postpartum depression in the U.S., there is no recommended protocol to inform the identification of women who are likely to experience CB-PTSD. Advancements in computational methods of free text has shown promise in informing diagnosis of psychiatric conditions. Although the language in narratives of stressful events has been associated with post-trauma outcomes, whether the narratives of childbirth processed via machine learning can be useful for CB-PTSD screening is unknown. This study examined the utility of written narrative accounts of personal childbirth experience for the identification of women with provisional CB-PTSD. To this end, we developed a model based on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify CB-PTSD via classification of birth narratives. A total of 1,127 eligible postpartum women who enrolled in a study survey during the COVID-19 era provided short written childbirth narrative accounts in which they were instructed to focus on the most distressing aspects of their childbirth experience. They also completed a PTSD symptom screen to determine provisional CB-PTSD. After exclusion criteria were applied, data from 995 participants was analyzed. An ML-based Sentence-Transformer NLP model was used to represent narratives as vectors that served as inputs for a neural network ML model developed in this study to identify participants with provisional CB-PTSD. The ML model derived from NLP of childbirth narratives achieved good performance: AUC 0.75, F1-score 0.76, sensitivity 0.8, and specificity 0.70. Moreover, women with provisional CB-PTSD generated longer narratives (t-test results: <i>t=2</i> . <i>30, p=0</i> . <i>02</i> ) and used more negative emotional expressions (Wilcoxon test: 'sadness': <i>p=8</i> . <i>90e-</i> <sup><i>04</i></sup> , <i>W=31,017</i> ; 'anger': <i>p=1</i> . <i>32e-</i> <sup><i>02</i></sup> , <i>W=35,005</i> . <i>50</i> ) and death-related words (Wilcoxon test: <i>p=3</i> . <i>48e-</i> <sup><i>05</i></sup> , <i>W=34,538</i> ) in describing their childbirth experience than those with no CB-PTSD. This study provides proof of concept that personal childbirth narrative accounts generated in the early postpartum period and analyzed via advanced computational methods can detect with relatively high accuracy women who are likely to endorse CB-PTSD and those at low risk. This suggests that birth narratives could be promising for informing low-cost, non-invasive tools for maternal mental health screening, and more research that utilizes ML to predict early signs of maternal psychiatric morbidity is warranted.","Bartal, Jagodnik, Chan, Babu, Dekel","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.30.22279394","20220912","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37619,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Trauma Service Utilization at a New York City Level I Trauma Center","The COVID-19 pandemic globally impacted trauma facilities and overall healthcare utilization. This study was conducted to characterize the utilization of trauma services at our Level I Trauma Center in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the preceding pre-pandemic year. A retrospective study of patient presenting to our Level 1 Trauma Center in Staten Island, New York. The pre-pandemic data was extracted from March 1st, 2019-February 29th, 2020. The pandemic year was divided into two phases: the initial wave (March 1st-Sept 1st, 2020) and the protracted phase (September 1st, 2020-March 1st, 2021). Patients were identified using ICD-10 coding and data regarding patient factors, mechanism of injury, and service utilization was extracted from the medical record. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS v.24. A total of 1650 trauma activations registered during the pre-pandemic phase, 691 during the initial wave, and 826 during the protracted phase. Compared to pre-pandemic, the number of Level 1 trauma activations remained unchanged, however mechanisms of injury shifted. Gunshot wounds (2.6% vs 1.2%), motorcycle crash (4.2% vs 2.0%) and blunt force injury caused by an object (strike injuries) (2.7% vs 1.3%) significantly increased during the initial wave (p-value &lt;0.05). There was a significant decrease in the percentage of both female (2.93% vs 2.33% vs 5.64%, p-value &lt;0.01) and pediatric (3.30% vs 3.64% vs 12.9%, p-value &lt;0.001) assault activations during the initial wave and protracted phase when compared to pre-pandemic levels, respectively. No significant changes were observed for self-harm, falls, accidents, burns, sports injuries, stab wounds, autobody collisions, or motor vehicle accident activations. Trauma centers should be prepared for increases in violent trauma. We also emphasize the need to implement strategies to raise public awareness of pediatric and female assault in the domestic setting, particularly during a mandatory stay-at-home policy where underreporting may occur.","Rosen, Pelle, Lakhi","https://doi.org/10.2147/POR.S378189","20220913","COVID-19; mechanism of injury; service utilization; trauma center","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37620,""
"Exploring the Paradox of COVID-19 in Neurological Complications with Emphasis on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a human coronavirus (HCoV) that has created a pandemic situation worldwide as COVID-19. This virus can invade human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-based mechanisms, affecting the human respiratory tract. However, several reports of neurological symptoms suggest a neuroinvasive development of coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 can damage the brain via several routes, along with direct neural cell infection with the coronavirus. The chronic inflammatory reactions surge the brain with proinflammatory elements, damaging the neural cells, causing brain ischemia associated with other health issues. SARS-CoV-2 exhibited neuropsychiatric and neurological manifestations, including cognitive impairment, depression, dizziness, delirium, and disturbed sleep. These symptoms show nervous tissue damage that enhances the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders and aids dementia. SARS-CoV-2 has been seen in brain necropsy and isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients. The associated inflammatory reaction in some COVID-19 patients has increased proinflammatory cytokines, which have been investigated as a prognostic factor. Therefore, the immunogenic changes observed in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients include their pathogenetic role. Inflammatory events have been an important pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The neuroinflammation observed in AD has exacerbated the A<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> burden and tau hyperphosphorylation. The resident microglia and other immune cells are responsible for the enhanced burden of A<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> and subsequently mediate tau phosphorylation and ultimately disease progression. Similarly, neuroinflammation also plays a key role in the progression of PD. Several studies have demonstrated an interplay between neuroinflammation and pathogenic mechanisms of PD. The dynamic proinflammation stage guides the accumulation of <i>ÃŽÂ±</i>-synuclein and neurodegenerative progression. Besides, few viruses may have a role as stimulators and generate a cross-autoimmune response for <i>ÃŽÂ±</i>-synuclein. Hence, neurological complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 cannot be ruled out. In this review article, our primary focus is on discussing the neuroinvasive effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its impact on the blood-brain barrier, and ultimately its impact on the people affected with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.","Rai, Tiwari, Singh, Singh, Mishra, Imran, Singh, Hooshmandi, Vamanu, Singh, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3012778","20220913","Alzheimer Disease; COVID-19; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; SARS-CoV-2; alpha-Synuclein","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37621,""
"Longitudinal survey of depressive symptoms among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","While changes in response to the different stages of the pandemic remain unknown, this study investigated the longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms in Japanese university students and identified factors associated with new onset of depression and suicidal ideation. Two surveys were conducted at one university in Akita, Japan, during the first COVID-19 outbreak period (<i>T</i>1: May-June 2020) and 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year later (<i>T</i>2: March-May 2021). Moderate depressive symptoms were defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 and suicide-related ideation scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°1 on question 9 of the questionnaire. Among 985 students who completed surveys in <i>T</i>1 and <i>T</i>2, participants with moderate depressive symptoms and suicide-related ideation increased from 11 to 17% and from 5.8 to 11.8%, respectively. Among 872 students at risk after excluding those with moderate depressive symptoms at <i>T</i>1, 103 students (11.8%) developed moderate depressive symptoms at <i>T</i>2. Among the 928 students at risk, after excluding those who had suicidal ideation at <i>T</i>1, 79 (8.5%) developed suicidal ideation. Multivariate logistic modeling revealed financial insecurity and academic performance as risk factors (psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), while having someone to consult about worries was a coping factor for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Children's representations of the COVID-19 lockdown and pandemic through drawings","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to face it have placed children and their caregivers in front of many challenges that could represent sources of stress. This work aims to explore the point of view of children through drawing, as a spontaneous means of expression, relating it to parents' perceptions of children's difficulties, strengths, and mentalization skills. The sample consists of 18 children (mean age = 8.22, SD = 1.79). Parents were asked to complete: a socio-demographic questionnaire with information on the impact of COVID-19 on the family, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Everyday Mindreading Scale. Children were asked to draw three moments: ""Before"" the pandemic, ""During"" the lockdown, and ""After,"" when the COVID-19 will be passed. The drawings were coded by constructing a content and expressive analysis grid, adapting coding systems found in the literature. Data were collected at the beginning of the summer of 2020, just after the first lockdown period (from March to May 2020 in Italy). The results of the present work are in line with previous studies that reported experiences of wellbeing and tranquility of children in time spent at home with family during the pandemic. From the drawings emerges that children feel sufficiently able to master the situation, as reflected by including themselves in drawings and providing many details of the house in ""During"" drawings. The literature also reports a feeling of sadness/loneliness caused by the lack of friends, an element that we also find in the tendency to represent friends significantly more in the drawings concerning the future. Some contents of drawings (inclusion of friends, relatives, and parents) appeared associated with emotional, interpersonal, and mentalizing abilities of children, as perceived by parents. Exploring children's representations of a stressful event like the pandemic through drawings allows to focus both on their difficulties and on their resources, with useful implications for the educational support.","Cornaggia, Bianco, Gilli, Marchetti, Massaro, Castelli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.960893","20220913","COVID-19; child development; children drawings; emotions; mindreading abilities; relationship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37623,""
"Tobacco smoking and depressive symptoms in Chinese middle-aged and older adults: Handling missing values in panel data with multiple imputation","The high co-occurrence of tobacco smoking and depression is a major public health concern during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. However, no studies have dealt with missing values when assessing depression. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effect of tobacco smoking on depressive symptoms using a multiple imputation technique. This research was a longitudinal study using data from four waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study conducted between 2011 and 2018, and the final sample consisted of 74,381 observations across all four waves of data collection. The present study employed a multiple imputation technique to deal with missing values, and a fixed effects logistic regression model was used for the analysis. The results of fixed effects logistic regression showed that heavy smokers had 20% higher odds of suffering from depressive symptoms than those who never smoked. Compared to those who never smoked, for short-term and moderate-term quitters, the odds of suffering from depressive symptoms increased by 30% and 22%, respectively. The magnitudes of the odds ratios for of the variables short-term quitters, moderate-term quitters, and long-term quitters decreased in absolute terms with increasing time-gaps since quitting. The sub-group analysis for men and women found that heavy male smokers, short-term and moderate-term male quitters had higher odds of suffering from depressive symptoms than those who never smoked. However, associations between smoking status and depressive symptoms were not significant for women. The empirical findings suggested that among Chinese middle-aged and older adults, heavy smokers and short-term and moderate-term quitters have increased odds of suffering from depressive symptoms than those who never smoked. Moreover, former smokers reported that the probability of having depressive symptoms decreased with a longer duration since quitting. Nevertheless, the association between depressive symptoms and smoking among Chinese middle-aged and older adults is not straightforward and may vary according to gender. These results may have important implications that support the government in allocating more resources to smoking cessation programs to help middle-aged and older smokers, particularly in men.","Du, Wu, Kang, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.913636","20220913","China; depressive symptoms; missing value; multiple imputation; smoking; Aged; COVID-19; China; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Tobacco Smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37624,""

"Prevalence and risk factors of depressive symptoms among 140,259 college students during the COVID-19 epidemic normalization in China: A cross-sectional survey","College students are one of the most vulnerable populations to the COVID-19 pandemic's mental health effects. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, we wanted to see how common depressive symptoms were among college students and what factors contributed to that. Between 21 and 27 May 2021, 140,259 college students from three cities in Henan Province, China, were involved. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to determine depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for potential depressive symptom factors. Mild depressive symptoms and above are present in 21.12% of college students. Women had a higher prevalence of mild depressive symptoms than men (61.38 vs. 59.75%), and depressive symptoms were most prevalent among rural students and least prevalent among city students (21.44 vs. 20.29%). Participants with depressive symptoms are also more likely to have a poor-behavioral status. From none-to-severe depressive symptoms, 78.88, 15.78, 2.80, 1.67, and 0.88% had them. Gender, residential location, and behavioral status were found to be associated with depressive symptoms after adjusting for potential confounders.

"Emotional exhaustion and unhealthy eating among COVID-19 front-line healthcare workers during recuperation: A cross-sectional study","Thousands of healthcare workers on the frontlines who have been battling the COVID-19 pandemic could face emotional and mental health risks even after their critical pandemic work. This study examined the impact of affective rumination on emotional exhaustion and the spillover effect of affective rumination on unhealthy food consumption among healthcare workers during recuperation. A total of 418 frontline healthcare workers from 10 Chinese medical institutions were recruited through random cluster sampling. A linear mixed model in SPSS25.0 was performed for hierarchical regression to analyze the effect of affective rumination on unhealthy food consumption via emotional exhaustion. A conditional process analysis was employed to investigate the moderating role of family support in the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion. Front-line healthcare workers scored at a medium level on an emotional exhaustion scale (2.45 Ã‚Â± 0.88). Affective rumination mediated by emotional exhaustion had a significant positive predictive effect on unhealthy food consumption. The indirect effect accounted for ~43.9% of the total effect. Family support amplified the effect of emotional exhaustion on unhealthy food consumption (ÃŽÂ² = 0.092, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Affective rumination could be a cause of emotional exhaustion and unhealthy food consumption. First-line healthcare workers could be screened for possible emotional exhaustion through the evaluation of affective rumination in order to provide them with targeted interventions. Family support did not prove to be beneficial in all cases as it enhanced the positive effect of emotional exhaustion on unhealthy eating in the current study. Therefore, family support should be carefully integrated in future interventions.","Yan, Zhou, Song, Luo, Wang, Yin, Wu, Ye","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.926395","20220913","COVID-19; affective rumination; emotional exhaustion; front-line healthcare workers; unhealthy food consumption; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37627,""
"Bipolar Disorder after COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report from an Ethiopian Perspective","COVID-19 has been a sudden public health crisis since January 2020, spreading from the city of Wuhan, China, to the whole country within a month and posing serious threats to lives. The pandemic has a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. The actual effect of the virus on the brain and possible psychiatric manifestations is still an area of study and further investigation. There are also several case reports showing manic like symptoms after COVID-19 infection. We describe the case of a 55-year-old patient who presented with behavioral and mood symptoms after a COVID-19 infection. <i>Case Presentation</i>. The patient presented with behavioral disturbance after a diagnosis of COVID-19. He exhibited symptoms including irritability, verbal and physical aggressiveness, increased goal-directed activity, elated and expansive mood, increased energy, grandiosity and inflated self-esteem, and decreased need for sleep. Findings on psychiatric evaluation encompassing detailed history and mental state examination suggested bipolar disorder due to COVID-19 infections. For this, he was put on sodium valproate 1000Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg per day and later, and he was discharged after 21 days with improvement. This case highlights the importance of paying attention to psychiatric symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and the early intervention and involvement of psychiatrists especially in critically ill patients. In the present scenario, we urge physicians to pay attention to those cases and be open-minded for such a possible new diagnosis. We also recommend performing antibody tests for CSF and RNA tests for patients with mental abnormalities following COVID-19. Further studies can be performed to identify the relationship between COVID-19 and bipolar disorders.","Tesfaye, Alemayehu, Gebru","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8931599","20220913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37628,""
"The association between peritraumatic distress, perceived stress, depression in pregnancy, and NR3C1 DNA methylation among Chinese pregnant women who experienced COVID-19 lockdown","Prenatal stress can affect pregnant women in an epigenetic way during the critical period of conception of their offspring. The study aims to investigate the relationship between peritraumatic distress, prenatal perceived stress, depression, and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) DNA methylation among pregnant women who experienced COVID-19 lockdown in China. Study data were collected from 30 pregnant women in Wuhan and Huanggang, China. The Peritraumatic Distress Inventory was used to measure peritraumatic distress, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms, and the Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived stress. DNA methylation in the exon 1F promoter region of NR3C1 gene from the venous blood mononuclear cell genome was characterized by bisulfite sequencing. Correlation and linear regression were used for data analysis. The mean level of peritraumatic distress, perceived stress, and depression was 6.30 (SD = 5.09), 6.50 (SD = 5.41), and 6.60 (SD = 4.85), respectively, with 23.33% of pregnant women being depressed. The mean NR3C1 methylation was 0.65 (SD = 0.22). Prenatal depression was positively correlated with the degree of methylation in venous blood from the mother (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), and depression predicted methylation of NR3C1 gene at the CpG 8 site (ÃŽÂ² = 0.05, p = 0.03). No association was found between peritraumatic distress as well as perceived stress and methylation of NR3C1. NR3C1 gene was susceptible to epigenetic modification of DNA methylation in the context of prenatal stress, and maternal depression was associated with increased NR3C1 methylation among women who experienced COVID-19 lockdown.","Wei, Ying, Zhai, Li, Liu, Liu, Yu, Yan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.966522","20220913","DNA methylation; NR3C1; depression; glucocorticoid receptor; perceived stress; peritraumatic distress; pregnant women; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; DNA Methylation; Depression; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37629,""

"Religious Conspiracy Theories About the COVID-19 Pandemic Are Associated With Negative Mental Health","<b>Objectives:</b> Together with the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories have begun to spread. Evidence is lacking for religious conspiracy theories (RCT) related to COVID-19 in a non-religious environment. This study aimed to assess links between religiosity and spirituality (R/S) and RCT about COVID-19, and to examine their associations with mental health. <b>Methods:</b> A sample of Czech adults (<i>n</i> = 1,273, mean age = 47.5, SD = 16.4; 51.5% male) participated in the survey. We measured R/S, RCT, negative religious coping (NRC), feelings impairment and mental health symptoms. <b>Results:</b> We found R/S were significantly associated with RCT with ÃŽÂ² 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.82) for the strongest association. Moreover, RCT and NRC were strongly associated with paranoia, anxiety and depression.

"Resilience as a Source of Easement to Health-Related Worries in Women at Increased Risk for Breast or Ovarian Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected individuals' and society's physical and psychological well-being. The study was conducted in order to assess the predictors for health-related worries during the COVID-19 pandemic in vulnerable populations. A cross-sectional web-based survey of women who had a higher risk of developing breast cancer (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC) was conducted, regardless of whether they had experienced an active malignant disease during the pandemic. A self-reported questionnaire was designed for this study to assess health-related worries. The PHQ-4 questionnaire was used to evaluate mental health, and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) questionnaire was employed to investigate resilience. History of BC or OC was recognized as an independent significant risk factor for worries regarding being more susceptible to a more severe course of COVID-19 disease (OR 3.593; 95% CI 1.030-12.536; p = 0.045). High scores in the BRS questionnaire were negatively correlated with health-related worries, such as an increased risk for occurrence of BC or OC (OR 0.332; 95% CI 0.118-0.933; p = 0.37) or worsening of oncological outcome as a result of an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (OR 0.330; 95% I 0.114-0.956; p = 0.041). The obtained findings determined resilience as an independent and potent protective parameter in terms of health-related concerns in women at high risk for BC and OC. The results may assist in identifying women at risk for health-related concerns during adverse life events, allowing healthcare providers to respond fast and according to the patientsÃ‚Â´ needs.","Schwab, Droste, Stewen, Elger, Theis, Heimes, Peters, Schmidt, Brenner, Hasenburg","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S373191","20220913","BRCA 1 &amp; 2; COVID-19; health-related worries; mental health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37636,""
"Perspective of Uncertainty and Emotional Responses in Breast Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Breast cancer is a chronic disease that has implications for many aspects of the patient's life. Contracting the COVID-19 virus places cancer patients at a higher risk of infection. This condition triggers uncertainty which causes emotional responses. The aim of this study was to measure the relationship between the uncertainty perspective of breast cancer patients and emotional responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used an observational study with a cross-sectional design. Data was collected from May to December 2021. The total sample of this study was 110 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Army Hospital of Dr. Soepraeon Malang, Indonesia. We used purposive sampling. The questionnaire used was a modified questionnaire from the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, a modified questionnaire from the Concerns about Recurrence Questionnaire, a modified questionnaire from the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale, and a modified questionnaire from the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Data was analyzed using SPSS with a Spearman correlation test. The mean uncertainty of the respondents was 75.98 or in the moderate category, emotional response was moderate fear with a mean score of 18.40, the average anxiety score was 41.05 or normal, and the mean depression score was 15.96 or low depression. In addition, there was a significant relationship between uncertainty and the emotional response among breast cancer patients in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€¦&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.05). This study showed that there was a relationship between uncertainty and emotional response among breast cancer patients. It is important for nurses to provide good information about the disease among patients by using therapeutic communication and paying attention to the negative emotional responses of breast cancer patients.","Supriati, Sudiana, Nihayati, Ahsan, Rodli, Kapti","https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608221124294","20220913","COVID-19; breast cancer; emotional responses; uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37637,""

"Factoring and correlation in sleep, fatigue and mental workload of clinical first-line nurses in the post-pandemic era of COVID-19: A multi-center cross-sectional study","A better understanding of the factors and their correlation with clinical first-line nurses' sleep, fatigue and mental workload is of great significance to personnel scheduling strategies and rapid responses to anti-pandemic tasks in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. This multicenter and cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the nurses' sleep, fatigue and mental workload and contributing factors to each, and to determine the correlation among them. A total of 1,004 eligible nurses (46 males, 958 females) from three tertiary hospitals participated in this cluster sampling survey. The Questionnaire Star online tool was used to collect the sociodemographic and study target data: Sleep quality, fatigue, and mental workload. Multi-statistical methods were used for data analysis using SPSS 25.0 and Amos 21.0. The average sleep quality score was 10.545 Ã‚Â± 3.399 (insomnia prevalence: 80.2%); the average fatigue score was 55.81 Ã‚Â± 10.405 (fatigue prevalence: 100%); and the weighted mental workload score was 56.772 Ã‚Â± 17.26. Poor sleep was associated with mental workload (<i>r</i> = 0.303, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and fatigue (<i>r</i> = 0.727, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Fatigue was associated with mental workload (<i>r</i> = 0.321, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). COVID-19 has caused both fatigue and mental workload. As 49% of nurses claimed their mental workload has been severely affected by COVID-19, while it has done slight harm to 68.9% of nurses' sleep quality. In the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, the high prevalence of sleep disorders and fatigue emphasizes the importance of paying enough attention to the mental health of nurses in first-class tertiary hospitals. Efficient nursing strategies should focus on the interaction of sleep, fatigue and mental workload in clinical nurses. In that case, further research on solutions to the phenomenon stated above proves to be of great significance and necessity.

"COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA: CORRELATION WITH DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL AND EMOTIONAL PROFILE","The aim: To study the structure of cognitive impairment in patients who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Investigate the correlation with demographic, biochemical parameters, as well as the emotional state of the patient. Materials and methods: Cognitive functions were assessed using the MOCA test. PHQ-9 depression and GAD-7 anxiety questionnaires were used to study psychopathological symptoms. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. Results: Cognitive performance is impaired in 94% of patients with COVID-19. This allows to suggest that COVID-19 has a serious impact on cognition, especially in elder people. Among different domains only visuospatial and executive functioning, abstract thinking, attention and delayed recall were severely impaired, while other domains stayed relatively intact. Patients after COVID-19 also tend to have a mild depressive and anxiety state. Anxiety levels were higher than depressive levels, but not connected to cognitive functioning. Also, there was seen a positive correlation between anxiety and pO2 and negative between anxiety and comorbid cardiac pathology. However, this requires further studies to reveal. Another interesting finding was non-linear relationship between cognitive performance and depression, that allows to suggest rapidly evolving depressive mood in persons with severe cognitive impairment after COVID-19. Cognitive and emotional state of patients after COVID-19 was also highly connected with working status. Conclusion: Significant cognitive impairment was presented in almost all patients with COVID-19. There was a selective impairment in domains of visuospatial/ executive functioning, abstract thinking, attention and delayed recall. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment was presented in almost all patients with COVID-19.

"MAPPING MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC A COMPARISON REVIEW OF CHINA AND WESTERN EUROPE","The aim: To map and compare mental health interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic in China and Western-Europe. The focus was specifically on the availability, duration, target group, content, setting, and outcomes of the interventions. Materials and methods: A scoping review was conducted by utilising several scientific databases. A total of 479 articles were found after removing the duplicate records. After screening, 36 articles were included in the study. Relevant intervention characteristics were systematically mapped, and compared within and among countries. Conclusions: All interventions had shared aims to improve the psychological resilience and to reduce psychological distress. In particular, anxiety- and depression-related symptoms were commonly addressed. On average, interventions in China were larger scaled, had longer durations, and often used combinations of strategies such as therapies and exercises both in-person and remotely. Interventions in Western-Europe tend to be locally implemented on a smaller scale, and often used a single strategy. Most Chinese interventions targeted adolescents, while all interventions in Western-Europe were meant for adults. Most interventions were assessed using quantitative methods using various mental health scales, showing statistically significant effects in improving mental health.","Vus, Nakanishi, da Silva","https://doi.org/10.36740/WLek202208102","20220913"," Covid-19;  Intervention;  MHPSS;  Mental health;  Pandemic ; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","",37643,""
"The Key Role of Schools in Youth Suicide Prevention","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for youth and families dealing with remote school and work, lack of childcare, and social isolation over the course of 2 years. In response, the U.S. Surgeon General recently published an advisory warning of a mental health crisis among youth,<sup>1</sup> noting that youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities, racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority youth, and youth in low-income, rural, and immigrant households were at higher risk of mental health challenges in the pandemic. The advisory arrived on the heels of an emergency declaration about child and adolescent mental health put forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Children's Hospital Association in October 2021. Both emphasize that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already growing youth mental health concerns and highlight the key role schools must play in preventing youth suicide.
