"COVID-19 dimensions and psychotic experiences among US college students: Findings from the Healthy Mind Study 2020","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous changes in daily living, which may be related to mental health problems, including psychotic experiences, though research has only begun to assess these associations. We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Survey (Fall Semester Cohort 2020), which is a non-probability sample of students attending one of 36 universities in the United States, who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic (September-December 2020). We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the associations between several COVID-19 dimensions (anxiety, discrimination, financial distress, infection, illness of loved one, death of loved one, caregiving) and 12-month psychotic experiences, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status. Each individual COVID-19 dimension was significantly associated with greater odds of having 12-month psychotic experiences, with the exception of being a caregiver. When accounting for all COVID-19 dimensions simultaneously in the same model, only COVID-19 related anxiety, financial distress, and infection were associated with psychotic experiences. COVID-19 dimensions were linked to psychotic experiences among university students, which may also apply to the larger population. This can potentially inform assessment and treatment during the pandemic.","Oh, Goehring, Rajkumar, Besecker, Zhou, DeVylder","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2021.09.003","20210917","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Pandemic; Psychotic experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18026,""
"Interleukin-37 is down-regulated in serum of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are indicated to play a prominent role in mediating the immunopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Interleukin (IL-37) is one of the anti-inflammatory cytokines that has been proposed to be involved in disease progression but the data are not overwhelming. Therefore, a case-control study was performed to analyze IL-37 levels in serum of 100 patients with severe COVID-19 and 100 blood donors (control group). Median age was significantly higher in COVID-19 cases than in controls. Stratification by gender, body mass index and ABO and Rh blood group systems showed no significant differences between patients and controls. Chronic diseases (cardiovascular and diabetes) were observed in 57.0% of patients. Serum levels of IL-37 and vitamin D were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. The low level of IL-37 was more pronounced in males, overweight/obese cases, blood group B or AB cases, Rh-positive cases, and cases with no chronic disease. Low producers of IL-37 were more likely to develop COVID-19 (odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.66; 95% confidence intervalÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.51-4.70; corrected probabilityÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.015). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a low serum level of IL-37 was a good predictor of COVID-19. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed that IL-37 and vitamin D were significantly correlated. In conclusion, IL-37 was down-regulated in serum of patients with severe COVID-19 compared to controls. This down-regulation may be associated with an increased risk of disease. Gender, body mass index, blood groups and chronic disease status may also affect IL-37 levels.","Ahmed, Ad'hiah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155702","20210917","Coronavirus disease-19; Interleukin-37; Odds ratio; Receiver operating characteristic curve; Vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18027,""
"An Update on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Pregnancy","Physiologic, mechanical and immunologic alterations in pregnancy could potentially affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 during pregnancy. Due to lack of comparable incidence data and challenges with disentangling differences in susceptibility from different exposure risks, data are insufficient to determine whether pregnancy increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data support pregnancy as a risk factor for severe disease associated with COVID-19; some of the best evidence comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) COVID-19 surveillance system, which reported that pregnant persons were more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), require invasive ventilation, require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and die compared with nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Although intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented, it appears to be rare, possibly related to low levels of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and decreased co-expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) needed for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in the placenta. Evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth, especially among pregnant persons with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes, there is evidence that the pandemic and its effects on healthcare systems have had adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes, such as increased stillbirths and maternal deaths. These trends may represent widening disparities and an alarming reversal of recent improvements in maternal and infant health. All three COVID-19 vaccines currently available under an Emergency Use Authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration can be administered to pregnant or lactating persons, with no preference for vaccine type. Although safety data in pregnancy are rapidly accumulating and no safety signals in pregnancy have been detected, additional information about birth outcomes, particularly among persons vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, are needed.","Jamieson, Rasmussen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.08.054","20210917","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); SARS-CoV-2; fetal death; fetus; maternal death; newborn; perinatal infection; pneumonia; pregnancy; preterm birth; vertical transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18028,""

"In vitro selection of Remdesivir resistance suggests evolutionary predictability of SARS-CoV-2","Remdesivir (RDV), a broadly acting nucleoside analogue, is the only FDA approved small molecule antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. To date, there are no reports identifying SARS-CoV-2 RDV resistance in patients, animal models or in vitro. Here, we selected drug-resistant viral populations by serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV. Using high throughput sequencing, we identified a single mutation in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12) at a residue conserved among all coronaviruses in two independently evolved populations displaying decreased RDV sensitivity. Introduction of the NSP12 E802D mutation into our SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics backbone confirmed its role in decreasing RDV sensitivity in vitro. Substitution of E802 did not affect viral replication or activity of an alternate nucleoside analogue (EIDD2801) but did affect virus fitness in a competition assay. Analysis of the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (&gt;800,000 sequences) showed no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we observed an excess of substitutions in Spike at corresponding sites identified in the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (i.e., H69, E484, N501, H655) indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. The identification and characterisation of a drug resistant signature within the SARS-CoV-2 genome has implications for clinical management and virus surveillance.","Szemiel, Merits, Orton, MacLean, Pinto, Wickenhagen, Lieber, Turnbull, Wang, Furnon, Suarez, Mair, da Silva Filipe, Willett, Wilson, Patel, Thomson, Palmarini, Kohl, Stewart","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009929","20210917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18030,""

"""LONG COVID"": an insight","We aimed this systematic review to analyze and review the currently available published literature related to long COVID, understanding its pattern, and predicting the long-term effects on survivors. We thoroughly searched the databases for relevant articles till May 2021. The research articles that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed and reviewed by two independent researchers. After preliminary screening of the identified articles through title and abstract, 249 were selected. Consequently, 167 full-text articles were assessed and reviewed based on our inclusion criteria and thus 20 articles were regarded as eligible and analyzed in the present analysis. All the studies included adult population aged between 18 and above 60 years. The median length of hospital stay of the COVID-19 patients during the acute infection phase ranged from 8 days to 17 days. The most common prevalent long-term symptoms in COVID-19 patients included persistent fatigue and dyspnea in almost all of the studies. Other reported common symptoms included: shortness of breath, cough, joint pain, chest pain or tightness, headache, loss of smell/taste, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of memory, depression, anxiety. Associated cardiovascular events included arrhythmias, palpitations and hypotension, increased HR, venous thromboembolic diseases, myocarditis, and acute/decompensated heart failure as well. Among neurological manifestations headache, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, memory issues, concentration, and sleep disorders were most commonly observed with varying frequencies. Mental health issues affecting mental abilities, mood fluctuations namely anxiety and depression, and sleep disorders were commonly seen. Further, diarrhea, vomiting, digestive disorders, and Loss of appetite or weight loss are common gastrointestinal manifestations. Therefore, appropriate clinical evaluation is required in long COVID cases which in turn may help us to identify the risk factors, etiology, and to my help, we treat them early with appropriate management strategies.","Ahmad, Shaik, Ahmad, Yusuf, Khan, Almutairi, Alghuyaythat, Almutairi","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202109_26669","20210917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18032,""
"The Protective Role of Parent Resilience on Mental Health and the Parent-Child Relationship During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is linked to particularly potent psychological effects for children and their caregivers while families adjust to new daily routines for work, education, and self-care. Longitudinal associations are presented from a national sample of 271 parents (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.29Ã‚Â years, 48.5% female) on resilience, mental health and stress indicators, and parenting outcomes. Multigroup path model results indicate significant associations between resilience and parent stress or parent perceived child stress initiates a sequence of significant linkages to parent depression, followed by caregiver burden and parent-child relationship quality. This final set of linkages between depression and both parenting outcomes were significantly stronger for men, who also reported higher rates of perceived child stress. Results suggest that fathers' depression symptoms and associated spill-over to perceived child stress is producing stronger effects on their parenting experiences than effects reported by mothers.","Russell, Tomkunas, Hutchison, Tambling, Horton","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01243-1","20210917","COVID-19; Caregiver burden; Parenting; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18033,""
"Comparison of Characteristics of Deaths From Drug Overdose Before vs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rhode Island","The rate of deaths from overdose has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent US overdose mortality rates have been markedly high. However, scant data are available on the causes of this increase or subpopulations at elevated risk. To evaluate the rates and characteristics of deaths from drug overdose before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective, population-based cohort study used data from 4 statewide databases linked at the person level via the Rhode Island Data Ecosystem on adults with deaths due to overdose in Rhode Island from January 1 to August 31, 2019, and January 1 to August 31, 2020. The rates of unintentional deaths from drug-related overdose during the 2019 and 2020 observation periods overall and by sociodemographic characteristics, drugs contributing to the cause of death, location of death, and socioeconomic factors were evaluated. In subgroup analyses restricted to Medicaid beneficiaries (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°271), the proportions of deaths from overdose by behavioral health treatment and diagnosis claims in the year before death were also examined. A total of 470 adults who died of drug overdose were included in the analysis (353 men [75%]; mean [SD] age, 43.5 [12.1] years). The rate of deaths from overdose in Rhode Island increased 28.1%, from 29.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2019 to 37.4 per 100 000 person-years in 2020 (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009). Compared with 2019, rates of deaths due to overdose during 2020 were higher among men (43.2 vs 59.2 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003), non-Hispanic White individuals (31.0 vs 42.0 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005), single individuals (54.8 vs 70.4 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04), deaths involving synthetic opioids (20.8 vs 28.3 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005), and deaths occurring in a personal residence (13.2 vs 19.7 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 person-years; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003). A decrease in the proportion of deaths from overdose involving heroin (11 of 206 [5%] vs &lt;2% [exact value suppressed]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02) and an increase among persons experiencing job loss (16 of 206 [8%] vs 41 of 264 [16%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) from 2019 to 2020 were observed. Among individuals who died of overdose and were Medicaid beneficiaries, the proportions of those aged 50 to 59 years with anxiety (11 of 121 [9%] vs 29 of 150 [19%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03), men with depression (27 of 121 [22%] vs 57 of 150 [38%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.008), and men with anxiety (28 of 121 [23%] vs 55 of 150 [37%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02) increased during 2020 compared with 2019. In this cohort study, during the first 8 months of 2020, the rate of deaths from overdose increased in Rhode Island compared with the same period in 2019, and several emerging characteristics of deaths from drug overdose during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified.

"Mental health of patients with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: a questionnaire-based survey weighted for attrition","Individuals with pre-existing mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic seems to have on mental health. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to assess whether patients with mental illness experienced deterioration in mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown of Denmark in the Spring of 2020. We conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey coupled with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees. The latter enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results. The online questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in symptoms during lockdown using the pre-pandemic period as reference. A total of 992 randomly drawn patients with mental illness from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region responded to the questionnaire (response rate = 21.6%). The weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 28, respectively. A total of 52% of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the lockdown, while 33% reported no change, and 16% reported improvement. The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration were loneliness, disruption of routines, concerns regarding the coronavirus, less contact with family/friends, boredom, and reduced access to psychiatric care. More than half of the patients reported worsening of their mental health during the pandemic lockdown. There should be an increased emphasis on ensuring both social and clinical support for individuals with mental illness during pandemics.","KÃƒÂ¸lbÃƒÂ¦k, Jefsen, Speed, ÃƒËœstergaard","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1970222","20210917","18-item Brief Symptom Inventory; 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index; Coronavirus disease 2019; mental disorders; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18035,""

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased contact of the victim with the aggressor (if he/she is the spouse), deepening of economic disparities, stressful environment, and loss of social support mechanisms are some of the factors that explain the possible increase in VAW rates. VAW is a sociological phenomenon whose bases are rooted in historical, political, religious, and economic conditions.

"Prevalence of problematic Internet use and its association with quality of life among undergraduate nursing students in the later stage of COVID-19 pandemic era in China","The prevalence of problematic Internet use (PIU) in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era is not known. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of PIU among baccalaureate nursing students (hereafter: nursing students) in the post-COVID-19 era. A total of 1070 nursing students were consecutively invited to participate in this study from the nursing schools of five universities. PIU and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. t Tests, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> , tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare basic demographic and clinical characteristics between participants with and without PIU. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine independent correlates. The prevalence of PIU was 23.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.7%-25.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that second- (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.024) and third-year (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.012) students were more likely to suffer from PIU compared with first year students. Students with more severe depressive (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.014) and anxiety symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.011) were independently and significantly associated with more severe PIU. After controlling for covariates, nursing students with PIU had a lower overall QOL score (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002). Problematic Internet use (PIU) was common among nursing students in the post-COVID-19 era. Considering the negative impact of PIU on QOL and academic performance, regular screening should be conducted and effective interventions implemented for nursing students with PIU. This was the first study on the prevalence of PIU among nursing students in the post-COVID-19 era.

"Psychological distress and perceived job stressors among hospital nurses and physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak","The study examined self-reported job-related stressors induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological distress among hospital nurses and physicians. In addition, we explored the role of negative affect (NA) and background variables in relation to COVID-19-related job stressors and psychological distress. During COVID-19 pandemic, hospital nurses and physicians were exposed to highly enduring occupational stress, that stem from subjective appraisal of inadequate job resources (i.e., personal protection equipment, information on how to manage safely in the ongoing work and organizational attention to the needs arising from the ongoing work). Cross-sectional design. Between May and July 2020, 172 nurses and physicians working at a medical centre in Israel filled in self-report questionnaires about sociodemographic data, COVID-19-related job stressors, psychological distress and NA. Our results confirmed the positive direct link between perceived COVID-19-related job stressors and psychological distress among hospital nurses and physicians. NA was found to serve as a mediator in this association (indirect link). Furthermore, nurses and physicians' seniority was related positively to psychological distress and also played a moderator role in the indirect link. We recommend to monitor the mental health of hospital nurses and physicians and to provide a platform to address their job stressor concerns related to COVID-19, and share helpful coping strategies. During the abrupt COVID-19 outbreak, hospital nurses and physicians face challenges that might raise NA and psychological distress. Our study revealed that among hospital nurses and physicians, COVID-19-related perceived job stressors and psychological distress were positively linked, and NA plays a mediating role in this association. Among nurses and physicians with moderate or high years of seniority (&gt;11Ã‚Â years), higher COVID-19-related perceived job stressors associated with higher NA, which in turn was associated with greater psychological distress. Policymakers would be wise to provide a platform to address hospital nurses and physicians' mental health.","Hamama, Marey-Sarwan, Hamama-Raz, Nakad, Asadi","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15041","20210917","COVID-19; job-related stressors; negative affect; nurses; physicians; psychological distress; seniority","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18040,""

With the observation method's help, a detailed perspective was found on people's coping processes, categorized as psychological, control, coherence, and connectedness coping. The present study considers the notable models of dealing with negative feelings, including '3Cs' and 'direct intervention and palliation strategy'. With the observation method's support, a detailed viewpoint was found on people's coping mechanisms, categorized as neurological, regulation, coherence, and connectedness coping. Using the ANOVA and t-tests, a significant augmentation in people's negative emotions was found since the beginning of the pandemic. Using GMM regression technique, 'avoidance', 'proactive preparedness', 'emotional resilience', 'entertainment', and 'spiritualism' were highly significant techniques in curbing the negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the LOGIT regression found cumulative negative emotions and emotions about negative career outlooks to be the most significant to bring negative emotions to normalcy. The study suggests that policymakers design a national-level strategy to strengthen the mental health systems to boost mental well-being.","Pandey, Talan, Mahendru, Shahzad","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16002-x","20210917","COVID-19; Coping strategies; LOGIT regression; Negative emotions; Quantitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18041,""
"Self-rated Changes of Health Status during Stay-at-home Orders among Older Adults Using the Long-term Care Insurance System of Japan: A Cross-sectional Study","To reveal self-rated changes of health status during stay-at-home orders among older adults and to verify whether decrease in frequency of going outdoors during these orders was related to self-rated changes in health status. A self-completed questionnaire for older adults was provided in 2 dayservice facilities and a nursing station. We operationally defined health status with 4 domains (motor function, oral and swallowing function, depression, and social networks) and designed the questionnaire to determine self-rated changes in health status using factor analysis. After factor analysis, regression analyses were conducted. Dependent variable was each factor score (self-rated changes of health status), and independent variable was decrease in frequency of going outdoors. Approximately 80% of participants answered that their health status had ""worsened"" in motor function (75.0%-87.2%). Moreover, more than 70% of participants answered ""worsened"" in ""Feeling energy"" and ""Getting together and speaking with friends"" (72.3% and 75.7%, respectively). Regression analyses demonstrated that, after adjusting for covariates, the decrease in frequency of going outdoors was related to self-rated changes of motor function and friend network. During stay-at-home orders, older adults felt deterioration in their motor function, in feeling energy, and in their friend network, especially people who had decreased their frequency of going outdoors felt more deterioration in their motor function and in their friend network.","Ono, Kashima, Asakawa","https://doi.org/10.1298/ptr.E10089","20210917","COVID-19; Frequency of going outdoors; Self-rated health; Stay-at-home orders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18042,""
"Observing the Working Alliance in Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Alcohol Addiction: Reliability and Validity of the Working Alliance Inventory Short Revised Observer","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the mental health and alcohol consumption of individuals. Videoconferencing psychotherapy has become a fundamental mode of treatment for people with alcohol use disorders. However, there are still doubts about its effectiveness and the therapeutic relationship. The working alliance is considered a foundation of effective practice in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Observer measurements of the working alliance have demonstrated reliability and meaningful associations with the reduction of symptoms. However, translations of instruments to evaluate the working alliance and examine its construct have not previously been conducted for online psychotherapy for alcohol addiction. This study aimed for the cross-cultural adaptation of the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form-Observer (WAI-SR-O) for Brazil and the evaluation of its reliability and evidence of its validity in videoconferencing psychotherapy for alcoholism. The WAI-SR-O was applied by pairs of observers for the evaluation of the working alliance in 19 recorded sessions of videoconferencing psychotherapy of 10 clients with a diagnosis of alcohol addiction. The sessions were also evaluated by the therapist (WAI-T) and client (WAI-C). The WAI-SR-O shows a moderate inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.67) for the general scale, higher ICC for the goals and bond subscales, and a moderate value for the task subscale. The internal consistency was good (a = 0.86). The results show low but significant correlations among the goals and bond subscales of the WAI-SR-O and the general, goals, and bond scales of the WAI-T. No correlations were found with the WAI-C. As the literature points out, the client, therapist, and observer versions of the WAI evaluated the alliance differently, requiring further study. The WAI-SR-O proved to be a reliable and valid measurement for the evaluation of the working alliance in videoconferencing psychotherapy for alcohol addiction, becoming an important tool for the study of the working alliance in telepsychotherapy.","Ribeiro, Colugnati, Kazantzis, Sartes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647814","20210917","COVIDÃ¢Ë†â€™19; alcohol; cognitive behavioral therapy; eHealth; evaluation; psychotherapeutic process; telepsychotherapy; working alliance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18043,""
"The Gaps Between the Self and Professional Evaluation in Mental Health Assessment of COVID-19 Cluster Cases","<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the discrepancy between self-rating and professional evaluation of mental health status in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cluster cases. <b>Method:</b> A total of 65 COVID-19 cluster cases admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University from June 14, 2020 to June 16, 2020 were included in the study. Mental health assessment was completed by self-rating and professional evaluation. The gaps between self-rating and professional evaluation in different demographic characteristics were compared. <b>Results:</b> The results of self-rating were inconsistent with those of professional evaluation. The gap was statistically different among certain demographic subgroups. As for anxiety, the gaps had remarkable statistics differences in subgroups of sex, monthly income, infection way, and anxiety/depression medical history. Similarly, in the terms of depression, the gaps had significant statistic differences in the subgroups of the medical history of anxiety/depression, history of physical disease, employment status and the insurance type, marriage, education (year), residing in Beijing (year), and the monthly income. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared to the professional evaluation, patients had a higher self-rating, which may be related to some demographic characteristics. It suggests that screening can be conducted in patients with COVID-19 by self-rating first, and then professional evaluation should be carried out in the patients with suspicious or positive results.","Liu, Wang, Hao, Yang, Yang, Duan, Fang, Han, Jiang, Li, Liu, Wang, Song","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.614193","20210917","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental health assessment; professional evaluation; self-rating scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18044,""

"How Has COVID-19-Related Income Loss and Household Stress Affected Adolescent Mental Health in Kenya?","Adolescent mental health has been under-researched, particularly in Africa. COVID-19-related household economic stress and school closures will likely have adverse effects. We investigate the relationship among adolescent mental health, adult income loss, and household dynamics during the pandemic in Kenya. A cross-sectional mobile phone-based survey was conducted with one adult and adolescent (age 10-19Ã‚Â years) pair from a sample of households identified through previous cohort studies in three urban Kenyan counties (Nairobi, Kilifi, Kisumu). Survey questions covered education, physical and mental health, and COVID-19-related impacts on job loss, food insecurity, and healthcare seeking. Logistic regression models were fit to explore relationships among adult income loss, household dynamics, food insecurity, and adult and adolescent depressive symptoms (defined as PHQ-2 score Ã¢â€°Â¤2). A total of 2,224 adult-adolescent pairs (Nairobi, nÃ‚Â = 814; Kilifi, nÃ‚Â = 914; Kisumu, nÃ‚Â = 496) completed the survey. Over a third (36%) of adolescents reported depressive symptoms, highest among older (15-19Ã‚Â years) boys. Adult loss of income was associated with skipping meals, depressive symptoms, household tensions/violence, and forgoing healthcare. Adolescents had 2.5 higher odds of depressive symptoms if COVID-19 was causing them to skip meals (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 2.0-3.1), if their adult head of household reported depressive symptoms (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 2.1-3.2). Income loss during the pandemic adversely affects food insecurity, household dynamics, healthcare-seeking behavior, and worsening adolescent depressive symptoms. With schools reopening, adolescent mental health should be formally addressed, potentially through cash transfers, school or community-based psychosocial programming.","Pinchoff, Friesen, Kangwana, Mbushi, Muluve, Ngo, Austrian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.023","20210917","Adolescent health; COVID-19; Economic insecurity; Kenya; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18047,""
"COVID-19 Employment Status, Dyadic Family Relationships, and Child Psychological Well-Being","COVID-19 has led to soaring unemployment rates and the widespread adoption of working-from-home (WFH) arrangements that have disrupted family relationships and adolescent psychological well-being. This longitudinal study investigated how parental employment status (i.e., job loss and WFH) influenced adolescents' daily affect indirectly through family functioning (i.e., parent-adolescent conflict and parental warmth) and whether these links varied by family's socioeconomic status. Daily-diary approaches were used to collect dyadic parent-adolescent data from a nationwide American sample (6,524 daily assessments from 447 parent-adolescent dyads; 45% black, 36% white, 10% Latinx, 7% Asian American, 2% Native American) over the course of 15 consecutive days at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents who experienced job loss demonstrated increases in parent-child conflict, which in turn predicted decreases in child positive affect and increases in child negative affect. Furthermore, parents' WFH status predicted increases in parental warmth, which in turn predicted increases in child positive affect and decreases in child negative affect. Parents of low-income families were more likely to experience job loss (24% vs. 13%) and less likely to WFH (44% vs. 73%) than middle-high income parents. Adolescents from families facing economic hardship and employment shifts during COVID-19 experienced changes in parent-child relational dynamics that influenced their emotional well-being. Recognizing these shifts in family ecology is critical to health providers' ability to screen for mental health, assess existing family supports, and provide timely, targeted information about stress management and contending with family conflict.","Wang, Henry, Del Toro, Scanlon, Schall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.016","20210917","COVID-19; Employment status; Family relationship; Psychological well-being; Socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18048,""
"Perceived weight gain and eating disorder symptoms among LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a convergent mixed-method study","In this study, we further explore the role of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress, social support, and resilience on self-reported eating disorder symptoms (using the EDE-QS) and perceived weight gain among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°adults) in the US context during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing a convergent mixed method design, we surveyed 411 individuals, and conducted qualitative semi-structured follow-up interviews with 43 LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°-identifying survey respondents. Using OLS regression and multinomial logistic regression, we modeled eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain among LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°individuals (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°120) and cisgender and heterosexual-identifying women (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°230), to cisgender and heterosexual-identifying men (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°61). We also explored complementary interview narratives among LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°people by employing selective coding strategies. Study results suggest that LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°individuals are likely experiencing uniquely high levels of pandemic-related stress, and secondly, that pandemic-related stress is associated with elevated eating disorder symptoms and higher risk of perceived weight gain. Nearly 1 in 3 participants reported eating disorder symptoms of potentially clinical significance. Social support, but not resilient coping, was found to be protective against increased eating disorder symptoms. Qualitative analyses revealed that LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°individuals situated physical exercise constraints, challenging eating patterns, and weight concerns within their pandemic experiences. Clinicians of diverse specialties should screen for eating disorder symptoms and actively engage patients in conversations about their COVID-19-related weight gain and eating behaviors, particularly with LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°-identifying adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has uniquely shaped the mental health of individuals globally. Adults, particularly those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+), may be at risk of engaging in disordered eating behaviors (eating disorder symptoms) due to pandemic-related stress. This study explores correlates of eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 411 US-residents, and engaged in follow-up semi-structured interviews with 43 LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°-identifying survey respondents to better establish the unique pandemic-related experiences and mental health challenges of LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°adults. We quantitatively found that LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°individuals experienced uniquely high levels of pandemic-related stress, and secondly, that pandemic-related stress was associated with increased eating disorder symptoms and perceived weight gain. Qualitative narratives complemented quantative findings and suggested that eating concerns, physical exercise constraints, and weight concerns were important to LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perceived health challenges during the pandemic. These findings highlight the need to screen for any persistent eating disorder symptoms or weight concerns, particularly among LGBTQ+Ã¢â‚¬â€°adults.","Tabler, Schmitz, Charak, Dickinson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00470-0","20210917","COVID-19; EDE-QS; LGBTQ; Weight gain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18049,""
"Impact of imposed social isolation and use of face masks on asthma course and mental health in pediatric and adult patients with recurrent wheeze and asthma","There is currently a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, and further drastic restrictions in our daily life will be necessary to contain this pandemic. The implications of restrictive measures like social-distancing and mouth-nose protection on patients with chronic respiratory diseases have hardly been investigated. Our survey, was conducted within the All Age Asthma Cohort (ALLIANCE), a multicenter longitudinal observational study. We assessed the effects of COVID-19 imposed social isolation and use of facial masks, on asthma course and mental health in patients with asthma and wheezing. We observed a high rate of problems associated with using facemasks and a significant reduction in the use of routine medical care. In addition to unsettling impacts, such as an increase in depression symptoms in adults, an astonishing and pleasing effect was striking: preschool children experienced an improvement in disease condition during the lockdown. This improvement can be attributed to a significant reduction in exposure to viral infections. Long-term observation of this side effect may help improve our understanding of the influence of viral infections on asthma in early childhood.","Maison, HerbrÃƒÂ¼ggen, Schaub, Schauberger, Foth, Grychtol, Abdo, Watz, Nikolaizik, Rabe, Kopp, Hansen, von Mutius, Bahmer, Omony, Fuchs, Roesler, Welchering, Kohistani-Greif, Kurz, Landgraf-Rauf, Laubhahn, Maison, Schaub, Ege, von Mutius, Illi, Omony, Hose, Zeitlmann, Berbig, Marzi, Schauberger, Ricklefs, Diekmann, Liboschik, Voigt, Sultansei, Weckmann, Kopp, Nissen, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Thiele, Bahmer, Kirsten, Pedersen, Watz, Waschki, Rabe, Herzmann, Hundack, Opitz, Gaede, Bovermann, Steinmetz, Veith, Brinkmann, Dittrich, Happle, Grychtol, Malik, Schwerk, Dopfer, Price, Hansen, Jirmo, Habener, DeLuca, Nikolaizik, Zemlin, Foth, Leson, Werlein, Maier, Skevaki, Renz, Schildberg, Rietschel, van Koningsbruggen-Rietschel","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13223-021-00592-9","20210917","Asthma; COVID-19; Facemasks; Health care utilization; Psychological health; Side effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18050,""
"Employment and working conditions of nurses: where and how health inequalities have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Nurses and midwives play a critical role in the provision of care and the optimization of health services resources worldwide, which is particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, they can only provide quality services if their work environment provides adequate conditions to support them. Today the employment and working conditions of many nurses worldwide are precarious, and the current pandemic has prompted more visibility to the vulnerability to health-damaging factors of nurses' globally. This desk review explores how employment relations, and employment and working conditions may be negatively affecting the health of nurses in countries such as Brazil, Croatia, India, Ireland, Italy, MÃƒÂ©xico, Nepal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Nurses' health is influenced by the broader social, economic, and political system and the redistribution of power relations that creates new policies regarding the labour market and the welfare state. The vulnerability faced by nurses is heightened by gender inequalities, in addition to social class, ethnicity/race (and caste), age and migrant status, that are inequality axes that explain why nurses' workers, and often their families, are exposed to multiple risks and/or poorer health. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, informalization of nurses' employment and working conditions were unfair and harmed their health. During COVID-19 pandemic, there is evidence that the employment and working conditions of nurses are associated to poor physical and mental health. The protection of nurses' health is paramount. International and national enforceable standards are needed, along with economic and health policies designed to substantially improve employment and working conditions for nurses and work-life balance. More knowledge is needed to understand the pathways and mechanisms on how precariousness might affect nurses' health and monitor the progress towards nurses' health equity.","Llop-GironÃƒÂ©s, VraÃ„Âar, Llop-GironÃƒÂ©s, Benach, Angeli-Silva, Jaimez, Thapa, Bhatta, Mahindrakar, Bontempo Scavo, Nar Devi, Barria, Marcos Alonso, JuliÃƒÂ ","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-021-00651-7","20210917","Employment conditions; Health; Nurses; Policy; Working conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18051,""
"Depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 in the general population and health-care workers: prevalence, relationship, and explicative model in Peru","This study has two aims. First, determine the fit of the fear model to COVID-19, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress in the general population and health-care workers. Second, determine which model best explains the relationship between depression and the triad of fear, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress in both groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-reported questionnaires for anxiety, fear of COVID-19, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Information was collected from adults living in Lima, the capital and the most populous city in Peru. The explanatory models were evaluated using a structural equation model. A total of 830 participants were included, including general population (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°640) and health-care workers (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°190). A high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms (16%), anxiety (11.7%), and post-traumatic stress (14.9%) were identified. A higher prevalence of depressive, anxious, or stress symptoms was identified in the general population (28.6%) compared to health-care workers (17.9%). The triad model of fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and stress presented adequate goodness-of-fit indices for both groups. A model was identified that manages to explain depressive symptoms in more than 70% of the general population and health-care workers, based on the variables of the triad (CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94; TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94; RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.06; SRMRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.06). In the general population post-traumatic stress mediated the relationship between anxiety and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.06 to 0.18) which was significant, but the indirect effect of post-traumatic stress was not significant in health care workers (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11 to 0.19). The prevalence estimates relied on self-reported information. Other variables of interest, such as intolerance to uncertainty or income level, could not be evaluated.

"Postpartum women's psychological experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: a modified recurrent cross-sectional thematic analysis","COVID-19 has placed additional stressors on mothers during an already vulnerable lifecourse transition. Initial social distancing restrictions (Timepoint 1; T1) and initial changes to those social distancing restrictions (Timepoint 2; T2) have disrupted postpartum access to practical and emotional support. This qualitative study explores the postpartum psychological experiences of UK women during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated 'lockdowns'. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 women, approximately 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days after initial social distancing guidelines were imposed in the UK (22 April 2020). A separate 12 women were interviewed approximately 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days after the initial easing of social distancing restrictions (10 June 2020). Data were transcribed verbatim, uploaded into NVivo for management and analysis, which followed a recurrent cross-sectional approach to thematic analysis. Two main themes were identified for T1: 'Motherhood is Much Like Lockdown' and 'A Self-Contained Family Unit'. Each main T1 theme contained two sub-themes. Two main themes were also identified for T2: 'Incongruously Held Views of COVID-19' and 'Mothering Amidst the Pandemic'. Each main T2 theme contained three sub-themes. Comparisons between data gathered at each timepoint identified increased emotional distress over time. Current findings call for the improvement of postpartum care by improving accessibility to social support, and prioritising the re-opening of schools, and face-to-face healthcare appointments and visitation. Social distancing restrictions associated with COVID-19 have had a cumulative, negative effect on postpartum mental health. Recommendations such as: Allowing mothers to 'bubble' with a primary support provider even at their healthcare appointments; allowing one support partner to attend all necessary healthcare appointments; and providing tailored informational resources, may help to support postpartum emotional wellbeing during this, and similar health crises in the future.","Jackson, De Pascalis, Harrold, Fallon, Silverio","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04071-2","20210917","Burnout, psychological; COVID-19; Mental health services; Postnatal care; Psychological distress; Psychosocial support systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18053,""
"""I have the strength to get through this using my past experiences with HIV"": findings from a mixed-method survey of health outcomes, service accessibility, and psychosocial wellbeing among people living with HIV during the Covid-19 pandemic","We examined the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on the wellbeing and access to care among people living with HIV (PLWH) in the UK. A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was circulated to PLWH attending care at three HIV services in Sussex. The questionnaire covered key themes: socio-demographic characteristics; changes in physical and mental health; accessibility of essential health services and information; and socio-economic concerns. Free-text qualitative responses were examined through framework analysis. Quantitative data from 653 respondents were available, with a subset of 385 free-text qualitative responses. In terms of mental health, 501 (77.6%) respondents reported feeling more anxious; 464 (71.8%) reported feeling more depressed than usual; and 128 (19.8%) reported having suicidal thoughts since the start of the pandemic. Respondents worried about running out of HIV medicine (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°264, 40.7%); accessing HIV services (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°246, 38.0%) as well as other health services (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°408, 63.0%). Widespread resilience was also noted: 537 (83.3%) of respondents felt that living with HIV had equipped them with the strength to adapt to the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Depressed mood and frailty among older people in Tokyo during the COVID-19 pandemic","The study aim was to identify depressed mood and frailty and its related factors in older people during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic. Since 2010, we have conducted questionnaire surveys on all older residents, who are not certified in the long-term care insurance, living in one district of Tokyo municipality. These residents are divided into two groups by birth month, that is those born between April and September and those born between October and March, and each group completes the survey every 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (in April and May). Study participants were older residents who were born between April and September and who completed the survey in spring 2018 and in spring 2020, the pandemic period. Depressed mood and frailty were assessed using the Kihon Checklist, which is widely used by local governments in Japan. We had no control group in this study. A total of 1736 residents responded to both surveys. From 2018 to 2020, the depressed mood rate increased from 29% to 38%, and frailty increased from 10% to 16%. The incidence of depressed mood and frailty was 25% and 11%, respectively. Incidence of depressed mood was related to subjective memory impairment and difficulty in device usage, and incidence of frailty was related to being older, subjective memory impairment, lack of emotional social support, poor subjective health, and social participation difficulties. Older people with subjective memory impairment may be a high-risk group during the coronavirus pandemic. Telephone outreach for frail older people could be an effective solution. We recommend extending the scope of the 'reasonable accommodation' concept beyond disability and including older people to build an age-friendly and crisis-resistant community.","Okamura, Sugiyama, Inagaki, Miyamae, Ura, Sakuma, Edahiro, Taga, Tsuda, Awata","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12764","20210916","COVID-19; depressed mood; epidemiology; frailty; memory impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18055,""
"Individual and community social capital, mobility restrictions, and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multilevel analysis of a representative US survey","This paper explores the role of social capital in mitigating the mental health harms of social/mobility restrictions instigated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We test whether: (a) social capital continued to predict lower mental distress during the pandemic; and (b) whether social capital buffered (moderated) the harm of social/mobility restrictions on psychological distress. In addition, we test the level at which social capital mitigation effects operated, i.e., at the individual- and/or contextual-level. To do so, we apply multilevel models to three waves of the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey consisting of probability samples of U.S. adults (with the average interview completion rate of 93%). In a novel approach, we explore two modes of capturing contextual social capital: aggregated individual-level survey responses and independently measured social capital indices (SCIs). Findings show that at the individual level social capital was associated with lower psychological distress. It also buffered the harm of restrictions: increasing restrictions had a weaker effect on distress among individuals interacting with neighbors more frequently. Importantly, mitigating processes of contextual social capital appeared conditional on how it was measured. Using aggregated survey responses, contextual social capital had no direct effect on distress but exerted an additional buffering role: individuals in counties with higher average neighbor-interaction experienced a weaker impact of restrictions. Using the independent SCI measures, we found county social capital reduced distress. However, its negative effect on distress becomes increasingly weaker the more restrictions an individual reported: where individuals reported lower restrictions, higher county SCI reduced distress; however, where individuals reported higher restrictions, higher county SCI had no effect on distress. More restrictive environments thus cut individuals off from the benefits of higher county social capital as measured using the SCI.","Laurence, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114361","20210916","COVID-19; Community social capital; Individual social capital; Mobility restrictions; Psychological-distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18056,""
"Loneliness and mental health in children and adolescents with pre-existing mental health problems: A rapid systematic review","Periods of social isolation are associated with loneliness in children and young people, and loneliness is associated with poor mental and physical health. Children and young people with pre-existing mental health difficulties may be prone to loneliness. Containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation, with unprecedented school closures and restrictions imposed on social interactions. This rapid review aimed to establish what is known about the relationship between loneliness and mental health problems in children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems. We sought to identify all primary research that examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between loneliness/perceived social isolation and mental health in children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems. We also aimed to identify effective interventions that reduce the adverse impact of loneliness. A rapid systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Of 4,531 papers screened, 15 included children and young people with pre-existing mental health conditions. These 15 studies included 1,536 children and young people aged between 6 and 23Ã‚Â years with social phobia, anxiety and/or depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Loneliness was associated with anxiety and depression both cross-sectionally and prospectively in children and young people with mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions. We found preliminary evidence that psychological treatments can help to reduce feelings of loneliness in this population. Loneliness is associated with depression and anxiety in children and young people with pre-existing mental health conditions, and this relationship may be bidirectional. Existing interventions to address loneliness and/or mental health difficulties in other contexts may be applied to this population, although they may need adaptation and testing in younger children and adolescents. Loneliness is common in children and young people, and during periods of enforced social isolation such as during COVID-19, children and young people report high levels of loneliness (or increased rates of loneliness). The review showed that loneliness is associated, both cross-sectionally and prospectively, in children and young people with mental health problems and also in children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder. Thus, loneliness is a possible risk factor of which mental health providers should be aware. Maintaining social contact both by direct and by indirect means, especially through the Internet, could be important in mitigating loneliness. Interventions to address loneliness should be further developed and tested to help children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems who are lonely by preventing exacerbation of their mental health difficulties, in particular anxiety and depression.","Hards, Loades, Higson-Sweeney, Shafran, Serafimova, Brigden, Reynolds, Crawley, Chatburn, Linney, McManus, Borwick","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12331","20210916","adolescents; anxiety; children; depression; loneliness; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18057,""
"Lessons Learned about the Need for Early Screening for Depression during the First Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","A nationwide survey assessed the prevalence and pandemic-related risk factors of major depressive disorder (MDD) at the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings showed a significant increase in the prevalence of MDD (22.7%) compared to the pre-pandemic 12-month estimate (10.4%). Specific pandemic-related concerns, along with significant increases in stress, loneliness, fatigue, and substance use behaviors are noted for those with the provisional diagnosis of MDD. Early screening and detection for potential MDD cases can reduce the severity and duration of maladaptive symptoms, decreasing the risk for future depression episodes and the potential loss of quality of life and productivity.","Uwadiale, Cordaro, Brunett, Stern, Howard","https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2021.1975333","20210916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18058,""

"Mental Health Screening in General Practices as a Means for Enhancing Uptake of Digital Mental Health Interventions: Observational Cohort Study","Digital mental health interventions stand to play a critical role in managing the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, enhancing their uptake is a key priority. General practitioners (GPs) are well positioned to facilitate access to digital interventions, but tools that assist GPs in identifying suitable patients are lacking. This study aims to evaluate the suitability of a web-based mental health screening and treatment recommendation tool (StepCare) for improving the identification of anxiety and depression in general practice and, subsequently, uptake of digital mental health interventions. StepCare screens patients for symptoms of depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale) in the GP waiting room. It provides GPs with stepped treatment recommendations that include digital mental health interventions for patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Patients (N=5138) from 85 general practices across Australia were invited to participate in screening. Screening identified depressive or anxious symptoms in 43.09% (1428/3314) of patients (one-quarter were previously unidentified or untreated). The majority (300/335, 89.6%) of previously unidentified or untreated patients had mild to moderate symptoms and were candidates for digital mental health interventions. Although less than half were prescribed a digital intervention by their GP, when a digital intervention was prescribed, more than two-thirds of patients reported using it. Implementing web-based mental health screening in general practices can provide important opportunities for GPs to improve the identification of symptoms of mental illness and increase patient access to digital mental health interventions. Although GPs prescribed digital interventions less frequently than in-person psychotherapy or medication, the promising rates of uptake by GP-referred patients suggest that GPs can play a critical role in championing digital interventions and maximizing the associated benefits.","Whitton, Hardy, Cope, Gieng, Gow, MacKinnon, Gale, O'Moore, Anderson, Proudfoot, Cockayne, O'Dea, Christensen, Newby","https://doi.org/10.2196/28369","20210917","anxiety; depression; digital mental health; general practice; screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18061,""
"Anxiety, Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Outbreak and Associated Factors","Outbreaks of infectious diseases have negative effects on mental health. Currently, there is very little information about the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents and associated factors affecting their mental health. The aim of the present study is to determine the severity of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to investigate the associated factors with these symptoms. The present study was conducted with a total of 447 adolescents. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated by the use of DSM-5 Level 2 Anxiety Scale, DSM-5 Level 2 Depression Scale and National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale. The association between age, gender, residential area, presence of COVID-19 in the participant, presence of COVID-19 in the family or environment and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with linear regression analysis. The mean age of participants was 15.06, and 38.3% of the participants were male and 61.7% were female. The rate of participants with moderate or high levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms was 28%, 37.6% and 28.5%, respectively. High age and living in an urban area were associated with increased anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms. In addition, female gender was associated with increased depression symptoms, and the presence of COVID-19 in the family or environment was associated with increased anxiety symptoms. The present study shows that adolescents have serious levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results emphasize the need for mental health interventions that are appropriate for the characteristics of this age group.","SelÃƒÂ§uk, Demir, Erbay, Ãƒâ€“zcan, GÃƒÂ¼rer, DÃƒÂ¶nmez","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14880","20210916","COVID-19; PTSD; adolescents; anxiety; depression; psychiatric symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18062,""
"Dietary Habits and Lifestyle During Coronavirus Pandemic Lockdown: Experience From Lebanon","This study aimed to examine the impact of quarantine on eating habits and lifestyle behaviors among the Lebanese adult population. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire designed on Google Forms between 3 June and 28 June 2020. The survey questions were adapted from the Short Food Frequency Questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, and the second version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire. A total of 2,507 adults completed the questionnaire. During the lockdown, 32.8% claimed weight gain, 44.7% did not eat fruits daily, 35.3% did not eat vegetables on daily basis, and 72.9% reported drinking less than eight cups of water per day. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the number of meals consumed per day, consumption of homemade meals, sedentary time, stress, and sleeping disturbances during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). However, there was a significant decrease in physical activity engagement, sleep quality, and energy level during the lockdown compared to before the pandemic (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Social touch deprivation during COVID-19: effects on psychological wellbeing and craving interpersonal touch","Social touch has positive effects on social affiliation and stress alleviation. However, its ubiquitous presence in human life does not allow the study of social touch deprivation 'in the wild'. Nevertheless, COVID-19-related restrictions such as social distancing allowed the systematic study of the degree to which social distancing affects tactile experiences and mental health. In this study, 1746 participants completed an online survey to examine intimate, friendly and professional touch experiences during COVID-19-related restrictions, their impact on mental health and the extent to which touch deprivation results in craving touch. We found that intimate touch deprivation during COVID-19-related restrictions is associated with higher anxiety and greater loneliness even though this type of touch is still the most experienced during the pandemic. Moreover, intimate touch is reported as the type of touch most craved during this period, thus being more prominent as the days practising social distancing increase. However, our results also show that the degree to which individuals crave touch during this period depends on individual differences in attachment style: the more anxiously attached, the more touch is craved; with the reverse pattern for avoidantly attached. These findings point to the important role of interpersonal and particularly intimate touch in times of distress and uncertainty.","von Mohr, Kirsch, Fotopoulou","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210287","20210917","COVID-19; anxiety; attachment; social touch; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18064,""

"Attitudes, stressors and work outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic among dental assistants in Germany: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed great challenges to medical professionals worldwide. Dental assistants (DAs) are at exceptionally high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to frequent and close patient contact and involvement in various high-risk dental procedures. This study aimed to investigate attitudes, stressors and work outcomes among DAs from all over Germany at the peak of cases in spring 2020. Cross-sectional study. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression. Dental, maxillofacial surgery and orthodontic practices across Germany, April 2020. Participants aged 18 years and above and currently working as DAs in Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was employed comprising questions on SARS-CoV-2-related attitudes, stressors and work outcomes. Validated scales assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety. Among 1481 participating DAs (median age 35 years, 98.4% female, 91.8% working in dental practices), major stressors were uncertainty about the pandemic's temporal scope (97.9% agreement, n=1450), uncertainty about one's financial situation (87.8%, n=1301), uncertainty about how to act correctly (87.6%, n=1298) and thoughts about a possible infection during work (83.8%, n=1241). Forty-two per cent of DAs (n=622) felt sufficiently prepared for dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2. Only 17.5% (n=259) agreed that material for personal protection was sufficiently available. Multivariable logistic regression analyses suggested that working in a dental practice, compared with orthodontic and maxillofacial surgery practices, was significantly associated with uncertainty about one's financial situation (OR 2.13 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.44)) and with the reported availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) (0.55 (0.36 to 0.84)). Training about correct behaviour of DAs during future infectious disease outbreaks is needed, especially for DAs working in dental practices. In the future, it will also be necessary to strengthen supply chains to ensure that PPE is sufficiently available in a timely manner.","Dreher, Pietrowsky, Loerbroks","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045881","20210916","COVID-19; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18066,""

"Predictors of academic performance during the covid-19 outbreak: impact of distance education on mental health, social cognition and memory abilities in an Italian university student sample","This study aimed to investigate the impact of distance education (DE) on mental health, social cognition, and memory abilities in a sample of university students during the national COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and to identify the predictors of academic performance. Two hundred and three students (76.4% women, mean age 24.3, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.9) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 and September 30, 2020, on DE experience and cognitive and social-cognitive variables. A short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, ten images from the Eyes Task, and five memory vignette stimuli were included in the survey. Descriptive, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Half of the student sample reported significant impairment in concentration and learning abilities during DE. Regarding psychological health, 19.7%, 27.1%, and 23.6% of the sample reported mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Correlation analyses showed a statistically significant negative association between depression and the overall subjective evaluation of DE (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.359; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000). Changes in one's study context and habits, i.e., studying alone at one's parents' home instead of studying with colleagues or alone in a university ""social place"" (e.g., the university library), seemed to increase the likelihood of poor academic performance by almost 3 times (O.R. 3.918; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.032). This predictor was no longer statistically significant in the subsequent step when the individual impairment predictors were entered. Learning concentration impairment during DE (O.R. 8.350; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014), anxiety about COVID-19 contagion for oneself or others (O.R. 3.363; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022), female gender (O.R. 3.141; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.045), and depressive symptomatology (O.R. 1.093; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.047) were ultimately determined to be the strongest predictors of poor academic performance, whereas the appreciation of DE represented a protective variable (O.R. 0.610; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000). The study showed a negative impact of DE on the mental health of students presenting depressive symptoms and impairment in concentration and learning, the latter identified as the strongest predictors of poor academic performances. The study confirms the emerging need to monitor the impact of DE, which occurred during the 2019/2020 academic year and will continue in the coming months, to refine educational offerings and meet students' psychological needs by implementing psychological interventions based on the modifiable variables that seem to compromise students' psychological well-being and academic outcomes.","Giusti, Mammarella, Salza, Del Vecchio, Ussorio, Casacchia, Roncone","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00649-9","20210917","COVID-19 outbreak; Cognitive difficulties; Depression; Distance education; Mental health; Academic Performance; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Education, Distance; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Social Cognition; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18068,""
"Identifying and understanding the contextual factors that shaped mid-implementation outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in organizations implementing mental health recovery innovations into services","Seven housing and health services organizations were guided through a process of translating Chapter Six of the Canadian Guidelines for Recovery-Oriented Practice into a recovery-oriented innovation and plan for its implementation. At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown measures, six of the seven organizations had begun implementing their chosen innovation (peer workers, wellness recovery action planning facilitator training, staff training and a family support group). This mid-implementation study used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify contextual factors that influenced organizations to continue or postpone implementation of recovery-oriented innovations in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-seven semi-structured 45-min interviews were conducted between May and June 2020 (21 implementation team members and six providers of the innovationÃ‚Â (trainers, facilitators, peer workers). Interview guides and analysis were based on the CFIR. Content analysis combined deductive and inductive approaches. Summaries of coded data were given ratings based on strength and valence of the construct's impact on implementation. Ratings were visualized by mid-implementation outcome and recovery innovation to identify constructs which appear to distinguish between sites with a more or less favorable mid-implementation outcomes. Four mid-implementation outcomes were observed at this snapshot in time (from most to least positive): continued implementation with adaptation (one site), postponement with adaptation and estimated relaunch date (four sites), indefinite postponement with no decision on relaunch date (one site), and no implementation of innovation yet (one site). Two constructs had either a negative influence (external policies and incentives-renamed COVID-19-related external policy for this study) or a positive influence (leadership engagement), regardless of implementation outcome. Four factors appeared to distinguish between more or less positive mid-implementation outcome: adaptability, implementation climate and relative priority, available resources, and formally appointed internal implementation leaders (renamed ""engaging implementation teams during the COVID-19 pandemic"" for this study). The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented outer setting factor. Studies that use the CFIR at the mid-implementation stage are rare, as are studies focusing on the outer setting.

"Ontario adults' health behaviors, mental health, and overall well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","Public health measures such as physical distancing and work-from-home initiatives have been implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. These measures may also be associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, which could be particularly problematic for those already at highest risk for losing years of healthy life due to chronic disease (i.e., 30-59-year-olds). The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to provide an overview of Ontario adults' health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and dietary intake), mental health, and well-being during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-July 2020); and (2) to explore the difference between physical activity and various health behaviors (i.e., well-being, mental health, and dietary intake). As a part of a larger, longitudinal study, participants completed an online survey that included demographic information, the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, Starting the Conversation, the Mental Health Inventory, and the Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult. Data analyses involved computing measures of central tendency and dispersion for demographic characteristics and tools followed by descriptive statistics. Separate independent t-tests were conducted to investigate the difference between physical activity status and well-being, mental health, and dietary intake. A total of 2157 Ontarians completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics indicated that respondents met physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines, reported double the amount of recommended recreational screen time, practiced moderately healthy dietary behaviors, experienced mental health problems, and scored below ""normal"" in some well-being domains. As the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown, its associated restrictions and society changes may influence adults' behaviors in both the short- and longer-term. As such, our findings might provide immediate insight into the development of timely and evidence-informed health promotion and disease prevention strategies for Canadians, which could support adults' health behaviors, mental health, and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and other, future pandemics.","Shillington, Vanderloo, Burke, Ng, Tucker, Irwin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11732-6","20210916","COVID-19; Diet; Mental health; Physical activity; Sedentary behavior; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18071,""
"Developing trauma resilient communities through community capacity-building","Trauma is a significant public health issue, negatively impacting a range of health outcomes. Providers and administrators in public mental health systems recognize the widespread experience of trauma, as well as their limited ability to address trauma within their communities. In response, the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health funded nine regionally based community partnerships to build capacity to address trauma. We describe partnership and community capacity-building efforts and examine community impact, defined as successful linkages to resources and changes in stress tolerance capacities among community members. We conceptualized community capacity-building as dissemination of trauma-informed education and training, community outreach and engagement, and linkage of community members to resources. We measured trauma-informed trainings among partnership members (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°332) using the Trauma-Informed Organizational Toolkit. Outreach, engagement and linkages were documented using Event and Linkage Trackers. We examined changes in the type of successful linkage after the issuance of statewide mandatory restrictions in response to COVID-19. We examined changes in stress tolerance capacities among community members (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°699) who were engaged in ongoing partnership activities using the 10-item Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale; the 28-item Coping Orientation to Problems; and the pictorial Inclusion of Community in Self Scale. Training and education opportunities were widespread: 66% of members reported opportunities for training in 13 or more trauma-informed practices. Partnerships conducted over 7800 community capacity-building events with over 250,000 attendees. Nearly 14,000 successful linkages were made for a wide range of resources, with consistent linkage success prior to (85%) and during (87%) the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, linkage type significantly shifted from basic services and health care to food distribution (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Small but significant improvements occurred in coping through emotional and instrumental support; and sense of community connectedness (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05 each). Community-based partnerships demonstrated effective capacity-building strategies. Despite the pandemic, community members did not report reduced stress tolerance, instead demonstrating gains in external help-seeking (use of emotional and instrumental supports) and perception of community connectedness. Future work will use qualitative methods to examine the impact of community capacity-building and the sustainability of this approach for addressing the impact of trauma within communities.","Gilmer, Center, Casteel, Choi, Innes-Gomberg, Lansing","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11723-7","20210916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18072,""
"Connection During COVID-19: Pilot Study of a Telehealth Group Parenting Intervention","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable stress for families, placing parents at risk for heightened psychological distress, while prompting widespread changes in mental health service delivery. This study evaluated treatment engagement, acceptability, and psychiatric distress among participants in the telehealth adaptation of the Connecting and Reflecting Experience (CARE) program after the onset of COVID-19. CARE is a transdiagnostic, bigenerational, mentalizing-focused group parenting intervention based out of an outpatient child mental health clinic in an underserved urban community. Individuals participating in CARE during the clinic's transition to telehealth services were recruited for participation in this pre-post design pilot study. Participants (N=12) completed self-report surveys before and after their first telehealth group session and at their 20-week follow-up. Quantitative and qualitative measures were used to evaluate psychiatric symptoms, treatment engagement, and preliminary acceptability of the adaptation. Self-reported mood and anxiety symptoms decreased significantly after 20 weeks of telehealth therapy. Participants reported high levels of therapeutic alliance and group cohesion in the telehealth format. Results also showed minimal participant-reported privacy concerns and a trend toward increased treatment engagement. These findings have implications regarding the acceptability of teletherapy interventions for caregivers of children during this period of heightened vulnerability and limited access to social support and health services. They also are relevant to establishing the preliminary acceptability of mentalizing-focused parenting inventions delivered via telehealth.","Zayde, Kilbride, Kucer, Willis, Nikitiades, Alpert, Gabbay","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.20210005","20210916","COVID-19; Group; Mentalization; Parenting; Psychotherapy; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18073,""

"Implementing and Adapting the SAFETY Treatment for Suicidal Youth: The Incubator Model, Telehealth, and the Covid-19 Pandemic","The Safe Alternatives for Teens and Youth (SAFETY) treatment was developed to decrease the risk of repeat suicidal and self-harm behavior in youth presenting with elevated suicide risk. This paper uses case illustrations to demonstrate the SAFETY treatment, building upon the companion paper describing our â€œincubatorâ€ treatment development model and process (Asarnow et al., 2021). As illustrated in the second case illustration, the incubator model approach was particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic switch to telehealth. SAFETY specifically targets suicide and self-harm risk reduction using an individually tailored principle-guided approach, grounded in a case conceptualization that identifies cognitive-behavioral processes and reactions that contribute to increased suicide attempt risk and explains the youthâ€™s suicidal/self-harm behavior within the context of his or her broader social systems. The SAFETY treatment has been tested in two treatment development trials, and results support the efficacy of SAFETY for preventing suicide attempts in adolescents presenting with recent self-harm.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.06.009","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","",18076,""
