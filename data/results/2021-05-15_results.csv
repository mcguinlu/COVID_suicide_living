"Family responsibilities and mental health of kindergarten educators during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Ontario, Canada","The present cross-sectional study, conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada, addressed the association between family responsibilities and mental health (depression and anxiety) among kindergarten educators. Participants comprised 1,790 (97.9% female) kindergarten educators (73.6% kindergarten teachers; 26.4% early childhood educators) across Ontario. Results revealed that educators were more likely to report moderate levels of depressive symptoms if they had the responsibility of caring for their own children, and more likely to report moderate levels of depressive and anxious symptoms if they had the responsibility of caring for an older adult. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Natalie Spadafora; Caroline Reid-Westoby; Molly Pottruff; Magdalena Janus","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.11.21257057","20210514","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13712,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of parents with young children: a qualitative interview study","Background Parents have faced unique challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including mobility constraints, isolation measures, working from home, and the closure of schools and childcare facilities. There is presently a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring how these changes have affected parents mental health and wellbeing. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 29 parents of young children. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results We identified five superordinate themes affecting participant mental health and wellbeing: 1) navigation of multiple responsibilities and change inside the home; 2) disruption to home life; 3) changes to usual support networks; 4) changes in personal relationships; and 5) use of coping strategies. Participants described stress and exhaustion from navigating multiple pressures and conflicting responsibilities with home, schooling, and work, without their usual support networks and in the context of disrupted routines. Family roles and relationships were sometimes tested, however, many parents identified coping strategies that protected their wellbeing including access to outdoor space, spending time away from family, and avoiding conflict and pandemic-related media coverage. Conclusions Employers must be cognisant of the challenges that the pandemic has placed on parents, particularly women and lone parents. Flexible working arrangements and support might therefore relieve stress and increase productivity. Coping strategies identified by parents in this study could be harnessed and encouraged by employers and policymakers to promote positive wellbeing during times of stress throughout the pandemic and beyond.","Jo Dawes; Tom May; Alison Ruth McKinlay; Daisy Fancourt; Alexandra Burton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.13.21256805","20210514","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13713,""
"The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the lived experience of people living in Thailand, Malaysia, Italy and the United Kingdom: a cross-country qualitative study","This qualitative study explores the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on lived experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's lives in Thailand, Malaysia, Italy and the United Kingdom. A total of 86 interviews were conducted with members of the public, including healthcare workers. Participants across countries held strong views on NPIs, with many feeling measures lacked clarity. Most participants reported primarily negative impacts of NPIs on their lives, including through separation, isolation and grief over missed milestones; work-related challenges and income loss; and poor mental health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, many also experienced inadvertent positive consequences, including more time at home to focus on what they most valued in life; a greater sense of connectedness; and benefits to working life. Commonly employed coping strategies focused on financial coping; psycho-emotional coping; social coping and connectedness; reducing and mitigating risks; and limiting exposure to the news. Importantly, the extent to which participants' lived experiences were positive or negative, and their ability to cope was underpinned by individual, social and economic factors. In order to mitigate negative and unequal impacts of NPIs, COVID-19 policies will benefit from paying closer attention to the social, cultural and psychological, not just biological vulnerabilities to, and consequences of public health measures.","Mira Leonie Schneiders; Bhensri Naemiratch; Phaik Kin Cheah; Giulia Cuman; Tassawan Poomchaichote; Supanat Ruangkajorn; Silvia Stoppa; Anne Osterrieder; Phee-Kheng Cheah; Darlene Ongkili; Wirichada Pan-ngum; Constance Mackworth-Young; Phaik Yeong Cheah","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.13.21257162","20210514","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13714,""

"COVID-19 and the Blitz compared: mental health outcomes in the UK","The Blitz narrative of resilience stands in contrast to the mental health risks identified as consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although evidence from then-classified studies of World War 2 showed that most people managed the stress of bombing, those vulnerable and exposed to substantial trauma had lasting or severe mental illness. Studies of different towns and occupational groups identified the proportion of people killed and wounded, the percentage of housing destroyed, and the loss of paid employment as risk factors for psychological breakdown. Mothers and children suffered not only with evacuation, but also from the trauma of bombing and damage to schools. A general association between civilian physical and psychological casualties suggests that population groups with high rates of infection and mortality might be susceptible to mental illness as a result of the pandemic. Lockdown and distancing measures contrast with the wartime sense of belonging and shared identity, reinforced by community networks and social activities.","Jones","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00118-8","20210514","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13716,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Emergencies","By forcing closure of schools, curtailing outpatient services, and imposing strict social distancing, the COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly affected the daily life of millions worldwide, with still unclear consequences for mental health. This study aimed to evaluate if and how child and adolescent psychiatric visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) changed during the pandemic lockdown, which started in Italy on February 24, 2020. We examined all ED visits by patients under 18 years of age in the 7 weeks prior to February 24, 2020, and in the subsequent 8 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown at two urban university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy. ED visits during the corresponding periods of 2019 served as a comparison using Poisson regression modeling. The clinician's decision to hospitalize or discharge home the patient after the ED visit was examined as an index of clinical severity. During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 72.0% decrease in the number of all pediatric ED visits (3,395) compared with the corresponding period in 2019 (12,128), with a 46.2% decrease in psychiatric visits (50 vs 93). The mean age of psychiatric patients was higher in the COVID-19 period (15.7 vs 14.1 years). No significant changes were found in hospitalization rate or in the prevalence distribution of the primary reason for the psychiatric ED visit (suicidality, anxiety/mood disorders, agitation). In the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19-induced social lockdown, the number of child and adolescent psychiatric ED visits significantly decreased, with an increase in patient age. This decrease does not appear to be explained by severity-driven self-selection and might be due to a reduction in psychiatric emergencies or to the implementation of alternative ways of managing acute psychopathology.","Davico, Marcotulli, Lux, Calderoni, Cammisa, Bondone, Rosa-Brusin, Secci, Porro, Campanile","https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.20m13467","20210514","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13717,""
"Telehealth Treatment of Patients in an Intensive Acute Care Psychiatric Setting During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparative Safety and Effectiveness to In-Person Treatment","Most research evaluating telehealth psychiatric treatment has been conducted in outpatient settings. There is a great lack of research assessing the efficacy of telehealth treatment in more acute, intensive treatment settings such as a partial hospital. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of behavioral health treatment has transitioned to a virtual format. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the effectiveness of our partial hospital program (PHP). The sample included 207 patients who were treated virtually from May 2020 to September 2020 and a comparison group of 207 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program a year earlier. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction, symptoms, coping ability, functioning, and general well-being. For both the in-person and telehealth methods of delivering partial hospital level of care, patients were highly satisfied with treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms and suicidality from admission to discharge. On the modified Remission from Depression Questionnaire, the primary outcome measure, both groups reported a significant (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) improvement in functioning, coping ability, positive mental health, and general well-being. A large effect size of treatment (Cohen dÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8) was found in both treatment groups. The only significant difference in outcome between the patients treated in the different formats was a greater length of stay (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD of 13.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.1 vs 8.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.0 days, tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.61, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and greater likelihood of staying in treatment until completion (72.9% vs 62.3%, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.34, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) in the virtually treated patients. Telehealth partial hospital treatment was as effective as in-person treatment in terms of patient satisfaction, symptom reduction, suicidal ideation reduction, and improved functioning and well-being. The treatment completion rate was higher in the telehealth cohort, and several patients who were treated virtually commented that they never would have presented for in-person treatment even if there was no pandemic. Telehealth PHPs should be considered a viable treatment option even after the pandemic has resolved.","Zimmerman, Terrill, D'Avanzato, Tirpak","https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.20m13815","20210514","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13718,""
"Is There an App for That?: Ethical Issues in the Digital Mental Health Response to COVID-19","Well before COVID-19, there was growing excitement about the potential of various digital technologies such as tele-health, smartphone apps, or AI chatbots to revolutionize mental healthcare. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread across the globe, clinicians warned of the mental illness epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Now, funding for digital mental health technologies is surging and many researchers are calling for widespread adoption to address the mental health sequelae of COVID-19. Reckoning with the ethical implications of these technologies is urgent because decisions made today will shape the future of mental health research and care for the foreseeable future. We contend that the most pressing ethical issues concern (1) the extent to which these technologies demonstrably improve mental health outcomes and (2) the likelihood that wide-scale adoption will exacerbate the existing health inequalities laid bare by the pandemic. We argue that the evidence for efficacy is weak and that the likelihood of increasing inequalities is high. First, we review recent trends in digital mental health. Next, we turn to the clinical literature to show that many technologies proposed as a response to COVID-19 are unlikely to improve outcomes. Then, we argue that even evidence-based technologies run the risk of increasing health disparities. We conclude by suggesting that policymakers should not allocate limited resources to the development of many digital mental health tools and should focus instead on evidence-based solutions to address mental health inequalities.","Skorburg, Yam","https://doi.org/10.1080/21507740.2021.1918284","20210514","Bioethics; artificial intelligence; mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13719,""
"Characterization of performance and disinfection resilience of nonwoven filter materials for use in 3D-printed N95 respirators","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a high demand for respiratory protection among health care workers in hospitals, especially surgical N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). To aid in alleviating that demand, a survey of commercially available filter media was conducted to determine whether any could serve as a substitute for an N95 FFR while held in a 3D-printed mask (Stopgap Surgical Face Mask from the NIH 3D Print Exchange). Fourteen filter media types and eight combinations were evaluated for filtration efficiency, breathing resistance (pressure drop), and liquid penetration. Additional testing was conducted to evaluate two filter media disinfection methods in the event that the filters were reused in a hospital setting. Efficiency testing was conducted in accordance with the procedures established for approving an N95 FFR. One apparatus used a filter-holding device and another apparatus employed a manikin head to which the 3D-printed mask could be sealed. The filter media and combinations exhibited collection efficiencies varied between 3.9% and 98.8% when tested with a face velocity comparable to that of a standard N95 FFR at the 85Ã¢â‚¬â€°L min<sup>-1</sup> used in the approval procedure. Breathing resistance varied between 10.8 to &gt;637Ã¢â‚¬â€°Pa (1.1 to &gt; 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°mm H<sub>2</sub>O). When applied to the 3D-printed mask efficiency decreased by an average of 13% and breathing resistance increased 4-fold as a result of the smaller surface area of the filter media when held in that mask compared to that of an N95 FFR. Disinfection by dry heat, even after 25 cycles, did not significantly affect filter efficiency and reduced viral infectivity by &gt; 99.9%. However, 10 cycles of 59% vaporized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> significantly (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) reduced filter efficiency of the media tested. Several commercially available filter media were found to be potential replacements for the media used to construct the typical cup-like N95 FFR. However, their use in the 3D-printed mask demonstrated reduced efficiency and increased breathing resistance at 85Ã¢â‚¬â€°L min<sup>-1</sup>.","O'Shaughnessy, Strzelecki, Ortiz-Hernandez, Aubin, Jing, Chang, Xiang, Thorne, Stapleton","https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1913283","20210514","COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; filter efficiency; pressure drop; respirator","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13720,""

"Assessment of a Crowdsourcing Open Call for Approaches to University Community Engagement and Strategic Planning During COVID-19","Reimagining university life during COVID-19 requires substantial innovation and meaningful community input. One method for obtaining community input is crowdsourcing, which involves having a group of individuals work to solve a problem and then publicly share solutions. To evaluate a crowdsourcing open call as an approach to COVID-19 university community engagement and strategic planning. This qualitative study assessed a crowdsourcing open call offered from June 16 to July 16, 2020, that sought ideas to inform safety in the fall 2020 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Digital methods (email and social media) were used for promotion, and submissions were collected online for 4 weeks. Participation was open to UNC students, staff, faculty, and others. Submissions were evaluated for innovation, feasibility, inclusivity, and potential to improve safety and well-being. Demographic data were collected from submitting individuals, and submissions were qualitatively analyzed for emergent themes on challenges with and solutions for addressing safety and well-being in the fall semester. Data were shared with UNC leadership to inform decision-making. The open call received 82 submissions from 110 participants, including current UNC students (56 submissions [68%]), people younger than 30 years (67 [82%]), women (55 [67%]), and individuals identifying as a racial/ethnic minority or as multiracial/ethnic (49 [60%]). Seven submissions were identified as finalists and received cash prizes with the encouragement to use these funds toward idea development and implementation. Seventeen runner-up teams were linked to university resources for further development. Thematic analysis of submissions regarding challenges with the fall semester revealed not only physical health concerns and the limitations of remote learning but also challenges that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, such as a lack of mental health support, structural racism and inequality, and insufficient public transportation. Solutions included novel ideas to support mental health among specific populations (eg, graduate students and racial/ethnic minorities), improve health equity, and increase transit access. All 24 finalists and runners-up indicated interest in implementation after being notified of the open call results. This study suggests that open calls are a feasible strategy for university community engagement on COVID-19, providing a stakeholder-driven approach to identifying promising ideas for enhancing safety and well-being. Open calls could be formally incorporated into university planning processes to develop COVID-19 safety strategies that are responsive to diverse community members' concerns.","Day, Li, Hlatshwako, Abu-Hijleh, Han, Deitelzweig, Bayus, Ramaswamy, Tang, Tucker","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10090","20210514","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13723,""

"Factors associated with mental health and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","Although mental distress and quality of life (QoL) impairments because of the pandemic have increased worldwide, the way that each community has been affected has varied. This study evaluated the impact of social distancing imposed by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on Brazilians' mental health and QoL. In this cross-sectional community-based online survey, data from 1156 community-dwelling adults were gathered between 11 May and 3 June 2020. We examined independent correlates of depression, anxiety and QoL, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, optimism/pessimism and spiritual/religious coping. Dependent variables were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety symptoms, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF for QoL. Correlates of depressive and anxiety disorder were estimated using logistic regression. There were high levels of depressive symptoms (41.9%) and anxiety symptoms (29.0%) in participants. Negative spiritual/religious coping was positively correlated with depressive disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14 95% CI 1.63-2.80; P &lt; 0.001) and with anxiety disorder (OR = 2.46 95% CI 1.90-3.18; P &lt; 0.001), and associated with worse social and environmental QoL (P &lt; 0.001). Healthcare professionals were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.93; P &lt; 0.001).

"Development, implementation, and evaluation of a clinical decision support tool to improve naloxone coprescription within military health system pharmacies","In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pharmacy clinical decision support tool designed to increase naloxone coprescription among people at risk for opioid overdose in a large healthcare system. The Military Health System Opioid Registry and underlying presentation layer were used to develop a clinical decision support capability to improve naloxone coprescription at the pharmacy point of care. Pharmacy personnel use a patient identification card barcode scanner or manually enter a patient's identification number to quickly visualize information on a patient's risk for opioid overdose and medical history related to pain and, when appropriate, receive a recommendation to coprescribe naloxone. The tool was made available to military treatment facility pharmacy locations. An interactive dashboard was developed to support monitoring, utilization, and impact on naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose. Initial implementation of the naloxone tool was slow from a lack of end-user awareness. Efforts to increase utilization were, in part, successful owing to a number of enterprise-wide educational initiatives. In early 2020, the naloxone tool was used in 15% of all opioid prescriptions dispensed at a military pharmacy. Data indicate that the frequency of naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose was significantly higher when the naloxone tool was used than when the tool was not used.","Rittel, Highland, Maneval, Bockhorst, Moreno, Sim, Easter, Nichols, Costantino","https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab206","20210514","clinical decision support; military; naloxone; opioids; overdose; pharmacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13728,""

"Alteration of the gut microbiota in post-weaned calves following recovery from bovine coronavirus-mediated diarrhea","Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is associated with severe diarrhea, dehydration, and depression, which result in significant economic damages in the dairy and beef cattle industries worldwide. However, differences in the gut microbiota structure and their correlations with differing physiological parameters between BCoV-infected calves with diarrhea and recovered calves are not well understood. In this study, fecal specimens were collected from 10 post-weaned calves, before and after 2 months of fluid therapy, and the samples were used for microbiota analysis. Following recovery, the alpha-diversity profiles (observed operational taxonomic units [OTUs], and Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) changed significantly when compared with those of calves with diarrhea. Beta-diversity analysis exhibited significant differences in gut microbiota compositions between calves with diarrhea and those in the recovered state. The abundances of eight phyla and thirteen genera in feces changed markedly after restoration of BCoV diarrhea. In addition, our correlation study clearly revealed that increased abundances of the genera <i>Caproiciproducens, Pseudoflavonifractor</i>, and <i>Oscillibacter</i> negatively correlated with serum glucose, and phosphorus levels, but positively correlated with serum chloride in calves with diarrhea, whereas increased abundances of the genera <i>Peptostreptococcaceae;Clostridium</i> (<i>Clostridium</i> cluster XI), <i>Intestinibacter, Cellulosilyticum, Ruminococcus, Romboutsia, Paeniclostridium, Clostridiaceae;Clostridium</i> and <i>Turicibacter</i> in recovered calves showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that structural changes of the gut microbiota after recovery from BCoV infection correlate with changes in physiological parameters. In conclusion, our data provide evidence of gut microbiota-composition changes and their correlations with the physical profiles of post-weaned calves, before and after fluid therapy for BCoV-related diarrhea.","Kwon, Jo, Lee, Choi, Yu, Oh, Park, Choi","https://doi.org/10.5187/jast.2021.e20","20210514","Bovine coronavirus; Gut microbiota; Physiological parameters; Post-weaned calf","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13730,""
"Remote buprenorphine-naloxone initiation as an essential service for people with chronic pain and opioid dependence during the COVID-19 pandemic: Case reports, clinical pathways, and implications for the future","Many health care professions have reacted swiftly to the COVID-19 pandemic. In-person care has been ramped down and telemedicine/telehealth has been thrust to the forefront of clinical care. For people living with chronic pain and often concomitantly dealing with opioid-related issues, this is a time of great stress. With population-wide movements to shelter in place, people living with pain are more isolated, more stressed, and more vulnerable to mental health concerns like depression and anxiety that can increase pain-related suffering. This article presents two case reports of patients struggling with chronic pain and opioid dependence in which a telemedicine-based buprenorphine-naloxone conversion was chosen as a treatment option by two Canadian programs: The Transitional Pain Service at the Toronto General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, and The Opioid Deprescribing Program in Calgary, Alberta. Both cases presented highlight the use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest that there will be substantial need for these services well beyond the apex of the crisis. A buprenorphine-naloxone home induction protocol is presented and we provide insight into important lessons learned regarding the appropriate selection of patients with chronic pain struggling with opioid use disorder for buprenorphine-naloxone conversion. The provision of health care during the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly forced practitioners to evolve novel health care practices, and these changes will have long-term implications.

"Feelings Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Patients Treated in the Oncology Clinics (Poland)","<b>Background:</b> The number of cancer patients is constantly growing. Both WHO and IARC report that this number may reach up to 24 million new diagnosed cases in the next two decades. The proposed treatment and especially the diagnosis can have a significant impact on an individual's approach to the disease, as well as on the patient's quality of life. <b>Objectives:</b> The study aimed to assess the quality of life, feelings, and fear of cancer-treating oncological patients, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Material and Methods:</b> The study used the standardized WHOQOL quality of life questionnaire in a shortened version, the COVID-19 fear scale (FCV-19S), and the AIS disease acceptance scale (in terms of cancer-related sensations). The questionnaire survey was conducted among patients of cancer clinics (Poland). The study was conducted in two stages-before the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). Data from 450 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed statistically. The obtained data were statistically processed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test (<i>p</i> = 0.05). <b>Results:</b> Among the surveyed patients of the cancer clinic, the quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased by 2%, compared to the period before the pandemic. The frequency of negative feelings associated with cancer increased during the COVID-19 pandemic-by 11% more men, and 4.4% of women determined the frequency of negative feelings to be 2-3 times a week. The level of fear associated with COVID-19 was moderate (57.1%), with women having a higher level of fear (12.5% higher than men). <b>Conclusion:</b> The development of the epidemic is very important in terms of public health. COVID-19 should be considered as one of the factors that bring about sudden changes in the mental health of the population, which may result from the dynamic development of this disease, dramatic media coverage, and own experiences. It has been shown that the sudden appearance of such a large stressor causes a decrease in patients' quality of life and an increase in negative feelings associated with chronic disease.","Grajek, DziaÃ…â€šach, Buczkowska, GÃƒÂ³rski, Nowara","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647196","20210514","COVID-19; cancer; fear; oncology; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13732,""
"What's Happened to Italian Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Preliminary Study on Symptoms, Problematic Social Media Usage, and Attachment: Relationships and Differences With Pre-pandemic Peers","Italian adolescents were confined at home for 3 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed them to feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loneliness that may have increased their vulnerability to emotional-behavioral symptoms (e.g., anxiety) and binge-eating attitudes. Potential risk factors for these psychopathological symptoms are problematic social media usage and attachment insecurity. Therefore, this study aimed: (1) to assess emotional-behavioral symptoms, binge eating, problematic social media usage, and attachment representations of adolescents during the pandemic, comparing them with prepandemic similar samples; (2) to investigate relationships among variables, exploring the role of problematic social media usage and insecure attachment as risk factors for more psychopathological symptoms. <i>Participants</i> were 62 community adolescents aged 12-17 years, enrolled through schools, and assessed online through the following <i>measures:</i> Youth Self-Report for emotional-behavioral problems, Binge-Eating Scale for binge eating, Social Media Disorder Scale for problematic social media usage, and the Friends and Family Interview for attachment. The main <i>results</i> were: (1) 9.4% of adolescents showed clinical rates of emotional-behavioral symptoms and 4.8% of binge eating attitudes. The comparison with pre-pandemic samples revealed that pandemic teenagers showed lower internalizing, but higher other problems (e.g., binge drinking, self-destructive behaviors) and more problematic social media usage than pre-pandemic peers. No differences in binge-eating attitudes and attachment were revealed (76% secure classifications). (2) Problematic social media usage was related to more binge eating and emotional-behavioral problems, predicting 5.4% of both delinquent and attention problems. Attachment disorganization predicted 16.5% of internalizing problems, somatic complaints, and social and identity-related problems. In <i>conclusion</i>, confinement did not increase adolescents' internalizing symptoms -i.e., vulnerability to mood disorders of an anxious-depressive type- which even decreased. However, teenagers may have expressed their discomfort through other problems and symptoms of social media disorder. Further studies should explore the role of adolescents' problematic social media usage and attachment insecurity as risk factors for additional psychopathological symptoms.","Muzi, SansÃƒÂ², Pace","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.590543","20210514","Binge-Eating disorder; COVID; adolescents; attachment representations; emotional-behavioral symptoms; pandemic (COVID-19); risk assessment; social media disorder scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13733,""
"Self-Reported Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Healthcare Workers in Ethiopia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency that has affected many world nations, including Ethiopia. Aside from its implications on the community as a whole, COVID-19 has also been associated with a variety of mental health problems among healthcare workers (HCWs). In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in central Ethiopia. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from June 25, 2020, to July 25, 2020, in Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-reported Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were cleaned, coded,Ã‚Â and analysed using SPSS Version 23. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify the associated factors for mental health outcomes at a p-value of less than 0.05. A total of 816 HCWs completed the self-report questionnaire. The percentage of HCWs who had moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 60.3%, 78%, and 33.8%, respectively. Female participants, HCWs in the Oromiya Special Zone, medical laboratory professionals, and HCWs working in the COVID-19 treatment isolation centers were significantly more likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. In this study, HCWs reported a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Female participants, HCWs in the Oromiya Special Zone, medical laboratory professionals, and HCWs working in the COVID-19 treatment isolation centers were significantly more likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. It is imperative that the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health should develop psychological interventions to address the specific needs of HCWs who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jemal, Deriba, Geleta, Tesema, Awol, Mengistu, Annous","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S306240","20210514","COVID-19; Ethiopia; anxiety; depression; health care workers; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13734,""

In all, 86 filled all the 6 questionnaires (Demographics, COVID-19 virus experience, Mental Health Inventory, Neonatal Satisfaction Survey, Parental Stressor Scale, and Questionnaire of Coping Strategies). Most mothers stated that COVID-19 pandemic had hurt social and family relationships, maternal role, and expressed stress and loneliness. Mothers of NICU infants had higher degree of helplessness. Religious social distancing was not protective. Background tendency to coping poorly with stress and depression most highly predicted stress.

"Global prevalence of mental health issues among the general population during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","To provide a contemporary global prevalence of mental health issues among the general population amid the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We searched electronic databases, preprint databases, grey literature, and unpublished studies from January 1, 2020, to June 16, 2020 (updated on July 11, 2020), with no language restrictions. Observational studies using validated measurement tools and reporting data on mental health issues among the general population were screened to identify all relevant studies. We have included information from 32 different countries and 398,771 participants. The pooled prevalence of mental health issues amid the COVID-19 pandemic varied widely across countries and regions and was higher than previous reports before the COVID-19 outbreak began.

"When COVID-19 enters in a community setting: an exploratory qualitative study of community perspectives on COVID-19 affecting mental well-being","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased level of anxiety and fear among the general population related to its management and infection spread. Considering the relevance of present circumstances, we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis technique. The primary outcome is assessing community perception towards their mental well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general communities; (2) current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality and (3) recommendations to address the mental health of communities. Generally, community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need for remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address the mental health needs of the community. COVID-19-associated mental health consequences have hit every individual in society. The study finding has the potential to guide the development of context-specific innovative mental health programmes to overcome the pandemic repercussions.","Ali, Feroz, Akber, Feroz, Nazim Meghani, Saleem","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049851","20210514","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13737,""
"Scoping review of mental health in prisons through the COVID-19 pandemic","To examine the extent, nature and quality of literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of imprisoned people and prison staff. Scoping review. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PsychExtra, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for any paper from 2019 onwards that focused on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on imprisoned people and prison staff. A grey literature search focused on international and government sources and professional bodies representing healthcare, public health and prison staff was also performed. We also performed hand searching of the reference lists of included studies. All papers, regardless of study design, were included if they examined the mental health of imprisoned people or prison staff specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Imprisoned people could be of any age and from any countries. All languages were included. Two independent reviewers quality assessed appropriate papers. Of 647 articles found, 83 were eligible for inclusion, the majority (58%) of which were opinion pieces. The articles focused on the challenges to prisoner mental health. Fear of COVID-19, the impact of isolation, discontinuation of prison visits and reduced mental health services were all likely to have an adverse effect on the mental well-being of imprisoned people. The limited research and poor quality of articles included mean that the findings are not conclusive. However, they suggest a significant adverse impact on the mental health and well-being of those who live and work in prisons. It is key to address the mental health impacts of the pandemic on people who live and work in prisons.

"Opioid use disorder treatment for people experiencing homelessness: A scoping review","The opioid-related overdose epidemic remains a persistent public health problem in the United States and has been accelerated by the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. Existing, evidence-based treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD) are broadly underutilized, particularly by people experiencing homelessness (PEH). PEH are also more likely to misuse and overdose on opioids. To better understand current gaps and disparities in OUD treatment experienced by PEH and efforts to address them, we synthesized the literature reporting on the intersection of housing status and OUD treatment. We conducted a scoping review of the literature from the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection. We included studies describing treatment-related outcomes specific to PEH and articles assessing OUD treatment interventions tailored to this population. Relevant findings were compiled via thematic analysis and narratively synthesized. 60 articles met our inclusion criteria, including 43 descriptive and 17 intervention-focused studies. These studies demonstrated that PEH experience more barriers to OUD treatment than their housed counterparts and access inpatient and detoxification treatment more commonly than pharmacotherapy. However, the reviewed literature indicated that PEH have similar outcomes once engaged in pharmacotherapy. Efficacious interventions for PEH were low-barrier and targeted, with housing interventions also demonstrating benefit. PEH have diminished access to evidence-based OUD treatment, particularly medications, and require targeted approaches to improve engagement and retention. To mitigate the disproportionate opioid-related morbidity and mortality PEH experience, innovative, flexible, and interdisciplinary OUD treatment models are necessary, with housing support playing an important role.","McLaughlin, Li, Carrero, Bain, Chatterjee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108717","20210514","Healthcare for the homeless; Homelessness; MOUD; Opioid use disorder; Substance use treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13739,""
"Pre-existing and post-pandemic insomnia symptoms are associated with high levels of stress, anxiety and depression globally during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased prevalence of insomnia and mental health symptoms globally. However, most studies to date have not examined mental health symptoms between individuals with insomnia, either pre-existing or developing post-pandemic, compared to good sleepers. This study examined differences in stress, anxiety, and depression between individuals with pre-existing insomnia symptoms, post-pandemic insomnia symptoms and no insomnia symptoms, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was completed by 2724 participants from 67 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared between individuals with post-pandemic insomnia symptoms (n=1007), pre-existing insomnia symptoms (n=804), and no insomnia symptoms (n=913). Post-pandemic insomnia symptoms were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than pre-existing or no insomnia symptoms (p's&lt;.001). Pre-existing insomnia symptoms were also associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than no insomnia symptoms (p's&lt;.001). Individuals who met likely criteria for Acute Insomnia also reported higher stress, anxiety and depression than those with Insomnia Disorder (p's&lt;.001). Across all groups, individuals reporting a previous mental health diagnosis had worse stress, anxiety and depression than those without a previous mental health diagnosis (p's&lt;.001). Lastly, individuals from South Africa reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than other countries (p's&lt;.01). Internationally, individuals with pre-existing and post-pandemic insomnia symptoms may be more susceptible to stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Anxiety is associated with appetitive traits in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has impacted mental health globally, however, associations between anxiety and appetitive traits during the pandemic are unreported. This study evaluated anxiety symptom severity and associations with appetitive traits in students at a large public University in the U.S. during the pandemic. Current undergraduate and graduate/professional students completed a cross-sectional survey in fall 2020. Demographic information, anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and appetitive traits assessed by the Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ) were evaluated. Mean scores for eight AEBQ scales (four food approach and four food avoidance traits) were calculated. Differences in mean scores were examined between participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) and those with mild to no anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) via independent samples t-tests and effect sizes. Associations between GAD-7 score and individual appetitive traits were also examined, adjusting for age and gender. Of the 1243 students who completed the survey (57% undergraduates; mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), 51.9% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Groups experiencing the highest degree of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms included transgender, gender fluid, and other-gendered participants (73.6%); the youngest age group [18-20Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (62%)]; undergraduate students (60.7%); and Hispanic/Latinx participants (57.7%). Participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms had higher scores for most food approach and avoidance traits but lower scores for enjoyment of food than those with mild to no anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were largest for hunger and emotional over-eating (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Adjusting for age and gender, GAD-7 score was significantly and positively associated with hunger, emotional over-eating, food and satiety responsiveness, and food fussiness and negatively associated with enjoyment of food. Over half of students at a U.S. University reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during COVID-19. More severe anxiety symptoms were associated with increased hunger, emotional over-eating, and food and satiety responsiveness and decreased enjoyment of food. Universities must consider strategies to address anxiety, particularly in younger students; transgender, gender fluid, and students of other genders; and across race/ethnicities keeping in mind associations with appetitive traits.","Coakley, Le, Silva, Wilks","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12937-021-00701-9","20210514","Anxiety; Appetitive traits; COVID-19; Emotional eating; Graduate students; Hunger; Mental health; Undergraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13741,""
"Interviewing children: the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on children's perceived psychological distress and changes in routine","The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in governments implementing disease containment measures such as school closures, social distancing, and home quarantine. To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. Almost 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78Ã¢â‚¬â€°%) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of the students reported significant mood symptoms. Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children's development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.","Segre, Campi, Scarpellini, Clavenna, Zanetti, Cartabia, Bonati","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-021-02704-1","20210514","COVID-19 quarantine; Children; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13742,""
"Telemedicine platform COVIDREHAB for remote rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19","The world's practice has shown the importance of medical rehabilitation, which allows increasing the effectiveness of treatment of patients with COVID-19, and also significantly reduce the risks of developing complications after COVID-19. Moreover, timely medical rehabilitation reduces the frequency of disability retirement. We developed and investigated the effectiveness of the telemedicine platform &quot;COVIDREHAB&quot; in order to enhance the effectiveness of the recovery period during self-isolation, as well as to provide access to rehabilitation for patients residing in remote areas or unable to undergo in-person medical rehabilitation. This pilot open clinical study includes 178 patients (108 women and 70 men) aged 32 to 82 years [mean age 50 (33-56) years] who had a moderate disease of COVID-19. We used the specialised platform COVIDREHAB for remote monitoring of the rehabilitation efficiency of patients who suffered from COVID-19. During the study, the supervising doctor assigned the patient a set of specialised questionnaires, which were filled in online. The questionnaires distributed to the patient included questions specifically designed for the COVIDREHAB remote platform as well as the mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) questionnaire. Patients who completed the remote rehabilitation programme were found to have positive dynamics of indicators of the respiratory system functional state, and complaints.Pulmonary rehabilitation is an important part of case management for patients with respiratory diseases and plays an active role in improving lung function and general well-being of patients. Patients who completed the comprehensive medical rehabilitation program using the information and analytical system COVIDREHAB, were found to have positive dynamics of indicators of the respiratory system functional state, and complaints. Hence, at the end of the course the shortness of breath severity decreased (from 34.8% to 12.4%, as well as the feeling of lack of oxygen from 32% to 17.4%, p &lt;0.05). We anticipate the online approach to rehabilitation will improve the functioning of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, restore physical function, reduce anxiety and depression, and restore quality of life. An essential benefit of this program is the prevention of secondary complications and reduction of serious adverse effects of COVID-19 treatment.&quot;","Gilmutdinova, Kolyshenkov, Lapickaya, Trepova, Vasileva, Prosvirnin, Marchenkova, Terentev, Yakovlev, Rachin, Fesyun, Reverchuk","https://doi.org/10.4081/ejtm.2021.9783","20210514","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13743,""

"Depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a novel population-level stressor. As such, it is important to examine pandemic-related changes in mental health and to identify which individuals are at greatest risk of worsening symptoms. Methods: Online questionnaires were administered to 34,465 individuals in the UK, recruited from existing cohorts or via social media. Around one third (n = 12,718) with prior diagnoses of depression or anxiety completed pre-pandemic mental health assessments, allowing prospective investigation of symptom change. We examined changes in depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms using prospective, retrospective and global ratings of change assessments. We also examined the effect of key risk factors on changes in symptoms. Outcomes: Prospective analyses showed small decreases in depression (PHQ-9: - .43 points) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7: -.33 points), and increases in PTSD symptoms (PCL-6: .22 points). Conversely, retrospective analyses demonstrated large significant increases in depression (2.40 points) and anxiety symptoms (1.97 points) and 55% reported worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic on a global change rating. Using both prospective and retrospective symptom measures, regression analyses demonstrated that worsening depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms were associated with i) prior mental health diagnoses, ii) female gender; iii) young age, and iv) unemployed or student status. Interpretation: We highlight the effect of prior mental health diagnoses on worsening mental health during the pandemic and confirm previously-reported sociodemographic risk factors. Discrepancies between prospective and retrospective measures of changes in mental health may be related to recall bias underestimating prior symptom severity.","Katherine Seaton Young et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624B-A28-3A2","20210514","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","",13746,""
