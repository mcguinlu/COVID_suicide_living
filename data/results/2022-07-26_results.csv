"Lowered quality of life in Long COVID is strongly predicted by affective symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome which are associated with inflammatory processes during the acute infectious phase and consequent neuroimmunotoxic pathways","The physio-affective phenome of Long COVID-19 is predicted by a) immune-inflammatory biomarkers of the acute infectious phase, including peak body temperature (PBT) and oxygen saturation (SpO2), and b) the subsequent activation of immune and oxidative stress pathways during Long COVID. The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version) and the physio-affective phenome of Long Covid (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1{beta}, IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with Astra-Zeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID.","Michael Maes; Haneen Tahseen Al-Rubaye; Abbas F.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adolescent Mental Health and Substance Use","Purpose The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19-induced financial impact, stress, loneliness, and isolation were related to perceived changes in adolescent mental health and substance use. Methods Data were from Baseline (2018) and Wave 3 (2020;mean ageÂ = 14.8;50% female) of 1,188 adolescents recruited from 12 Texas public middle schools as part of a randomized controlled trial. Participants were primarily Black (23%), Latinx (41%), Asian (11%), and White (9%). We assessed mental health and substance use (Baseline and Wave 3) and pandemic-related physical interaction, loneliness, stress, family conflict, and economic situation (Wave 3). Results COVID-19-induced stress and loneliness were linked to depression (betaÂ = 0.074, p = .001;betaÂ = 0.132, p = .001) and anxiety (betaÂ = 0.061, pÂ = .001;betaÂ = 0.088, p = .001) among ethnically diverse adolescents. Adolescents who did not limit their physical interactions due to COVID-19 had fewer symptoms of depression (betaÂ =Â -0.036, pÂ = .03);additionally, adolescents who did not restrict their socializing were substantially more likely to report using a variety of substances (e.g., for episodic heavy drinking;odds ratioÂ = 1.81, pÂ = .001). Increased use of a food bank was linked to depression (betaÂ = 0.063, p = .001) and a negative change in financial situation was linked to increased alcohol use (odds ratioÂ = 0.70, pÂ = .04) among adolescents. Discussion After controlling for prepandemic psychopathology and race/ethnicity, COVID-19 induced isolation, loneliness, stress, and economic challenges were linked to poor mental health and substance misuse. Substantial structural, community, school, and individual level resources are needed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent psychosocial health.","Temple, Jeff R.; Baumler, Elizabeth, Wood, Leila, Guillot-Wright, Shannon, Torres, Elizabeth, Thiel, Melanie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.05.025","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34847,""
"Enhancing mental health literacy in obsessive-compulsive disorder and reducing stigma via smartphone: A randomized controlled trial protocol","Background Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling disorder that can be successfully treated. However, individuals with OCD do not seek or delay seeking treatment. This delay may be explained by poor mental health literacy and stigmatizing attitudes toward OCD in community. In order to work on these variables, a gamified mental health mobile application (app) called esTOCma has been developed. The purpose of this study is to describe the protocol for a study to test the efficacy of esTOCma, increasing mental health literacy and help-seeking intention, reducing the stigmatizing attitudes and social distance suffered by people with OCD, as well as the distress associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Methods A randomized controlled trial with a crossover design with two conditions (immediate-use App group versus delayed-use App group) will be conducted on a non-clinical adult sample of the community of a minimum size of 200 participants. Participants in the immediate-use App group will start using the app at baseline until completion (10Â days);whereas participants in the delayed-use App group will wait 10Â days, and then start using the app until completion (10Â days). The outcomes will be measured at four assessment points (baseline;10Â days from baseline;and 20Â days from baseline;and after 3Â months). The following instruments will be administered: Attribution Questionnaire, General Help-Seeking Questionnaire, Social Distance Scale, Mental Health Literacy, Psychoeducation Questionnaire, Social Desirability Scale, Single-Item Self-esteem Scale, and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised. Discussion This protocol presents the first study to describe a randomized control trial of a mental health app focused on changing mental health literacy, stigmatizing attitudes, social distance and help-seeking intention associated with OCD. An app intervention of these characteristics is especially relevant nowadays as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased obsessive-compulsive symptoms and severity. An improvement in general knowledge about OCD and a reduction in stigma could be associated with earlier OCD detection and an increase in help-seeking intention, which could result in greater wellbeing. Moreover, normalizing intrusions and knowledge about the cognitive OCD model could serve as a protective variable in vulnerable individuals.

"Fear and poor mental health among workers during the global cruise tourism crisis: Impact of low employability and family support","This research examines how fear of the crisis affects the mental health of hospitality workers in the cruise industry by performing a cross-sectional survey and using partial least squares model. Results confirm that fear of pandemic-induced shutdown negatively affects the mental health of cruise ship employees. The moderating effect of perceived employability outside the cruise ship industry and family emotional support are also uncovered. This study successfully consolidates the literature on job demand, job resources, work engagement, and well-being to determine the complex essence of cruise ship employeesâ€™ work engagement and well-being. Theoretically, this study expands the scarce literature that links the fear of the crisis with employeesâ€™ poor mental health. Some previous studies have examined this relationship in other contexts of economic crisis throughout history, but, for obvious reasons, none of these studies have had the opportunity to investigate a global economic crisis associated with a health crisis.","Arjona-Fuentes, Juan M.; Radic, Aleksandar, Ariza-Montes, Antonio, Han, Heesup, Law, Rob","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2022.103276","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Hospitality Management; 106:103276, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34849,""
"Effect of Patient Portals on Perception of Care Quality, General Health, and Mental Health: An Exploratory Analysis","This study analyzes the relationship between patientsâ€™ understanding of online medical records and their perception of care quality. It also explores the mediating role of patientsâ€™ general health perception and mental health and the moderating role of age in this relationship. The study develops and tests an exploratory conceptual model by analyzing the 2020 US-based Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We checked the survey for multicollinearity and common method bias and adjusted for family-wise error. Using models 6 and 59 of the Hayes PROCESS macros, the study articulates a sequential mediation and a parallel moderated mediation model to capture the intended relationships. Patientsâ€™ understanding of online medical records had a significant positive association with the perception of care quality (Direct: ÃŸ=0.17;Indirect: ÃŸ=0.12). Additionally, the study captured the significant effect of age and perception of general health (self-health) on the perception of care quality. We also reported significant associations between mental health and general health perception (ÃŸ=0.26). These findings suggest that the patient portals' contents should be designed in a way to be easily understood by patients from various backgrounds to improve the overall care experience.","Choudhury, Avishek, Elkefi, Safa, Strachna, Olga, Asan, Onur","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hfh.2022.100018","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Human Factors in Healthcare;: 100018, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34850,""
"A flatter curve affords hospitals greater time to prepare for a pandemic surge","This paper quantifies the benefits of flattening the curve (with a constant total patient load over the study period) on the risk of a hospital bed shortage in a pandemic. Using discrete-event simulation of patient care paths in hospitals, synthetic data that eliminates issues of confounding affects from the simultaneous occurrence of regional response actions and/or changes in resources, treatments or other situational circumstances, is produced for estimating hospital capacity for pandemic response. Results from systematically designed numerical experiments produced several findings. These include that the higher the acceleration in pandemic patient demand growth, the greater the impact of the intervention. Cutting this acceleration by 75% from the greatest studied rate created over four additional weeks to prepare for an 80% risk of running out of intensive care beds. Additionally, the greater the acceleration in growth, the fewer the days with a high risk of running out of beds, but the greater the total number of critical patients that could not be served with existing resources. Finally, the lower this acceleration, the fewer resources or modifications needed to cope with the surge, but the longer they are needed. The findings further show how hospitals can benefit from analytical tools that exploit digital health information to predict and plan for need levels and time to onset of these levels. These tools can be embedded within a real-time framework in which automated and early warnings can inform the selection of strategies for managing or coping with expected increases in demand for emergency hospital services.","Miller-Hooks, Elise, Tariverdi, Mersedeh, Prentiss, David, Kirsch, Thomas D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.health.2022.100076","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare Analytics;: 100076, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34851,""
"Cross-cultural validation of the Worries about COVID-19 and its consequences Scale (W-COV) in adolescents and young people","The pandemic context presents remarkable psychological challenges for adolescents and young adults. The aim of the present work was to construct and study the psychometric properties of a scale in Spanish language (W-COV) to measure their worries related to the pandemic. Participants were 5559 people aged between 14 and 25Â years old (MÂ =Â 19.05;SDÂ =Â 3.28). Self-report data were collected using a cross-sectional and cross-cultural design. Participants were from 5 Spanish-speaking countries. Instruments were W-COV to assess worries about COVID-19 and its consequences;DASS-21 for anxiety, depression and stress;and SWLS for life satisfaction. Exploratory, confirmatory and multi-group factor analyses were conducted to determine the factorial structure of the W-COV and its measurement invariance (configural, metric, scalar and error variance). Correlational and regression analyses were also performed to study convergent and predictive validity. The results suggest that W-COV presents a bifactorial structure: (1) a general factor of worries about COVID-19;and (2) three different factors: worries about health, economic and psychosocial consequences from COVID-19. The internal reliability indices Cronbach's a and Omega were adequate. With respect to the invariance results, the instrument can be used interchangeably in the five countries considered, in both genders and in two different age groups (12â€“17 and 18â€“25). Regarding validity, W-COV factors were positively associated with anxiety, depression and stress, and negatively predicted life satisfaction. In conclusion, W-COV is a reliable and valid instrument for researchers and health care professionals to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic on mental health of young Ibero-Americans.","MÃ³naco, EstefanÃ­a, Schoeps, Konstanze, Valero-Moreno, Selene, Castro-Calvo, JesÃºs, Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada, del Rosario, Constanza, Coello, Fernanda, Herrera, SebastiÃ¡n, Trujillo, Ãngela, Munevar, Fernando Riveros, Esparza, Nancy Alejandra Amador","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.07.016","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34852,""
"Measuring resilience in the food-energy-water nexus based on ethical values and trade relations","The challenges of the 21st century require resilient societies and a robust international regulatory framework [1]. The current disruptions to the global framework (most notably by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war on Ukraine) as well as the historic experiences especially of the Great Depression and the Lehman crisis (Annex II) elucidate the importance of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a global regulatory framework. The SDGs provide new targets for resilient development. In this paper we set specific focus especially on SDG 17 â€œPartnerships for the Goalsâ€ and its aim of a free multilateral trading system (Annex I, SDG 17.10-17.12) for sustainable development [2]. Against this background the German Resilience Index was developed as a new measure for defining the resilience of the German society based on the SDGs including the explicit consideration of trade dynamics. The German Resilience Index (GRI) enables an analysis of the extent to which Germany has succeeded in building socio-economic-ecological resilience to defy the storms of globalization. The index is based on the German Sustainable Development Goals and the defined targets, considering also ethical values derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities of the InterAction Council and trade relations as corner stones of resilient development. The analysis thus provides a first approach for systematically considering the impact of Germanyâ€™s intensive participation in globalization and the ethical values of the German Sustainability Strategy and its SDGs. The results are important for the political decision-making process and the political as well as social discourse about the future course of sustainable, and thus resilient, development in Germany.","SchlÃ¶r, Holger, Venghaus, Sandra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119447","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Energy; 323:119447, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34853,""
"The phenomenology of tic and tic-like behavior in TikTok","Objective: We aimed to evaluate the tic phenomenology portrayed in videos about Tourette syndrome (TS) posted on TikTok, a popular social media platform. Background: An increase in functional tic-like disorder (FTLD) has been seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients often report increased viewing of TS videos and posting videos of their movements in TikTok.1 Methods: The 100 most viewed videos under #tourettes in TikTok up to 03/27/21 were reviewed. All reviewers were pediatric movement disorder specialists. Three primary reviewers (&lt;2 years independent practice) and 4 senior reviewers participated. Atypical or rare tic phenomenology was predefined and videos were randomly assigned to 2 primary reviewers. Disagreements between primary reviewers were solved by consensus. If not resolved, a senior reviewer was the tiebreaker. In addition, 2 primary and 1 senior reviewer rated each video on a Likert scale from 1= All of the tics portrayed are typical of TS to 5= None of the tics portrayed are typical of TS. Spearman correlation between primary and senior reviewers was calculated. Results: Of the reviewed videos, 6 did not portray tics and 2 were removed from TikTok before all reviewers could assign a score. Coprolalia and copropraxia were depicted in 53.2% and 20.2% of the videos, respectively. Coprophenomena often had atypical characteristics. Frequently, tics appeared to be strongly influenced by the environment, for both motor (54.3% of videos) and phonic tics (54.3%). Aggression was seen in 19.1%, throwing objects in 22.3%, self-injurious behaviors in 27.7%, and long phrases (&gt;3 words) in 45.7% of videos. [table1] The primary reviewers' median Likert score was 4.5 (IQR:4-5) and senior reviewers' median score was 5 (IQR: 3-5). Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.46 (p &lt; 0.001). [figure1]. Conclusion: We found a high frequency of atypical or rare tic phenomenology portrayed in TikTok videos. Most of the videos were rated as poorly consistent with TS. Recent FTLD patients present with similar events to those in the videos. 'Social contagion' has been postulated as a mechanism for the recent increase in FTLD.1 This modeling has been previously described in mass functional illness.2 Alternatively, echophenomena in susceptible patients has also been suggested. More research is needed to define the relationship between social media and FTLD.","Zea Vera, A.; Bruce, A.; Garris, J.; Tochen, L.; Bhatia, P.; Lehman, R.; Lopez, W.; Wu, S.; Gilbert, D.","https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.13411","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Movement Disorders Clinical Practice; 9(SUPPL 1):S70-S72, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34854,""
"Seizure Control During COVID-19: A Study Using the Responsive Neurostimulation System (RNS)","Objective: To better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy (PWE) with an RNS implanted. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a challenge to care of PWE. Some reports suggest COVID-19 can cause increased seizures in PWE, which may be related to psychosocial distress during the pandemic. Conversely, the pandemic may have brought about a decrease in daily demands and stressors, which could cause decreased seizure frequency in PWE. While surveys and record reviews provide some indication of the effect of the pandemic on seizures, RNS can potentially provide more accurate counts. Design/Methods: Patients with an RNS system implanted before September 2019 were included. We analyzed the weekly number of long episodes counts (LEC) as a proxy for seizures for 6 months (26 weeks) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic declaration (Sep 2019-Mar 2020) and after the declaration (Mar 2020-Sep 2020). Additionally, telephone surveys and chart review were conducted to assess patient mental health during the pandemic. The correlation between change in LEC and reported stressors was assessed. Results: Twenty patients were included. The average age was 41.2 years (SD=11.9). Thirteen (65%) patients were male. Comparing the pre-COVID-19 period to COVID-19 period, we found 5 (25%) patients had increased LEC compared to 15 (75%) patients who did not have significant increase in LEC. Change in anti-seizure medications (p = 0.031) and bilateral seizure types (p=0.031) were associated with an increase in LEC. Anxiety(p=1.00), depression(p=0.58), and sleep disturbances(p=1.00) were not significantly correlated with increases in LEC. Conclusions: Contrary to some published literature, we did not find a significant increase in seizures following the pandemic when assessed using the objective measure of RNS LEC and subjective self-reports on a telephone survey. Additionally, we did not find a correlation between pandemic-related stress and seizures in those who were found to have increased seizures.","Ward, R.; Karakas, C.; Skrehot, H.; Vallera, A.; Cleboski, S.; Haneef, Z.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Seizure+Control+During+COVID-19:+A+Study+Using+the+Responsive+Neurostimulation+System+(RNS)","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34855,""
"Is COVID-19 Associated With an Increase in Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale Scores Among Postpartum Women?","INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression affects approximately 10% to 20% of pregnancies. Recent studies suggest an increased incidence of postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of postpartum depression in a cohort of patients cared for within a tertiary care center before and after the COVID-19 pandemic using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). METHODS: A retrospective chart review of randomly selected patients seen for postpartum care and who completed an EPDS between April 2019-February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 cohort, 448 patients) and April 2020-February 2021 (post-COVID-19 cohort, 468 patients) was conducted with Institutional review board approval. The EPDS scores categorized four levels: &lt;9, 9-11, 12-14, and &gt;15, corresponding to negative, mild, moderate, and severe total scores. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared these associations. RESULTS: Percentages of pre-COVID-19 cohort patients within each EPDS category above were 64.9%, 17%, 11.6%, and 6.5%, respectively, and for the post-COVID-19 cohort were 36.8%, 31.8%, 18.6%, and 12.8%, respectively. In the post-COVID-19 cohort, ANOVA showed a significant increase in the number of patients with positive total EPDS scores (F (1,895.22)=30.66, P&lt;.001, <U+03B7>2=0.032), in mild EPDS levels (F (1,843.65)=12.24, P&lt;.001, <U+03B7>2=0.013) and severe EPDS levels, (F (1,860.72)=12.26, P&lt;.001, <U+03B7>2=0.013). ANOVA showed no significant difference in the number of patients with moderate EPDS levels. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a statistically significant increase in EPDS scores in postpartum patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be conducted to determine which factors impacted the increase in EPDS scores after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vozzola, A.; McCracken, J.; Vozzola, D.

"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on EPDS Scores and Maternal Quality of Life","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health. We evaluated the impact on pregnant women and compared the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) and a Maternal Postpartum Quality of Life Questionnaire (mPQOL) before and during the pandemic to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on maternal mental health and quality of life. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, EPDS screening exams and mPQOL surveys were collected postpartum on all pregnant women during six 12-week epochs prior to and during the pandemic (Epoch 1: December 16, 2019, to March 8, 2020;Epoch 2:March 9, 2020, to May 31, 2020;Epoch 3: June 1, 2020, to August 23, 2020;Epoch 4: August 24, 2020, to November 15, 2020;Epoch 5: November 16, 2020, to January 31, 2021;Epoch 6: February 1, 2021, to May 2, 2021). Scores were compared among the epochs. A score of 13 or higher indicated screening positive for depression. The mPQOL survey was evaluated by sub-categories: Psychological/Baby, Socioeconomic, Relational/Partner, Relationships/Family, and Health/Functioning. Satisfaction was ranked on a scale from 1 to 6 (1=very dissatisfied, 6=very satisfied). EPDS scores and mPQOL scores were compared among the epochs to determine contributors that impacted quality of life during the pandemic. RESULTS: Out of 2,011 women, an EPDS score of 13 or higher increased from 3% to 9% from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 and peaked at 11% in Epoch 5 (P=0.007). mPQOL Socioeconomic and Relational/Partner sub-category scores decreased significantly from 5.8 to 5.5 (P=0.014) and 5.5 to 5.4 (P=0.041), respectively, from Epoch 2 to Epoch 3. CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in positive EPDS screens in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sub-scores obtained from the mPQOL survey suggest that increasing socioeconomic concerns and relational partner issues may have driven these trends.","Twichell, E.; Zofkie, A.; Mathisen, D.; Lafferty, A.; McIntire, D.

Scales of quality of life and cognition were obtained and included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Neuro-QOL (Anxiety, fatigue, depression). Results: Of 98 participants recruited, 68% of participants were seen in neurology clinic specifically for PASC while 31% were seen for non-COVID related complaints but had a prior positive COVID-19 test. Mean age was 50.5Â±15.1 and 65% were female. Median time post-acute infection was 9.0 (IQR 4.7-11.7/range 0.5 - 16.8) months. Of the 93 participants with symptoms after 6 weeks, the most frequent symptoms reported were fatigue (67%), headaches (49%), muscle aches (48%), word-finding difficulty (48%), difficulty sleeping (47%), shortness of breath (47%), and change in memory (46%). The most common pre-morbid conditions were anxiety/depression (32%), hypertension (26%), pulmonary disease (23%), and autoimmune (17%). BMI&gt;25 was present in 68%. 41% had a prior neurological condition with migraines being the most common (18%). There was no statistically significant difference in reported symptoms, pre-morbid conditions, sex, and age between participants who presented with PASC versus other neurological complaints. Patients reporting persistent fatigue (n=64) had a mean Neuro-QOL fatigue score of 53.3Â±9.9. Normal mean MoCA scores were present in patients reporting word finding difficulty or memory change (19.3Â±2.4 points) and in participants with abnormal Neuro-QOL scores (19.4Â±2.1 points). Conclusions: Patients with PASC in a neurology outpatient clinic report persistent neurological, systemic symptoms that affect their quality of life on multiple validated measures. The MoCA test may not be able to detect subtle cognitive deficits in this population.","Thawani, S.; Kenney, R.; Hasanaj, L.; Frontera, J.; Seixas, A.; Galetta, S.; Balcer, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+post-acute+sequelae+of+COVID-19+(PASC)+experience+in+an+outpatient+neurology+setting","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34858,""
"Headache Frequency and Quality of Life in Patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19","Objective: We sought to describe PASC-related headache severity and quality of life in a cohort of non-hospitalized individuals presenting to our outpatient neurology practices (PASC) Background: People with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) have reported many neurological symptoms such as brain fog, memory difficulties, and headache. Design/Methods: Participants with evidence of prior COVID-19 infection were asked to complete symptom scales, Neuro-QOL (anxiety, depression, and fatigue), and validated headache questionnaires: Headache Impact Test-6 and American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention questionnaire. Results: Among 98 participants reporting PASC symptoms after acute illness, mean age was 50.5Â±15.1 and 65% were female. Headache (49%) was the second most frequent neurologic symptom reported after fatigue (67%). 18% (18/98) had a prior history of migraine headaches. 38.9% (7/18) of participants with pre-morbid migraine reported more than 15 symptomatic headache days per month. When controlling for age and sex, there was a statistically significant difference (p=0.011) between in participants with a prior migraine history indicating more frequent headaches in the last 3 months (mean 39.0Â±28.5 headaches) compared to participants without prior migraine (mean 18.5Â±25.3 headaches). HIT-6 scores were also significantly greater (p=0.005) in participants with a migraine history after adjusting for age and sex, (58.6Â±13.2) versus 47Â±12.2) indicating worse quality of life related to headaches. In participants with HIT-6 scrores&gt;=56 indicating substantial or severe impact on quality of life and AMPP scores meeting criteria for chronic migraine, NeuroQOL scores for depression, anxiety, and fatigue were also elevated/worse. Conclusions: People with PASC in a neurology outpatient practice, with a prior migraine history report elevated headache frequency, worse quality of life related to their headaches as indicated by the HIT-6 test and Neuro-QOL. These data support the inclusion of headache specific measures in studies of PASC in larger samples and suggests that COVID-19 infection can impact headaches.","Thawani, S.; Kenney, R.; Hasanaj, L.; Frontera, J.; Galetta, S.; Balcer, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Headache+Frequency+and+Quality+of+Life+in+Patients+with+Post-Acute+Sequelae+of+COVID-19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34859,""

"Autonomic dysfunction following COVID-19 infection: an early experience","Objective: We present an early systematic analysis of autonomic dysfunction following COVID19 to provide initial insights into the spectrum of this condition. Background: Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a poorly understood aspect of the current pandemic, with clinical features that overlap with symptoms of autonomic/small fiber dysfunction. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with confirmed history of COVID-19 infection referred for autonomic testing for symptoms concerning for para-/postinfectious autonomic dysfunction at Mayo Clinic Rochester or Jacksonville between March 2020 and January 2021. Results: We identified 27 patients fulfilling the search criteria. Symptoms developed between 0 and 122 days following the acute infection and included lightheadedness (93%), orthostatic headache (22%), syncope (11%), hyperhidrosis (11%), and burning pain (11%). Sudomotor function was abnormal in 36%, cardiovagal function in 27%, and cardiovascular adrenergic function in 7%. The most common clinical scenario was orthostatic symptoms without tachycardia or hypotension (41%);22% of patients fulfilled the criteria for postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and 11% had borderline findings to support orthostatic intolerance. One patient each was diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, vasodepressor syncope, cough/vasovagal syncope, exacerbation of preexisting orthostatic hypotension, exacerbation of sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and exacerbation of small fiber neuropathy. Conclusions: Abnormalities on autonomic testing were seen in the majority of patients but were mild in most cases. The most common finding was orthostatic intolerance, often without objective hemodynamic abnormalities on testing. Unmasking/exacerbation of preexisting conditions was seen. The temporal association between infection and autonomic symptoms implies a causal relationship, which however cannot be proven by this study.","Shouman, K.; Vanichkachorn, G.; Cheshire, W.; Suarez, M.; Shelly, S.; Lamotte, G.; Sandroni, P.; Benarroch, E.; Berini, S.; Cutsforth-Gregory, J.; Coon, E.; Mauermann, M.; Low, P.; Singer, W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Autonomic+dysfunction+following+COVID-19+infection:+an+early+experience","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34861,""
"Success of Home-to-Home Tele-neuropsychology (TeleNP) in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Candidacy Assessments of Multicultural PD Patients: State of Practice for COVID-19 and Beyond","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic created unique challenges for neuropsychological assessment of DBS candidates due to physical distancing and safety requirements. Existing literature has demonstrated guidelines and feasibility of neuropsychological measures administered via teleconference, but none to our knowledge have assessed implementation, feasibility, clinical utility, and acceptance of home-to-home TeleNP in determining candidacy for DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Background: PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and DBS surgery offers significant improvement in motor symptoms and quality of life for medication refractory patients. Since neuropsychologists play an essential role in evaluating cognitive and behavioral changes that impact decisions on DBS surgical candidacy, adapting current practices is critical for continuity of care. Design/Methods: PD patients [n=72, M =63.3(8.76), 65.3% male, M =14.7(2.93), 50.7% Hispanic, 58.3% tested in English/41.7% in Spanish) underwent neuropsychological (global cognition, language, memory, attention, processing speed, visuospatial ability) and emotional assessments via home-to-home TeleNP between May 2020 and August 2021. Independent t-tests were conducted to assess TeleNP discriminability of cognitive and emotional function in surgical candidates. Results: To date, 66 candidates were approved for DBS (44 completed surgery, 17 are pending, 5 opted not to proceed), and 6 were not surgical candidates due to neurocognitive and/or severe psychiatric disorders. Surgical candidate mean neuropsychological scores were average across all domains, with normal to mild mood symptoms. The non-selected group differed by education but not age, and was significantly different (p=.006) in overall cognition [MoCA t(70)=3.62], age edu working memory [WAIS-IV DS t(70)=3.15], phonemic fluency [COWAT FAS t(70)=2.85], verbal reasoning [WAIS-IV SI t(67)=3.38], perceptual reasoning [WAIS-IV MR t(70)=3.02], depression [BDI-2 t(68)=3.47], and anxiety [BAI t(70)=2.88]. Conclusions: TeleNP is a successful platform for assessing DBS surgical candidacy safely in English and Spanish speaking PD patients and offers potential for providing high quality screening for those with physical limitations, reduced access to transportation, or are living in remote areas.","Sarno, M.; Reyes, A.

"Relation of Anxiety and Depression with Personal Protective Equipment Associated Headache in Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Outbreak","Objective: To determine the relationship of anxiety and depression with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) associated headache. Background: Healthcare workers who treat COVID-19 patients were mandated to use PPE to protect themselves. Personal Protective Equipment causes some difficulties and discomfort as well as some side effects, such as headache. Personal Protective Equipment associated headache might be caused by some pathomechanisms, such as mechanic factor, hypercarbia, and stress. Anxiety and depression are thought to trigger or exacerbate PPE-associated headache. Design/Methods: This was a descriptive analytic study with cross-sectional method conducted in June 2021. We involved healthcare workers in Haji Adam Malik General Hospital, a referral centre for COVID-19 in North Sumatera, Indonesia. Personal Protective Equipment associated headache was assesed with The International Classification of Headache Disorder, 3 Edition (ICHD-3) criteria for external compression headache. Depression was screened with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Anxiety was screened with Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: There were 110 respondents in this study: 64 (58,2%) were female, aged 31,94 Â±6,43 years, occupation nurse 74(67,3%). Personal Protective Equipment associated headache was experienced by 64 (58,2%) respondents. It was correlated with N95 mask usage (p=0,001), goggle usage (p=0,001), female healthcare workers (p= 0,008) and nurse profession (p= 0,001). Anxiety was reported by 13 (11,8%) respondents, with 10 respondents had mild anxiety. The profession of doctor were correlated with anxiety (p=0,009). Depression was reported by 28 (25,5%) respondents, with 24 respondents had mild depression. There was no correlation between respondents characteristic with depression. Study analysis showed that anxiety and depression were not significantly associated with PPE-associated headache, with p value 0,794 dan 0,897. rd Conclusions: Anxiety and depression were not associated with PPE-associated headache in COVID-19 healthcare workers. These results suggest that another pathomechanisms have bigger influence in PPE-associated headache.","Saragih, E. C.; Hutagalung, H. S.; Surbakti, K.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Behavioral Health of People with Intellectual and/or Developmental Disabilities","Objective: To examine how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the behavioral health of people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) in the US. Background: The general population has suffered increasing rates of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Having an intellectual disability was the most significant independent risk factor for a diagnosis of COVID-19, and the second strongest independent risk factor to COVID-19 mortality. This study investigates how the pandemic uniquely impacted the behavioral health of people with IDD. Design/Methods: Data were collected using a modified version of the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey -Adapted for Autism and Related Neurodevelopmental conditions (CRISISAFAR). The survey was disseminated electronically to a non-probability (i.e., convenience) sample of community and advocacy groups through the authors' networks of IDD-affiliated organizations. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools from March to June 2021. Results: 437 individuals with IDD completed the survey. 52.2% listed having an intellectual disability and 48.7% listed autism spectrum disorder, among other diagnoses. 51.6% of the survey population reported that their mental health had worsened during the pandemic. 47.6% said that they were worrying more, 55.6% struggled with changes in routine, and 18.7% reported increased self-injurious behavior. Losing access to services and programs correlated with declining mental health. Loss of or decrease in community support also correlated with increased screen time, worse sleep, and needing more help with activities of daily living. Conclusions: The behavioral health of individuals with IDD was profoundly impacted by the changes caused by COVID-19. Despite pervasive needs for increased mental and physical health resources amongst individuals with IDD, the potential positive impact of physical activity and pandemic safe social supports and opportunities should be regarded as an important and accessible means to mitigate the overall gap in services.","Sanders, J.; Sturley, R.; Pillai, R.; Asato, M.; Sillau, S.; Aravamuthan, B.; Cervenka, M.; Hammond, N.; Bonuck, K.; Siegel, J.; Siasoco, V.; Margolis, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Behavioral+Health+of+People+with+Intellectual+and/or+Developmental+Disabilities","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34864,""
"The relevance of air hygiene: an urgent matter after the COVID-19 pandemic","Historically, major public health advances-water sanitation and hygiene, as well as food safety- have gone hand in hand with the healthcare responses to the big epidemic outbreaks that have beset humankind. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the weaknesses of environmental health when it comes to addressing one of the most important aspects of the prevention of respiratory infectious diseases: airborne, or aerosol, transmission in indoor environments. Although there exist standards that regulate air quality inside public buildings, in practice they are not perceived as health or prevention requirements, so compliance therewith is rarely monitored. Therefore, from a public health perspective, and based on the experience gained from the pandemic, it would seem reasonable to incorporate ""air hygiene"" monitoring into environmental health-going beyond energy or comfort considerations and emphasizing sanitary and microbiological aspects. This would represent a substantial breakthrough in the containment of the transmission of infectious diseases via aerosols.","Rotger, S. C.; Iriarte, J. M.

"May 03, 2022;98 (18 Supplement) MONDAY, APRIL 4 Dysautonomia in Long Haul Covid-19 Infection Impairs Activities of Daily Living and Mental Health: The Patient Perspective","Objective: We report the burden of long haul COVID-19 associated dysautonomia and emphasize impact on activities of daily living and mental health, with the goal of developing interventions. Background: Dysautonomia is an established neurological effect of COVID-19 and has been reported in long-haul COVID-19 patients. It is imperative to understand the impact of this condition from the patient perspective to appreciate individual illness experience, clinical course, and disease burden to develop neurological, psychiatric, and social interventions. Design/Methods: 18 long-haul patients in a COVID-19 Remote Patient Monitoring Program (Precision Recovery: Mount Sinai Health System) were interviewed regarding their experience with COVID-19. Patients were asked about their experiences navigating diagnoses, the health care system, and their recovery process, with emphasis on long-haul symptom course and impact. References to dysautonomia within their long haul COVID-19 experience (symptoms persisting greater than four weeks post initial infection) were analyzed for statistical and qualitative significance. Results: The following symptoms of long-haul COVID-19 dysautonomia were reported: fluctuating fevers 12/18 (67%);heart palpitations/tachycardia: 12/18 (67%);digestion problems 8/18 (44%);dizziness 6/18 (33%);and fluctuations in blood pressure 4/18 (22%). 7/18 (39%) of patients reported 3 or more dysautonmic symptoms. Patients reported three categories of impact on daily activities: (1) routine physical exertion intolerance;(2) impaired ability to care for self (nutrition, hygiene);and (3) impacted social interaction due to physical impedance and/or isolation in experience. The main mental health effects associated with long-haul dysautonomia included: (1) depression and suicide ideation, (2) intense anxiety, and (3) self doubt. Conclusions: Dysautonomia in long haul COVID-19 patients has a devastating impact on daily living and mental health. It is imperative to recognize these effects and understand them from the patient perspective in order to develop compassionate, validating, and efficacious neurological, psychological, and social interventions for this population.","Reford, E.; Mohammadi, N.; Spica, N.

"Acute prolonged motor aura resembling ischemic stroke after COVID - 19 vaccination (CoronaVac): the firstcase report","Objective: NA Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand has started its vaccination program since February 2021. After the launch of the mass vaccination with CoronaVac, there were reports of patients who suffer unusual hemiparesis across the country. We report the first case of a patient who suffered transient focal neurological deficit mimicking stroke following CoronaVac vaccination. However, instead of an ischemic stroke, motor aura was suspected. Design/Methods: A 24 year-old Thai female presented with left hemiparesis fifteen minutes after receiving CoronaVac. She also had numbness of her left arm and legs, flashing lights, and headaches. On physical examination, her BMI was 32.8. Her vital signs were normal. She had moderate left hemiparesis (MRC grade III), numbness on her left face, arms, and legs. Her weakness continued for 5 days. Results: A brain CT scan was done showing no evidence of acute infarction. Acute treatment with aspirin was given. MRI in conjunction with MRA was performed in which no restricted diffusion was seen. A SPECT was performed to evaluate the function of the brain showing significant hypoperfusion of the right hemisphere. The patient gradually improved and was discharged. Conclusions: In this study, we present the first case of stroke mimic after CoronaVac vaccination. After negative imaging studies, stroke is unlikely to be the cause. Asymmetrical abnormal functional imaging study showing multifocal hypoperfusion on the right could represent the ongoing neurological deficits. Therefore, we believed that it might be due to cortical spreading depression, in which motor aura could be responsible. The uniqueness in our case is the prolongation of weakness that we think might be due reverberating spreading depression wave. The cause is unknown, but we proposed that aluminum found to enhance the vaccine that could disrupt the Glutamate - Nitric oxide - cGMP pathway leading to the prolongation of motor aura.","Rattanawong, W.; Akaratanawat, W.; Tepmongkol, S.; Chutinet, A.; Charnnarong, N.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Acute+prolonged+motor+aura+resembling+ischemic+stroke+after+COVID+-+19+vaccination+(CoronaVac):+the+firstcase+report","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34867,""

"Mid and Long-term Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of PostCOVID-19 Syndrome: A Meta-analysis","Objective: To determine the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported 12 weeks (3 months) or more after acute COVID-19 onset in adults. Background: Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that persist or develop three months after the onset of COVID-19 pose a significant threat to the global healthcare system. These symptoms are yet to be synthesized and quantified via meta-analysis. Design/Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted for studies published between January 1 , 2020 and August 1 , 2021. Studies were included if the length of follow-up satisfied the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence definition of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Additional criteria included reporting of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported =3 months post onset of COVID-19. Results: Of 1,458 articles, 19 studies, encompassing a total of 11,324 patients, were analysed. Overall prevalence for neurological post-COVID-19 symptoms were: fatigue (37%, 95% CI: 24%- 50%), brain fog (32%, 9%-55%), memory issues (27%, 18%-36%), attention disorder (22%, 10%- 34%), myalgia (18%, 4%-32%), anosmia (12%, 7%-17%), dysgeusia (11%, 4%-17%) and headache (10%, 1%-21%). Neuropsychiatric conditions included sleep disturbances (31%, 18%-43%), anxiety (23%, 13%-33%) and depression (12%, 7%-21%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms substantially increased in prevalence between mid- and long-term follow-up. Compared to non-hospitalised patients, patients hospitalised for acute COVID-19 had reduced risk of anosmia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and sleep disturbance at three (or more) months post-infection. Conversely, hospital admission was associated with higher frequency of memory issues (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.3). Conclusions: Fatigue, brain fog and sleep disturbances appear to be key features of post-COVID19 syndrome. Psychiatric manifestations (sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression) increase significantly in prevalence over time. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to develop intervention strategy to reduce disease burden.","Premraj, L.; Kannapadi, N.; Briggs, J.; Battaglini, D.; Fanning, J.; Suen, J.; Robba, C.; Fraser, J.; Cho, S.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on People with Parkinson's: Insights from Wearable Sensors","Objective: To describe changes in daily activity measured by wearable sensors in participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) following the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Digital tools provide objective, frequent and sensitive data collection in real-world settings. In a natural history study of PD, participants used wearable sensors before and after COVID-19 shutdowns. Design/Methods: At research visits throughout this two-year study at the University of Rochester Medical Center, participants wore sensors with accelerometer and gyroscopic capabilities and completed questionnaires. Following each visit, participants wore sensors remotely for 7 days during waking hours. Participant position and activity from days 1-6 of wear was classified from sensor data. Results: Prior to March 14 2020, when COVID-19 shutdowns began in Monroe County, NY, 17 participants with PD (70.4 (6.3) years) and 13 controls (61.1 (13.5) years) completed a baseline visit. All 30 later completed a month 12 visit after COVID-19 shutdowns. Sensor wear was comparable at baseline (13.9 (1.4) hours/day) and month 12 (13.74 (2.1) hours/day). At month 12, PD participants walked an average of 1709 (1457) steps/day, approximately 17% less than at baseline (2048 (1416) steps/day), with considerable individual variation. PD participants spent approximately 20% more time lying while awake at month 12 (112.7 (149.9) min) than at baseline (93.6 (103.1) min). Daytime sleep did not increase from baseline (39.6 (39.3) min) to month 12 (39.2 (32.8) min). PD and control participants reported greater anxiety and depression at month 12. From baseline to month 12, controls had similar activity trends as participants with PD, but walked more, spent less time lying, had less daytime sleep, and reported less depression and anxiety at both time points. Conclusions: Following the emergence of COVID-19, participants with PD walked less and spent more time resting. These data provide an objective measure of the pandemic's impact on a small cohort of individuals with PD.","Pawlik, M.; Jensen-Roberts, S.; Waddell, E.; Myers, T.; Soto, J.; Hartman, E.; Nnadika, E.; Yang, P.; Wilson, R.; Lizarraga, K.; Tarolli, C.; Schneider, R.; Dorsey, E.

"A pilotstudy on the effect of a community-based boxing program on Parkinson ' s disease","Objective: We characterized the effect of a 12-week community-based boxing exercise program on motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PWP). Background: Non-motor symptoms, including depression and apathy, are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), with significant impact on quality of life and independence. Apathy, in particular, can be difficult to treat with pharmacotherapeutics. Design/Methods: This was a prospective observational study. PWP underwent a 12-week designed community-based boxing program. The following assessments were performed by a movement disorders neurologist at baseline and after completion of the program: MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) modified version (since this was performed virtually due to COVID-19 pandemic), MDS Non-Motor Rating Scale (MDS-NMS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Lilli Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), Parkinson's Disease Questionaire-39 (PDQ-39), and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living scale (SE-ADL). Pre- and post-assessments were compared using paired T-test;only participants who completed the program and both assessments were analyzed. Results: Twenty-four PWP enrolled in the boxing program, out of which 14 agreed to be a part of the study and completed assessments. All participants were ambulatory and functionally independent at baseline. MDS-NMS (p=0.003), HDRS (p=0.04), and MDS-UPDRS III modified (p=0.0003) improved significantly after the intervention. LARS (p=0.25), PDQ-39 (p=0.07), and SE-ADL (p= 0.16) did not change. Anecdotally, participants reported an improvement in motivation. Conclusions: PWP who participated in a community-based boxing program had improvements in motor exam, non-motor symptoms, and depression. Using a larger sample size, future studies should assess the impact of such an intervention on apathy.","Patel, R.; Blasucci, L.; Mahajan, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+pilotstudy+on+the+effect+of+a+community-based+boxing+program+on+Parkinson+'+s+disease","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34871,""

"Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion after COVID-19 vaccination","Objective: To investigate the clinical features of the two cases presenting neurological syndrome after receiving COVID-19 vaccination, who were diagnosed with mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS). Background: Neurological symptoms can occur after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. However, its etiology hasn't been fully revealed. Design/Methods: A 23-year-old previously healthy man (Patient 1) and a 33-year-old woman with a history of depression (Patient 2) developed neurological symptoms approximately one week after receipt of the first standard dose (0.3 mL, intramuscular injection) of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (Coronavirus Modified Uridine RNA Vaccine (SARS-CoV-2)) (Day 1) and deteriorated over the next week. Clinical course, laboratory and MRI findings were serially analyzed. Results: Patient 1 presented with headache, low-grade fever and memory disturbance (Day 3). Intravenous acyclovir and meropenem were administered under a possible diagnosis of aseptic meningitis but not effective. Patient 2 presented with visual disturbance, headache, dysarthria, a left forearm tremor, dysesthesia of the mouth and distal limbs, and visual agnosia (Day 10). In both patients, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were negative. Complete blood cell count, blood-chemistry including electrolytes and antibody titers, and cerebrospinal fluid test findings were unremarkable initially. However, second cerebrospinal fluid test of Patient 1 (Day 8) showed pleocytosis (942 cells/ÂµL, normal = 5 cells/ÂµL) and elevated protein levels (181 mg/dL, normal 10-40 mg/dL). Brain MRI on Day 17 in Patient 1 and Day 15 in Patient 2 after receiving the vaccination showed high signal intensity lesions at the midline of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Based on the typical imaging features, the patients were diagnosed with MERS. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (1,000 mg/day for 3 days) improved their symptoms and MRI lesion disappeared. Conclusions: MERS should be considered in patients with neurological manifestation after COVID-19 vaccination, even though symptoms were mild and nonspecific.","Ohara, H.; Shimizu, H.; Kasamatsu, T.; Kajita, A.; Uno, K.; Sugie, K.; Kinoshita, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mild+encephalitis/encephalopathy+with+reversible+splenial+lesion+after+COVID-19+vaccination","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34873,""

"COVID-19 and Its Effect on the Prevalence of Postpartum Anxiety","INTRODUCTION: Early studies have shown that the prevalence of anxiety-related disorders in pregnant and postpartum women has increased since the onset of COVID-19. Reasons include fear related to the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and the newborn as well as concern about undergoing delivery without loved ones present. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference in the rates of postpartum anxiety pre- and post-COVID-19 as demonstrated by the EPDS-3A, a modified standardized measure of postpartum anxiety. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 916 randomly selected women who completed a postpartum visit and an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)-3A) screening from April 2019-February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 cohort) and April 2020-February 2021 (post- COVID-19 cohort) was conducted with institutional review board approval. Presence of anxiety-related symptoms was evaluated using the EPDS-3A. Data including EPDS-3A score, demographic information, and medical history were queried. The data from the cohorts were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: ANOVA showed a significant increase in the EPDS-3A scores for patients in the post- compared to pre-COVID-19 cohort (F (1, 908.06)523.89, P&lt; .001, <U+03B7>2 = .025). A score of 4 on the EPDS- 3A indicated clinically significant anxiety. A greater number of patients Scored&gt;4 on the EPDS-3A in the post-COVID-19 cohort (34.8%) compared to the pre-COVID-19 cohort (18.8%). CONCLUSION: Postpartum anxiety as identified via the EPDS-3A was significantly more prevalent in the post-COVID-19 cohort. These findings emphasize the importance of screening for postpartum anxiety in addition to postpartum depression, especially in the post-COVID- 19 era.","McCracken, J.; Vozzola, A.; Vozzola, D.

"Bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (B/F/ TAF) for the Treatment of People Living with HIV (PLWH): 12-month (12M) Effectiveness, Persistence, and Safety in a Multi-country Cohort Study","Introduction: BICSTaR (GS-EU-380-4472/GS-CA-380-4574/GS-IL-380- 5335) is an ongoing, multinational, observational cohort study evaluating real-world effectiveness and safety of B/F/TAF in ART naÃ¯ve (TN) and ARTexperienced (TE) PLWH. Materials and Methods: This 12M pooled analysis included PLWH starting B/F/TAF in clinical practice from June 2018 to September 2020 (latterly during the COVID-19 pandemic) in Europe/Israel/Canada. Outcomes included virological effectiveness (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml [missing=excluded]), persistence, drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and laboratory parameters. Results: One-thousand one hundred thirty-five PLWH were included (Table 1). The TE group had older median age than TN. Of TE participants, 65%/20%/16% switched from INSTI/NNRTI/PI-based regimens (36% TDF/46% TAF/13% ABC);12% had prior virologic failure. Baseline resistance was documented in 124/535 participants (NRTI/NNRTI/PI/ INSTI=6%/6%/3%/0.2%). Prevalence of comorbidities (47%/72% TN/TE) and concomitant medication usage was high. At 12M, 97% (149/154) of TN and 96% (771/800) of TE participants had HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml, and persistence on B/F/TAF was high [91% (1032/1135)]. In a multivariable analysis, TE participants with neuropsychiatric disorder ongoing at baseline had lower odds for viral suppression (odds ratio=0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.96). There was no emergence of resistance to the components of B/F/TAF. DRAEs occurred in 13% (148/1135) of participants;gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric DRAEs were the most common (3% each). Discontinuations due to DRAEs were low (TN 4%;TE 6%). Serious DRAEs were rare (0.2%;2 TE participants with depression). Lipidchanges are shown (Figure 1). Conclusion: B/F/TAF was associated with high levels of effectiveness and persistence after 12M in this large real-world cohort of TN and TE PLWH with a high comorbidity burden. Effectiveness was demonstrated across key subgroups (females, older participants, late presenters). Importantly, there were no new or unexpected safety findings. Collectively, these real-world data continue to support the use of B/F/TAF in clinical practice.","Mallolas, J.; Esposito, V.; Hocqueloux, L.; Lambert, J.

"Strategies for Behavioral Research in Neurology: Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Applications for the Future","Objective: The study has three aims: 1) highlight challenges of clinical behavioral trials in neurology during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) determine approaches to maximize generalizability of pandemic-era studies, and 3) offer strategies for future successful behavioral trials. Background: Behavioral therapies are safe, effective treatments for many neurological conditions. However, over 20,000 clinical trials have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with high impact on behavioral studies that require increased in-person interactions to deliver the therapeutic intervention. Design/Methods: We reviewed existing literature on clinical trials to evaluate the pandemic's influences upon clinical behavioral studies in neurology, including study design, participant recruitment, demographics, and adherence. Using Pubmed and Google Scholar, we conducted a search of peer-reviewed articles based on the following key terms: â€œpandemic clinical trials,â€ â€œneurology,â€ â€œinequities,â€ and â€œadherence.â€ The review focused on 43 articles published from 2000 to 2021. Results: Common themes surrounding the pandemic's impact are noted in the following statements. Social-distancing guidelines disrupted protocols for behavioral studies, given difficulty shifting from in-person to virtual settings. Traditional routes of recruitment (e.g., brochures) were hindered, whereas digital methods (e.g., social media) were popularized. Transforming trials into virtual settings resulted in the exclusion of some diverse participants without access to required digital tools. Adherence has been affected variably, with increased rates for participants with more flexible schedules versus possible decreased adherence/motivation for those with pandemic-related psychological changes (e.g., depression). onclusions: Future clinical behavioral trials might: 1) broaden recruitment using newly popularized digital techniques, 2) improve trial access for diverse populations, 3) expand protocols to include virtual and in-person participation, 4) increase patient adherence and retention, and 5) incorporate measures to evaluate for mood- and anxiety-related comorbidities into statistical analysis. As these strategies are integrated, more research is needed to devise methods to protect clinical trials from pandemic-related or other disruptions in the future.","Maisha, K.; Minen, M.; Cuneo, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Strategies+for+Behavioral+Research+in+Neurology:+Lessons+Learned+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+and+Applications+for+the+Future","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34877,""

"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Students Interested in Obstetrics and Gynecology","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mental health distress among health care professionals. This study aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical students interested in obstetrics and gynecology at medical schools in two early epicenters of COVID-19. METHODS: This study was approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Board. An online questionnaire was distributed to allopathic medical students in Washington and New York. The survey assessed mental health from March to April 2020 via the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, and questions on self-rated mental health. RESULTS: Out of 1,139 students who completed the survey, 63 reported a plan to pursue residency training in obstetrics and gynecology. Forty-six (74%) reported an overall deterioration in mental health, 34 (59%) reported depressive symptoms, and 38 (65%) reported anxiety symptoms. Seventeen (28%) students met criteria for major depressive disorder and 16 (27%) for anxiety disorder. Twenty-three (37%) reported at least one close contact with symptoms or diagnosis of COVID-19 and 7 (11%) reported at least one close contact with COVID-19-related death. Commonly cited self-care tactics included staying in touch with friends/family (92%), entertainment (81%), and fitness (65%). When compared to the overall population of students, there were no significant differences in responses for students interested in obstetrics and gynecology. CONCLUSION: Students in this study experienced high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Medical trainees are already at an increased risk for depression and anxiety relative to the general population, making it critical for medical schools to understand students' perspectives and prioritize mental health.","Lin, J.; Christophers, B.; Nieblas-Bedolla, E.; Gordon-Elliott, J.

"Impact of Social Distancing during the COVID19 Pandemic on Longitudinal Severity of Depression in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis - A Single Site Analysis","Objective: To determine the impact of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic on the severity of depression in Multiple Sclerosis Patient-Centered Specialty Practice (MS-PCSP) patients at Georgetown University. Background: Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased mental health needs in the U.S.;this impact may be more significant for patients facing stricter isolation due to chronic illnesses, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Design/Methods: This study proposed an addition to the MS-Advance Study;patients seen in MS-PCSP at Georgetown University were screened for depression using the Neuro-QOL and PHQ-9 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This cohort was included in the study sample as baseline data was available for comparison. We interviewed all index survey respondents who completed at least one Neuro-QOL and one PHQ-9 in that study (n=220). Participants verbally completed a Neuro-QOL survey, PHQ-9 survey and a unique COVID-specific questionnaire. A generalized linear mixed model analysis was used to compare the pre- and post-COVID-19 results. Results: Overall, patients had lower cumulative Neuro-QOL scores (anxiety, depression, fatigue) during the July - October 2020 COVID-19 pandemic wave, and these differences were statistically significant (p-value = 0.017, n = 114). For patients who were females, white or ages =55 years, there was a corresponding 4.08, 4.36 and 4.40 unit decrease in Neuro-QOL cumulative score, respectively. When we looked for correlations among variables, we found that there was no significant relationship between history of mood disorders or use of mood stabilizers and PHQ-9/Neuro-QOL scores. Conclusions: In this study, participants presented with a lower severity of depressive symptoms during July - October 2020. This was counterintuitive to what we predicted. We have been able to identify several factors that may explain these results, including decreased burden of travel for work and increased availability of time with family.","Lana, M.; Ahmad, A.; Lewontin, M.; Tornatore, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Social+Distancing+during+the+COVID19+Pandemic+on+Longitudinal+Severity+of+Depression+in+Patients+with+Multiple+Sclerosis+-+A+Single+Site+Analysis","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34880,""
"Changes of neuropsychiatricsymptomsin patients with dementia during COVID-19 crisis: Telephone survey from the Yangcheon Dementia Reassurance Center","Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia during the pandemic through the complete enumeration telephone survey in the caregivers of dementia patients who were registered at the database of Yangcheon Dementia Reassurance Center (YDRC) for Dementia. Background: It has been reported that the social isolation imposed by COVID-19 pandemic can have a major impact on the mental health of dementia patients. Design/Methods: There were a total of 2080 dementia patients on the database of YDRC who were registered as having dementia from 2008 ~2020. From Mar to April in 2021, the telephone survey was conducted in all the caregivers with dementia on the database of YDRC. We asked whether the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients were aggravated during COVID 19 and if they were, which neuropsychiatric symptoms were aggravated among the 12 symptoms of neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI): delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, disturbances of sleep, and disturbances of appetite/eating. Results: Among 2080 patients with dementia (mean age: 81.2 years, 66.8 % females), a total of 1038 caregivers of patients with dementia responded to the telephone survey. Among 1038 patients, 274 patients (26.4%) were reported to have at least one and more aggravating neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depression/dysphoria (44.5 %), disturbances of sleep (9.5 %), and delusion (9.1 %). Conclusions: Given that patients'neuropsychiatric worsening is commonly associated with greater burden of the caregiver's, a more preemptive strategy to manage aggravating the neuropsychiatric symptoms from the Community Dementia Reassurance can help reduce difficulties of caregivers in this pandemic situation.","Kim, S.

"Dizziness After COVID-19 Infections or Vaccinations","Objective: To explore the underlying reasons of dizziness experienced by patients after having the COVID-19 infections or vaccinations. Background: At our dizziness center, we saw a spike of dizziness consults after patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infections or received COVID-19 vaccinations. The symptoms included dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance. This study aims to examine if the infection, vaccination, or antibodies from such could be the reason for the dizziness complaints or if other factors explain patients' dizziness. Design/Methods: Patients were identified using a combination of retrospective chart review to identify patients with diagnoses of dizziness, COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccinations from our database, coupled with referrals from ongoing clinical consultations who we believed to exhibit dizziness symptoms related to their COVID-19 infections or vaccinations within four weeks of dizziness onset. Patients all had brain MRI and extensive vestibular testing, including: VNG, Rotary Chair, audiograms, and consultation with an experienced neuro-otologist. Results: Of the 40 patients examined, 20 began experiencing dizziness after testing positive for COVID-19 and 20 reported dizziness after receiving the vaccines. All patients had brain MRI, but no MRI findings indicated inflammatory changes from infections or antibody reactions. Only five of 40 patients had abnormal VNG indications of uncompensated peripheral vestibulopathy which could be related to virus infections or antibody reactions. Thirty out of 40 patients had histories of anxiety, depression, other mood disorders, or family histories of mood disorders. Based on the clinical history and examinations, along with MRI findings and comprehensive vestibular testing, 75% of the 40 patients had diagnoses of persistent perceptual positional vertigo (PPPV), which was most likely related to patients' underlying anxiety, depression, or mood disorders. Conclusions: We believe that the COVID-19 infections or vaccinations may trigger PPPV as stressors, but mostly not due to the virus infections or its antibody reactions.","Kahn, M.; Stephenson, K.; Cox, J.; Zhang, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dizziness+After+COVID-19+Infections+or+Vaccinations","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34883,""

Recovery to MCS-especially within 8 weeks of injury-is an important prognostic indicator in DoC of other etiologies, but its significance in COVID-19 remains unknown. Design/Methods: All 21 patients were included in a prospectively followed cohort involving telephonic assessment 6 and 12 months after discharge. We examined relationships between recovery to MCS and survival. For patients completing telephone assessments, we report functional outcomes including Barthel Index, extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (E-GOS), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS);and psychological outcomes using Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance inventories. Results: Recovery to MCS within 8 weeks of illness onset-but not later-was associated with 12-month survival (6/8 versus 2/9, p=0.024). Six patients completed both assessments. Of these, 2 were in DoC at 6 months and died by 12 months;1 recovered consciousness after 6 months but remained severely disabled;1 was moderately disabled;and 2 achieved functional independence (Barthel Index 100;E-GOS 5-7;mRS 1-2). Neuro-QOL scores were elevated at 6 but not 12 months. Conclusions: Ten percent (2/21) of our original cohort achieved functional independence by 12 months, demonstrating that recovery is possible after COVID-19-associated DoC. Consistent with the literature on non-COVID DoC, recovery to MCS within 8 weeks of illness onset may be prognostically favorable. Psychological symptoms in this severely ill group were less common than in patients with neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 generally. More work is needed to understand the natural history of long-term recovery from severe COVID-19.","Gurin, L.; Im, B.; Lewis, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Recovery+from+Disorders+of+Consciousness+after+Severe+COVID-19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34884,""
"Associations Between Emotional Resilience and Mental Health Problems in Underserved Pregnant Women","INTRODUCTION: Prenatal distress (ie, depression and anxiety) is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Importantly, emotional resilience has been found to protect women from mental health conditions. The goals of this research were to identify the prevalence of depression and anxiety and to examine relationships between emotional resilience and depression/anxiety in low socioeconomic (LSE) prenatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study adopted a cross-sectional design. We recruited 15 underserved Hispanic women who were aged 18-40 years and had a singleton pregnancy through WIC in California. The validated surveys were used to collect participants' demographics, mental health, and emotional resilience, including Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and Coping Self-Efficacy. The Cronbach's alpha of these surveys ranged from 0.77 to 0.93. Descriptive statistics and partial correlations were conducted using SPSS. RESULTS: Maternal mean age was 26.8 (SD=3.73). Approximately one half of pregnant women (46.7%) had a Bachelor's degree or higher, 20% did not live with the baby's father, and 33.3% indicated having an at-risk pregnancy (e.g., anemia). Appropriately 13.3% of Hispanic pregnant women experienced prenatal depression and/or anxiety. After controlling for maternal education, higher mindfulness was significantly associated with a lower level of anxiety (r= 20.67, P=.009), and greater coping self-efficacy was significantly associated with a lower level of depression (r= 20.54, P=.049). CONCLUSION: It would be critical to improve pregnant women's mental health by increasing their ability to practice mindfulness and confidence to cope with distress.","Guo, Y.; Jimah, T.; Borg, H.; Pimentel, P.; Kehoe, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Associations+Between+Emotional+Resilience+and+Mental+Health+Problems+in+Underserved+Pregnant+Women","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Obstetrics and Gynecology; 139(SUPPL 1):94S, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34885,""
"Prevalence of Postpartum Depression Following the COVID-19 Pandemic at an Urban Academic Institution","INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a complication of pregnancy commonly occurring within the first month of delivery. Numerous risk factors are associated with PPD, including financial stressors, inadequate emotional support, and perceived social isolation. This study evaluated the impact of the implemented social restrictions to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus on the overall prevalence of PPD at an urban academic center. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective cohort study was performed of 1,097 subjects between 1 and 8 weeks postpartum. Group 1, the control group, included 420 women with routine PPD screening prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1-December 31, 2019). Group 2, our case group, included 677 women with routine PPD screening during the pandemic (April 1-December 31, 2020). Both groups completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the prevalence of PPD (defined as having an EPDS score greater than 11) was determined. Postpartum patients following fetal demise were excluded. RESULTS: The prevalence of PPD was higher in postpartum women before the COVID-19 pandemic (13.10%) when compared to postpartum women screened during the pandemic (10.78%). This increased prevalence, however, was not found to be statistically significant (P=.2474). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of PPD before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the downward trend of PPD during the pandemic may be due to quarantine recommendations allowing families/spouses to work from home. The association of PPD and specific social support systems should be evaluated further.","Green, D.; Southern, C.; Sessions, K.; Chen, J.; Ragonetti-Zebell, G.; Green, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+of+Postpartum+Depression+Following+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+at+an+Urban+Academic+Institution","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Obstetrics and Gynecology; 139(SUPPL 1):68S, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34886,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Movement Disorders Patients in the Outpatient Setting","Objective: We sought to determine the emotional impact, stress, and burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on movement disorders patients. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress for the whole population, as it is the only major incidence of a widespread infectious illness that most have experienced in their lifetime. The impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic neurodegenerative disease, including movement disorders, is largely unknown. Design/Methods: Over 4 months (May to August 2021), subjects were asked to fill out a subjective questionnaire that asked whether neurological symptoms, relationships, mental health care, finances, or healthcare delays worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Pandemic Emotional Impact Scale (PEIS). The PEIS is a validated scale designed to measure the emotional impact of a worldwide pandemic. The scale has 16 questions, each of which is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the worst. The two-sample t-test was used to obtain p-values at a=0.05. Results: The cohort had a mean age of 68.0 Â± 10.5 years, with 54% males and 46% females. 62% of subjects had diagnoses of PD, and 38% had either ET, ataxia, or dystonia. The average disease duration for the cohort was 8.80 Â± 9.47 years. The mean PEIS score for the cohort was 32.52 Â± 12.61 (range 16-80). Higher (worse) PEIS scores were significantly associated with â€œpersonal financial lossâ€ (p=0.0077), â€œworsening neurological symptomsâ€ (p=0.0006), â€œstrained relationshipsâ€ (p=0.0021), â€œfriends/family experiencing financial lossâ€ (p=0.0006), â€œfriends/family hospitalizedâ€ (p=0.0178), â€œdelay in healthcareâ€ (p &lt; 0.0001), and â€œmasks impacting healthâ€ (p = 0.0064). Conclusions: Although the emotional burden of COVID-19 was reasonably low in this cohort, patients were affected by financial burden, strained relationships, delays in healthcare, and mask wearing. The mental health and emotional burden of movement disorder patients should be carefully addressed.","Ghanekar, S.; Madhuri, F.; Shub, A.; Lozano, L.; Huang, Y.; Bezchlibnyk, Y.; Smith, D.; Hauser, R.; Mitchell, A.; Zesiewicz, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Movement+Disorders+Patients+in+the+Outpatient+Setting","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34887,""
"Frequency, Persistence, and Patient-reported Outcomes of Neurological Symptomsin Mild COVID-19: Resultsfrom the ALBERTA HOPE COVID-19 Trial","Objective: To examine the natural history of neurological symptoms in mild COVID-19. Background: Various neurological manifestations have been reported with COVID-19, mostly in retrospective studies of hospitalized patients. There are few data on patients with mild COVID19. Design/Methods: Consenting participants in the ALBERTA HOPE COVID-19 trial( NCT04329611, hydroxychloroquine vs placebo for 5-days), managed as outpatients, were prospectively assessed 3-months and 1-year after their positive test. They completed detailed neurological symptom questionnaires, Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment(T-MoCA), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale(K10), and the EQ-5D-3L(quality-of-life). Informants completed the Mild Behavioural Impairment Checklist(MBI-C) and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline(IQCODE). We tracked healthcare utilization and neurological investigations using medical records. Results: Among 198 patients (median age:45, IQR:37-54, 43.9% female);28(14.1%) had preexisting neurological/psychiatric disorders. Among 179 patients with symptom assessments, 139(77.7%) reported =1 neurological symptom, the most common being anosmia/dysgeusia(56.3%), myalgia(42.6%), and headache(41.8%). Symptoms generally began within 1-week of illness(median:6-days, IQR:4-8). Most resolved after 3-months;40 patients(22.3%) reported persistent symptoms at 1-year, with 27(15.1%) reporting no improvement. Persistent symptoms included confusion(50%), headache(52.5%), insomnia(40%), and depression(35%). Body mass index, prior neurologic/psychiatric history, asthma, and lack of full-time employment were associated with presence and persistence of neurological symptoms;only female sex was independently associated on multivariable logistic regression(aOR:5.04, 95%CI:1.58-16.1). Patients with persistent symptoms had more hospitalizations and family physician visits, worse MBI-C scores, and were less often independent for instrumental daily activities at 1-year(77.8% vs 98.2%, p=0.005). Patients with any or persistent neurological symptoms had greater psychological distress defined as K10=20(aOR:21.0, 95%CI:1.96-225) and worse quality-of-life ratings(mean EQ-5D VAS:67.0 vs 82.8, p=0.0002). 50.0% of patients had T-MoCA&lt;18 at 3-months versus 42.9% at 1-year;patients reporting memory complaints were more likely to have informant-reported cognitive-behavioural decline (aOR[1-year IQCODE&gt;3.3]:12.7, 95%CI:1.08-150). Conclusions: Neurological symptoms were commonly reported in survivors of mild COVID-19 and persisted in one in five patients 1-year later. These symptoms were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes.","Ganesh, A.; Rosentreter, R.; Chen, Y.; Mehta, R.; McLeod, G.; Wan, M.; Krett, J.; Mahjoub, Y.; Lee, A.; Schwartz, I.; Metz, L.; Smith, E.

"Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis(CVST) As A Complication Of COVID-19 Infection Presenting As Post COVID-19 Headache","Objective: NA Background: COVID-19 infection has been associated with a state of hypercoagulability. The hypercoagulability typically presents as a Deep Venous thrombus or Pulmonary Embolism but rarely can manifest as CVST even after recovery from the original COVID-19 infection. Case Report: 27-year-old Caucasian female who had a COVID-19 infection 2 weeks prior, presented with 4 days of persistent headaches associated with nausea and vomiting. Patient also had episodes of rightward gaze without loss of awareness. No prior history of seizures. NIHStrokeScale was 0. CT head showed a hyper density within the sylvian fissure and the sulci of the right temporal and right lateral frontal lobes suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH);CTA head showed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis(CVST) involving straight sinus, most of vein of Gale, right transverse and right sigmoid sinuses that was also seen on MR venogram. MRI brain showed illdefined edema in a distribution concerning for venous infarct due to CVST. CTA chest also showed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. EEG showed focal slowing in the right hemisphere and no epileptiform discharges. Patient was started on heparin and transitioned to Dabigatran on discharge. Past medical history was remarkable for Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (s/p ablation), obesity and depression. Patient has no personal or family history of hypercoagulability or malignancy. Patient reported birth control use which she stopped 3 weeks prior to this presentation. Patient stopped cigarette smoking 5 years ago. Patient has a healthy 2.5-year-old son and has no history of miscarriages. Patient was not vaccinated for COVID. Results: NA Conclusions: This is a case of CVST without major classical predisposing factors for CVST however patient had recent COVID-19 infection which should be considered as a potential risk factor for CVST. Considering MR venogram of the head in patients presenting with persistent post-COVID headaches can help identify this potential life threating condition in a timely manner.","Dibs, M.; Sankaraneni, R.

"Professional Exhaustion Syndrome and Depression in Two Cohorts of Medical Residents Before and After the Covid-19 Pandemic","Objective: To compare professional burnout and depression in medical residents of our health institution before and after the pandemic. Background: Medical residencies are one of the most affected sectors within the health system by the COVID-19 pandemic, generating a negative impact on both clinical practice and professional exhaustion, as well as on the emotional aspect. Design/Methods: Observational analytical study conducted through anonymous self-administered questionnaires in two groups of medical residents, differed by 3 years (2018/2021). Demographic data and medical history were collected. In addition to Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI, for professional exhaustion) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II, for depression). Results: 68 residents participated (2018: 31;2021: 37), female (2018: 48%;2021: 62%), with an average age of 27.2 +-2.4 SD (2018);30.2 +-3.3 SD (2021). In 2021 there was a reduction in elderly residents' participation (2018/2021: PGY1 22.6%/18.9%, PGY2 22.6%/10.8%, PY3 35.5%/24.3%, PGY4 19.4%/45.9%). In 2018 no one reported insomnia neither chronic drug and/or alcohol abuse, in 2021 27% reported insomnia (p=0.02) and 8.1% abuse. Slept hours in the last 72 hours were 13.6 +- 4.1 SD in 2018 and 16.5 +-5.4 SD in 2021. Severe and extreme depression scored by BDI-II were a new finding this year (2018/2021: Normal 51.6%/16.2%, mild mood disturbance 25.8%/29.7%, mild depression 12.9%/21.6%, moderate depression 9.7%/10.8%, severe depression 0%/13.5% and extreme depression 0%/8.1%). In 2021 greater emotional exhaustion and lack of personal fulfillment were observed compared to 2018, but no depersonalization or burnout criteria were made when answered BDI-II (2018/2021: Normal 51.6%/16.2%, mild mood disturbance 25.8%/29.7%, mild depression 12.9%/21.6%, moderate depression 9.7%/10.8%, severe depression 0%/13.5% and extreme depression 0%/8.1%). Conclusions: In our medical residents an increased level of depression was observed in 2021 compared to 2018. The pandemic working overload probably exacerbated bad working conditions. It is important to improve the quality of life and work of doctors in training.","Diaz, C. F. B.; Pszenyckyj, J.; Appiani, F.; Micucci, D.; Vazquez, G.; Claverie, C.

"Atypical Presentation of Lance Adams Syndrome in the setting of Clonazepam overdose and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia","Objective: To report an atypical presentation of Lance-Adams Syndrome presenting from severe respiratory depression rather than cardiac arrest and to highlight the importance of distinguishing it from post hypoxic myoclonic variants. Background: Clinicians often face difficulty distinguishing Lance-Adams Syndrome (LAS) from Myoclonic Status Epilepticus (MSE). Similarities between the two conditions frequently result in confusion when diagnosing, managing and prognosticating for post-hypoxic myoclonus patients. Design/Methods: A 23-year-old male with a history pertinent for Hemophilia B, depression, opiate and alcohol abuse and chronic pain was found down in his home next to an empty bottle of clonazepam. He was hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 40s and intubated in the field. Upon arrival to the Emergency room, neurological examination revealed intact corneal reflexes but no gag reflex, cough, or purposeful movements of the extremities. The patient exhibited stimulus induced myoclonic jerking which lasted &gt;30 minutes despite being loaded on valproic acid and levetiracetam. Jerking subsequently ceased with propofol drip. Chest X-ray confirmed interstitial opacities and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. On attempting to wean sedation, patient exhibited full-body myoclonus including face and palate with inability to follow commands and lack of spontaneous movements. As the EEG showed BIPEDS greater than 2.5 HZ, we decided to burst suppress him and treat with targeted temperature management. After 10 days, the patient was successfully weaned from sedation and extubated, but remained on multiple anti-seizure medications. Results: Patient responded well despite his diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. He regained the ability to follow commands upon discharge but had residual moderate expressive aphasia and post-hypoxic action-induced myoclonus, consistent with LAS. Conclusions: The atypical presentation of this case emphasizes the importance of distinguishing LAS from MSE to guide neurologists to aggressively treat LAS to improve outcome, particularly since MSE historically results with a 90-100% mortality rate.","Culpepper, K.; Terpak, L.; Cruz-Saavedra, L.; Krishnaiengar, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Atypical+Presentation+of+Lance+Adams+Syndrome+in+the+setting+of+Clonazepam+overdose+and+SARS-CoV-2+pneumonia","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34891,""
"Impact of the coronavirus SARS COV-2 (COVID19) pandemic on the quality of life and mood of patients with multiple sclerosis","Objective: Our objective was to assess the level of depression and HRQoL of MS patients and compare it with the 2019 pre-pandemic assessment. Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disabling chronic disease with clinical heterogeneity and uncertain prognosis. Evaluating the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients is important for the multidisciplinary therapeutic approach including physical, psychic and social aspects that influence the well-being of people with consequences in the course of the disease. As of March 2020 due to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and quarantine measures, habits and access to the health system have been substantially modified. Design/Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A virtual survey assessed HRQoL with the â€œMultiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life questionnaireâ€ (MusiQol), depression with the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and pandemic-related aspects using a questionnaire designed for this study. The results of MusiQol and BDI-II were compared with those obtained from the 2019 evaluations. Results: We evaluated 62 patients. In the comparative analysis with 2019, a significant decrease in HRQoL was observed (z=-2.21, p=0.03). The affected domains were activities of daily living, psychological well-being, and sexual and sentimental life. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the assessment of depression using BDI-II (z=-0.39, p=0.69). Conclusions: HrQoL of MS patients is decreased compared to 2019. The pandemic itself, health and quarantine measures have negatively impacted HRQoL, substantially impairing patients' performance in activities of daily living, psychological well-being, and sexual and sentimental life.","Cohen, L.; Alonso, R.; Silva, B.; Pita, C.; Ciufia, N.; Garcea, O.; Eizaguirre, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+the+coronavirus+SARS+COV-2+(COVID19)+pandemic+on+the+quality+of+life+and+mood+of+patients+with+multiple+sclerosis","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34892,""

The BICSTaR population has a high baseline prevalence of comorbidities (particularly neuropsychiatric). PROs were prospectively collected. Materials and Methods: One hundred eighty TN/955 TE participants were considered for the 12M analysis (cut-off Feb 2021, including people enrolled from Jun 2018 to Sept 2020, i.e. partially during the COVID- 19 pandemic). PRO measures: Adherence [visual analogue scale (VAS)];physical/mental health [short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire: Aggregated physical/mental component summary (PCS/MCS) scores;HIV-symptom index (HIV-SI;symptoms dichotomised into bothersome/not bothersome);HIV treatment satisfaction questionnaire (HIVTSQ;TE only);physician visits. VAS/SF-36/HIV-SI: Analysis population restricted to participants with questionnaires completed at both baseline/12M. SF-36/HIV-SI/HIVTSQ were described for participants with/without prior/ongoing neuropsychiatric comorbidities (TE only as TN subgroup was small). Results: Adherence to treatment was high at baseline (TE) and was maintained at 12M after switch to B/F/TAF [Table 1 (T1)]. Statistically significant improvements in PCS/MCS scores were observed in TN participants at 12M (p&lt;0.05);scores remained stable in TE participants (Figure 1). The medyan (Q1, Q3) number of bothersome symptoms in TN participants declined from 6 (2, 9) at baseline to 2 (0, 6) at 12M (p&lt;0.001;T1);TE, no change in absolute count. Statistically significant reductions in the frequency of several bothersome symptoms were reported in TN participants (p&lt;0.05) (TE: No statistically significant changes).

"The Burden of Maternal Mental Health During COVID-19: Impact Analysis Through Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders Screening","INTRODUCTION: The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends screening for depression and anxiety at least once during the perinatal period and again during postpartum checks. The delivery of validated screening tools varies amongst institutions and individual obstetricians. The objectives of this study were to assess our institution's baseline screening rates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health. METHODS: Our patient population was pregnant and postpartum patients at Carilion Clinic from January 2019 to July 2020. Data collected from medical records included scores of the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Screening (EPDS), Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 2 and 9, demographics, and psychiatric history. Screening rates and incidence of mood disorders were compared between pre- and intra-COVID-19 cohorts. RESULTS: Of the 850 women included, 43.5% (n=370) were screened during perinatal visits and 49.8% (n=424) postpartum. Screenings were completed more frequently during postpartum checks pre-COVID-19 compared to during the pandemic with PHQ-2 (27.4% vs. 16.1%, P=.0001) and PHQ-9 (10.3% vs. 5.4%, P=.011). More women screened positive for depression at perinatal checks during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (13.2% vs. 4.7%, P=.0377). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected rates of maternal depression screening and has significant mental health impacts on this population. This study reveals baseline rates of screening in perinatal and postpartum visits at our institution, which is critical to delivery of quality care.

"Calming Effect of Clinically Designed Improvisatory Music for Patients Admitted to Epilepsy Monitoring Unit during COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of Clinically Designed Improvisatory Music (CDIM) to induce calmness and stress relief in patients admitted to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU). Background: Epilepsy monitoring requires simulating seizure-inducing conditions which frequently causes discomfort to EMU patients. COVID-19 hospital restrictions added another layer of stress upon hospital admission. The purpose of this research was to provide evidence that CDIM brings relief to EMU patients. Design/Methods: Five individuals with epileptic seizures in the EMU during the COVID-19 lockdown participated in the study (average age+ SD=30.2 + 6). Continuous video EEG and heart tracing were obtained before, during, and after live CDIM. CDIM consisted of 40 minutes of virtual calming music played by a music practitioner on viola. Post-intervention surveys assessed patients' emotional state. Alpha/beta power spectral density ratio was calculated for each subject across the brain and was evaluated using one-way repeated analysis of variance, comparing 20 minutes before, during, and 20 minutes after CDIM. Post-hoc analysis was performed using paired t-test. Results: Patients reported enhanced emotional state (9.25/10), contentment (9.5/10), and decreased restlessness (8.75/10) on a 10-point Likert scale. Compared to baseline, all experienced decreases in heart rate during CDIM. Alpha/beta ratio increased at whole-brain and regional levels during CDIM and persisted post-intervention. There was a significant main effect of CDIM on alpha/beta ratio (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Consistent with investigations in patients with depression and anxiety, we found positive effects of music as reported by patients, a decrease in heart rate, an increased alpha/beta ratio due to calming effect in response to CDIM. These effects persisted for at least 20 minutes post-intervention. Our study provides proof of concept that live CDIM provided demonstrable comfort for patients admitted in the EMU during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bonakdarpour, B.; Zhou, G.; Huang, D.; Zelano, C.; Takarabe, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Calming+Effect+of+Clinically+Designed+Improvisatory+Music+for+Patients+Admitted+to+Epilepsy+Monitoring+Unit+during+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34895,""
"Functional Tic Disordersin Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: To investigate whether the prevalence of functional tic disorders in children increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify clinical features consistent with functional versus organic tic disorders. Background: Functional neurologic disorders are increasingly recognized in the pediatric population, with prior case series suggesting a higher prevalence during times of societal stress or trauma. Of the functional movement disorders, tics are uncommonly reported. Design/Methods: This retrospective study included all new outpatient encounters in the MGH Tic Disorders Clinic where children ages 9-17 were given an ICD-10 diagnosis of Functional Movement Disorder or Tic Disorder NOS during the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the 18 months preceding the pandemic. Individual cases were excluded if on chart review the presentation was not supportive of the diagnosis of a functional tic disorder. Patient demographics, a description of the reported tics, and clinical course were extracted from the medical record. Results: In the 18 months preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and in the subsequent 18 months, there were 190 and 168 new presentations for tic disorders, respectively. The percentage of these patients diagnosed with functional tic disorders nearly doubled from 11% to 21% during the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison to patients with organic tic disorders, patients with functional tic disorders had an older age of onset, were more often female, and more frequently presented with complex motor and/or vocal tics at onset. Conclusions: There was a marked increase in pediatric patients presenting with functional tic disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the equivalent pre-pandemic time period. Societal stress impacting individual mental health as well as increased utilization of social media are likely contributory. Continued data collection post-pandemic may further clarify the role of social media in pediatric functional tic disorder presentations.","Armstrong-Javors, A.; Dy-Hollins, M.; Realbuto, E.; Scharf, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Functional+Tic+Disordersin+Children+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology; 98(18 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34896,""
"Strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and youth well-being: a scoping review protocol","Children and youth are often more vulnerable than adults to emotional impacts of trauma. Wide-ranging negative effects (eg, social isolation, lack of physical activity) of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and youth are well established. This scoping review will identify, describe and categorise strategies taken to mitigate potentially deleterious impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children, youth and their families. We will conduct a scoping review following the Arksey-O'Malley five-stage scoping review method and the Scoping Review Methods Manual by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Well-being will be operationalised according to pre-established domains (health and nutrition, connectedness, safety and support, learning and competence, and agency and resilience). Articles in all languages for this review will be identified in CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, ERIC, Education Research Complete, MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO. The search strategy will be restricted to articles published on or after 1 December 2019. We will include primary empirical and non-empirical methodologies, excluding protocols, reports, opinions and editorials, to identify new data for a broad range of strategies to mitigate potentially deleterious impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and youth well-being. Two reviewers will calibrate screening criteria and the data abstraction form and will independently screen records and abstract data. Data synthesis will be performed according to the convergent integrated approach described by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Ethical approval is not applicable as this review will be conducted on published data. Findings of this study will be disseminated at national and international conferences and will inform our pan-Canadian multidisciplinary team of researchers, public, health professionals and knowledge users to codesign and pilot test a digital psychoeducational health tool-an interactive, web-based tool to help Canadian youth and their families address poor mental well-being resulting from and persisting beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Moss, Lorenzetti, FitzGerald, Smith, Harley, Tutelman, Birnie, Mizen, Anglin, Stelfox, Fiest, Parsons Leigh","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062413","20220725","COVID-19; child &amp; adolescent psychiatry; community child health; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34897,""
"Impact of biosecurity measures, social pressure and bullying on attitudes, perceptions, and job satisfaction levels among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","The extent and nature of social pressure and bullying towards healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 remains unclear. The following study identifies the effect of social pressure and bullying directed towards HCWs when using biosecurity measures during the COVID-19 pandemic; further, the impact on perceptions, attitudes and job satisfaction level is also explored. We conducted a cross-sectional survey-based study among 684 Ecuadorian HCWs. The survey consisted of 38 questions related to the frequency, attitudes, and perceptions of biosecurity measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to assess the validity of the questionnaire. Associations between variables were analysed using Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> and Fisher's exact test. Using SPSS V.25, qualitative and quantitative data were analysed. Of the 684 participants, 175 (25.59%) experienced or felt bullying or social pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with the use of biosecurity measures. Of these, 40.6% believed it was due to an imbalance of power in the workplace. The perception that HCWs wearing personal protective equipment resulting in bullying was noted in 12% of the respondents. Job satisfaction was positive among 73% of the respondents. Gender (female) and type of institution (public) were noted to contribute towards job satisfaction and bullying experiences. Exposure to social bullying and pressure due to the use of biosecurity measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in reduced job satisfaction and thoughts about quitting work.","Sarfraz, Sarfraz, Camacho-Leon, Alvarado-Villa, Andrade-Molina, Fernandez-Cadena, Agolli, Yukselen, Felix, Gallardo Bastidas, Espinoza-Fuentes, Michel, Cherrez-Ojeda","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056952","20220725","COVID-19; health &amp; safety; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34898,""
"Testing positive, losing a loved one, and financial hardship: Real-world impacts of COVID-19 on US college student distress","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a particularly heavy toll on U.S. college students. In addition to facing academic-related stress and social pressures, these individuals are now increasingly susceptible to experiences such as contracting the virus, losing loved ones to COVID-19, or facing financial hardship due to the pandemic. The effects of such personal, pandemic-related experiences on young adult mental health - and the inherent racial disparities within these outcomes - remain largely understudied. We analyzed 65,568 undergraduate students from the Spring 2021 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA). The rates of the aforementioned COVID-19-related stressors were unevenly distributed across racial groups. A logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of moderate and serious psychological distress revealed that participants who had experienced the death of a loved one had 1.14 times greater odds of developing psychological distress (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001). Those who experienced financial hardship had an odds ratio of 1.78 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001). Surprisingly, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with an odds ratio of 0.82 of psychological distress (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001). Self-reported measures are susceptible to recall bias and misinterpretation. Exposure and outcome variables were measured simultaneously in this cross-sectional study which limits inference on causality. Financial burdens and bereavement are especially impactful stressors among college students during the pandemic, whereas contracting COVID-19 seemingly exhibits less impact on distress levels. When addressing student wellbeing, institutions should consider prioritizing the implementation of resources to support individuals affected by pandemic-related financial and familial losses.","ElTohamy, Hyun, Macaranas, Chen, Stevens, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.022","20220725","Bereavement; Depression; Kessler; Mental health; Racial minority; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34899,""
"Perceived mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: The roles of social support and social engagement for working age adults in the United States","In this paper we assess if two protective mechanisms for mental health - social support and social engagement - are associated with lower risk of reporting worsening mental health as a result of the pandemic. Using a demographically representative sample of working age adults in the United States (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4014) collected in February and March of 2021, we use logistic regression models to predict self-reported worsening mental health as a result of the pandemic using social support - measured as instrumental and emotional support - and social engagement. We use additional stratified models to determine if these relationships are consistent across rural-urban areas. Results indicate that among urban working age adults, emotional support, high levels of instrumental support, and some types of social engagement were associated with significantly lower risk of worsening mental health. However, among rural working age adults, only emotional support and high levels of instrumental support were significantly associated with lower odds of worsening mental health. Findings suggest that while emotional support may be effective for working age adults in lowering risk of worsening mental health from the pandemic, social engagement may not be for rural residents. The results support use of mental health promotion and prevention approaches that bolster emotional support through familial and local social networks, and raises caution about the efficacy of social engagement approaches in rural contexts.","Rhubart, Kowalkowski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107171","20220725","COVID-19; Mental health; Rural-urban; Social engagement; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34900,""
"Telehealth Strategies for the Delivery of Maternal Health Care : A Rapid Review","Telehealth strategies to supplement or replace in-person maternity care may affect maternal health outcomes. To conduct a rapid review of the effectiveness and harms of telehealth strategies for maternal health care given the recent expansion of telehealth arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to produce an evidence map. Systematic searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus for English-language studies (January 2015 to April 2022). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of maternal care telehealth strategies versus usual care. Dual data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment of studies, with disagreements resolved through consensus. 28 RCTs and 14 observational studies (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â = 44Ã‚Â 894) were included. Maternal telehealth interventions supplemented in-person care for most studies of mental health and diabetes during pregnancy, primarily resulting in similar, and sometimes better, clinical and patient-reported outcomes versus usual care. Supplementing in-person mental health care with phone- or web-based platforms or mobile applications resulted in similar or better mental health outcomes versus in-person care. A reduced-visit prenatal care schedule using telehealth to replace in-person general maternity care for low-risk pregnancies resulted in similar clinical outcomes and higher patient satisfaction versus usual care. Overall, telehealth strategies were heterogeneous and resulted in similar obstetric and patient satisfaction outcomes. Few studies addressed disparities, health equity, or harms. Interventions varied, and evidence was inadequate for some clinical outcomes. Replacing or supplementing in-person maternal care with telehealth generally results in similar, and sometimes better, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction compared with in-person care.

"An observational report of screen time use among young adults (ages 18-28) during the COVID-19 pandemic and correlations with mental health and wellness: An international online cross-sectional study","Screen time (ST) use during the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically risen, but there is little research on the specific type of ST use, degree of change compared to before COVID-19, and associations it may have with other factors. Young adults are a particular interest since previous studies show the detriment ST has on a young person's health. With the combination of a life-changing pandemic, there are depths left unreached regarding ST and young adults, and this study aims to provide insight onto these unknowns. To assess ST in three domains (entertainment, social media (SM), and educational/professional) in young adults early in the COVID-19 pandemic, identify trends, and any correlations with demographics, mental health, substance abuse, and overall wellness. An online, cross-sectional observational study was performed from September 2020-January 2021 with 183 eligible respondents. Data was collected on ST, trauma from COVID-19, anxiety, depression, substance use, BMI, and sleep. The average total ST during COVID-19 was 23.26 hours/week, entertainment was 7.98 hours, SM was 6.79 hours/week, and educational/professional purposes was 8.49 hours/week. For all categories, the average ST during COVID-19 was higher than before, P&lt;.001 . We found ST differences between genders, student status, and the continent of location. Increased wellbeing scores during COVID-19 was correlated with greater change of total ST (P=.011). Poorer sleep quality (P=.011) and longer sleep duration (P=.028) were associated with a greater change in entertainment ST (P=.011). More severe depression was associated with the amount of entertainment ST (P=.047) and greater percent change in SM (P=.007). This was also seen for more severe anxiety, P=.026 and P=.002, respectively. Greater stress from COVID-19 was associated with the amount of ST for educational/professional (P=.05), change in total ST (P=.006), change in entertainment ST (P=.011), and change for educational/professional (P=.023). Higher ASSIST tobacco scores were associated with greater change of total ST (P=.004) and higher pack years were associated with greater change in SM ST (P=.003). Lastly, higher alcohol scores (P=.004) and servings of alcohol per week (P=.003) were associated with greater change in entertainment ST. We did not find quarantining negatively impacted these dependent variables. There is no doubt ST and worsening mental health increased during COVID-19 in young adults. However, these findings indicate there are many significant associations between ST use and mental health, and is more complex than originally thought, especially since we found quarantining is not associated with mental health in our sample size. Although there are other factors that need to be further investigated, this study emphasizes different types of ST and degree of change in ST affect various groups of people in discrete ways and acknowledging these findings can help young adults optimize their mental health during pandemics.","Wiciak, Shazley, Santhosh","https://doi.org/10.2196/38370","20220725","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34902,""
"Mental health among university employees during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of previous life trauma and current posttraumatic stress symptoms","Previous studies indicated that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has harmed the mental health of diverse samples. Adopting a trauma lens with a sample of university faculty and staff, this study examined risk conferred by previous exposure to traumatic life events (TLE) on pandemic-related mental health harm (MHH) and stress and the mediating influence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. In Spring 2021, employees (<i>N</i> = 641) of a public university in the United States completed an online cross-sectional survey, including validated scales of TLE and PTSD and single-item measures of MHH and stress taken from published COVID-19 studies. A structural probit model was used to estimate: (a) direct effects of cumulative TLE on PTSD, MHH, and stress; and (b) indirect effects of cumulative TLE via PTSD adjusting for age. Gender was tested as a moderating influence. Nearly 36% of the sample reported positive PTSD screens along with high levels of MHH (22.5%) and stress (42.3%). Cumulative TLE was significantly and positively associated with MHH and stress. Both genders experienced a negative impact on mental health and stress either fully or partially through PTSD symptoms; however, the gender by trauma interaction term was not significant. As age decreased, PTSD and MHH increased. Results suggest that PTSD symptoms play a crucial role in the experience of MHH and stress during the pandemic for those who endured previous trauma. Implications for employer policies, public health messaging, and mental health services are explored.

"Developing, Implementing, and Evaluating an Artificial Intelligence-Guided Mental Health Resource Navigation Chatbot for Health Care Workers and Their Families During and Following the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Cross-sectional Study","Approximately 1 in 3 Canadians will experience an addiction or mental health challenge at some point in their lifetime. Unfortunately, there are multiple barriers to accessing mental health care, including system fragmentation, episodic care, long wait times, and insufficient support for health system navigation. In addition, stigma may further reduce an individual's likelihood of seeking support. Digital technologies present new and exciting opportunities to bridge significant gaps in mental health care service provision, reduce barriers pertaining to stigma, and improve health outcomes for patients and mental health system integration and efficiency. Chatbots (ie, software systems that use artificial intelligence to carry out conversations with people) may be explored to support those in need of information or access to services and present the opportunity to address gaps in traditional, fragmented, or episodic mental health system structures on demand with personalized attention. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated even further the need for mental health support among Canadians and called attention to the inefficiencies of our system. As health care workers and their families are at an even greater risk of mental illness and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, this technology will be first piloted with the goal of supporting this vulnerable group. This pilot study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Mental Health Intelligent Information Resource Assistant in supporting health care workers and their families in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Nova Scotia with the provision of appropriate information on mental health issues, services, and programs based on personalized needs. The effectiveness of the technology will be assessed via voluntary follow-up surveys and an analysis of client interactions and engagement with the chatbot. Client satisfaction with the chatbot will also be assessed. This project was initiated on April 1, 2021. Ethics approval was granted on August 12, 2021, by the University of Alberta Health Research Board (PRO00109148) and on April 21, 2022, by the Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board (1027474). Data collection is anticipated to take place from May 2, 2022, to May 2, 2023. Publication of preliminary results will be sought in spring or summer 2022, with a more comprehensive evaluation completed by spring 2023 following the collection of a larger data set. Our findings can be incorporated into public policy and planning around mental health system navigation by Canadian mental health care providers-from large public health authorities to small community-based, not-for-profit organizations. This may serve to support the development of an additional touch point, or point of entry, for individuals to access the appropriate services or care when they need them, wherever they are.

"Effect of a Comprehensive Telehealth Intervention vs Telemonitoring and Care Coordination in Patients With Persistently Poor Type 2 Diabetes Control: A Randomized Clinical Trial","Persistently poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (PPDM) is common and causes poor outcomes. Comprehensive telehealth interventions could help address PPDM, but effectiveness is uncertain, and barriers impede use in clinical practice. To address evidence gaps preventing use of comprehensive telehealth for PPDM by comparing a practical, comprehensive telehealth intervention to a simpler telehealth approach. This active-comparator, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2 Veterans Affairs health care systems. From December 2018 to January 2020, 1128 outpatients with PPDM were assessed for eligibility and 200 were randomized; PPDM was defined as maintenance of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.5% or higher for 1 year or longer despite engagement with clinic-based primary care and/or diabetes specialty care. Data analyses were preformed between March 2021 and May 2022. Each 12-month intervention was nurse-delivered and used only clinical staffing/resources. The comprehensive telehealth group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°101) received telemonitoring, self-management support, diet/activity support, medication management, and depression support. Patients assigned to the simpler intervention (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°99) received telemonitoring and care coordination. Primary (HbA1c) and secondary outcomes (diabetes distress, diabetes self-care, self-efficacy, body mass index, depression symptoms) were analyzed over 12 months using intent-to-treat linear mixed longitudinal models. Sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation and inclusion of clinical data examined the impact of missing HbA1c measurements. Adverse events and intervention costs were examined. The population (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200) had a mean (SD) age of 57.8 (8.2) years; 45 (22.5%) were women, 144 (72.0%) were of Black race, and 11 (5.5%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. From baseline to 12 months, HbA1c change was -1.59% (10.17% to 8.58%) in the comprehensive telehealth group and -0.98% (10.17% to 9.19%) in the telemonitoring/care coordination group, for an estimated mean difference of -0.61% (95% CI, -1.12% to -0.11%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. At 12 months, patients receiving comprehensive telehealth had significantly greater improvements in diabetes distress, diabetes self-care, and self-efficacy; no differences in body mass index or depression were seen. Adverse events were similar between groups. Comprehensive telehealth cost an additional $1519 per patient per year to deliver. This randomized clinical trial found that compared with telemonitoring/care coordination, comprehensive telehealth improved multiple outcomes in patients with PPDM at a reasonable additional cost. This study supports consideration of comprehensive telehealth implementation for PPDM in systems with appropriate infrastructure and may enhance the value of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Participants completed a post-intervention survey (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41) on experiences and preferred intervention delivery modality, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Impact Survey (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50) and provided open-ended feedback about the intervention (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27). Intervention process data included attendance, modality, and withdrawals. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inductive content analyses. Of 71 intervention participants, 6 (8%) withdrew before session 1. Completers adhered to intervention timeline better than withdrawals. Participants liked the in-person interaction, efficient coach support, accountability of in-person and Zoom vs. phone sessions and the flexibility and convenience of phone and Zoom vs. in-person sessions. A majority of participants reported experiencing pandemic impacts such as heightened emotional distress, decreased activity engagement, poorer eating behaviors and being unable to meet basic needs. Participants deviating from intervention timelines may be re-engaged by targeted outreach attempts. Videoconference has the potential for providing as-needed coaching. Future interventions may be optimized to account for and address areas impacted by the pandemic. Findings revealed specific strategies that can be implemented in future interventions to improve emotional and physical health among diverse populations.","Ronneberg, Lv, Ajilore, Gerber, Venditti, Snowden, Steinman, Wittels, Barve, Dosala, Rosas, Kringle, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1093/her/cyac017","20220725","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34907,""
"COVID-19-related fear, stress and depression in school principals: impacts of symptoms like COVID-19, information confusion, health-related activity limitations, working hours, sense of coherence and health literacy","School principals have been reported to have a higher prevalence of burnout and psychological problems than their colleagues. During the pandemic, extra workload and pressure from unprecedented situations potentially cause fear, stress and depression. Therefore, we aimed to explore associated factors of stress, fear of COVID-19 (F-CoV-19S) and depressive symptoms among school principals. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Taiwan from 23 June to 16 July 2021. Data of 413 school principals were collected, including socio-demographic factors, COVID-19-related factors, work-related information, health status, sense of coherence (SoC), health literacy (HL), F-CoV-19S, stress and depression. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were utilized to explore associations. School principals with symptoms like COVID-19 (S-COVID-19-S), or with health-related activity limitations had a higher score of stress (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.92; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.039) (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.52; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and a higher depression likelihood (OR = 3.38; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) (OR = 3.06; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), whereas those with a better SoC had a lower stress score (B = -1.39; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and a lower depression likelihood (OR = 0.76; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.020). School principals confusing about COVID-19-related information had a higher score of stress (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.47; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and fear (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.77; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The longer working time was associated with a higher fear score (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.69; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.006). Additionally, school principals with a higher HL score had a lower stress score (B = -1.76; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), a lower fear score (B = -1.85; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and a lower depression likelihood (OR = 0.53; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.043). Health-related activity limitations, S-COVID-19-S, COVID-19-related information confusion and longer working hours were positively associated with at least one mental health problem (e.g. stress, fear and depression), whereas better SoC and HL showed the benefits to mitigate fear, stress and depressive symptoms in school principals. Our study provides evidence for appropriate strategies to improve principals' mental health during the pandemic.Key messages:School principals with health-related activity limitations or with symptoms like COVID-19 were more likely to be stressed and depressed.Higher levels of stress and fear were observed in school principals who confused about COVID-19-related information, and who had longer working time than before the pandemic.Better sense of coherence and higher health literacy could potentially mitigate the fear, stress and depressive symptoms in school principals.","Duong, Nguyen, Lai, Chen, Dadaczynski, Okan, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2101688","20220725","COVID-19; Stress; depression; fear; health literacy; health-related activity limitations; information confusion; school principals; sense of coherence; working hours","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34908,""
"Association between co-residence and loneliness during COVID-19 among sexual minority people in Hong Kong","Research has identified that loneliness during COVID-19 is associated with co-residence status, and individuals living alone were more likely to report loneliness. However, it may not apply to sexual minority people as those living with their family may experience different sexual orientation-related stressors. This study aims to (1) understand the pattern of living arrangement and loneliness among sexual minority people during COVID-19, (2) examine parental acceptance, family conflict and loneliness among sexual minority people with different living arrangements and (3) investigate the association between parental acceptance and loneliness among sexual minority people with different living arrangements during COVID-19. An online survey with 1,457 Hong Kong sexual minority people was conducted. Sexual minority people living with their partner(s) were less likely to report loneliness. Concurrently, those living with their parent(s) showed a similar level of loneliness as those who lived alone. Living with parent(s) during COVID-19 does not necessarily alleviate feelings of loneliness among them, which we argue may be due to parental unacceptance of their sexual orientation. Nearly half of the respondents stated that their parent(s) were unaccepting of their sexual orientation and 41.8% of them indicated an increase in family conflict during COVID-19. For those living with their parent(s), parental unacceptance is related to more family conflict during COVID-19, which in turn is associated with higher levels of loneliness. Not living with unaccepting parents may reduce family conflict and feelings of loneliness, but this has not been the case for many respondents from a city with high population density and cost of living. Social and mental health service providers need to come up with timely and appropriate interventions to address the unique needs faced by sexual minority people during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Suen, Chan, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221110435","20220725","COVID-19; Hong Kong; gay and bisexual; lesbian; loneliness; sexual minorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34909,""
"Perceived Emotional Impact of COVID-19 and Depressive Symptoms among Male Same-Sex Chilean Couples: Direct and Indirect Dyadic Associations through Relationship Satisfaction","Stressors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic can spill over into the quality of couple relationships, with negative consequences on mental health. The mental health impact of COVID-19 might be particularly pronounced in disadvantaged populations such as LGBT people. This study aimed to examine direct and indirect dyadic associations between emotional impact of COVID-19 and depressive symptoms through relationship satisfaction in male same-sex couples. Using a cross-sectional design, 158 male same-sex Chilean couples completed self-report measures of the emotional impact of COVID-19, relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms. We used the actor-partner interdependence mediation model for indistinguishable dyads to explore the direct and indirect dyadic associations. Results indicated that each partner's perceived emotional impact of COVID-19 was associated with his own higher depressive symptoms directly and indirectly, through his own lower relationship satisfaction. The other partner's perceived emotional impact of COVID-19 was associated with one's own higher depressive symptoms only directly. Our findings reinforce the notion that satisfactory couple relationships can act as a protective factor against depression in the LGBT population. Programs to promote adaptive coping strategies to deal with the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have beneficial effects for the emotional adjustment of male same-sex couples, also by promoting relationship satisfaction.","GuzmÃƒÂ¡n-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Barrientos, Garrido, Bahamondes, GÃƒÂ³mez, Espinoza-Tapia, Casu","https://doi.org/10.1080/0092623X.2022.2098214","20220725","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34910,""
"Adversity, social support and risk of self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic","Little is known about the degree to which social factors interact with COVID-19-related adversity to increase the risk of self-harm thoughts and behaviours. Using data derived from a UK cohort study, Paul &amp; Fancourt found that loneliness was associated with an increase in the odds of self-harm thoughts and behaviours, whereas high-quality social support protected against self-harm thoughts and behaviours. The authors concluded that it is the quality of social support and interactions, rather than the act of engaging in social interaction per se, that protects against self-harm in the context of adversity. The COVID-19 pandemic may exert longer-lasting effects on population mental health, and continued surveillance of mental health, including self-harm status, will be essential. If accompanied by appropriate measures of the availability and quality of social support, such monitoring could also inform the development of more effective adaptive interventions for those at risk of engaging in self-harm.","Borschmann, Moran","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.553","20220725","COVID-19; Self-harm; adversity; loneliness; social deprivation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34911,""
"Resilience, perceived social support and professional quality of life among medical social workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Mainland China: A cross-sectional survey","As COVID-19 rapidly overwhelmed the world in 2020, medical social workers have fought against the disease on the front lines as a member of medical teams, but little is known about the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. This study investigated the resilience, perceived social support and professional quality of life of medical social workers in Mainland China under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire survey was applied to 319 respondents and the results showed that informal support was positively related with compassion satisfaction (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.67, p &lt;Ã‚Â .01) and negatively correlated with job burnout (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.51, p &lt;Ã‚Â .01) while formal support was positively associated with compassion satisfaction (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.61, p &lt;Ã‚Â .01) and negatively associated with job burnout (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.44. p &lt;Ã‚Â .01).

"Relationship between fear of COVID-19 and premenstrual syndrome in Turkish university students","Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been reported to be related to psychological distress. The COVID-19 pandemic has globally caused heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and fear. There is no sufficient evidence regarding the impact of the fear of COVID-19 on PMS and related symptoms. Therefore, this study examined the association of the fear of COVID-19 with PMS among Turkish university students. The sample of this cross-sectional study consisted of 829 Turkish university students. Data were collected online using the Questionnaire Form, the Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCoV-19S). The prevalence of PMS was 73 percent. The most common symptoms were fatigue, irritability, appetite changes, and depression. Participants had a moderate fear of COVID-19 (mean FCoV-19S: 20.48Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.96). Most participants stated that the pandemic did not affect the menstrual cycle length (72.5 percent) and bleeding (79.6 percent). Participants who noted that the pandemic impacted the length of their menstrual cycles and bleeding had a significantly higher mean FCoV-19S score than those who did not (<i>p =</i> .000). Moreover, FCoV-19S scores were positively correlated with PMS scores, PMS-related discomfort, and dysmenorrhea VAS scores (<i>p &lt;</i> .001).

"Health care workers' mental health in the face of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Healthcare workers are leading the way in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the high levels of psychological stress, this group is more likely to experience psychological issues. These psychological problems in healthcare providers include depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to find out how common these problems were in the face of COVID-19. On 20 February 2022, systematic searches were conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science and ProQuest databases. Two authors selected articles based on search keywords. As a last step, articles about the prevalence of psychological problems among healthcare workers in the face of COVID-19 were looked at and analysed for five different outcomes. The initial search yielded 18,609 articles. After reviewing the titles, abstracts and full texts of the articles, 44 were chosen for the final analysis and 29 were subjected to a meta-analysis. Insomnia, anxiety, depression, PTSD and stress are among the psychological issues faced by healthcare workers. Furthermore, the highest pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD and stress was 36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 24-50%), 47% (95% CI 22-74%), 49% (95% CI 28-70%), 37% (95% CI 19-59%) and 27% (95% CI 6-69%). In this meta-analysis, insomnia was found to be the most common mental health problem, followed by anxiety, PTSD, depression and stress in healthcare workers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, the pooled prevalence of these mental health problems was higher among physicians, nurses and older staff in the subgroup analysis. As a result, health policymakers and managers of the health care system should think about effective interventions to promote mental health, paying particular attention to these two groups.Key pointsStudies conducted in China reported more mental problems than in other countries.Health policymakers and health system managers should hold training programs to promote healthcare workers' mental health with a particular focus on more vulnerable groups.The prevalence of PTSD, stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia were higher among physicians, nurses and older staff.Health systems at both national and local levels have to take older physicians, nurses and healthcare providers into consideration while designing interventions.","Ghahramani, Kasraei, Hayati, Tabrizi, Marzaleh","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2022.2101927","20220725","COVID-19; Physician; health; healthcare provider; mental health; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34914,""

This study explored the perceptions and experiences of internal medicine residents, subspecialty medicine program directors, and interviewers during virtual interviews. We invited all Canadian third-year IM residents, subspecialty program directors, and interviewers who participated in the 2020 medical subspecialty medicine interviews to complete a branching survey with a section for residents and one for program directors and interviewers. We distributed the anonymous survey after the submission of the rank order lists, to not affect residency match outcomes. Qualitative data were open-coded thematically and quantitative data were cleaned and then statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics and Analysis of Variance tests. 62 residents, 59 program directors, and 113 interviewers responded to the survey with representation from almost all Canadian medical faculties and medical subspecialties. Strengths of virtual interviews included reduced cost, stress, pandemic infection risk, and carbon footprint. Weaknesses of virtual interviews included decreased ability to connect personally and informally, and inability to tour medical facilities and cities. A majority of both resident respondents (59.6%) and program directors/interviewer respondents (54.6%) supported conducting interviews virtually in the future.

"Teachers, Stress, and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis","The 2020-2021 academic year brought numerous challenges to teachers across the country as they worked to educate students amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study is a secondary data analysis of qualitative responses collected as part of a teacher survey to evaluate a social emotional learning curriculum implemented during the 2020-2021 academic year. The lived experiences of teachers (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°52) across 11 elementary schools in the Great Plains region were captured through open-ended questions as the teachers transitioned from in-person to remote learning. A phenomenological approach was utilized to analyze the challenges expressed by teachers as they faced instability and additional professional demands. Given that stress and other factors that strain mental health exist within multiple layers of an individual's social ecology, a modified social-ecological framework was used to organize the results and themes. Findings suggest that during the academic year, teachers experienced stressors related to their personal and professional roles, concerns for students' well-being which extended beyond academics, and frustrations with administration and other institutional entities around COVID safety measures. Without adequate support and inclusion of teacher perspectives, job-related stress may lead to teacher shortages, deterioration of teacher mental health, and ultimately worse outcomes for students.

"Practicing COVID-19 Public Health Measures Is Associated With Anxiety and Depression in Undergraduate University Students","COVID-19 has affected mental health globally, increasing depression and anxiety. This study examined relationships between practicing COVID-19-related public health measures and depression and anxiety in young adult students. A sample of 755 undergraduate students 18-25 years of age at a large public university completed a cross-sectional survey in fall 2020 during the pandemic (response rate = 18.9%). The survey included demographic questions, anxiety and depression screeners (GAD-7 and PHQ-9), and questions on practicing public health measures (stay-at-home orders, quarantining, social distancing, etc.) since March 2020. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to calculated adjusted odds between practicing public health measures and anxiety and depression. The majority of respondents reported practicing public health measures; however, 53% experienced anxiety (GAD-7 score &gt;10) and 57% experienced depression (PHQ-9 score &gt;10) in the 2 weeks prior to completing the survey. Participants who quarantined had significantly higher odds of anxiety (AOR = 1.44; 95% CL 1.07, 1.96) and depression (AOR = 1.77; 95% CL 1.30, 2.41) than those who did not. Participants who self-isolated also had significantly higher odds of anxiety (AOR = 1.53; 95% CL 1.13, 2.08) and depression (AOR = 1.87; 95% CL 1.37, 2.56) compared to those who did not.

"Psychological Wellbeing and Employability of Retrenched Workforce During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study Exploring the Mitigations for Post Pandemic Recovery Phase","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has triggered several employment-related issues, followed by different response strategies. With retrenchment measures being a common response strategy during economic downturns, many individuals have been faced with unemployment. This study aimed to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic related retrenchment on the psychological wellbeing of the Malaysian workforce, using a qualitative research approach and based on the Latent-deprivation Model. A purposive sample of 30 retrenched participants was interviewed via telephone during Malaysia's Movement Control Order (MCO). Thematic analysis was subsequently conducted to identify key themes in the data set. Six themes emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) Retrenchment leading to the deterioration of psychological wellbeing; (2) Unemployment, financial strain and economic uncertainty; (3) Emotions related to the COVID-19 virus; (4) Coping with lifestyle change; (5) Recommendations to improve the psychological wellbeing and mental health of the retrenched workforce, and (6) Career and financial support at the recovery phase. The present study provides valuable insight into the wellbeing of retrenched workforce who are forced to cope with both unemployment and a global pandemic, and workforce perspectives regarding types of support needed during the recovery phase.","Ke, Grajfoner, Carter, DeLima, Khairudin, Lau, Kamal, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.907797","20220725","COVID-19; job loss; latent-deprivation model; mental health; post-pandemic recovery; psychological wellbeing; retrenchment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34919,""
"COVID-19 Lockdown and Lifestyle Changes in Saudi Adults With Types 1 and 2 Diabetes","We aimed to evaluate and compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle changes and other common related effects of the lockdown in Saudi adults with diabetes mellitus (DM), both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). 265 T1D and 285 T2D individuals were included in this cross-sectional survey during lockdown using an online questionnaire and compared with 297 participants without DM. Variables included demographics, treatment changes, use of supplements, change in sleeping habits and physical activity, dietary changes, social and mental health, and education and awareness during COVID-19 lockdown. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with more treatment doses in people with T1D but not in those with T2D (<i>p</i> = 0.003). More participants with T1D and T2D than the control group reported that they felt symptoms of depression during lockdown (ORs of 1.83, <i>p</i> = 0.008 and 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively) and that lockdown affected them psychologically (ORs of 1.64, <i>p</i> = 0.019 and 1.85, <i>p</i> = 0.005, respectively). More participants with T1D than controls reported that their physical activity decreased during lockdown (OR of 2.70, <i>p</i> = 0.024). Furthermore, significantly lesser participants in both DM groups than controls agreed that the health education regarding COVID-19 covered everything (ORs of 0.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and 0.56, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively for T1D and T2D groups). Regarding dietary habits, the DM groups reported more changes in either the number of daily meals, meal content, or mealtimes than the control group. COVID-19 lockdown-associated lifestyle changes were more prevalent in individuals with T1D and T2D compared to control. Findings may assist public health authorities in outlining their responses in pandemics and promote healthy lifestyle adaptations in this high-risk cohort to limit adverse effects in future lockdowns.","Al-Daghri, Almiman, Wani, Khattak, Aljohani, Alfawaz, Al-Hameidi, Aldisi, Alkhaldi, Sabico","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.912816","20220725","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; diabetes; diet; lifestyle; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34920,""
"The Role of Unemployment, Financial Hardship, and Economic Recession on Suicidal Behaviors and Interventions to Mitigate Their Impact: A Review","Understanding the social determinants and risk factors for suicidal behaviors underlies the development of effective suicide prevention interventions. This review focused on recently published literature (2010 onwards), with the aim to determine the role of economic factors (at the individual and population level) on suicidal behaviors and ideation as well as the effectiveness of interventions addressing these factors in reducing suicidal behaviors and ideation. Where available, literature examining the economic impact of COVID-19 was highlighted. Economic recession and unemployment are associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior at the population and individual level. Additionally, personal financial problems such as debt and financial strain are associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation at the individual level. Regarding interventions, unemployment benefits, employment protection legislation, higher minimum wage and active labor market programs may reduce suicide at the population level. However, it is not clear what impact they have at the individual level, nor in relation to suicide attempts, self-harm, or suicidal ideation. There was a lack of evidence as to the effectiveness of financially focused suicide prevention interventions at either level. Current findings were contextualized within, and advance, prominent social theoretical models. Recommendations focused on future areas of research, including the unfolding economic impact of COVID-19, as well as the co-design and evaluation of tailored interventions and/or gatekeeper training for those in the financial and welfare sector, and enhanced early education aimed at increasing financial literacy in young people before onset or exacerbation of financial hardship.","Mathieu, Treloar, Hawgood, Ross, KÃƒÂµlves","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.907052","20220725","COVID-19; economic recession; financial hardship; self-harm; suicide; unemployment; welfare benefits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34921,""

"Adverse Impacts of Temporomandibular Disorders Symptoms and Tooth Loss on Psychological States and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","Emotion and quality of life may have been impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, especially in the lockdown. The impact of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) symptoms and tooth loss on mental status and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) are not fully understood in a stressful situation. We aimed to investigate whether TMD and tooth loss were the impaired risks of psychological states and OHRQoL in COVID-19 lockdown, and attempt to explore other potential risk factors. This cross-sectional study surveyed residents via an online self-reported questionnaire, when Yangzhou was in lockdown. Demographic data, clinical information, the level of anxiety, depression and OHRQoL were collected and analyzed. Painful TMD symptoms and tooth loss are the risks of more severe anxiety and depression. TMD symptoms and tooth loss worsened OHRQoL. Lower education degree (OR: 6.31, <i>P</i> = 0.019), TMD-related pain symptoms (OR: 10.62, <i>P</i> = 0.005), tooth loss (OR: 3.12, <i>P</i> = 0.035), sleep disorders (OR: 2.92, <i>P</i> = 0.049) and relatively close contacts (OR: 3.95, <i>P</i> = 0.020) were verified as risk factors for increased level of anxiety. With respect to depression, low socio-economic status (OR: 6.22, <i>P</i> = 0.021), TMD-related pain (OR: 7.35, <i>P</i> = 0.012), tooth loss (OR: 4.48, <i>P</i> = 0.009), sleep disorders (OR: 5.13, <i>P</i> = 0.007) and relatively close contacts (OR: 12.94, <i>P</i> = 0.001) were identified as independent factors for developing depression. Additionally, drinking (B: -2.584, <i>P</i> = 0.013) and never going to the dental clinic (B: -3.675, <i>P</i> = 0.024) were relevant to better OHRQoL, while TMD without pain (B: 2.797, <i>P</i> = 0.008), TMD-related pain (B: 12.079, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), tooth loss (B: 2.546, <i>P</i> = 0.006), sleep disorders (B: 2.598, <i>P</i> = 0.003) were independent factors for impaired OHRQoL. Painful TMD symptoms, tooth loss and sleep disorders were the impaired risks of psychological states. TMD symptoms and tooth loss damaged OHRQoL when the city was in lockdown. Therefore, individualized psychological counseling is supposed to maintain control of mental health and OHRQoL under the stressful event.","Weng, Hou, Jiao, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.899582","20220725","COVID-19; Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL); TMD symptoms; lockdown; mental health; tooth loss","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34923,""
"Social determinants of health in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients in the United States: Clinician perspective and health policy implications","Social determinants of health (SDoH) can impact the vulnerable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) population, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers' understanding of SDoH at the point of care and their impact is unknown. We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with US clinicians at 17 pulmonary hypertension (PH) centers and one patient advocate from the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. We sought participants' perspective on SDoH in PAH and their impact. Transcripts were developed and analyzed for key themes to assess potential policy implications. Participants served a large PAH population and demonstrated high awareness of SDoH and its impact on treatment and outcomes. They reported that patients' SDoH, including socioeconomic status, health insurance, access to health care, education levels, health literacy, employment status, and insecurities associated with housing, food, transportation, and family support, impacted health and well-being. COVID-19-related social isolation, mental health, and substance abuse contributed to significant inequities in care provision and outcomes. While telemedicine helped clinicians manage patients remotely during the pandemic, there was a concern for patients with limited access to this medium. Participants reported no formal screening for SDoH at the point of care. With the recognition and the desire to act upon health inequities associated with SDoH, participants felt that it was vital for their centers to have a dedicated PH social worker and support staff to optimize care and outcomes. An approach that integrates SDoH in PAH care management, streamlined through institutional policy, could address health disparities leading to improved healthcare access, outcomes, and quality of care.","Nadipelli, Elwing, Oglesby, El-Kersh","https://doi.org/10.1002/pul2.12111","20220725","health equity; healthcare disparities; population health; rare disease; social needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34924,""
"Selection of Pediatric Mental Health Quality Measures for Health System Improvement in British Columbia Based on a Modified Delphi Approach","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of mental wellbeing. The identification and implementation of quality measures can improve health outcomes and patient experience. The objective was to identify and define a core set of valid and relevant pediatric mental health quality measures that will support health system evaluation and quality improvement in British Columbia, Canada. The study consisted of four phases. First, a comprehensive database search identified valid pediatric quality measures focused on mental health and substance use (MH/SU). Second, the identified quality measures were mapped to focus areas, which were then prioritized by two stakeholder groups consisting of 26 members. Third, up to two representative measures for each prioritized focus area were pre-selected by an expert panel (<i>n</i> = 9). And fourth, a three-step modified Delphi approach was employed to (1) assess each quality measure on a 7-point Likert scale against three relevance criteria (representative of a quality problem, value to intended audience and actionable), (2) discuss the results, and (3) select and rank the most relevant measures. Forty-eight stakeholders were invited to participate; of those 24 completed the round 1 survey, 21 participated in the round 2 discussion and 18 voted in the round 3 selection and ranking survey. For round 1, consensus was determined when at least 70% of the response rates were within the range of five to seven. For round 3, Kendall's coefficient of concordance W was used as an estimator of inter-rater reliability. One-hundred pediatric mental health quality measures were identified in the database search. Of those, 37 were mapped to ten focus areas. Pre-selection resulted in 19 representative measures moving forward to the Delphi study. Eleven measures met the consensus thresholds and were brought forward to the round 2 discussion. Round 3 ranking showed moderate to strong raters' agreement (Kendall's W = 0.595; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and resulted in the following five highest-ranked measures: level of satisfaction after discharge from inpatient admission due to MH/SU, number of patients experiencing seclusion or restraint, length of time from eating disorder referral to assessment, number of ED visits due to MH/SU, and number of readmissions to ED. The selected core set of valid and relevant pediatric quality measures will support sustainable system change in British Columbia. The five top-ranked measures will be refined and tested for data collection feasibility before being implemented in the province.","Waibel, Wu, Smith, Johnson, Janke","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.866391","20220725","Delphi techniques; health care quality indicators; mental health services; pediatrics; quality improvement; substance-related disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34925,""
"Online Mindfulness Intervention, Mental Health and Attentional Abilities: A Randomized Controlled Trial in University Students During COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide restrictive measures, raising concerns about mental health in young adults who were not particularly vulnerable to the virus itself. This study investigated the impact of these restrictions on mental and cognitive health of university students, and tested the efficacy of a brief online mindfulness meditation intervention in countering psychological distress and improving attentional abilities. Ninety-six university students forced into remote learning due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and with no experience in meditation were randomly assigned to either a passive control group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°48) or to an experimental group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°48) following daily, for 17Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, an online mindfulness intervention (10-20Ã¢â‚¬â€°min per day). Due to drop-out, 38 participants in each group were finally analyzed. Pre- and post-tests assessed participants' mental health (psychological well-being, depression, anxiety, stress) and attentional abilities. The analysis of baseline data in comparison with normative scores and pre-pandemic statistics confirmed the expected psychological distress, but it did not reveal any attentional deficits in our participants. Pre-post change scores analyses showed a reduction in stress (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006, <i>ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub></i> <sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.10), anxiety (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002, <i>ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub></i> <sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13), and depression (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.025, <i>ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub></i> <sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07), and an improvement in well-being (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013, <i>ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub></i> <sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12) in the experimental group, but not in the control group. In both groups, no significant effect was found on attentional abilities. Our results confirmed the psychological vulnerability of higher education students in the midst of the remote learning period during the second COVID-19 lockdown in France, while suggesting preservation of attentional functioning. Although the tested mindfulness intervention did not enhance the attentional abilities in already good performing students, it did promote their mental health. This study offers additional evidence on the feasibility and efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in students during psychologically straining periods, like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Devillers-RÃƒÂ©olon, Mascret, Sleimen-Malkoun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.889807","20220725","COVID-19 lockdown; attentional abilities; mental health; mindfulness meditation; online practice; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34926,""
"Psychological Responses of Health Care Workers Are Strongly Associated With Pandemic Management","Globally, governments adopted protective measures to stabilize the worsening COVID-19 pandemic situation. These measures had a large impact on health care workers (HCWs) and could make the work environment more stressful for them. Therefore, we explored the associations of the psychological responses of HCWs and pandemic management among Slovak health care workers during the second wave of the pandemic. We obtained data about psychological responses, COVID-19 experiences, information overload, non-adherence of the public, work stress and barriers and facilitators of health care provision from HCWs at the COVID-19-related departments of one hospital that mainly covered eastern Slovakia (215 health care professionals, 77.7% females, <i>M</i>/<i>SD</i> = 44.4). Data were analyzed using logistic regression models adjusted for gender. Pandemic management was most strongly associated with psychological responses, such as irritability, sadness, anxiety, dizziness, and back pain, in health care workers. The non-adherence of the public had the strongest associated psychological impact on HCWs, mostly affecting anxiety and irritability (odds ratios, ORs varying from 3.9 to 7.0). From the barriers and facilitators of health care provision, the use of personal protective equipment had the most impact psychologically, whereas efficient department management was most protective, with ORs around 0.3.

"How Does Inclusive Leadership Curb Workers' Emotional Exhaustion? The Mediation of Caring Ethical Climate and Psychological Safety","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the politics, economy, and society of the world, which has dealt the most severe blow to the hospitality industry. Meanwhile, the pandemic and government control policies have brought high psychological pressure to hospitality front-line employees, resulting in emotional exhaustion. As a part of burnout syndrome, emotional exhaustion poses a threat to employees' mental health, career sustainability, and well-being. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to investigate the curb effectiveness of inclusive leadership on emotional exhaustion and to explore the mediation roles of ethical climate and psychological safety between them. Time-lagged data were collected from 65 teams and 358 hospitality front-line employees working in Chinese hotels in two stages with a one-month gap. This research verified that inclusive leadership has a negative impact on emotional exhaustion both indirectly through the mediation roles of ethical climate and psychological safety. And the ethical climate and psychological safety played partial mediation roles between inclusive leadership and emotional exhaustion. In theory, the findings explored the dual mediation mechanism of the inhibitory effect of inclusive leadership on emotional exhaustion. In practice, we provided the training and correct guidance to develop inclusive leadership for hotel enterprises and to resolve the emotional exhaustion of employees, which can enhance sustainability in careers.","Li, Peng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.877725","20220725","caring ethical climate; emotional exhaustion; hospitality frontline employees; inclusive leadership; psychological safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34928,""

"A Stage 1 Pilot Cohort Exploring the Use of EMDR Therapy as a Videoconference Psychotherapy During COVID-19 With Frontline Mental Health Workers: A Proof of Concept Study Utilising a Virtual Blind 2 Therapist Protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the delivery of psychological treatment. Due to social distancing requirements, the provision moved to videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP). There is a paucity of empirical data supporting the efficacy of EMDR therapy as a VCP. This stage 1 pilot study tested an EMDR therapy scripted protocol, such as Virtual Blind 2 Therapist (VB2Tr), on frontline mental health workers as a VCP regarding fitness for purpose, distinctiveness, relevance, and efficiency. A total of 24 participants were recruited for the study. The design included a one-session treatment intervention with pre, post, 1-month, and 6-month follow-up (FU) measurements. This treatment session used a ""Blind 2 Therapist"" EMDR therapy scripted protocol as videoconference psychotherapy that involves non-disclosure of traumatic memory. The research explored the treatment effect on the core characteristics of trauma memory, including subjective disturbance, belief systems, memory intensity (MI), vividness, and levels of emotionality. Additionally, the research explored participants' experiences of adverse and benevolent childhood experiences (ACEs/BCEs) during their childhood. Regarding the four tests, namely, fitness for purpose, distinctiveness, relevance, and efficiency, results are favourably suggesting potential clinical benefits of using EMDR as videoconference psychotherapy. Although this is a proof-of-concept study showing positive results, no clinical population or control group was used. The purpose of the study is to explore the potential for scalability toward a larger clinical trial. The treatment intervention was achieved irrespective of either ACEs/BCEs during childhood. The research tentatively supports the case for EMDR therapy as a credible treatment when used as video conference psychotherapy and in using the Blind 2 Therapist protocol.

"Risk Factors Associated With Increased Anxiety Sensitivity in Children and Adolescents in Northwest China During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","A large body of evidence has revealed that the sudden outbreak of public health emergencies induces dramatic effects on the mental health of the general public. We aimed to investigate the level of anxiety sensitivity and its risk factors in children and adolescents from northwest China during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in early 2020. A cross-sectional survey was conducted through the Wenjuanxing platform using a convenience sampling method between 18 and 26 February 2020. The self-designed questionnaire contained sociodemographic characteristics, factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI) scale. The data from 1,091 valid questionnaires from students aged 9-17 years were analyzed using ANOVA, multiple linear regression, and binary logistic regression. The average CASI scores were 11.47 Ã‚Â± 6.631, and 642 students (58.9%) had prominent anxiety sensitivity. Gender, education level, family members participating in anti-COVID-19 work, getting ill and needing medical help during the lockdown, feeling afraid or having heart palpitations on hearing things associated with COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 would have adverse impacts on themselves or their family in the future, and fear of infection were identified as significant factors for elevated levels of anxiety sensitivity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). We established a multiple linear regression model for the anxiety sensitivity score. Risk factors found for anxiety sensitivity in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown included studying in secondary or high school, becoming ill during the pandemic, feeling afraid or experiencing rapid heartbeat or palpitations on hearing about the COVID-19 pandemic, thinking that COVID-19 would have an adverse impact on themselves or their family in the future, and fear of infection.

"College Students' Opinions About Coping Strategies for Mental Health Problems, Suicide Ideation, and Self-Harm During COVID-19","Mental health problems have emerged as a significant health complication in United States colleges during COVID-19, and as a result, they have been extensively investigated in the United States and internationally. In contrast, research on coping among the college population during the pandemic is scant. Hence, this study investigated coping strategies proposed by undergraduate students attending a Midwestern university. The purpose of this preliminary study was to obtain college students' feedback/opinions about coping strategies for mental health problems, suicide ideation, and self-harm during COVID-19. In December 2021, one-hundred and four undergraduate students (ages 18-22 years) completed an online survey on coping strategies using Qualtrics. Major topics included: (1) Types of coping strategies/styles expressed by students for general mental health problems, (2) Types of coping strategies for suicide ideation and self-harm behaviors, (3) Preferred platforms for receiving coping therapy, and (4) Reasons for accepting or refusing parent involvement with mental health problems. The most beneficial coping strategies for mental health were ranked by college students as follows: (1) a skills training development program (30%), (2) meditation (19%), and (3) mindfulness exercises (15%), and physical education (11%). The respondents' best coping strategies for preventing self-harm and suicide ideation/behaviors during COVID-19 were ranked as: (1) improving support from friends (32%), (2) building self-esteem (29%), and (3) addressing anger, depression, stress, and loneliness (25%). Finally, a total of 50% of participants felt that parents should be involved in college student interventions. Students stated that the most important type of support that they received from their parents were: (1) emotional support (31%), (2) direction and/or assistance with solutions (27%), and problem-solving (16%). This study identified potential avenues which could be implemented into action during future outbreaks. Specifically, employing interventions that: (i) train undergraduate students to employ more effective skills training coping strategies or practicing mindfulness or meditation; (ii) integrate mental health, suicide, and self-harm prevention into the curriculum; (iii) offer more in-person campus services targeted toward the psychological and emotional effects of a pandemic, and (iv) involve support persons (e.g., family) in students' lives to enhance their well-being during and after COVID-19.","Klonoff-Cohen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918891","20220725","COVID-19; college students; coping; family support; mental health problems; self-harm; skills training; suicide ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34932,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated increases in experiences of assault violence among black men with low socioeconomic status living in Louisiana","The COVID-19 pandemic has had mental health, social, and economic implications among communities with high levels of social disadvantage; this may have impacted community violence rates. The objective of this study was to characterize overall trends in assault and social disadvantage of patients experiencing assault before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. All trauma activations at a level one trauma center serving the entire southeast Louisiana region were included during March-August pre-COVID (2018-2019) and during COVID (2020). ICD-10 E-codes were used to identify trauma intent (assault vs. other). Assaults in this context are defined as physical injuries caused by an act of violence wherein the perpetrator was suspected or confirmed to have intended harm, injury, or death to the victim. Social disadvantage was assessed using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Change in the monthly rate of assault-trauma activations was assessed using negative binomial regression with adjustment for race, gender, and injury intent. The study was reviewed and approved by the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. A total of 4,233 trauma activations were included. The majority of activations occurred among men. Assaults increased from 27.5% of all activations pre-Covid to 35.6% during the pandemic. Penetrating trauma similarly increased from 29.5% to 35.7% of all activations. Negative binomial regression demonstrated that in addition to this increase in proportion of assaults relative to all activations, the monthly assault rate also increased by 20% during the pandemic. These increases were driven primarily by increased assaults among Black men. ADI rank did not change between study periods. Health disparities in violence worsened during the pandemic: increased cases of assault occurred disproportionately among Black men, and assaults persisted in occurring primarily among low-ADI communities where burden had been high pre-pandemic. There is a critical need for resources and support to Black men, to mitigate violence and improve racial heath equity.","Beiter, Danos, Conrad, Broyles, Zabaleta, Mussell, Phillippi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09974","20220725","Assault; COVID-19; Community violence; Health disparities; Social disadvantage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34933,""
"A qualitative analysis of psychosocial stressors and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline healthcare personnel in the United States","There is a dearth of qualitative studies exploring the lived experiences of frontline healthcare personnel (HCP) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined workplace stressors, psychological manifestations of said stressors, and coping strategies reported through coded open-text responses from 1024 online surveys completed over two months by 923 HCP participating in three nationwide cohorts from Spring 2020. Our findings suggest that risk, job insecurity, frustration with hospital administration, inadequate access to personal protective equipment, and witnessing patient suffering and death contributed to deteriorating mental and physical health. Negative health impacts included the onset or exacerbation of anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms, including weight fluctuation, fatigue, and migraines. Coping mechanisms included substance use and food consumption, meditation and wellness, fitness, socializing with loved ones, and religious activities. Insights garnered from participants' responses will enable more personalized and effective psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention for frontline HCP in future health crises.","Shah, Becene, Nguyen, Stuart, West, Berrill, Hankins, Borba, Rich-Edwards","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmqr.2022.100130","20220725","Burnout; COVID-19; Coping; Health care professional; Mental health and illness; Occupational stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34934,""

"Burnout and Resilience during the COVID-19 Outbreak: Differences between Male and Female Students","This research aims to determine the burnout levels of male and female students on the three subscales of Exhaustion (EX), Cynicism (CY), and Professional Efficacy (PE) and their resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a non-experimental quantitative, descriptive, and cross-sectional research conducted on students of Riau University. The snowball sampling method was used to obtain data from 131 students consisting of 69 female and 62 male through the distribution of an online questionnaire and analyzed using the independent sample t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. The data distribution showed that burnout on the PE, EX, CY, and resilience is in the high, moderate, moderate and normal categories, respectively. The data analysis showed that the burnout variable for the PE and EX indicators in female was higher than for men. Meanwhile, male's CY and resilience indicators were higher than female. This indicates significant differences in burnout and resilience between male and female during the pandemic. The results also showed that there is no correlation between PE and resilience as well as CY and resilience, while EX and resilience show a correlation. This finding shows the psychological condition of students in using distance learning during the pandemic.

"Stress and Diet Quality Among Ecuadorian Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic A Cross-Sectional Study","Stress has been associated with food habits. Stress changes eating patterns and the salience and consumption of hyperpalatable foods. During the lock-down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, stress was very common. We investigated the association between stress and diet quality in Ecuadorian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study. Data was collected using a self-administered online survey. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and diet quality was evaluated using the Global Diet Index (GDI). A linear regression model with restrictive cubic splines was used to investigate the association between stress and diet quality. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling, including a total of 2602 individuals. Most participants were female (68.57%) and had university education (78.52%), with a median age of 25 (IQR: 25, 37). Stress was reported by 26.06% of participants. The majority of individuals (75.79%) reported having a diet that needed changes or an unhealthy diet. Independently from biological sex, age, level of education, people/room ratio, economic allowance, and expenses for food, stress was statistically significantly associated with diet quality (<i>p</i> = 0.035). The association between stress and diet quality was inverse and non-linear; higher stress levels were associated with poorer diet quality. The consumption of palatable foods was not statistically significant associated with stress. Stress is associated with poorer diet quality.

"Neuropsychiatric sequelae of long COVID-19: Pilot results from the COVID-19 neurological and molecular prospective cohort study in Georgia, USA","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, there has been a growing interest in the chronic sequelae of COVID-19. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in the acute phase of infection, but there is a need for accurate characterization of how these symptoms evolve over time. Additionally, African American populations have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 Neurological and Molecular Prospective Cohort Study in Georgia (CONGA) was established to investigate the severity and chronicity of these neurologic findings over the five-year period following infection. The CONGA study aims to recruit COVID-19 positive adult patients in Georgia, United States from both the inpatient and outpatient setting, with 50% being African American. This paper reports our preliminary results from the baseline visits of the first 200 patients recruited who were on average 125 days since having a positive COVID-19 test. The demographics, self-reported symptoms, comorbidities, and quantitative measures of depression, anxiety, smell, taste, and cognition were analyzed. Cognitive measures were compared to demographically matched controls. Blood and mononuclear cells were drawn and stored for future analysis. Fatigue was the most reported symptom in the study cohort (68.5%). Thirty percent of participants demonstrated hyposmia and 30% of participants demonstrated hypogeusia. Self-reported neurologic dysfunction did not correlate with dysfunction on quantitative neurologic testing. Additionally, self-reported symptoms and comorbidities were associated with depression and anxiety. The study cohort performed worse on cognitive measures compared to demographically matched controls, and African American patients scored lower compared to non-Hispanic White patients on all quantitative cognitive testing. Our results support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Our results suggest that self-reported neurologic symptoms do not appear to correlate with associated quantitative dysfunction, emphasizing the importance of quantitative measurements in the complete assessment of deficits. Self-reported symptoms are associated with depression and anxiety. COVID-19 infection appears to be associated with worse performance on cognitive measures, though the disparity in score between African American patients and non-Hispanic White patients is likely largely due to psychosocial, physical health, and socioeconomic factors.","Chen, Wang, McCluskey, Morgan, Switzer, Mehta, Tingen, Su, Harris, Hess, Rutkowski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100491","20220725","Cognition; Cohort; Coronavirus; Hyposmia; Long COVID; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34938,""
"Assessment of Depression and Anxiety Among Admitted People With Heart Disease Conditions: A Cross-Sectional Hospital-Based Study in a Bangladeshi Population During the COVID-19","Depression and anxiety are widespread and chronic among patients with heart disease. We wanted to determine the proportion of heart patients with depression and anxiety levels as well as factors contributing toward depression and anxiety among hospitalized heart disease patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the COVID-19 era. The study comprised a total of 384 participants with a confirmed heart disease diagnosis. We conducted a cross-sectional study from 5th March to 27th June 2021. The hospital-based study admitted patients sequentially with a new or pre-existing heart disease diagnosis to one of Dhaka's two leading hospitals. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale screened all individuals for depression and anxiety. Most of the respondents (88.2%) were male and within the age categories of 51-60 years (32.81%). 96.6% of the patients were married, 30% had no income, 36.6% had only completed classes 1-5, and ~47% resided in rural areas. Approximately 36% of the study participants were former smokers, with 31% current smokers. Borderline abnormal and abnormal levels of anxiety and borderline abnormal and abnormal levels of depression were found in (23.9%, 49.4%) and (55.7%, 13.3%), respectively, of hospitalized patients. Age, residence, profession, monthly income, and chronic disease were significant predictors of anxiety, while only gender remained significantly associated with depression.

"Occupational Stress and Insomnia Symptoms Among Nurses During the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: The Chain Mediating Effect of Perceived Organizational Support and Psychological Capital","Nurses play an important role in medical and health services and insomnia symptoms were relatively high among nurses, especially during the epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease. Insomnia not only damages the physical and mental health of the individual, but also reduces the efficiency of their work and the quality of care, ultimately impacting on patient care. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of perceived organizational support and psychological capital in the relationship between occupational stress and insomnia among Chinese nurses. A cross-sectional study has been carried out in a tertiary grade A hospital in Shandong Province, China from March 2021 to May 2021. The self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 810 nurses, which including Chinese Effort-Reward Imbalance Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale, Perceived Organizational Support Questionnaire, Chinese Psychological Capital Questionnaire, gender, age, education level and other demographic characteristics. Effective respondents were 658 (81.2%). Descriptive analysis, independent-samples <i>t</i>-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analyses, ordinary least-squares regression and the bootstrap method were used for data analysis. The prevalence of insomnia symptoms in this study was found to be 57.3%. There were significant differences in insomnia symptoms in weekly working hours (<i>t</i> = -2.027, <i>P</i> = 0.043), with chronic disease (<i>t</i> = -2.825, <i>P</i> = 0.005), negative life events (<i>t</i> = -5.340, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), departments (<i>F</i> = 3.077, <i>P</i> = 0.006) and position (<i>t</i> = 2.322, <i>P</i> = 0.021) among nurses. Overall, the serial-multiple mediations of perceived organizational support and psychological capital in the relationship between occupational stress and insomnia were found to be statistically significant. The prevalence of insomnia symptoms was comparatively high among Chinese nurses, and occupational stress had direct negative influence on it. Perceived organizational support and psychological capital acted as chained mediating factor could partially relieve insomnia symptoms related to occupational stress. Supportive working environment should be provided, and improving psychological capital levels to help nurses coping with insomnia symptoms.","Du, Liu, Zhang, Shao, Hua, Li, Lang, Ni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.882385","20220725","effort reward imbalance; insomnia symptoms; occupational stress; overcommitment; perceived organizational support; psychological capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34940,""
"Need Satisfaction and Depressive Symptoms Among University Students in Hong Kong During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Moderating Effects of Positive Youth Development Attributes","As studies on the mental health status of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic are almost non-existent in Hong Kong, we examined four research questions in this paper: What is the prevalence of depressive symptoms in university students in Hong Kong? What are the socio-demographic correlates of depressive symptoms? Do need satisfaction and positive youth development (PYD) attributes, including beliefs about adversity, psychosocial competence (resilience and emotional competence) and family functioning predict depression? Do PYD attributes moderate the predictive effect of need satisfaction on depression? We examined the above research questions using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) in 1,648 university students in Hong Kong. For PYD attributes, we utilized validated measures of Chinese beliefs about adversity, psychosocial competence (resilience and emotional competence), and family functioning. For need satisfaction, we used a measure derived from two focus group interviews involving university students. Results showed that 48.4% of the respondents (95% confidence interval = [45.9%, 51.1%]) scored 16 or above (i.e., ""at-risk"" for clinical depression). As predicted, age, gender, student status (local vs. international), and family financial hardship were significant socio-demographic correlates of depressive symptoms. Besides, need satisfaction and PYD attributes negatively predicted depression scores. Finally, multiple regression analyses controlling for gender, age, and student status as covariates showed that all PYD attributes moderated the impact of need satisfaction on depression. The findings reinforce the theoretical proposition that PYD attributes serve as important factors in protecting the mental health of university students during the pandemic.","Shek, Dou, Zhu, Wong, Tan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.931404","20220725","beliefs about adversity; depression; family functioning; positive youth development; psychosocial competence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34941,""
"Trait Anxiety Mediates Impulsivity and Suicidal Ideation in Depression During COVID-19 Pandemic","Suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has been an urgent affair during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is well-established that impulsivity and trait anxiety are two risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, literature is still insufficient on the relationships among impulsivity, (state/trait) anxiety and suicidal ideation in individuals with MDD. The present study aims to explore the relationships of these three variables in MDD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic through three scales, including Barrett Impulsivity Scale (BIS), State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Self-rating Idea of Suicide Scale (SIOSS). Sixty-three MDD patients (low SIOSS group and high SIOSS group, which were split by the mean score of SIOSS) and twenty-seven well-matched healthy controls were analyzed. Our results showed that the high SIOSS group had higher trait anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = [-19.29, -5.02]) but there was no difference in state anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.171, 95% CI = [-10.60, 1.25]), compared with the low SIOSS group. And the correlation between impulsivity and suicidal ideation was significant in MDD patients (<i>r</i> = 0.389, <i>p</i> = 0.002), yet it was not significant in healthy controls (<i>r</i> = 0.285, <i>p</i> = 0.167). Further, mediation analysis showed that trait anxiety significantly mediate impulsivity and suicidal ideation in patients with depression (total effect: ÃŽÂ² = 0.304, <i>p</i> = 0.002, 95% CI = [0.120, 0.489]; direct effect: ÃŽÂ² = 0.154, <i>p</i> = 0.076, 95% CI = [-0.169, 0.325]), indicating impulsivity influenced suicidal ideation through trait anxiety in MDD patients. In conclusion, our results suggested that trait anxiety might mediate the association of impulsivity and suicidal ideation in MDD patients. Clinicians may use symptoms of trait anxiety and impulsivity for screening when actively evaluating suicidal ideation in MDD patients, especially in the setting of COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Zhang, Zhao, Yuan, Qiu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.892442","20220725","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; impulsivity; major depressive disorder; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34942,""
"A Review Study on the Trends of Psychological Challenges, Coping Ways, and Public Support During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Vulnerable Populations in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant mortality and morbidity in the United States. The mental health impact during the pandemic was huge and affected all age groups and population types. We reviewed the existing literature to understand the present trends of psychological challenges and different coping strategies documented across different vulnerable sections of the United States population. This rapid review was carried out to investigate the trends in psychological impacts, coping ways, and public support during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in the United States. We undertook a rapid review of the literature following the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We searched PubMed as it is a widely available database for observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects, coping ways, and public support on different age groups and healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We included thirty-five studies in our review and reported data predominantly from the vulnerable United States population. Our review findings indicate that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of various age groups differently, especially in the elderly population and HCWs. Review findings suggest that factors like children, elderly population, female gender, overconcern about family, fear of getting an infection, personality, low spirituality, and lower resilience levels were at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic. Systemic support, higher resilience levels, and adequate knowledge were identified as protecting and preventing factors. There is a paucity of similar studies among the general population, and we restricted our review specifically to vulnerable subgroups of the population. All the included studies in our review investigated and surveyed the psychological impacts, coping skills, and public support system during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence to date suggests that female gender, child and elderly population, and racial factors have been affected by a lack of support for psychological wellbeing. Further, research using our hypothesized framework might help any population group to deal with a pandemic-associated mental health crisis, and in that regard, analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.","Kumar, Singh, Mishra, Saraswati, Bhalla, Pagali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.920581","20220725","COVID-19; culture; mental health; psychological adaptation; psychosocial support systems; society","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34943,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown on Anxiety, Depression and Nursing Burden of Caregivers in Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Mild Cognitive Impairment in China: A 1-Year Follow-Up Study","Many countries have adopted lockdown strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the pandemic on anxiety, depression and care burden in caregivers of nursing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), over a one-year period. We collected data on consecutive patients and their caregivers recruited at T0 (from 30 September to 31 December 2019) before the pandemic of COVID-19 at the memory clinic of Tianjin Huanhu Hospital. The patients and caregivers were followed up on face-to-face at T1 (from 30 September to 31 December 2020) during the pandemic to assess changes in physical activity, social contact, sleep quality, caregiver burden, anxiety and depression. A total of 105 AD, 22 DLB and 50 MCI patients and caregivers were enrolled. A total of 36.6 % of the AD, 81.6% of the DLB, 38% of the MCI caregivers had worsening ZBI, whereas 31.7 % of the AD, 54.4% of the DLB, 26 % of the MCI caregivers had worsening GAD-7, and 29.6 % of the AD, 54.4% of the DLB, and 32 % of the MCI caregivers had worsening PHQ-9.

Examination of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Data to November 2021","Overdoses caused by synthetic mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as fentanyl are causing increasing mortality in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have complex effects on public health, including opioid use disorders (OUD). It is unclear whether recent increases in mortality caused by synthetic opioids have reached a plateau (i.e., a stable period), after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined provisional overdose mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for synthetic opioids excluding methadone (code T40.4; monthly data available from 39 States, plus New York City and Washington DC), for June 2019-November 2021. Data were first examined as crude mortality rates. The presence of a maximum plateau was analyzed for the last 4 months of available data. For authorities in which a plateau in mortality was detected, sigmoidal Boltzmann equations were used to model parameters of this phenomenon (e.g., level of the plateau). At the end of the study period, all but one authority (New Hampshire) reported increases in mortality rates for synthetic opioids, compared to the baseline month of June 2019 (range: 111-745% of baseline). A plateau was observed over the last 4 months of the study period (Aug 2021-Nov 2021) in 29 of the authorities. Ten other authorities had not reached a stable plateau at the end of the study period. For the authorities where a plateau was detected, a sigmoidal Boltzmann model revealed a fitted maximum of 262% rise in mortality over the study period, from the baseline month. The midpoint in the rise in mortality was fitted in September 2020. After separation of data into census regions, the highest plateau was observed in the West region, followed by South, Midwest, and Northeast (fitted plateau values were 409, 262, 204, and 149% of baseline, respectively). There were increases in overdose mortality due to synthetic opioids across most states, ranging considerably in magnitude. A plateau in overdose mortality was detected at the end of the study period in most of these authorities. The reasons for these plateaus should be explored, in order to develop optimized public health interventions.","Brown, Chen, Dong, Lake, Butelman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.947603","20220725","COVID-19; fentanyl; opioid; opioid use disorder; overdose; plateau","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34946,""
"Dementia and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic raised significant concerns related to the management of care for people with dementia, but few studies have examined the mental health of older adults with dementia and their caregivers during the pandemic, when compared to other populations. This systematic review thus aims to compare and discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with dementia and on their caregivers' mental health. A search was performed in the PubMed/Medline and ISI databases according to the PRISMA methodology. We included studies published in 2020 and 2021 with the following combinations of keywords: ""COVID-19 and mental health and elderly,"" ""COVID-19 and mental health and dementia;"" ""COVID-19 and dementia and caregivers,"" ""pandemic and mental health and elderly,"" and ""pandemic and anxiety."" Twenty-two studies were included. Technology has proven to be an essential ally during the pandemic, since all 22 studies performed remote data collection. Nearly all the studies emphasized that social isolation and withdrawal can lead to the emergence or increase of neuropsychiatric symptoms and motor difficulties. However, the findings were mixed concerning the pandemic's impact on the cognition of people with dementia. Caregivers also suffered from the pandemic's impact, experiencing an increase in the burden of care and symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Few studies suggested measures to alleviate the difficulties of people with dementia and their caregivers. There are reports of the benefits of technology in communication and treatment through teleconsultations, however, not everyone has access to such technology, making it difficult to disseminate this tool to the target population. The studies generally showed that social isolation can increase motor deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregivers' burden and anxiety. New avenues for care and intervention are thus needed for older adults with cognitive deficits and their caregivers to avoid the intensification of physical and psychological suffering. Technological initiatives and support should consider people with cognitive impairment and different levels of technology literacy. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/.","Gaigher, Lacerda, Dourado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.879598","20220725","COVID-19; anxiety; caregiver; dementia; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34947,""
"Risks and Resources for Depressive Symptoms and Anxiety in Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Results of the Longitudinal COPSY Study","Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is of particularly high relevance. Especially for children and adolescents, the pandemic and its restrictions represent a significant burden. The present study aims to identify risks and resources for depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents during the pandemic in Germany. Self-reported data from the first wave of the longitudinal COVID-19 and Psychological Health (COPSY) study were used to investigate risks and resources among <i>n</i> = 811 children and adolescents aged 11-17 years. Depressive symptoms and anxiety were measured at the first follow-up 6 months later. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the effects of risks and resources on depressive symptoms and anxiety. Parental depressive symptoms predicted depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents 6 months later. Female gender was identified as a risk factor for anxiety during the pandemic. None of the potential resources were associated with depressive symptoms or anxiety at the follow-up. The findings provide evidence of risk factors for depressive symptoms and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children and adolescents who face risk factors need to be identified early and monitored during the pandemic. Family-based intervention programs are needed to help vulnerable children and adolescents cope with the challenges of the pandemic.","GÃƒÂ¼zelsoy, Ravens-Sieberer, WestenhÃƒÂ¶fer, Devine, Erhart, HÃƒÂ¶lling, Kaman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.901783","20220725","COVID-19; children and adolescents; mental health; resource factors; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34948,""
"Latino sexual minority men's intersectional minority stress, general stress, and coping during COVID-19: A rapid qualitative study","Sexual minority men face mental health, substance use, and HIV disparities, all of which can be understood by minority stress and intersectionality theories. With the emergence of COVID-19 and considering its disproportionate impact on Latinx and sexual minority communities, Latino sexual minority men (LSMM) may be facing unique consequences of this new pandemic that intersect with pre-COVID disparities. The purpose of the current study is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LSMM's intersectional minority stress, general stress, and coping, filling a gap in the current literature. The current rapid qualitative study explores the impact of COVID-19 on LSMM in South Florida who reported being HIV-negative (N=10) or living with HIV (N=10). The rapid analysis revealed themes of exacerbated intersectional minority stress and general stress in the context of COVID-19, some of which was related to the impact of pre-COVID-19 disparities in the LSMM community. Participants reported a variety of coping responses, some of which participants found helpful and others (e.g., substance use) which further exacerbated disparities. The findings underscore the need to scale up and disseminate behavioral health resources to LSMM to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this community's health and well-being.","Harkness, Weinstein, Atuluru, Altamirano, Vidal, Rodriguez-Diaz, Safren","https://doi.org/10.1080/19359705.2021.1995096","20220725","COVID-19; Latino sexual minority men; coping; minority stress; rapid qualitative analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34949,""
"Predictors of Mental Health among the General Population of US Adults Eight Months into the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impacts on mental health. We examined whether mental health differed based on sociodemographic and background characteristics, political party affiliation, and concerns about COVID-19. A cross-sectional, national sample of 1095 U.S. adults were surveyed October 22-26, 2020. The survey collected information on demographics, risk and protective behaviors for COVID-19, and mental health using the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5) scale. Independent samples t-tests, one-way Analysis of Variance tests, and a multivariable linear regression model were conducted. Regression results showed respondents with criminal justice (B = -6.56, 95% CI = -10.05, -3.06) or opioid misuse (B = -9.98, 95% CI = -14.74, -5.23) histories reported poorer mental health than those without. Those who took protective behaviors (e.g., wearing masks) reported poorer mental health compared to those who indicated protective behaviors were unnecessary (B = 7.00, 95% CI = 1.61, 12.38) while those who took at least one risk behavior (e.g., eating in a restaurant) reported better mental health than those who did not. Our study shows that certain groups have experienced poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that mental health should continue to be monitored so that public health interventions and messaging help prevent the spread of COVID-19 without increasing poor mental health outcomes.","Balawajder, Taylor, Lamuda, MacLean, Pollack, Schneider","https://doi.org/10.4236/psych.2022.133029","20220725","COVID-19; MHI-5; Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34950,""
"The associations among the stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and insomnia symptoms in depressed patients after the first COVID-19 outbreak was initially controlled in China: A prospective cohort study","Depressed patients suffered from severe psychological distress even after the first COVID-19 outbreak was initially controlled. The longitudinal changes and associations among stress and other psychological problems during this period remained unknown. In this study we investigated stress symptoms and the longitudinal impact of stress symptoms on other psychological symptoms in depressed patients after the first COVID-19 outbreak was initially controlled. A total of 5241 depressed patients at the outpatient of 56 hospitals across mainland China were recruited from May 18 to June 18, 2020. Five months later, 2113 of them responded again. Demographic characteristics were collected and psychological symptoms were evaluated at baseline and the follow-up. The longitudinal associations between stress symptoms at baseline and the changes of other psychological problems were assessed using Poisson regression. The prevalence of stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and insomnia symptoms declined over time. Having stress symptoms at baseline was positively associated with the new occurrences of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and insomnia symptoms (range, adjusted RRs 1.69-1.81). The sampling method and the high dropout rate are the major limitations. Additionally, the mental conditions of the participants were not obtained, which may lead to unavoidable bias. The prevalence of stress symptoms declined over time after the first COVID-19 outbreak was initially controlled. We found that having stress symptoms at baseline was a predictor for the new occurrences of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and insomnia symptoms.","Guo, Zhao, Wang, Fang, Liu, Luo, Tang, Li, Lv, Xu, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.021","20220725","Association; COVID-19; Changes; Depressed patients; Psychological distress; Stress symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34951,""
"Assets and persistent depression mediated by daily routine disruptions and financial hardship: A population-based cohort study during the first year of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a global economic downturn. Persons who have fewer assets could be at greater risk of depression during this period. This prospective population-representative study in Hong Kong aimed to investigate the relation between assets during the acute phase of COVID-19 (February to August 2020, T1) and persistent probable depression from T1 to March-August 2021 (T2), as well as the mediating effects of daily routine disruptions and financial hardship on the assets-depression association. Low assets at T1 prospectively related to persistent probable depression (from T1 to T2). Primary routine disruptions (i.e., healthy eating and sleep) at T1 and financial hardship at T2 were found to fully mediate the association between T1 assets and persistent probable depression. Persistent probable depression reported on the PHQ-9 should be further verified with clinical diagnoses/interviews. In face of large-scale disasters, persons with fewer assets are at greater risk of persistent poorer mental health than persons with more assets; everyday daily routine disruptions and financial hardship could mediate this association. Practically this suggests a need to provide behavioral and financial assistance to persons with fewer assets in the short run and a need to ensure that everyone has adequate assets to mitigate the mental health consequences of a pandemic in the long run.","Tao, Lee, Fung, Li, Ettman, Galea, Hou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.040","20220725","Assets; COVID-19; Conservation of Resources; Daily routines; Depression; Financial hardship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34952,""
"Sleep and mental health in pregnancy during COVID-19: A parallel process growth model","Pregnancy is associated with elevated risk for poor sleep quality, which increases the risk for poor obstetrical outcomes and parent mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen increased reports of disturbed sleep worldwide; however, the degree this extends to pregnancy or influences pregnancy mental health outcomes has not been examined. The goal of this study was to examine changes in pregnant individuals' sleep, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and to understand how sleep was associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression over time. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. About 3747 pregnant individuals participated between April and July 2020. The present analysis was restricted to participants who completed at least 2 assessments, yielding a final sample of 1842 pregnant individuals. Depression symptoms were elevated at baseline, compared to prepandemic estimates of prevalence, but declined gradually over time. Shorter sleep duration, higher sleep disturbance, and more sleep-related impairments at baseline predicted a slower decline in depression symptoms over time. More sleep disturbances at baseline also predicted slower decline in anxiety symptoms over time. In contrast, rates of depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline were not predictive of changes in any of the 3 sleep variables over time. These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for sleep problems in pregnancy, in order to optimize mental health throughout pregnancy and mitigate long-term negative outcomes.","Tomfohr-Madsen, Rioux, MacKinnon, Silang, Roos, Lebel, Giesbrecht","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2022.05.011","20220725","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Longitudinal; Pandemic; Pregnancy; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34953,""
"Perception of strong social norms during the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to positive psychological outcomes","Social norms can coordinate individuals and groups during collective threats. Pandemic-related social norms (e.g., wearing masks, social distancing) emerged to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, little is known about the psychological consequences of the emerging norms. We conducted three experiments cross-culturally, during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic in China (Study 1), the recovery period in China (Study 2), and the severe period in the United States and Canada (Study 3). Across the three studies, we first distinguished the opposite effects of social norms and risk perception on individuals' psychological characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic and further revealed that individuals who perceived stronger pandemic norms reported a lower level of COVID-19 risk perception, which in turn would be associated withÃ‚Â fewer negative emotions, lowerÃ‚Â pressure, more positive emotions, higher levels of trusts, and more confidence in fighting against COVID-19. Our findings show that perceived tighter social norms are linked to beneficial psychological outcomes.

"The insomnia, fatigue, and psychological well-being of hospital nurses 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the COVID-19 pandemic began: AÃ‚Â cross-sectional study","Research has shown sleep problems, elevated fatigue, and high cases of burnout, as well as signs of post-traumatic stress and psychological distress among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many US hospitals attempted to minimise its impact on staff by providing basic resources, mental health services, and wellness programs. Therefore, it is critical to re-evaluate these well-being indices and guide future administrative efforts. To determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic after 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°months on hospital nurses' insomnia, fatigue, burnout, post-traumatic stress, and psychological distress. Cross-sectional. Data were collected online mainly through state board and nursing association listservs between July-September 2021 (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°2488). The survey had psychometrically tested instruments (Insomnia Severity Index, Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion Recovery Scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory, Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Patient Health Questionnaire-4) and sections on demographics, health, and work. The STrengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology checklist was followed for reporting. Nurses had subthreshold insomnia, moderate-to-high chronic fatigue, high acute fatigue, and low-to-moderate intershift recovery. Regarding burnout, they experienced increased emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment, and some depersonalisation. Nurses had mild psychological distress but scored high on post-traumatic stress. Nurses who frequently cared for patients with COVID-19 in the past months scored significantly worse in all measures than their co-workers. Factors such as nursing experience, shift length, and frequency of rest breaks were significantly related to all well-being indices. Nurses' experiences were similar to findings from the early pandemic but with minor improvements in psychological distress. Nurses who frequently provided COVID-19 patient care, worked Ã¢â€°Â¥12Ã¢â‚¬â€°h per shift, and skipped rest breaks scored worse on almost all well-being indices. Administration can help nurses' recovery by providing psychological support, mental health services, and treatment options for insomnia, as well as re-structure current work schedules and ensure that rest breaks are taken.","Sagherian, Cho, Steege","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16451","20220722","COVID-19 patients; burnout; distress; fatigue; insomnia; nurses; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34955,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression in older adults: A panel data analysis","This paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression in the older population, an especially vulnerable group for which to date there is limited empirical research. We employ a panel data consisting of seven waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2010-2020). The breadth and depth of the data considered enabled us to control for individual fixed effects, to adjust for pre-pandemic trends in depression levels and to perform a heterogeneity analysis, depending on the intensity of the lockdown measures implemented and relevant socioeconomic characteristics. We find that, following the COVID-19 pandemic, study participants reported a statistically significant increase in the depressive symptoms by around 0.7 over 8 points as measured by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) index. The estimated coefficients were larger in November than in July, for individuals who lost their job, retired and women. Interestingly, we observed that mental health has worsened substantially relative to the pre-pandemic period across all income groups of the older population, suggesting a limited role of income as a protective mechanism for mental health. Our findings provide compelling evidence that depression levels amongst older adults have worsened considerably following the COVID-19 pandemic, and that factors other than income, such as social interactions, may be highly relevant for well-being in later life.","Gaggero, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-PÃƒÂ©rez, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Rubio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2022.07.001","20220722","CES-D index; COVID-19; Depression trends; Older adults; Pandemic; Panel data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34956,""
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among first responders for medical emergencies during COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to cause enormous psychological burden among health care workers, including first responders. However, psychological well-being of first responders, essential in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, has often been ignored. We performed the first meta-analysis to explore the prevalence of 1) depression, 2) anxiety, and 3) stress among first responders for medical emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive search was conducted in Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo, PubMed, and the WHO COVID-19 database from 2020.

"The impact of COVID-19 on nurse alcohol consumption: AÃ‚Â qualitative exploration","To explore the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurse alcohol consumption. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused immense disruption to healthcare services worldwide, and nurses have not been immune, experiencing burnout, declining mental health and ultimately, attrition from the profession. Increases in alcohol consumption have been reported across subsections of society, including those with pre-existing mental ill health and experiencing high stress, and exploring this phenomenon in nurses is essential for workforce well-being and sustainability. Qualitative descriptive study design. Secondary analysis of individual, semi-structured interviews with nurses (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°42) from diverse settings across Australia, including community, primary and hospital settings, conducted in July and August 2021. Data were analysed using structural coding and reported in accordance with the CORE-Q guidelines. Two key themes were found after analysis of the data: (1) factors influencing alcohol consumption (subthemes: workplace factors and external factors), and (2) the pandemic's influence on alcohol consumption (subthemes: increased consumption, moderation of consumption and alcohol as a reward). Several participants described increased alcohol consumption because of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to the stress of working in an environment where resources were scarce. Workplace factors such as overtime, missed breaks and heightened workload were all described as driving stress, and in turn increased alcohol consumption. Increased alcohol consumption has been associated with burnout, absenteeism and intention to leave. The nursing profession is currently undergoing significant continuing stress providing care and management to patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and increased alcohol consumption is a significant threat to personal and workforce well-being, workforce sustainability and quality nursing care.","Searby, Burr, Redley","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16467","20220724","COVID-19; alcohol consumption; alcohol drinking; nurses; nursing staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34958,""
"The effects of obesity on the menstrual cycle","The prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity has significantly increased in the United States and worldwide since the 1970s, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The complications of obesity range from negative effects on the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatobiliary, and musculoskeletal systems to higher rates of mental health conditions such as depression and eating disorders among affected individuals. Among adolescent girls, childhood obesity has been associated with the earlier onset of puberty and menarche, which can result in negative psychosocial consequences, as well as adverse effects on physical health in adulthood. The hormones leptin, kisspeptin and insulin, and their actions on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, have been implicated in the relationship between childhood obesity and the earlier onset of puberty. Obesity in adolescence is also associated with greater menstrual cycle irregularity and the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can result in infrequent or absent menstrual periods, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Hyperandrogenism, higher testosterone and fasting insulin levels, and lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, similar to the laboratory findings seen in patients with PCOS, are also seen in individuals with obesity, and help to explain the overlap in phenotype between patients with obesity and those with PCOS. Finally, obesity has been associated with higher rates of premenstrual disorders, including premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and dysmenorrhea, although the data on dysmenorrhea appears to be mixed. Discussing healthy lifestyle changes and identifying and managing menstrual abnormalities in adolescents with obesity are key to reducing the obstetric and gynecologic complications of obesity in adulthood, including infertility, pregnancy complications, and endometrial cancer.","Itriyeva","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cppeds.2022.101241","20220723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34959,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children with psychiatric diagnoses - multidimensional CCPCA Model","The study aimed to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression in children with previously diagnosed psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Online questionnaires were used to investigate three groups of subjects: patients with a psychiatric diagnosis, primary school pupils, and children from children's homes. A total of 167 children with their parents or guardians participated in the study. In addition to basic statistics, a multidimensional Centroid Class Principal Component Analysis (CCPCA) model was used. It was found that the strongest fear of the coronavirus was experienced by children from children's homes, while the most severe depressive symptoms and state anxiety were observed among patients diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Parental care by assisting with school education and lack of close contact with other people (less than two metres) at parents/guardians' work had the most potent protective effect in reducing the fear of COVID-19. There is a need for further research in children and adolescents to develop effective strategies for protecting their mental well-being when faced with social isolation or disease.","Kalenik, Topolski, GÃƒÂ³rnik, WolaÃ…â€žczyk","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04144-2","20220725","CCPCA; COVID-19; Children and adolescents; Class-Centroid Principal Component Analysis; Psychiatric disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34960,""

"A three-wave panel study on longitudinal relations between problematic social media use and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","It still remains unclear whether problematic social media use (PSMU) is a cause or a consequence of psychological distress. The present study aimed to investigate the temporal relationships between PSMU and psychological distress through a three-wave panel study (between April and July 2020, with an interval of 1Ã‚Â month between each period of time). 3,912 adult Italian participants were surveyed during the COVID-19 pandemic for psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) and PSMU (Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale). Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were applied to disaggregate between-person from within-person associations as regards PSMU and an individual's distress. On a between-person level we found that adults with higher PSMU also reported heightened levels of psychological distress across the three waves. However, on a within-person level, no cross-lagged associations were found between changes in distress and subsequent changes in PSMU and vice versa. The results were largely unchanged with the inclusion of participants' gender and age or COVID-19-related fears as covariates, and when the three subscales of depression, anxiety and stress were examined in separate models. The current study suggests that the link between PSMU and psychological distress is mainly driven by trait-like differences and not by state-like individual changes over time.","Di Blasi, Salerno, Albano, Caci, Esposito, Salcuni, Gelo, Mazzeschi, Merenda, Giordano, Lo Coco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107430","20220726","COVID-19; Problematic social media use; Psychological distress; Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model; Social media addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34963,""

"The relationship between cognitive flexibility, depression, and work performance: Employee assessments using cognitive flexibility tests","Background Cognitive flexibility is a frontal lobe function, and some scholars have indicated that it is linked to depression. The Cognitive Flexibility Test (CFT) is a neuropsychological test that can easily and promptly measure cognitive flexibility within a short amount of time. This study focuses on healthy younger workers to determine the associations between their cognitive flexibility, depression, and performance at work. Methods The absolute absenteeism and the absolute presenteeism of a group of 80 regular employees were measured, and the employees were administered the Verbal Fluency Test (VTF), the CFT-A and CFT-B, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-2), and the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ). Google Forms were used to measure the BDI-2, absolute absenteeism, and absolute presenteeism, and online interviews were conducted on Zoom to collect answers to the CFT and the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT). Results No significant age-related differences appeared in the number of responses obtained for the CFT-A and CFT-B from subjects grouped according to the decades they represented, ranging from the 20s to the 50s. In addition, the CFT-A and CFT-B did not indicate significant correlations between the BDI-2 and absenteeism and presenteeism. Limitations Small sample, online vs. in person assessments due to COVID-19. Conclusion The results suggest that the function of cognitive flexibility is relatively stable and is unaffected by age brackets. The study also found no links between the cognitive flexibility of healthy young workers, the state of depression, or their work performance.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100388","20221201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34965,""
"US dental health care workersâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background This study was designed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and understand factors influencing mental health among dental health care workers (DHCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Beginning in June 2020, 8,902 DHCWs participated monthly in an anonymous longitudinal, web-based survey (response rate, 6.7%). The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used to estimate rates of anxiety and depression symptoms. Changes in mental health over time and differences by demographic and practice characteristics, COVID-19 community transmission level, and COVID-19 vaccination status were tested using <U+03C7>2 tests and multilevel multivariable logistic regression. Results Anxiety symptom rates peaked in November 2020 (28% of dental hygienists, 17% of dentists) and declined to 12% for both professions in May 2021. Depression symptom rates were highest in December 2020 (17% of dental hygienists, 10% of dentists) and declined to 8% in May 2021. Controlling for gender, age, race or ethnicity, and COVID-19 community transmission level, the authors found that dentists had significantly lower odds of anxiety symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95) and depression symptoms (aOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.93) than dental hygienists. Compared with vaccinated respondents, those who were unvaccinated but planning on getting vaccinated had significantly higher rates of anxiety (aOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.44) and depression (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.29) symptoms. Conclusions DHCWsâ€™ mental health fluctuated during the pandemic. Anxiety and depression in DHCWs were associated with demographic and professional characteristics as well as perceived risk of COVID-19. Practical Implications Mental health support should be made available for DHCWs. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

"Over the counter drugs and self-medication: A worldwide paranoia and a troublesome situation in India during the COVID-19 pandemic","Self-medication is the use of drugs to treat self-diagnosed ailments without the use of a formal prescription. Self-medication is defined by the World Health Organization as the use of medications to address self-diagnosed diseases or symptoms. Over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceuticals are medications that can be sold without a prescription directly to the client in accordance with the laws of each nation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing tendency in the use of OTC and self-medication was seen, with the situation in India particularly deteriorating due to lax regulatory restrictions. This has resulted in a slew of problems, ranging from a lack of drugs to severe responses due to overdosage and drug-drug combinations. There is an urgent need for more tangible regulatory control over self-medication and OTC medications to safeguard the uninformed populace from harm.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103797","20220601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34973,""

"Understanding the Mental Health of Physically Challenged People and General People through Statistical and Machine Learning Approach","Compared to the general population, physically challenged peopleâ€™s mental health is less studied especially in the context of developing countries. During COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a study to explore the association of different factors with mental health of physically challenged and general people of Bangladesh. In our study, there were 22 physically challenged people and 71 general people. We find that interpersonal support has a significant (p<0.05) positive relation with well-being of both participantsâ€™ groups. However, age has a significant negative association with general peopleâ€™s well-being. Developing machine learning models to classify the general people and physically challenged people, we find that our model based on the Random Forest algorithm is able to classify people over 93% accurately having the same types of demographics, lifestyle, and psychological data. Therefore, our findings show the possibility of having differences in factors affecting the mental health of physically challenged people and general people.","Tanvir Hasan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E013D-B69-975","20220725","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; machine learning; physically challenged people; statistical analysis; human-centered computing","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-26","",34977,""
