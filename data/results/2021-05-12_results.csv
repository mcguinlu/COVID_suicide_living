"Occupational challenges of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic A qualitative study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on health care systems worldwide with health care workers (HCWs) delivering care under unprecedented conditions. This study deals with HCWs' physical, mental, emotional and professional challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to understand structural determinants of those challenges. Methods We carried out an exploratory qualitative study in public and private hospitals in Vienna, Austria. HCWs such as medical doctors, qualified nursing staff, nurse assistants, technical and cleaning staff in direct and indirect contact with COVID-19 patients were included. Collected data was analyzed using content analysis. Findings We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews in person and per phone from June 2020 to January 2021. Three overall themes resulted as relevant: challenges due to lack of preparedness, structural conditions, and physical and mental health of HCWs. Lack of preparedness included missing or delayed infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) combined with structural conditions such as staff shortages and overworked personnel. Physical and mental strains resulted from being overworked and working permanently on alert. Further, working in PPE, facing medical uncertainties and the critical conditions of patients were challenging factors. HCWs lacked recognition on multiple levels and dealt with social stigma and avoidance behavior of colleagues, especially in the beginning of the pandemic. Interpretation To mitigate HCWs' occupational health risks and staff turnover, we propose the following context-specific recommendations: Required medical personnel in care of COVID-19 patients, especially nursing staff, should be carefully planned and increased to avert chronic work overload. Intensive training and education in palliative care, as well as in IPC for all HCWs is important. Providing supportive supervision is as essential as appropriate recognition by higher level management and the public.

"Comparison of Mental Health Symptoms prior to and during COVID-19: Evidence from a Living Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Objectives: The rapid pace, high volume, and limited quality of mental health evidence being generated during COVID-19 poses a barrier to effective decision-making. The objective of the present report is to compare mental health outcomes assessed during COVID-19 to outcomes prior to COVID-19 in the general population and other population groups. Design: Living systematic review. Data Sources: MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection: Citation Indexes, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, medRxiv (preprints), and Open Science Framework Preprints (preprint server aggregator). The initial search was conducted on April 13, 2020 with ongoing weekly updates. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: For this report, we included studies that compared general mental health, anxiety symptoms, or depression symptoms, assessed January 1, 2020 or later, to the same outcomes collected between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. We required [&ge;] 90% of participants pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 to be the same or the use of statistical methods to address missing data. For population groups with continuous outcomes for at least three studies in an outcome domain, we conducted restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects meta-analyses. Results: As of March 22, 2021, we had identified 36 unique eligible studies with data from 33 cohorts. All reported COVID-19 outcomes between March and June 2020, and 3 studies also reported outcomes between September and November 2020. Estimates of changes in general mental health were close to zero in the general population (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.16, I2 = 94.6%; 4 studies, N = 19,707) and among older adults (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.16, I2 = 90.4%; 4 studies, N = 5,520) and university students (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.30, I2 = 92.0%; 3 studies, N = 3,372). Changes in anxiety symptoms were close to zero and not statistically significant in university students (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.36, I2 = 95.4%; 5 studies, N = 1,537); women or females (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39, I2 = 92.3%; 3 studies, N = 2,778); and men or males (SMD = 0.07, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.15; I2 = 0.01%; 3 studies, N = 1,250); anxiety symptoms increased, however, among people with pre-existing medical conditions (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54, I2 = 91.0%; 3 studies, N = 2,053). Changes in depression symptoms were close to zero or small and not statistically significant among university students (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.45, I2 = 91.8%; 5 studies, N = 1,537); people with pre-existing medical conditions (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.17, I2 = 14.9%; 3 studies, N = 2,006); women or females (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.55, I2 = 91.2%; 3 studies, N = 2,843); and men or males (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.22; I2 = 92.3%; 4 studies, N = 3,661). In 3 studies with data from both March to June 2020 and September to November 2020, symptoms were unchanged from pre-COVID-19 at both time points or there were increases at the first assessment that had largely dissipated by the second assessment. Conclusions: Evidence does not suggest a widespread negative effect on mental health symptoms in COVID-19, although it is possible that gaps in data have not allowed identification of changes in some vulnerable groups. Continued updating is needed as evidence accrues.","Ying Sun; Yin Wu; Olivia Bonardi; Ankur Krishnan; Chen He; Jill T. Boruff; Danielle B.

"Mental health of Adolescents in the Pandemic: Long-COVID19 or Long-Pandemic Syndrome?","Backround Post-COVID19 complications such as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) and Long-COVID19 move increasingly into focus, potentially causing more harm in this age group than the acute infection. To better understand the symptoms of long-COVID19 in adolescents and to distinguish infection-associated symptoms from pandemic-associated symptoms, we conducted a Long-COVID19 survey, comparing responses from seropositive and seronegative adolescents. To our knowledge, data of Long-COVID19 surveys with seronegative control groups have not been published yet. Methods Since May 2020 students grade 8-12 in fourteen secondary schools in Eastern Saxony were enrolled in the SchoolCovid19 study. Seroprevalence was assessed via serial SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in all participants. Furthermore, during the March/April 2021 study visit all participants were asked to complete a 12 question Long-COVID19 survey regarding the occurrence and frequency of difficulties concentrating, memory loss, listlessness, headache, abdominal pain, myalgia/ arthralgia, fatigue, insomnia and mood (sadness, anger, happiness and tenseness). Findings 1560 students with a median age of 15 years participated in this study. 1365 (88%) were seronegative, 188 (12%) were seropositive. Each symptom was present in at least 35% of the students within the last seven days before the survey. However, there was no statistical difference comparing the reported symptoms between seropositive students and seronegative students. Whether the infection was known or unknown to the participant did not influence the prevalence of symptoms. Interpretation The lack of differences comparing the reported symptoms between seropositive and seronegative students suggests that Long-COVID19 might be less common than previously thought and emphasizing the impact of pandemic-associated symptoms regarding the well-being and mental health of young adolescents.

"Can remotely supervised exercise positively affect self-reported depressive symptoms and physical activity levels during social distancing?","The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the self-reported depressive symptoms and physical activity (PA) levels among participants who performed self- nonexercising (NE), guided exercise (SGE), remotely supervised exercise (RSE), and face-to-face supervised exercise (FFE) during social distancing. Three hundred and forty-four individuals (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years and 67% women) answered a self-reported online survey that included questions related to the physical exercise practice (e.g., supervised and remote) during social distancing and questions about perceptions of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Ãƒâ€¦sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated [MADRS-S] scores) and metabolic equivalent task minutes per week (METs minÃ¢â‚¬Â¢wk<sup>-1</sup>) of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA scores (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form) before and during social distancing. The RSE group (n=45) showed higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA than the SGE (n=146) and NE (n=109) groups. The RSE and FFE (n=44) groups showed higher METs of the total PA scores than the SGE and NE groups. The NE group showed higher MADRS-S scores than the other groups. Lower MADRS-S scores depend on the exercise practice and higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA depend on the supervised exercise practice. Thus, telehealth interventions can be implemented during the pandemic to enhance vigorous PA.","Moreira-Neto, Martins, Miliatto, Nucci, Silva-Batista","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113969","20210511","COVID-19; Home-based exercise; Inactivity; Mental health; Physical exercise; Supervision; Telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13642,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among local residents in South of Brazil: during pandemic times, youth sleep matters","Social isolation has been associated with poor sleep quality and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most studies included a heterogeneous sample with variances in social disruption policies and did not focus on a local profile with homogeneous prevention policies. Thus, the present study's purpose was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep quality in a specific region in South of Brazil with similar culture and social distance policies adopted by the local governments. This study was conducted with 327 individuals aged 18-72 years, living in &quot;Vale do Taquari&quot;, Brazil. We assessed sociodemographic variables and depression, anxiety, stress symptoms (DASS-21), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. Our results showed that sleep dysfunction moderated the effects of age on psychological symptoms, indicating that younger participants who had a lower sleep quality presented worse mental health. Further, the participants with more perceived stress during the pandemic and more sleep dysfunction reported more anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Psychological symptoms were not related to social isolation duration but to the subjective perception that the pandemic interfered with life and generated stressful situations. These results may help governments make important decisions about protection and isolation measures in the future waves of COVID-19 infection.","BÃƒÂ¼cker, Rosa, Czepielewski","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0225","20210511","COVID-19; mental health; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13643,""
"One year into the COVID-19 pandemic - temporomandibular disorders and bruxism: What we have learned and what we can do to improve our manner of treatment","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically changed the routine way of life and challenged the ways in which health and dental services are provided. During the 1st lockdown, practiced in most of the countries, routine dental procedures were suspended. Even after the lockdown was eased, visiting crowded dental clinics was still considered health-threatening, especially among populations at high risk of developing a severe reaction to COVID-19. Regretfully, in most cases, temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and bruxism were not included under the definition of emergency, leaving many patients without the possibility of consulting their dentists. A literature search, performed about 10 months after the declaration of the pandemic, found only a few studies dealing with TMD and bruxism during COVID-19. Most of the studies indicate adverse effects on subjects' psycho-emotional status (stress, anxiety, depression), which in turn lead to the intensification of subjects' TMD and bruxism symptoms, and increased orofacial pain. Unlike other oral pathologies, which require manual interventions, chronic orofacial pain can be addressed, at least at its initial stage, through teledentistry and/or consultation. Remote first aid for patients suffering from orofacial pain includes various kinds of treatment, such as the self-massage of tense and painful areas, stretching, thermotherapy, drug therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which can be administered through the phone and/or the Internet. Relevant legal and ethical issues should be considered while using remote modes for the triage, diagnosis and treatment of chronic orofacial pain patients.","Alona, Eli","https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/132896","20210511","COVID-19; bruxism; orofacial pain; teledentistry; temporomandibular disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13644,""
"Persons with Substance Abuse Disorders and Other Addictions: Coping with the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cuba implemented policies mandating social distancing on March 11, 2020, which were still in place at the time of this study. During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.","Fabelo-Roche, Iglesias-MorÃƒÂ©, GÃƒÂ³mez-GarcÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.37757/MR2021.V23.N2.2","20210511","COVID-19; Cuba; alcoholism; drug users; interview; medical informatics; psychological adaptation; psychological resilience; psychophysiologic disorders; qualitative research; substance-related disorders; tobacco use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13645,""
"Incorporating Medical Students into Primary Care Telehealth Visits: A Tutorial","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about sweeping change in healthcare delivery, shifting from in-person consultation to a virtual format. Few medical schools provide virtual medicine or telemedicine training to their learners, though this is likely to be important for future medical practice. This report communicates a framework to incorporate medical students into primary care telemedicine clinics. A third-year medical student and internal medicine attending from the Johns Hopkins University completed telemedicine clinic visits in April 2020 using a variety of video platforms and via telephone calls. Over four clinic days, we completed 9 telemedicine visits. Our patients were on average 68 years old, the majority were female (67%), and most appointments were completed via a video platform (67%). We additionally summarize our experience and describe (1) practical tips prior to the telehealth visit (2) technology considerations (3) during the telehealth visit (4) debriefing and feedback (5) challenges to care and (6) student, provider, and patient reactions to telemedicine visits. Telemedicine clinics are successfully used for managing patient with chronic conditions, low-risk urgent care visits, and mental health concerns. Patients report high patient satisfaction scores for telemedicine visits and the majority of patients are comfortable with having medical students as part of their care team. Moving forward, telemedicine will remain a popular avenue to receive health care. We have learned medical students can successfully be integrated into telemedicine clinics and they should be exposed to telehealth whenever possible prior to residency.","Balaji, Clever","https://doi.org/10.2196/24300","20210511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13646,""
"Impact of COVID-19 and Partial Lockdown on Access to Care, Self-Management and Psychological Well-being among People with Diabetes: A Cross-sectional Study","The impact of lockdown measures can be widespread, affecting both clinical and psychosocial aspects of health. This study aims to assess changes in health services access, self-care, behavioral and psychological impact of COVID-19 and partial lockdown amongst diabetes patients in Singapore. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey amongst people with diabetes with the Diabetes Health Profile-18 (DHP-18). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed for each DHP-18 subscale (Psychological Distress, Disinhibited Eating and Barriers to Activity) as dependent variables in separate models. Among 301 respondents, 45.2% were women, 67.1% of Chinese ethnicity, 24.2% were aged 40 to 49 years, 68.4% have Type 2 diabetes and 42.2% on oral medications alone. During the pandemic and the lockdown, nearly all respondents were able to receive care safely from at the clinics they attend (94%) and obtain their medications and diabetes equipment and supplies (97%) when needed. Respondents reported less frequent engagement in physical activity (38%), checking of blood pressure (29%) and blood glucose (22%). Previous diagnosis of mental health conditions (ÃŽÂ²= 9.33, p= 0.043), Type 1 diabetes (ÃŽÂ²= 12.92, p= 0.023), number of diabetes-related comorbidities (ÃŽÂ²= 3.16, p= 0.007) and Indian ethnicity (ÃŽÂ²= 6.65, p= 0.034) were associated with higher psychological distress. Comorbidities were associated with higher disinhibited eating (ÃŽÂ²= 2.49, p= 0.014) while ability to reach doctor despite not going to the clinic is negatively associated with psychological distress (ÃŽÂ²= -9.50 p= 0.002) and barriers to activity (ÃŽÂ²= -7.53, p= 0.007). Health services access were minimally affected but COVID-19 and lockdown had mixed impact on self-care and management behaviors. Greater clinical care and attention should be provided to people with diabetes with greater number of comorbidities and previous mental health disorders during the pandemic and lockdown.","Yeoh, Tan, Lee, Huan Tan, Low, Lim, Sum, Tavintharan, Wee","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14319","20210511","COVID-19; Diabetes; health services access; lockdown; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13647,""
"Nurses' and Physicians' Distress, Burnout, and Coping Strategies During COVID-19: Stress and Impact on Perceived Performance and Intentions to Quit","Health care providers (HCPs) have experienced more stress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit. Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.","Lou, Montreuil, Feldman, Fried, Lavoie-Tremblay, Bhanji, Kennedy, Kaneva, Harley","https://doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000365","20210511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13648,""
"Use of a Self-Guided Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Tool During COVID-19: An Evaluation Study","Internet-based programs can help provide accessible and inexpensive behavioral health care to those in need; however, the evaluation of these interventions has been mostly limited to controlled trials. Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary aim was to determine users' levels of stress and depression and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective was understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session 1 and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. Cumulative anonymous data from April through October 2020 were analyzed from 562 individuals. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. A total of 2,484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouse and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the Mood module were worry/anxiousness/stress and difficulty concentration or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% completing the Conflict Module, 17% completing session 1 of the Mood Module, and 14% completing session 1 of the Stress Module. Usability and acceptability scores for the Mood and Stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=0.03) and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all timepoints (P=0.01). Depression severity decreased by 20% (SD 35.2, P=0.6) between sessions 1 and 2. Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available online-based interventions.

As of late August 2020, over 25Ã‚Â million persons had been infected, and we will see the global death toll exceed oneÃ‚Â million by the end of 2020. Both are minimum estimates. All segments of society have been drastically affected. Schools worldwide have been forced to close due to illness and absenteeism, transmission and risk to vulnerable members of the school community, and community concerns. The decision to reopen school during a pandemic will have a tremendous impact on children's safety, growth, and well-being. Not opening invites social isolation and suboptimal educational experiences, especially for youth whose computing assets and online access are limited and those with special needs. The opening has hazards as well, and the mitigation of these risks is the topic of this chapter. Opening schools requires careful considerations of benefits, risks, and precautions. Guiding principles for safety and strategic application of the principles in each educational niche are critical issues to consider during school reopening. The fundamental principles of disease control involve school-directed initiatives (physical distancing and mask use, hand/face and surface cleansing, administrative controls, engineering controls) and individual-level risk reduction approaches to maximize adherence to new guidelines. The school-initiated &quot;top-down&quot; approaches and the individual-level &quot;bottom-up&quot; approaches must be synergized, as no single method will ensure safety. We discuss how to effectively layer strategies in each educational space to increase safety. Since the vulnerability of children has been heightened during this pandemic crisis, we highlight the special considerations for mental health support that should be considered by schools. The safety principles, disease control strategies, and other critical issues discussed here will serve as a starting point for developing a safe, comprehensive, and feasible reopening plan.","Li, Lin, Brault, Paquette, Vermund, Godri Pollitt","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_44","20210511","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Disease control strategies; Education; Pandemic; Quarantine; Reopening; Safety; School","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13651,""
"Treatment of Patients with Mental Illness Amid A Global COVID-19 Pandemic","A newly discovered coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is not only physically challenging but also has many subtle and overt mental impacts. The concern of being infected, lack of antiviral agents, preventive strategies of social distancing, and home isolation have created unrest in the society. The way of reacting to emergencies varies from individual to individual, and that this variability lies in our unique personality traits. The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the mental stability of all of us, and hence it is crucial to recognize the vulnerable population and support them to prevent or minimize the catastrophe like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional trauma, and suicides. In this context, the role of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and other mental healthcare providers is indispensable.","Jain, Sahu, Mitra","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_42","20210511","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Mental illness; Personality; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13652,""
"Mental Health in Health Professionals in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed enormous challenges to the healthcare systems worldwide, which are mainly shouldered by healthcare workers from all professions. This chapter outlines the potential stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic for health professionals and describes possible consequences for their mental health as well as potential interventions and coping strategies. The chapter is based on preliminary research on the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in health professionals and is complemented by findings from previous outbreaks of high-risk infectious diseases. High proportions of healthcare workers report acute symptoms of anxiety, depression, high psychological stress, and insomnia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coping strategies and self-care on an individual level, interventions on an institutional level such as specific training and institutional support, as well as social and psychological support can help to mitigate psychological strain. Further reliable and prospective studies regarding the mental health of health professionals, as well as further measures to protect their short- and long-term mental health, are required.","Bendau, StrÃƒÂ¶hle, Petzold","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_41","20210511","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Healthcare; Nurses; Physicians; Psychological distress; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13653,""
"The Main Sources and Potential Effects of COVID-19-Related Discrimination","The outbreak of a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which appeared in late 2019 and eventually resulted in the announcement of a pandemic by the World Health Organization, led to global fear and panic as well as the spread of false information and fake news from different sources. As a result, a sharp increase in prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia against different groups of people was observed in different geographical locations. This chapter presents the psychological and social sources of stereotypes and prejudices that take forms in the COVID-19 pandemic. These sources can be located in psychosocial processes, such as (i) socially generated and reinforced fears; (ii) human responses to stress induced by certain types of stimuli; (iii) sense of helplessness based on the lack of control over reality; (iv) psychological responses reinforced by conformism (crowd psychology); and (v) the stigmatization process. The chapter also presents the main groups of increased risk of experiencing prejudice and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic (Asians, health-care workers, COVID-19 patients, and their relatives). Moreover, it provides a documented example of such behaviors. The groups at higher risk of more adverse effects of COVID-19 due to pre-pandemic discrimination are also discussed. Finally, initiatives taken to mitigate the discrimination associated with COVID-19 are presented, as well as the recommendations and good practices for preventing these behaviors during future outbreaks and for limiting discrimination against COVID-19 until the disease can be contained.","Rzymski, Mamzer, Nowicki","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_39","20210511","COVID-19; Discrimination; Fear; Prejudice; SARS-CoV-2; Stigma; Xenophobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13654,""
"Exploration of the Epidemiological and Emotional Impact of Quarantine and Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Starting in December 2019 in Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has crossed the borders forming a pandemic in 2020. The absence of pharmacological interventions has pushed governments to apply different sets of old, non-pharmacological interventions, which are, though temporary, helpful to prevent further pandemic propagation. In the context of COVID-19, research confirms that quarantine is useful, mainly if applied early and if combined with other public health measures. However, the efficacy of quarantine and isolation is limited in many ways, ranging from legal issues and suspension of economic activities to mental health considerations. This chapter is an exploration of (i) epidemiological impact of isolation and quarantine; (ii) emotional impact of isolation and quarantine; and (iii) the possible effect of culture on quarantine experience.","Mojtabavi, Javidi, Naviaux, Janne, Gourdin, Mohammadpour, Saghazadeh, Rezaei","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_38","20210511","Anxiety; COVID-19; Emotional regulation; Iran; Quarantine; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13655,""
"Dietary Supplements for COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease that can rapidly escalate to respiratory failure and death. It has infected millions of people worldwide. The trajectory of this disease continues to progress in some areas of the United States and worldwide. The Institute for Health Metrics now predicts a resurgence of infections in the fall of 2020. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 includes an inflammatory phase with either resolution or the potential to accelerate to a cytokine storm, characterized by high interleukin (IL)-6 and other inflammatory markers. COVID-19 is a condition without a gold-standard treatment. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir in severe cases of COVID-19, which shortened the recovery time in hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection in one study. Although several vaccine trials are underway, no vaccines are available for primary prevention of COVID-19 at this time. Dietary supplement sales have dramatically risen during the COVID-19 pandemic despite depressed economic conditions. Commonly used immune-modulating dietary supplements, including vitamin D, ascorbic acid, zinc, and melatonin, are reviewed in this manuscript highlighting biological plausibility for salutary benefit against COVID-19. Ongoing clinical trials recruiting subjects at the time of this writing are provided for each dietary supplement.","Mullin, Limektkai, Wang, Hanaway, Marks, Giovannucci","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_29","20210511","COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Inflammasome; Melatonin; SARS-CoV-2; Vitamin C; Vitamin D; Zinc","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13656,""
"From Precision Metapharmacology to Patient Empowerment: Delivery of Self-Care Practices for Epilepsy, Pain, Depression and Cancer Using Digital Health Technologies","To improve long-term outcomes of therapies for chronic diseases, health promotion and lifestyle modifications are the most promising and sustainable strategies. In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps (digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions (metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This article also describes how digital therapies delivering &quot;medicinal&quot; self-care and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems.","Bulaj, Clark, Ebrahimi, Bald","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.612602","20210511","internet; mHealth; machine learning; pharmacy care; prescription medications; self-management; software as a medical device; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13657,""

"COVID-19 and the multidisciplinary care of patients with lung cancer: an evidence-based review and commentary","Delivering lung cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant and ongoing challenges. There is a lack of published COVID-19 and lung cancer evidence-based reviews, including for the whole patient pathway. We searched for COVID-19 and lung cancer publications and brought together a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to review and comment on the evidence and challenges. A rapid review of the literature was undertaken up to 28 October 2020, producing 144 papers, with 113 full texts screened. We focused on new primary data collection (qualitative or quantitative evidence) and excluded case reports, editorials and commentaries. Following exclusions, 15 published papers were included in the review and are summarised. They included one qualitative paper and 14 quantitative studies (surveys or cohort studies), with a total of 2295 lung cancer patients data included (mean study size 153 patients; range 7-803). Review of current evidence and commentary included awareness and help-seeking; lung cancer screening; primary care assessment and referral; diagnosis and treatment in secondary care, including oncology and surgery; patient experience and palliative care.

Despite the different approaches of countries to stop the spread of the virus and different infection rates, the dynamically developing pandemic has already affected the entire world. The consequences of the coronavirus for our mental health can be divided into those related to strategies for the prevention of infection, like isolation, quarantine, limitation of social contacts, and remote work, and those related to the direct impact of infection on our nervous system. This review aims to highlight the global effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on public mental health following social restrictions, to identify how infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may have direct neurophysiological effects and to compare the impact on public mental health between the USA, Australia, and Poland with Taiwan and Thailand.","BliÃ…Âºniewska-Kowalska, Halaris, Wang, Su, Maes, Berk, GaÃ…â€šecki","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.932220","20210511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13660,""
"THE YEAR IN REVIEW: MECHANICAL VENTILATION DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents the greatest medical crisis encountered in the young history of critical care and respiratory care. During the early months of the pandemic, when little was known about the virus, the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure it caused did not appear to fit conveniently or consistently into our classification of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This not only re-ignited a half-century's long simmering debate over taxonomy, but also fueled similar debates over how PEEP and lung-protective ventilation should be titrated, as well as the appropriate role of non-invasive ventilation in ARDS. Furthermore, COVID-19 ignited other debates on emerging concepts such as ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury from vigorous spontaneous breathing. Over a year later these early perplexities have receded into the background without having been reviewed or resolved. With a full year of evidence having been published this narrative review systematically analyzes whether or not COVID-19 associated respiratory failure is essentially ARDS, with perhaps a somewhat different course of presentation. This includes a review of the severity of hypoxemia and derangements in pulmonary mechanics, PEEP requirements, recruitment potential, the ability to achieve lung-protective ventilation goals, duration of mechanical ventilation, associated mortality, and response to non-invasive ventilation. It also reviews the concepts of ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury as these are crucial to understanding the contentious debate over the nature and management of COVID-19.","Kallet","https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.09257","20210511","Corona Virus Disease 2019; acute respiratory distress syndrome; lung-protective ventilation; noninvasive ventilation; patient self-inflicted lung injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13661,""
"Cross-sectional survey on physician burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vancouver, Canada: the role of gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation","To determine the prevalence of physician burnout during the pandemic and differences by gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. We conducted a cross-sectional survey (August-October in 2020) of internal medicine physicians at two academic hospitals in Vancouver, Canada. Physician burnout and its components, emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The response rate was 38% (n=302/803 respondents, 49% women,). The prevalence of burnout was 68% (emotional exhaustion 63%, depersonalisation 39%) and feeling low personal accomplishment 22%. In addition, 21% reported that they were considering quitting the profession or had quit a position. Women were more likely to report emotional exhaustion (OR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.73, p=0.03) and feeling low personal accomplishment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.09 to 4.70, p=0.03) than men. Visible ethnic minority physicians were more likely to report feeling lower personal accomplishment than white physicians (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.55, p=0.001). There was no difference in emotional exhaustion or depersonalisation by ethnicity or sexual orientation. Physicians who reported that COVID-19 affected their burnout were more likely to report any burnout (OR: 3.74, 95% CI: 1.99 to 7.01, p&lt;0.001) and consideration of quitting or quit (OR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.34 to 7.66, p=0.009). Burnout affects 2 out of 3 internal medicine physicians during the pandemic. Women, ethnic minority physicians and those who feel that COVID-19 affects burnout were more likely to report components of burnout. Further understanding of factors driving feelings of low personal accomplishment in women and ethnic minority physicians is needed.","Khan, Palepu, Dodek, Salmon, Leitch, Ruzycki, Townson, Lacaille","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050380","20210511","COVID-19; general medicine (see internal medicine); human resource management; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13662,""
"Telemedicine Psychiatric Consultation on an Inpatient Obstetrical Labor and Delivery Unit","Limited access to mental health resources has challenged clinicians in delivering early behavioral health interventions to perinatal populations. We describe telepsychiatry consultations to a rural hospital's labor and delivery unit. To demonstrate how consultation-liaison services during peripartum hospitalization could meet this need. One-year data from electronic medical records of women who were at risk of postpartum syndromes and offered a telepsychiatry consult was extracted and reviewed. A total of 85 consults were conducted via telepsychiatry primarily for depression, anxiety, and medication management. Bedside psychotherapeutic interventions and education were provided to 63 patients, medications were initiated for 32 patients, and outpatient referrals were made for 47 patients. Our results indicate that consultation-liaison telehealth can successfully engage at-risk mothers in psychiatric treatment.

"Psychometric properties of the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale in Spanish-speaking countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychometric studies are needed to decide the most suitable instrument in psychological research. Whereas Beck Depression Inventory has more psychometrics studies in Spanish-speaking countries, Beck Anxiety Inventory has less evidence. Additionally, anhedonia is a crucial construct to understand the relationship between depression and anxiety and their outcomes. However, there a scarce psychometric studies in anhedonia measures in non-English languages. Therefore, the first objective was to describe the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) psychometric properties. The second objective was to evaluate the measurement invariance of two psychometric scales, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), in 12 Spanish-speaking countries. The first included 1287 participants over 18 years of age from Chile. The second with a sample of 9954 participants from 12 Spanish-speaking countries. We analyze the construct, convergent, concurrent, and discriminant validities using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. This study showed good internal consistency for both scales. First, we provided evidence for construct validity, convergent validity, concurrent validity, and discriminant validity in a Chilean sample. Secondly, we established measurement invariance between Chile and those other 11 countries.

"Impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on mental health: evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in England and Scotland","The Covid-19 pandemic has been associated with worsening mental health but it is unclear whether this is a direct consequence of containment measures, like â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ orders, or due to other considerations such as fear and uncertainty about becoming infected. It is also unclear how responsive mental health is to a changing situation. Exploiting the different policy responses to COVID-19 in England and Scotland and using a difference-in-difference analysis, we show that easing lockdown measures significantly improves mental health in a short time span. Additionally, we show that those with lower socioeconomic status benefit more from relaxing the restrictions, whereas they suffered a larger deterioration in mental health where the lockdown was extended. As lockdown measures may continue to be necessary in the future, further efforts (both financial and mental health support) are required to minimize the consequences of COVID-19 containment policies for mental health.","Manuel Serrano-Alarcon et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-464-214","20210512","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; mental health; health economics; health inequality; lockdown; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-12","",13666,""
