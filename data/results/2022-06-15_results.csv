"The prevalence of mental ill-health in women during pregnancy and after childbirth during the Covid-19 pandemic: a Systematic review and Meta-analysis","Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARSCoV) is a respiratory disease causing coronavirus. SARSCoV has caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARSCoV in Hong King and SARSCoV2 (COVID19). COVID19, to date, have had the highest mortality and morbidity globally, thus reaching the pandemic status. In comparison to research conducted to explore the impact of pandemics on the general wellbeing, there appears to be a paucity on its association with womens mental health. Many pregnant women have reported that the pandemic negatively impacted their mental health. Aim This study aimed is to explore the prevalence of the impact of the COVID19, MERS and SARS pandemics on the mental health of pregnant women. Method A study protocol was developed and published in PROSPERO (CRD42021235356) to explore a number of key objectives. For the purpose of this study PubMed, Science direct, Ovid PsycINFO and EMBASE databases were searched from December 2000 to July 2021. The search results were screened, first by title, and then by abstract. A metaanalysis was conducted to report the findings. Results There were no studies reporting the mental health impact due to MERS and SARS. We systematically identified 316 studies that reported on the mental health of women that were pregnant and soon after birth. The metaanalysis indicated 24.9% (21.37% to 29.02%) of pregnant women reported symptoms of depression, 32.8% (29.05% to 37.21%) anxiety, 29.44% (18.21% to 47.61%) stress, 27.93% (9.05%to 86.15 %) PTSD, and 24.38% (11.89% to 49.96%) sleep disorders during the COVID19 pandemic. Furthermore, the I2 test showed a high heterogeneity value. Conclusion The importance of managing the mental health during pregnancy and after delivery improves the quality of life and wellbeing of mothers. Developing an evidence based mental health framework as part of pandemic preparedness to help pregnant women would improve the quality of care received during challenging times.

"Blending Internet-based and tele group treatment: Acceptability, effects, and mechanisms of change of cognitive behavioral treatment for depression","The current COV-19 pandemic increases the need for remote treatment. Among several provision strategies, tele groups have been tested as an efficient option. Still, the number of studies is comparably low, with a clear lack of studies investigating supposed treatment mechanisms. Sixty-one mildly to moderately depressed participants from Salzburg, Bavaria, and Upper Austria were randomized to the intervention or a waiting list control group (RCT). The seven-week treatment comprised preparatory online modules, followed by personalized feedback and a subsequent tele group session. Large treatment effects were observed for depression (CES-D: dÂ =Â 0.99, pÂ &lt;Â .001;PHQ-9: dÂ =Â 0.87, pÂ =Â .002), together with large effects for cognitive behavioral skills (cognitive style, and behavioral activation, dÂ =Â 0.88â€“0.97). Changes in skills mediated treatment outcomes for CES-D and PHQ-9, suggesting comparable mechanisms as in face-to-face therapy. Two typical moderators, therapeutic alliance, and group cohesion, however, failed to predict outcome (pÂ =Â .289), or only exhibited statistical tendencies (pÂ =Â .049 to .071). Client satisfaction, system usability, and treatment adherence were high. Blending Internet-based and tele group interventions offers additional options for low-threshold care that is less dependent on population density, commuting distances, or constraints due to the current COV-19 crisis. Results indicate that the blended intervention is clinically effective by fostering core CBT skills. While findings suggest the notion that working alliance and group cohesion can be established online, their relevancy for outcomes of blended treatment needs to be further investigated.","Schuster, Raphael, Fischer, Elena, Jansen, Chiara, Napravnik, Nathalie, Rockinger, Susanne, Steger, Nadine, Laireiter, Anton-Rupert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100551","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Internet Interventions;: 100551, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32770,""
"Domestic violence against women during the Covid-19 pandemic: A scoping review","Objectives This scoping review aims to assess the situation of violence against women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America, mainly in Brazil. Methods This study consists of a Scoping Review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. To conduct this review, we mapped scientific evidence on domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criteria were: journal articles on domestic violence set in Latin American countries, particularly Brazil, in the context of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, published between March 2020 and June of 2021. Articles that were not published in journals, studies focusing on child violence or the elderly population, suicide-related approaches, editorials and letters to readers were excluded. The databases used were: National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Embase, COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Scopus Preview, Web of Science, LILAC's, Database of the best Evidence-Based Health (Epistemonikos) with the following strategic keywords: ""domestic violence"" ""female'/exp OR female"" ""domestic violence AND women"" ""SARS-CoV-19"") AND (""domestic violence"") SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""2020-nCoV"". The databases above were accessed in July 2021. The articles selected from the databases were synthetized following the double-check procedure and the topics that were most relevant to the subject discussed were separated. The articles used were in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Results We discussed domestic violence against women in the context of social isolation, showing a significant increase and highlighting aggravating factors - financial instability, exacerbation of the female workload, increase in drug and alcohol consumption, lack of access to care services - and statistics that demonstrate the significant increase in countries such as Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay and Brazil, especially in SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, ParanÃ¡, among other states. Despite the meaningful increase in the number of cases and the aggravating factors for domestic violence against women in Latin America and Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reality of underreporting, resulting, among others, from limited legal, social and economic support and the lack of well-prepared intersectoral services may be a limitation in this scenario, since the situation can be even more acute. We presented measures adopted in Brazil and alternatives to confront the critical situation of domestic violence against women, aggravated by social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 18 most relevant articles were read twice by each author, following the â€œDouble-Checkâ€ protocol. The articles used addressed important questions around the established goals: (a) characteristics of the current scenarios in Latin America and, specifically, in Brazil, with regard to violence against women;(b) factors that intensify this type of violence;(c) numbers that demonstrate an increase in cases;and finally (e) strategies to combat domestic violence against women. A total of 595 articles were found, then, based on the s presented, 18 articles were used to write this scoping review.","de Souza Santos, Debora, Bittencourt, Eloisa Auler, de Moraes Malinverni, AndrÃ©a Cristina, Kisberi, Juliany Barreto, de FranÃ§a VilaÃ§a, Sabrina, Iwamura, Edna Sadayo Miazato","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2022.100276","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Forensic Science International: Reports; 5:100276, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32771,""
"Care Work and Social Justice in Creative Arts Therapy: Putting Queer Performance Theory and Disability Justice in Conversation with Drama Therapy","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased existing health disparities for the LGBTQIA2S+ community, reducing (or eliminating) access to healthcare through traditional pathways and increasing the value and necessity of community care. Putting queer performance theory in conversation with disability justice frameworks allows for exploration of how the creative arts therapies â€“ and drama therapy specifically â€“ can adapt to meet the emerging needs of marginalized populations. Situating drama therapy within a queer disability justice lens can support drama therapists in reclaiming the most revolutionary aspects of drama therapy theory and principles. Contrasting clinical and community-based approaches to drama therapy via autoethnography, limitations of the medical model of mental healthcare are interrogated while offering examples of alternative approaches to providing care rooted in activism and community organizing.","Sayre, Dana N.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2022.101940","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Arts in Psychotherapy;: 101940, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32772,""
"Prevalence, progress, and subgroup disparities in pharmacological antidepressant treatment of those who screen positive for depressive symptoms: A repetitive cross-sectional study in 19 European countries","Background The European Mental Health Action Plan (EMHAP) 2013-2020 promoted community-based mental health services. One potential success indicator is the provision of antidepressant medication to those needing it.Methods Public data from two surveys (Health Survey for England, UK;Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) covered 19 European countries across EMHAP phases one (2011-2015) and two (2015-2018). People screening positive for depressive symptoms by self-report were included. The primary outcome was antidepressant use: using country-specific weighted regression models, we estimated temporal trends and subgroup disparities in antidepressant receipt, with secondary analysis by country-level measures including healthcare expenditure.Findings Across 37,250 participants, after controlling for age, sex, wealth, and physical disability, antidepressant use (amongst those screening positive) increased significantly in 14/19 countries, with the smallest increase being in Slovenia (adjusted OR[AOR] for trend=1.68[1.20-2.36]) and the highest increase being in Germany (AOR for trend=10.07[7.54-13.46]) and Austria (AOR for trend=10.07[7.32-13.74]). The overall proportion using antidepres-sants was positively associated with national health expenditure (coefficient=5.43[1.62-9.25]), but not with gross national income per capita or the number of psychiatrists, general practitioners, or psychiatric hospital beds. In 15/ 19 countries, antidepressants were used less by &gt;= 65-year-olds than 50-64-year-olds, with the smallest differential reported in Luxembourg (AOR=0.70[0.49, 0.98]) and the highest in Germany (AOR=0.28[0.21, 0.37]);this disparity widened in 12/15 countries. Men used antidepressants less than women in 8/19 countries, across phases. In 13/19 countries, people with physical disability were more likely to receive antidepressants, with the smallest gap in Italy (AOR=1.42[1.12-1.80]) and the largest in Israel (AOR=2.34[1.46-3.74]);this disparity narrowed in 5/13 countries. Disparity by wealth was found in 8/19 countries, but its temporal trend varied.Interpretation Usage of antidepressants by those with depressive symptoms has increased, with wide variation between countries and subgroups. Disparities across age, sex, and disability should prompt further research.","Chen, S. Q.; Ford, T. J.; Jones, P. B.; Cardinal, R.

"THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT","COVID-19 has had a profound effect on our mental health services. In a short period of time, mental health services have had to re-configure to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This has resulted in the closure of day services, reduced in-person psychiatric support and social isolation, leaving some of society's most vulnerable in crisis. The purpose of this study is to identify any differences in the number and severity of emergency presentations to the Emergency Department (ED). The study is a retrospective review of the log of patients referred to the liaison psychiatry team at an Inner-City Dublin hospital from the ED or inpatients wards where self-harm was the reason for admission. Three timeframes were chosen between January and June 2020: a baseline group (T1), lockdown (T2) and re-opening of society (T3). Severity of presentation was measured using the Threshold Assessment Grid1. (TAG) and DUNDRUM readmission scales2. from the anonymised database (n=306). Data were analysed using the application SPSS. There was a significant increase in self-harm presentations in T2 and T3 (T2 - 55.1% n=27 & T3 - 38.1% n=16) with the highest incidence during the first lockdown (T2). Psychiatric admissions rose during the pandemic, highest in T3 with an admission rate of 26.8% (n=11) compared to baseline (19.9%, n=39 T1, p value 0.733). The results demonstrate the impact of the first few months of the COVID- 19 pandemic on psychiatric services. Further research is required to fully understand the impact and the needs of this population. (Table Presented).","Springael, M.; Doherty, A.

"A comparative study to find out/assess the impact of lockdown on the mental health of the general population and covid-19 frontline health care workers","Background: Lockdown is an emergency situation which has confined people to their homes, states and country. Individuals felt insecure and worried about their financial matters and their mental health was affected at some point of time during the corona virus pandemic lockdown. Aim: The study aimed to assess the effect of lockdown on mental health between the general population and covid-19 frontline health care workers. Material and Methods: The survey was conducted from July to October 2020 using DSM -5 Self-Rated level 1 cross-cutting symptom measure -Adult scale, circulated through social media platform (Google forms). In this study, 180 participants were enrolled. Hindi version of the measure was used to assess the psychological impact on the participants and a score of 0 was considered as NO and was taken as a Negative response and scores 1 to 4, were considered as YES and were taken as a positive responses. Result: A total of 180 responses were obtained during the survey, amongst them 36.67% were male and 63.33%were female. Frontline healthcare workers were 51.67% and among the Non-health care workers, unemployed were 10%, Student were 17.78%, and the remaining working were 56.67%. As per DSM 5 Crosscutting symptoms scores, the most common reported psychological symptoms were Anxiety 81.11%, Depression 52.78%, Sleep problems 29.44%, and Substance use 25%,. The comparison between both the groups was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.001). However, non-healthcare workers experienced more psychological symptoms. conclusion: The covid-19 lockdown was associated with poor mental health across individuals.the lockdown was observed to be a stressful situation that could have precipitated psychological symptoms like anxiety, stress, depression, and sleep disturbance in the individuals.","Tak, N.; Soni, A.; Suwalka, A.; Modi, R.; Bhasker, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+comparative+study+to+find+out/assess+the+impact+of+lockdown+on+the+mental+health+of+the+general+population+and+covid-19+frontline+health+care+workers","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Molecular and Clinical Medicine; 9(3):3019-3029, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32778,""

"Systematic review of changed smoking behaviour, smoking cessation and psychological states of smokers according to cigarette type during the COVID-19 pandemic","Although the global COVID-19 pandemic has increased interest in research involving high-risk smokers, studies examining changed smoking behaviours, cessation intentions and associated psychological states among smokers are still scarce. This study aimed to systematically review the literature related to this subject. A systematic review of published articles on cigarettes and <i>COVID-19</i>-related topics DATA SOURCES: Our search was conducted in January 2021. We used the keywords COVID-19, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and psychological factors in PubMed and ScienceDirect and found papers published between January and December 2020. We included articles in full text, written in English, and that surveyed adults. The topics included smoking behaviour, smoking cessation, psychological state of smokers and COVID-19-related topics. Papers of low quality, based on quality assessment, were excluded. Thirteen papers were related to smoking behaviour, nine papers were related to smoking cessation and four papers were related to psychological states of smokers. Owing to the COVID-19 lockdown, cigarette users were habituated to purchasing large quantities of cigarettes in advance. Additionally, cigarette-only users increased their attempts and willingness to quit smoking, compared with e-cigarette-only users. Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, the intention to quit smoking was different among smokers, according to cigarette type (cigarette-only users, e-cigarette-only users and dual users). With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, policies and campaigns to increase smoking cessation intentions and attempts to quit smoking among smokers at high risk of COVID-19 should be implemented. Additionally, e-cigarette-only users with poor health-seeking behaviour require interventions to increase the intention to quit smoking.","Chun, Cheon, Hwang","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055179","20220614","COVID-19; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32793,""
"Precarious work among personal support workers in the Greater Toronto Area: a respondent-driven sampling study","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of personal support workers (PSWs) in health care, as well as their work conditions. Our study aimed to understand the characteristics of the PSW workforce, their work conditions and their job security, as well as to explore the health of PSWs and the impact of precarious employment on their health. Our community-based participatory action research focused on PSWs in the Greater Toronto Area. We administered an online, cross-sectional survey between June and December 2020 using respondent-driven sampling. Data on sociodemographics, employment precarity, worker empowerment and health status were collected. We assessed the association between precarious employment and health using multivariable logistic regression models. We contacted 739 PSWs, and 664 consented to participate. Overall, 658 (99.1%) completed at least part of the survey. Using data adjusted for our sampling approach, the participants were predominantly Black (76.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 68.2%-84.9%), women (90.1%, 95% CI 85.1%-95.1%) and born outside of Canada (97.4%, 95% CI 94.9%-99.9%). Most worked in home care (43.9%, 95% CI 35.2%-52.5%) or long-term care (34.5%, 95% CI 27.4%-42.0%). Although most participants had at least some postsecondary education (unadjusted proportion = 83.4%, <i>n</i> = 529), more than half were considered low income (55.1%, 95% CI 46.3%-63.9%). Most participants were precariously employed (86.5%, 95% CI 80.7%-92.4%) and lacked paid sick days (89.5%, 95% CI 85.8%-93.3%) or extended health benefits (74.1%, 95% CI 66.8%-81.4%). Nearly half of the participants described their health as less than very good (46.7%, 95% CI 37.9%-55.5%). Employment precarity was significantly associated with higher risk of depression (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03). Despite being key members of health care teams, most PSWs were precariously employed with low wages that keep them in poverty; the poor work conditions they faced could be detrimental to their physical and mental health. Equitable strategies are needed to provide decent work conditions for PSWs and to improve their health.","Pinto, Hapsari, Ho, Meaney, Avery, Hassen, Jetha, Lay, Rotondi, Zuberi","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210338","20220614","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32794,""
"Mediating Effect of Public Service Motivation and Resilience on the Association Between Work-Related Stress and Work Engagement of Public Workers in the COVID-19 Pandemic","We aimed to explore the influence of public workers' distress or viral anxiety on their level of depression and work engagement during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, we ascertain the mediation effect of resilience and public service motivation on this association. A total of 300 public workers participated in this online survey. Their demographic characteristics and responses to survey items were collected using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items Scale, the Public Service Motivation (PSM) Scale, the Nine-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Korean Occupational Stress Scale-Short Form, and the Brief Resilience Scale. Work engagement of public workers was expected by PSM (ÃŽÂ²=0.28, p&lt;0.001), resilience (ÃŽÂ²=0.30, p&lt;0.001), and work-related stress (ÃŽÂ²=-0.40, p&lt;0.001) (F=57.4, p&lt;0.001). Depression was expected by fewer years of employment (ÃŽÂ²=-0.12, p=0.02), viral anxiety (ÃŽÂ²= 0.21, p&lt;0.001), and low resilience (ÃŽÂ²=-0.42, p&lt;0.001) (F=22.1, p&lt;0.001). Resilience and PSM partially mediated the effects of work-related stress on work engagement. Depression was influenced by COVID-19-induced viral anxiety, and their resilience-but not PSM-mediated the association. Public workers' resilience and PSM partially mediated the effects of work-related stress on work engagement. The influence of viral anxiety on public workers' depression was mediated by their resilience but not PSM.","Jeong, Cho, Kim, Lee, Choi, Kim, Kim, Yoo, Chung","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0403","20220614","COVID-19; Psychological; Public; Stress; Work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32795,""
"Visiting parents in times of COVID-19: The impact of parent-adult child contacts on the psychological health of the elderly","Using the 8th wave of the SHARE and the SHARE Corona Survey, we investigated whether the disruption of parent-adult child contacts due to social distancing restrictions increased the symptoms of depression among old age individuals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We model the relationship between the disruption of parent-adult child contacts and the mental health of the elderly using a recursive simultaneous equation model for binary variables. Our findings show that the likelihood of disruption of parent-adult child contacts was higher with adult children who do not live with or close to their parents (i.e., in the same household or in the same building) for whom contact disruption increases about 15 %. The duration of restrictions to movement and lockdowns also has a positive and significant effect on parent-child contact disruption: an additional week of lockdown significantly increases the probability of parent-child contact disruption, by about 1.5 %. The interventions deemed essential to reduce the spread of the pandemic, such as the ""stay-at-home"" order, necessarily disrupted personal parent-child contacts and the social processes that facilitate psychological well-being, increasing the probability of suffering from a deepening depressed mood by about 17 % for elderly parents.","Brugiavini, Di Novi, Orso","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2022.101152","20220614","COVID-19; Disruption; Mental health; ParentÃ¢â‚¬â€œadult child relationship; Stay-at-home order","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32796,""
"Tele-medicine and improvement of mental health problems in COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","Tele-medicine services have been developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupts mental health services. The present study investigates the effectiveness of telephone-delivered services for psychological disorders in the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials for relevant clinical studies up to February 1, 2022.

Twelve relevant clinical articles were included in our study. Eight articles were parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two were Quasi-experimental, and one was a multicenter retrospective cohort study. A total of 1900 adults (18Ã‚Â years old or above that) were included. Online telecommunication methods like online apps and videoconference were the most common interventions. The most prevalent measured outcome was levels of anxiety and depression among participants. Eleven out of 12 articles showed a significant association between telemedicine and mental health improvement. The included studies in the current systematic review reported the probable efficacy of telemedicine in improving mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is not possible to determine the best telecommunication method for each mental disorder in different populations and the preference of patients is still face to face therapy. So RCTs in different populations with previous mental disorders or chronic diseases are required to investigate the further telemedicine's efficacy on managing mental problems.","Hatami, Deravi, Danaei, Zangiabadian, Shahidi Bonjar, Kheradmand, Nasiri","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1924","20220614","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental disorder; tele-medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32797,""
"Promoting Physical Activity Among University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, sanitary context and e-learning have greatly modified student lifestyles and led to deteriorations in their mental health. An increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms and sedentary behaviors, reduction in physical activity, and a stronger tendency to move toward unhealthy diet have been demonstrated. This finding highlights the need for innovative interventions to promote healthy lifestyle among students. This research protocol aims to evaluate the effects of an intervention program on the lifestyle and psychological state of students. Students from University of NÃƒÂ®mes were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 following conditions: an intervention group and a control group. Participants in the intervention group were engaged in an 8-week physical activity program. Prior to the start of the program, design-based innovative workshops were conducted with participants to ensure that the program was co-constructed by the users and met their specific needs. Students in the control group did not receive any intervention. For each group, measures of physical activity, sedentary time, anthropometric data, sleep, physical condition, and psychological variables (eg, anxiety, depression, motivation, body appreciation, perceived control, well-being) were conducted at baseline and 9 weeks later. A total of 110 participants were initially included. Reporting of the results is projected for the spring of 2022. It is anticipated that this innovative intervention co-constructed by pairs will promote a healthier lifestyle and psychological health in students. There is every reason to believe that a mobilized co-construction approach is a promising strategy to limit unhealthy habits and promote physical activity while increasing motivation. The development and evaluation of interventions to address the specific needs of university students is essential and could be transferred to other vulnerable populations such as people with chronic diseases or older people.

"Training Military Psychiatrists to Adapt and Overcome: How COVID-19 Highlighted the Unique Flexibility of Military Psychiatry in Training and in the Fleet","Born out of necessity, military medicine continues to find itself at the forefront of medical innovation. This generation of military physicians has never previously been challenged with continuing to provide top notch medical support to servicemembers in a variety of operational settings in the midst of a global pandemic. While military medicine has always been able to uniquely meet the educational goals of residency training, COVID-19 brought new challenges to the forefront. While the threat presented by COVID-19 was different from the historical battlefield threats and challenges that have given birth to military medicine, it was nevertheless ready to pivot and adjust course, focusing on how to best meet the medical needs of the military patient population in an ever-changing geopolitical environment while continuing to meet and exceed the educational standards that training programs are held to. Historically and currently, mental health remains one of the most common reasons that servicemembers are evacuated from combat zones. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for modern military psychiatry to showcase its ability to adjust the educational focus in certain areas of residency training to prepare the next generation of military psychiatrists to be able to face the newest threat to force wellness.","Quinn, Dickinson, Shukla","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01342-3","20220614","COVID-19; Graduate Medical Education (GME); Military; Psychiatry; Residency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32799,""
"Covid-19 Social Distancing, Lifestyle and Health Outcomes Among Persons Living with HIV (PLWH): A Web-based Survey","We investigated changes in lifestyle, depressive symptoms, self-perception of health, and body weight changes of persons living with HIV (PLWH) during the COVID-19 social distancing (SD). In a Web-based cross-sectional survey, participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°406) were questioned about lifestyle and health status before and during SD. Most responders were men, 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, high education level; 49.8% had their income reduced during SD. About 9% were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 13.5% required hospitalization. During SD: - most participants did not change their food intake, although 25% replaced healthy foods with unhealthy ones; -more than half mentioned poor sleep quality; -about 50% increased their sedentary behavior. Depressive symptoms (reported by 70.9%) were associated with sedentary behavior, poor sleep quality, and reduced income. About one-third had a negative perception of their health status, which was inversely associated with practicing physical exercises and positively associated with sedentarism and poor sleep quality. More than half increased their body weight, which was associated with a lower intake of vegetables. The older age reduced the odds of the three outcomes. Carefully monitoring PLWH regarding SD will enable early interventions toward health.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Sleep of Undergraduate Students: A Systematic Literature Review","The 2019 coronavirus pandemic forced the shift to distance education aggravating mental and physical vulnerabilities of undergraduate students, including sleep. This review aims to describe sleep problem rates and prevalence, sleep pattern disruption, sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, psychological and socio-economic factors affecting sleep of undergraduates in 22 countries. A systematic search for articles published from 2020-2021 using ""COVID-19,"" ""Coronavirus,"" ""Pandemic,"" ""Sleep,"" ""Mental Health,"" and ""Students"" from PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane yielded 2550 articles, where 72 were included. Selection criteria were: English full-text available articles, undergraduates and not postgraduates, reported sleep outcomes, and participants not from allied health courses. Risk of bias was assessed using various Joanna Briggs Institute checklists and outcomes were descriptively synthesized. Prevalence of sleep problems was notable, while longitudinal studies showed increased rates. There was significantly increased sleep duration, and sleep pattern disruption during lockdowns. Several psychological, behavioral, environmental, demographic, and socio-economic factors were found to be associated with sleep changes. These highlight the pandemic's impact on sleep of undergraduate students and reveal opportunities for institutions to intervene with policies and programs to promote the well-being of undergraduates.

"Analysis of the Spiritual Orientations and the Hopelessness Levels of the Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study aims to identify the spiritual orientations and hopelessness levels of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In this study designed as cross-sectional and correlational research, the sample was comprised of 199 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a research hospital located in eastern Turkey. Data were collected between December 2020 and January 2021. The research data were collected online by using survey form, the Spiritual Orientation Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale to reduce face-to-face interaction due to the isolation policy. The collected data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, the t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. The mean scores obtained by the participant COVID-19 patients from the Spiritual Orientations Scale and the Beck Hopelessness Scale were found, respectively, as 96.13 Ã‚Â± 20.16 and 6.15 Ã‚Â± 4.59 points. It was determined that the participants of the study had a high-level of spiritual orientations and low-level hopelessness, and there was a negative correlation between them (p &lt; .05). In this study, it was identified that the participant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had high-level spiritual orientations and low-level hopelessness. It was found that as the participant COVID-19 patients had higher spiritual orientation levels, their hopelessness levels fell. Spirituality can reduce hopelessness by strengthening the coping mechanisms of COVID-19 patients. It can increase the psychological resistance of patients by increasing positive thoughts.","BÃƒÂ¼yÃƒÂ¼kbayram, Aksoy, Ã…Å¾ayan","https://doi.org/10.54614/FNJN.2022.21068","20220614","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32802,""
"Anxiety and Depression Levels of Nurses in the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Effect in Menstrual Cycle","This study aimed to identify how anxiety and depression levels of female nurses were affected during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic and its effect on their menstruation cycles. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 522 female nurses. The data were collected using an online Google questionnaire for sociodemographic and menstrual characteristics and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, the chi-squared test, and binary logistic regression. The data were obtained from an online Google questionnaire for sociodemographic and menstrual characteristics and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale from August to October 2020. According to the findings, 53.3% of participants were at risk for anxiety and 66.3% were at risk for depression. While 58.6% of them had experienced menstrual irregularities in the last 6 months, 72.9 of them were at risk for depression, and 59.8 of them were at risk for anxiety. Logistic regression found a significant association between anxiety, depression, and regular menstruation. The anxiety levels of the nurses with irregular menstruation were 1.114 times higher and their depression levels were 1.119 times higher. This study determined female nurses' anxiety and depression levels during the pandemic and their effect on the nurses' menstrual patterns. Female nurses are at risk of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, and this affects their menstrual cycles negatively.","Hazar, BakÃ„Â±r, YaÃ„Å¸Ã„Â±z AltÃ„Â±ntaÃ…Å¸, Kavlak","https://doi.org/10.54614/FNJN.2022.21198","20220614","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32803,""

Total reported time in bed (a proxy for sleep duration) increased on weekdays by an average of 1.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â± 1.8Ã‚Â hours (pÃ‚Â &lt; .001) during COVID-19, compared to retrospective report of time in bed prior to COVID-19. During COVID-19, 81.3% of adolescents reported spending 8Ã‚Â hours or more in bed on weekdays compared to only 53.5% prior to COVID-19. On weekdays, bedtimes were delayed on average by 2.5Ã‚Â hours and wake times by 3.8Ã‚Â hours during COVID-19 compared to prior to COVID-19. On weekends, bedtimes were delayed on average by 1.6Ã‚Â hours and waketimes by 1.5Ã‚Â hours (all p's &lt; 0.001). Social jetlag of &gt;2Ã‚Â hours decreased to 6.3% during COVID-19 compared to 52.1% prior to COVID-19. Anxiety and depression symptoms and a decline in physical activity during COVID-19 were associated with delayed bed and wake times during COVID-19. During COVID-19, adolescents reported spending more time in bed, with most adolescents reporting 8Ã‚Â hours of sleep opportunity and more consistent sleep schedules. As schools return to in-person learning, additional research should examine how sleep schedules may change due to school start times and what lessons can be learned from changes that occurred during COVID-19 that promote favorable adolescent sleep.","L Wesley, Cooper, Brinton, Meier, Honaker, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2022.2086871","20220614","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32804,""
"Care home managers' views on the media coverage of COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes for older adults: A case study in Stockholm","The COVID-19 pandemic has particularly affected older adults and resulted in high rates of infections and deaths in care homes. We have conducted a case study in which three managers of care homes for older adults in central Stockholm have shared their thoughts on the media coverage of care homes for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed the data using conventional content analysis and identified three themes and five categories. The results show that the managers experienced the media coverage of care homes during the pandemic to be negative and incomplete, causing feelings of sadness and shame amongst themselves and their staff. The negative media coverage further generated added workload as they had to arrange for discussions to answer questions by staff and close relatives of the residents. Informants also thought that there is a lack of knowledge about the role of care homes and subsequently what to expect of them. Finally, informants reported that the pandemic might create an opportunity for system-level policy changes. In light of this, we discuss possible victim blaming of staff and how greater public awareness of the care home sector could facilitate for a debate on policy changes and the low social status of caring for older adults.","Morath, BurstrÃƒÂ¶m, Liljas","https://doi.org/10.1111/opn.12483","20220614","COVID-19; ageing; interviews; media; nursing homes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32805,""
"Strange themes in pandemic dreams: Insomnia was associated with more negative, anxiousÃ‚Â and death-related dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic","Dreaming and insomnia are important markers of distress in times of crisis. Here, we present a longitudinal, mixed-methods study examining changes in dreaming between individuals with and without insomnia symptoms and their relationship to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A global survey examining insomnia symptoms, dreams and mental health was launched in April 2020 and followed participants over 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Of 2214 participants, 1009 (45%) reported dream changes at baseline. A higher proportion of participants with new-onset insomnia reported dream changes (55%) than those with pre-existing insomnia (45%) or good sleepers (36%). Overall, thematic analysis identified key dream change themes of increased dream activity, with participants dreaming vividly, in high-definition, and with a strong negative charge. Themes around survival, adjusting to pandemic life, meaning-making and poor sleep quality were also noted. Linguistic Inquiry Word Count showed that individuals with insomnia used more negative words to describe their dream changes than good sleepers. Specifically, the new-onset insomnia group used more anxious and death-related words than those who slept well. Notably, all groups experienced a significant reduction in dream activity by 3-month follow-up. Lastly, dream changes were associated with worse mental health symptoms over time, and this effect was more pronounced in individuals with insomnia. Our results highlight that insomnia symptoms, especially new-onset insomnia, are associated with more negative dream changes during collective stressful events, potentially compounding daytime distress and mental health symptoms over time. During times of crisis, dreaming and insomnia may reveal an important target for mental health interventions.","Meaklim, Burge, Le, Bains, Saunders, Ghosh, Junge, Varma, Rehm, Jackson","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13655","20220614","acute insomnia; dreaming; longitudinal study; mental health; mixed-methods; thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32806,""
"Thoughts of suicide or self-harm among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses","Healthcare workers are at higher risk of suicide than other occupations, and suicidal thoughts appear to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the experiences of healthcare workers with frequent thoughts of suicide or self-harm during the pandemic, including factors that contributed to their distress, and the supports that they found helpful. We used content analysis to analyse free-text responses to the Australian COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers Study, from healthcare workers who reported frequent thoughts that they would be better off dead or of hurting themselves, on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A total of 262 out of 7795 healthcare workers (3.4%) reported frequent thoughts of suicide or self-harm in the preceding 2 weeks. They described how the pandemic exacerbated pre-existing challenges in their lives, such as living with a mental illness, working in an unsupportive environment and facing personal stressors like relationship violence or unwell family members. Further deterioration in their mental health was triggered by heavier obligations at home and work, amid painful feelings of loneliness. They reported that workplace demands rose without additional resources, social and emotional isolation increased and many healthful activities became inaccessible. Tokenistic offers of support fell flat in the face of multiple barriers to taking leave or accessing professional help. Validation of distress, improved access to healthcare and a stronger sense of belonging were identified as helpful supports. These findings highlight the need for better recognition of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating and protective factors for thoughts of suicide and self-harm among healthcare workers.","Bismark, Smallwood, Jain, Willis","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.509","20220614","COVID-19; healthcare workers; patient safety; self-harm; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32807,""

"Did Personality Type Influence Burn Out Syndrome Manifestations During Covid-19 Pandemic?","Emergency department (ED) health care providers had one of the highest incidences of burnout just before the pandemic. Personality type influences the way we communicate and relate to others, as well as our reaction to stress. In evaluating the causes of burnout, we take into account several factors, the most important of which being the conditions of the professional environment, interpersonal relationships and personality traits. This study aims to identify and analyze the relationships between personality traits and burnout syndrome in medical staff in the Emergency Department. A descriptive, multicenter cross-sectional study project was used to collect data from 60 physicians and nurses from the Emergency Department of the County Emergency Clinical Hospital Galati. The tools used, distributed to participants to collect socio-demographic details, included the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), and a pilot questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions, concerning exhaustion level, and focused on stress-generating elements and emotional management in the Emergency Department during the pandemic. A large percentage of doctors in ED (45.8%) (n = 24) indicated a high level of exhaustion, while only 30.6% (n = 36) of nurses indicated a high level of exhaustion. Physicians displayed a higher level of stress than nurses, with 66.6% (n = 24) of physicians indicating an increased level of stress, compared to only 36.1% (n = 36) of nurses. A large percentage of nurses indicated a high level of depression (36.1%), whereas only 25% of Emergency Department physicians indicated a high level of depression. The individuals with a melancholic and choleric temperament, as rated by the EPI, appeared more susceptible to developing burnout syndrome. The indication of instability or neuroticism appears to enhance the occurrence of burnout syndrome. There was also a correlation between extraversion and a high level of burnout, with extraverted individuals more easily reaching a high level of burnout. The results indicate a greater occurrence of exhaustion and stress in Emergency Department physicians compared to nurses in the Emergency Department. From the results, we can propose that there is a relationship between the personality traits as measured by the EPI and the occurrence of burnout syndrome. These findings may help to understand the vulnerability of medical staff to burnout, and to pre-emptively support them to deal effectively with stressors in the work environment.","Moscu, Marina, Anghele, Anghele, Dragomir","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S353405","20220614","Covid-19; burnout syndrome; emergency staff; extraversion; neuroticism; personality evaluation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32809,""
"Prospective assessment of stress and health concerns of radiation oncology staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid and repetitive adjustment of radiotherapy practice, hospital-level and department-level organization and hygiene measures. To prospectively monitor and manage stress levels and health concerns, employees of a radiation oncology department were invited to participate in weekly online surveys during the first year of the pandemic. Starting March 31st, 2020, cross-sectional online surveys were distributed to all employees of the Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich. The survey included questions about the profession, the work setting, the global stress level as well as the health concerns during the past work week. Stress levels and health concerns were assessed on a 10-point scale. SurveyMonkeyÃ‚Â® was used to conduct the survey. Distribution was performed via email. Participation was anonymous and voluntary. Between March 2020 and February 2021, 50 weekly surveys were distributed to 127 employees on average and resulted in 1,877 individual responses. The average response rate was 30%. The mean global stress level varied significantly by profession, ranging from 2.7 (Ã‚Â±2.5) points for administrative staff to 6.9 (Ã‚Â±2.3) points for radiation therapy technicians (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). The mean global stress level was highest with 4.8 (Ã‚Â±2.9) points for in-hospital work with direct patient contact. Health concerns were highest regarding family and friends with 4.0 (Ã‚Â±3.1) points on average. Changes of the stress level varied in correlation with infection waves. Weekly online surveys for prospective assessment of stress levels and health concerns were successfully conducted during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating their feasibility and value to monitor profession and workplace specific stress patterns and to allowed for tailored interventions.

"Associations of Food Insecurity and Material Social Support with Parent and Child Mental Health During COVID-19","The rise of mental health problems during COVID-19 has been called a national crisis. Parents and caregivers reported parenting stress, anxiety, and depression, which may be exacerbated by economic insecurity. This study used longitudinal data to examine the association of food insecurity and material social support to subsequent parent and child mental health outcomes in the early weeks of COVID-19. Data were collected from a national convenience sample of U.S. parents (N = 359) at two time points: April 14, 2020 (T1) and April 30, 2020 (T2). Data were analyzed using multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses. Most of the sample were mothers (67.5%) and identified as White (69.6%). Among parents for whom services were applicable, over half (51.4%) were unable to receive free and reduced-cost school-based lunch. Food insecurity at T1 was significantly associated with higher odds of parental anxiety (OR = 1.52, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and depression (OR = 1.63, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), as well as increased parenting stress (ÃŽÂ² = .16, <i>p</i> = .008) and parental report of child anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = .15, <i>p</i> = .014). Conversely, material social support was significantly associated with lower odds of parental anxiety (OR = 0.90, <i>p</i> = .014) and depression (OR = 0.85, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), as well as lower levels of parenting stress (ÃŽÂ² = -.20, <i>p</i> = .001) and parental report of child anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = -.17, <i>p</i> = .018). Results suggest that household food insecurity may place parents and children at greater risk for mental health problems during COVID-19. However, access to tangible resources that offer material or financial support may be protective for both parent and child mental health. Study results suggest that policy interventions are needed to support the economic wellbeing of families during COVID-19.","Ward, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106562","20220614","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; family; pandemic; parenting; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32811,""
"Why Is Non-suicidal Self-injury More Common in Women? Mediation and Moderation Analyses of Psychological Distress, Emotion Dysregulation, and Impulsivity","Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) appears to be more common among women than men, though the underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In a community sample of young adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°996, aged 18-33) assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated alternative explanation for the NSSI prevalence gap: are women more likely to experience the feelings which lead to NSSI as a coping strategy, or does this prevalence gap result from differences in how men and women respond to distress? Cross-sectional mediation and moderation analyses tested how self-reported psychological distress (K10), emotion dysregulation (DERS), and impulsivity (UPPS-P) may contribute to a higher prevalence of NSSI among women. Women were twice as likely as men to report past-year NSSI (14.47% versus 7.78%, OR = 2.00, 95% CI [1.29, 3.13]). Women reported significantly higher psychological distress and significantly lower sensation seeking and positive urgency than men. Psychological distress partially statistically mediated the relationship between gender and past-year NSSI. Gender did not significantly moderate associations between psychological distress, emotion dysregulation, or impulsivity and past-year NSSI. Past-year NSSI prevalence did not significantly decrease with age and we found no significant age by gender interaction. Greater levels of NSSI in young women are partly explained by their greater levels of psychological distress, but not by differences in how men and women respond to this distress. Given similar levels of psychological distress, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity, women and men are similarly likely to experience NSSI. HighlightsWomen aged 18-33 were significantly more likely to report past-year NSSI than menWomen's greater psychological distress contributed to their higher NSSI prevalenceVariables investigated here were similarly associated with NSSI in men and women.","Lutz, Neufeld, Hook, Jones, Bullmore, Goodyer, Ford, Chamberlain, Wilkinson","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2022.2084004","20220614","Distress; NSSI; emotion regulation; gender; impulsivity; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32812,""
"Behavioral healthcare organizations' experiences related to use of telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploratory study","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were forced to shift many services quickly from in-person to virtual, including substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health (MH) treatment services. This led to a sharp increase in telehealth services, with health systems seeing patients virtually at hundreds of times the rate as before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing qualitative data about SUD and MH care organizations' experiences using telehealth, this study aims to elucidate emergent themes related to telehealth use by the front-line behavioral health workforce. This study uses qualitative data from large-scale web surveys distributed to SUD and MH organizations between May and August 2020. At the end of these surveys, the following question was posed in free-response form: ""Is there anything else you would like to say about use of telehealth during or after the COVID-19 pandemic?"" Respondents were asked to answer on behalf of their organizations. The 391 responses to this question were analyzed for emergent themes using a conventional approach to content analysis. Three major themes emerged: COVID-specific experiences with telehealth, general experiences with telehealth, and recommendations to continue telehealth delivery. Convenience, access to new populations, and lack of commute were frequently cited advantages of telehealth, while perceived ineffectiveness of and limited access to technology were frequently cited disadvantages. Also commonly mentioned was the relaxation of reimbursement regulations. Respondents supported continuation of relaxed regulations, increased institutional support, and using a combination of telehealth and in-person care in their practices. This study advanced our knowledge of how the behavioral health workforce experiences telehealth delivery. Further longitudinal research comparing treatment outcomes of those receiving in-person and virtual services will be necessary to undergird organizations' financial support, and perhaps also legislative support, for virtual SUD and MH services.","Kisicki, Becker, Chaple, Gustafson, Hartzler, Jacobson, Murphy, Tapscott, Molfenter","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08114-y","20220613","Mental health; Qualitative research; Reimbursement; Substance use disorder; Telehealth; Virtual services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32813,""
"Effectiveness and mechanism of a 4-week online self-help mindfulness intervention among individuals with emotional distress during COVID-19 in China","Many people suffered from emotional distress especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to alleviate emotional distress, more accessible psychological intervention programs, such as online intervention programs, are needed. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy and the potential mechanism of a 4-week, online, self-help mindfulness-based intervention to manage emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic between February 3 and May 20, 2020. A total of 302 individuals with high emotional distress completed a self-help mindfulness course, which lasted 30-60Ã‚Â min per day for 28 consecutive days. Participants who registered in the program later were included in the analyses as the control group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°315). Levels of mindfulness, perceived stress, emotional distress, anxiety and depression were assessed at baseline(T1), week 1(T2), week 2(T3), week 3(T4) and week 4(T5). Significant Group by Time interaction effects were found on mindfulness, perceived stress, emotional distress, anxiety and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Compared to the control group, the intervention group had a greater increase in changes of all outcome variables (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Random intercept cross-lagged analyses showed that compared with control group, mindfulness at T2 and T4 negatively predicted stress at T3 and T5, and mindfulness at T2 and T4 negatively predicted depression at T3 and T5 while depression at T3 predicted mindfulness at T4 in the mindfulness group. The results suggest that a 4-week self-help online mindfulness intervention improved mindfulness and reduced stress, emotional distress, anxiety and depression symptoms. Compared to the control group, changes in mindfulness preceded changes in stress, and mindfulness and depression reciprocally influenced each other during the intervention.

"Social support, perceived stigma, and depression among PLHIV on second-line antiretroviral therapy using structural equation modeling in a multicenter study in Northeast Ethiopia","Depression has a multitude of clinical and public health consequences for HIV patients. The magnitude of HIV patients who failed first-line antiretroviral treatment and switched to second-line therapy is becoming a growing public health concern. However, unlike first-line therapy, to date, little attention has been given to mental health problems in such patients, particularly in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this research was conducted to determine the magnitude of depression and its determinants among HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy. A multi-centered cross-sectional study was conducted on 714 HIV patients on second-line therapy who were selected via systematic random sampling. Data were collected in personal interviews as well as document reviews. The nine-item patient health questionnaire score was used to assess depression, while the three-item Oslo Scale was used to assess social support. The associations between exogenous, mediating, and endogenous variables were identified simultaneously using structural equation modeling. Statistical significance was declared at a P-value less than 0.05, and the effect sizes were presented using 95% CI. Depression was reported in 27.7% of HIV patients on second-line therapy [95% CI: 24.7-31.1%]. Social support has a direct [[Formula: see text] = -Ã‚Â 0.9, (95% CI: -Ã‚Â 1.11 to -Ã‚Â 0.69)] and indirect [[Formula: see text] = -Ã‚Â 0.22, (95% CI: -Ã‚Â 0.31 to -Ã‚Â 0.13)] negative effect on depression. Perceived stigma wasÃ‚Â a mediator variable and significantly associated with depression [[Formula: see text] = 0.40, (95% CI: 0.23-0.57)]. Co-morbid illness [[Formula: see text] = 0.49, (95% CI: 0.35-0.63)], high viremia [[Formula: see text] = 0.17, (95% CI: 0.08-0.26], moderate and high-risk substance use [[Formula: see text] = 0.29, (95% CI: 0.18-0.39)], and not-workable functional status [[Formula: see text] = 0.2, (95% CI: 0.1-0.31)] were all positively associated with depression. This study revealed that there was a high prevalence of depression among HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy. Social and clinical factors were associated with depression risk.

"Exploring association of mobile phone access with positive health outcomes and behaviors amongst post-partum mothers in rural Malawi","Access to mass media and emerging technologies (e.g., cell phones, the internet, and social media) is a social determinant of health that has been shown to profoundly influence women's health outcomes. In the African region, where women in rural settings with limited access to care are most vulnerable to maternal mortality and other pregnancy-related morbidities, mobile phone access can be an important and life-saving health determinant. The goal of this study was to examine the association between mobile/cellular phone ownership and health behaviors of post-partum mothers in rural Malawi. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited and consented a convenient sample of 174 post-partum mothers of 4- and 5-month-olds who were attending well-child clinics in Gowa, situated in the rural Ntcheu district of Malawi. Using logistic regression models, we hypothesized that compared to non-cell phone owners, mobile phone ownership will be predictive (greater odds) of antenatal visit frequency, exclusive breastfeeding knowledge and practices, health-seeking behaviors, and involvement in motherhood support groups; and protective (lower odds) of infant illnesses, breastfeeding challenges, and post-partum depressive symptoms. Mobile phones were highly prevalent in this rural setting, with 45% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°79) of post-partum women indicating they owned at least one cell phone. Cell phone owners tended to have higher levels of education (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012) and wealth (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Interestingly, mobile phone ownership was only associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices; and phone owners had 75% lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding (adj. OR 0.25; 95% CI: 0.07-0.92, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038) in multivariable models. Though not statistically significant but clinically meaningful, cell phone ownership was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (adj. OR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.39-1.84, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.67) and more social support (adj. OR 1.14; 95% CI: 0.61-2.13, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.70). Digital literacy and internet connectivity are social determinants of health, thus delving deeper into mothers' digital experiences to identify and ameliorate their unique barriers to full digital access will be crucial to successful implementation of digital interventions to address post-partum challenges for women in hard-to-reach settings such as ours. Such interventions are of even greater relevance as the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the urgency of reaching vulnerable, marginalized populations.","Anto-Ocrah, Latulipe, Mark, Adler, Zaihra, Lanning","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04782-0","20220613","Africa; Breastfeeding; Cell/mobile phone technology; Covid; Digital health; Information and communication technology (ICT); Malawi; Mhealth; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32816,""
"Anxiety and Stress due to COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Factors Among Healthcare Workers in West Guji Zone Southern Ethiopia","The COVID-19 pandemic caused a dramatic loss of life around the world and has caused mental and social problems that affect every country in the world. Healthcare workers involved in providing care are at high risk of developing mental health problems as they face heavy workloads, life-and-death decisions, and the risk of infection is high. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety and stress and their associated factors among healthcare workers in Southern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in public health facility located in the West Guji district. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 283 study participants. Descriptive, binary, and multiple logistic regression statistics were used. Odds ratios adjusted with 95% CI were used, and statistical significance was declared with a p-value ofÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05. A total of 275 participants were included, with a response rate of 97.2%. The prevalence of anxiety and stress were 25.5% and 9.1%, respectively. Factors associated with anxiety symptoms were age, psychoactive drug use, alcohol use, and monthly income, and stress symptoms were alcohol use, medical illness, and knowledge of healthcare workers due to COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of anxiety and stress among healthcare workers due to COVID-19 were an average compared with studies in low-income and high-income countries. Health institutions must focus on the well-being of healthcare workers during the fighting for COVID-19 and comprehensive psychological assistance to support the mental well-being of healthcare workers by giving different training.","Wayessa, Melesse, Hadona","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01335-1","20220613","Anxiety; Associated factors; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32817,""

"Pandemic Experiences: A report on experiences of research culture in Wellcome funded PhD programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Emerging Research Cultures project is a strategic project funded by Wellcome to form and support a community of practice with the 23 PhD training programmes funded in 2019. These programmes were deeply affected by the restrictions imposed by the UK government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As in person meetings were restricted, teaching, attendance of labs, meetings with potential supervisors, other staff members and other members of the programmes were all moved to virtual platforms. In April 2021, the Emerging Research Cultures project held two workshops to explore what had been the studentsâ€™ experiences of beginning their PhD training during the pandemic. This report summarises the discussions and draws out the main themes. Three points stood out in these discussions. Firstly, people clearly welcomed the opportunity to talk about their experience and this in itself contributed to their processing of the experience they had gone through together. Secondly, student and staff experiences were very closely interconnected, and each affected the other. The quality of research culture, clearly, is not a matter for students alone, and staff live this as deeply as students do. And lastly, mental health issues, or self-descriptions that are related to mental health, were prominent in the discussion. This may be simply because people had the opportunity to talk about what they were going through, and the months of pandemic restrictions have been difficult for everyone. However, there clearly have been deep challenges on the mental health and wellbeing front, which may demand attention and action.","Annamaria Carusi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0125-82C-521","20220615","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Education|Higher Education; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; research funding; phd training; phd supervision; research culture; publication culture","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","",32819,""
