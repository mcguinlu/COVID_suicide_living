"How student perceptions about online learning difficulty influenced their satisfaction during Canada's Covid-19 response","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant challenge to higher education and forced academic institutions across the globe to abruptly shift to remote teaching. Because of the emergent transition, higher education institutions continuously face difficulties in creating satisfactory online learning experiences that adhere to the new norms. This study investigates the transition to online learning during Covid-19 to identify factors that influenced students' satisfaction with the online learning environment. Adopting a mixed-method design, we find that students' experience with online learning can be negatively affected by information overload, and perceived technical skill requirements, and describe qualitative evidence that suggest a lack of social interactions, class format, and ambiguous communication also affected perceived learning. This study suggests that to digitalize higher education successfully, institutions need to redesign students' learning experience systematically and re-evaluate traditional pedagogical approaches in the online context. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic University transitions to online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic were undertaken by faculty and students who had little online learning experience. The transition to online learning was often described as having a negative influence on students' learning experience and mental health. Varieties of cognitive load are known predictors of effective online learning experiences and satisfaction. What this paper adds Information overload and perceptions of technical abilities are demonstrated to predict students' difficulty and satisfaction with online learning. Students express negative attitudes towards factors that influence information overload, technical factors, and asynchronous course formats. Communication quantity was not found to be a significant factor in predicting either perceived difficulty or negative attitudes. Implications for practice and/or policy We identify ways that educators in higher education can improve their online offerings and implementations during future disruptions. We offer insights into student experience concerning online learning environments during an abrupt transition. We identify design factors that contribute to effective online delivery, educators in higher education can improve students' learning experiences during difficult periods and abrupt transitions to online learning.","Conrad, Colin, Deng, Qi, Caron, Isabelle, Shkurska, Oksana, Skerrett, Paulette, Sundararajan, Binod","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13206","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Educational Technology; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27818,""
"Diaper Need During the COVID-19 Pandemic Associated with Poverty, Food Insecurity, and Chronic Illness: An Analysis of a Representative State Sample of Caretakers with Young Children","Objectives: Diaper need is an important form of material hardship for families with young children. This study quantified diaper need during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined factors associated with diaper need. Methods: Using a representative statewide sample of adults in Massachusetts, diaper need was assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic among respondents with at least one child 0â€“4 years of age in diapers (n=353). Bivariate tests examined associations between diaper need and individual and household factors. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between diaper need and demographic factors, job loss, and mental health during the pandemic. Results: More than one in three respondents reported diaper need (36.0%). Demographic factors associated with diaper need were age &lt;25 years, Latino ethnicity, having less than a high school degree, unemployment before the pandemic, household income &lt;$50,000, household food insecurity, or having a household member with a chronic disease. Diaper need was higher among respondents who utilized a nutrition assistance program or a food pantry during the pandemic. In multivariable analyses considering job loss and mental health during the pandemic, diaper need was associated with household income &lt;$50,000 (odds ratio [OR] 3.61;confidence interval [95% CI] 1.40â€“9.26) and a chronic disease diagnosis within the household (OR 4.26;95% CI 1.77â€“10.29). Conclusions: This study indicates a level of diaper need similar to what was documented before the COVID-19 pandemic despite federal stimulus payments and increased distributions by local diaper banks. The findings identify groups at increased risk and suggest opportunities to reach those at risk through food assistance programs.","Zack, Rachel M.; Clay, Lauren A.; Birk, Nick W.","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2021.0093","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Equity; 6(1):150-158, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27819,""

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Toward Mask-Wearing Behaviors During Covid-19 Pandemic Among Mangalore Residents: A Cross-Sectional Study","Objectives The objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, awareness, and practice toward mask-wearing behaviors of Mangalore residents during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods This survey was conducted at A B Shetty Memorial Institute of Dental Sciences in Mangalore. The questionnaire consisted of 18 questions that were prepared as an online form (Google Forms), and a total of 172 responses were received among the residents of Mangalore who visited the hospital. The questions were distributed based on knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding the mask-wearing behaviors, and the distribution of responses was presented as frequency and percentages. Prior to the inception of the study, the nature and purpose of the study were explained to each respondent, and informed consent was obtained by all participants in this study. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 23. Results It was evident that the COVID-19 knowledge scores were found to be significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and potentially dangerous practices toward the COVID-19 epidemic in this study. These findings clearly indicate the importance of improving residents' COVID-19 knowledge via health education, which may also result in improvements in their attitudes and practices toward COVID-19. Conclusion In summary, our findings suggest that Mangalore residents have fair knowledge and optimistic attitudes, despite the current lockdown measures undertaken during the second wave of COVID-19, The positivity rate in Mangalore has not reduced satisfactorily. Self-protection, testing, and vaccination would help to reduce the spread and mortality rate due to coronavirus. The residents of Mangalore should abide by the COVID -19 preventive measures and implement this knowledge into their daily practices.","Krishna, N.; Ramesh, A.; Hegde, A.

"Plastic Surgery Practice during COVID Times","Introduction COVID-19 has affected plastic surgeons like never before. We conducted an all-India survey to find how the practice was affected among public/private sector, reconstructive/aesthetic practice, and consultants/residents. We have proposed some solutions to the identified problems, which are supported by previous literature. Methods A survey framed in Google forms was circulated through WhatsApp and emails in August 2020. Closed and semiopen questions regarding changes in personal and professional lives, coping strategies adopted, and open questions for suggestions in improving practice, academics and measures to tackle the pandemic were included. Responses were collected in an Excel sheet and analysis done using SPSS software. Results A total of 220 consented responses were obtained. Public hospital practitioners had to bear the COVID-related administrative as well as executive works, especially residents, which led to anxiety, family concern, burnout, and concern about the loss of skills and academics. Patient interaction was also reduced. Aesthetic surgeons bore more financial loss. Conclusions Plastic surgeons in India faced decrease in caseload, financial loss, COVID-related duties, workload for residents, reduced academics, family and mental health problems, difficulty with personal protection equipment (PPE) during surgeries, and queries from patients. These can be solved by doing cases within the limits of protocols and safety, pooling public and private sector for COVID duties, rotating residents' groups to reduce workload, using telemedicine for academics and patient consultations, and providing social support groups to surgeons.","Bhaskaran, D.; Chandran, A.; Rajan, T.

"Investigating the relationship between cross-national suicide rates and COVID-19 first and second waves spread across the world: an exploratory study","Introduction: COVID-19 spreads between people in close contact. Social isolation, which is linked with increased suicide risk, prevents COVID-19 from spreading. Suicide and COVID-19 may therefore represent two antagonistic phenomena. Specifically, we tested whether previous cross-national suicide rates inversely correlate with COVID-19 cases and deaths across countries. Material and Methods: We ran unadjusted bivariate correlations between the most updated (2016) cross-national Age-Standardised suicide rates and COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths (as of: 30/08/2020, 11/10/2020 and 30/05/2021) across countries;and we controlled for WHO Income group, WHO region, suicide data quality, and urbanicity. Results: Suicide rates negatively correlated with COVID-19 cumulative cases up to 30/08/2020 (r = -0.14, P = .064) and up to 11/10/2020 at an almost significant level (r = -0.149, P = .050) across 174 countries. As of 11/10/2020 this correlation became significant when controlling for WHO region (r = -0.17, P = .028), data quality (r = -0.181, P = .017) and urbanicity (r = -0.172, P = .039);and as of 30/08/2020 when adjusting for WHO region (r = -0.15, P = .047) and data quality a (r = -0.16, P = .036). No significant correlations between suicide rates and COVID-19 deaths were found. Conclusions: There seems to be an inverse correlation between previous cross-national suicide rates and COVID-19 cumulative cases across countries. Suicide and COVID-19 appear to behave, to some degree, as antagonistic phenomena, which challenges their prevention. RESUMEN IntroducciÃ³n: La COVID-19 se contagia entre personas en contacto estrecho. El aislamiento social, asociado a mayor riesgo de suicidio, previene la propagaciÃ³n de COVID-19. El suicidio y la COVID-19 podrÃ­an representar dos fenÃ³menos antagÃ³nicos. Investigamos si las tasas de suicidio transnacionales correlacionan inversamente con los casos y fallecimientos por COVID-19 por paÃ­ses. Material y MÃ©todos: Correlaciones bivariadas no controladas entre las tasas de suicidio transnacionales estandarizadas por edad mÃ¡s actualizadas (2016) y los casos y fallecimientos por COVID-19 (hasta: 30/08/2020, 11/10/2020, 30/05/2021) por paÃ­ses;y ajustadas por riqueza, region, calidad de los datos de suicidio y urbanicidad, con datos de la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud (OMS). Resultados: Las tasas de suicidio correlacionaron negativamente con los casos por COVID- 19 hasta 30/08/2020 (r = -0.14, P = .064) y hasta 11/10/2020 a un nivel casi significativo (r = -0.149, P = .050) en 174 paÃ­ses. Hasta 11/10/2020 esta correlaciÃ³n se convirtiÃ³ en significativa al controlar por regiÃ³n OMS (r = -0.17, P = .028), calidad de los datos (r = -0.181, P = .017) y urbanicidad (r = -0.172, P = .039);y hasta 30/08/2020 al ajustar por region OMS (r = -0.15, P = .047) y calidad de los datos (r = -0.16, P = .036). No se encontraron correlaciones significativas entre tasas de suicidio y fallecimientos por COVID-19. Conclusiones: Parece existir una correlaciÃ³n inversa entre las tasas de suicidio transnacionales previas y los casos por COVID-19 por paÃ­ses. El suicidio y la COVID-19 parecen comportarse, hasta cierto punto, como dos fenÃ³menos antagÃ³nicos, lo que supone un desafÃ­o para su prevenciÃ³n.","Lopez-Morinigo, Javier-David, Blasco-Fontecilla, Hilario, Courtet, Philippe, Ayuso-Mateos, JosÃ©-Luis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2022.02.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista de PsiquiatrÃ­a y Salud Mental;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27825,""
"The effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation for Post-COVID symptoms: A rapid review of the literature","Background Multi-disciplinary rehabilitation is recommended for individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection (i.e., symptoms 3â€“4 weeks after acute infection). There are emerging reports of use of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in the post-acute stages of COVID-19, however the appropriateness of PR for managing post-COVID symptoms remains unclear. To offer practical guidance with regards to post-COVID PR, a greater understanding of the clinical effectiveness literature is required. Methods A rapid review of the published literature was completed. An electronic database search of the literature published between July 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021 was performed in MEDLINE, Pubmed, and EMBASE. Primary studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of PR for individuals with post-COVID symptoms were included. Results Nine studies evaluating the effectiveness of PR were identified;most were small, experimental or quasi-experimental studies, including 1 RCT, and were primarily of low quality. After attending PR, all studies reported improvements in exercise capacity, pulmonary function, and/or quality of life for individuals with post-COVID symptoms who had been hospitalized for their acute COVID-19 infection. Few studies evaluated changes in post-COVID symptom severity or frequency and, of these, improvements in dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety and depression were observed following PR. Further, no studies evaluated non-hospitalized patients or long-term outcomes beyond 3 months after initiating PR. Conclusions With limited high-quality evidence, any recommendations or practical guidance for PR programmes for those with post-COVID symptoms should consider factors such as feasibility, current PR capacity, and resource constraints.","Soril, Lesley J.

"Psychological impact of COVID19 on community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians","Background The unique situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the consequent worldwide lockdown can have a psychological impact on specific populations. Community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, as essential healthcare workers on the front line who continue to do their jobs during this pandemic, can also experience psychological distress. Few data are available on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemics on this population. Objectives This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Spanish community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians during lockdown, and to identify factors contributing to psychological distress. Methods A cross-sectional, quantitative, correlational study was designed including 1162 pharmacy team members. The Impact of Event Scale revised was used to assess the psychological impact. Data collection was performed by emailing the instrument to individuals or by using social networks. Results Overall participants, almost 70% revealed severe levels of psychological impact. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly affected community pharmacy workers, the degree of which is related to gender, age, and feelings of fear/stress. Conclusions In the initial phase of the lockdown associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, the majority of the respondents rated the psychological impact as severe. Our findings allow for the identification of factors associated with a greater psychological impact.","Baldonedo-Mosteiro, Carmen, Franco-Correia, Sara, Mosteiro-Diaz, Maria Pilar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcsop.2022.100118","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy;: 100118, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27827,""
"Gambling and online trading: emerging risks of real-time stock and cryptocurrency trading platforms","Objectives Online platforms enable real-time trading activities that are similar to those of gambling. This study aimed to investigate the associations of traditional investing, real-time stock trading, and cryptocurrency trading with excessive behavior and mental health problems. Study design This was a cross-sectional population-based survey. Methods The participants were Finnish people aged 18â€“75 years (NÂ =Â 1530, 50.33% male). Survey asked about monthly regular investing, real-time stock-trading platform use, and cryptocurrency trading. The study had measures for excessive behavior: gambling (Problem Gambling Severity Index), gaming (Internet Gaming Disorder Test), internet use (Compulsive Internet Use Scale), and alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). Psychological distress (Mental Health Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), COVID-19 anxiety, and perceived loneliness were also measured. Background factors included sociodemographic variables, instant loan taking, and involvement in social media identity bubbles (Identity Bubble Reinforcement Scale). Multivariate analyses were conducted with regression analysis. Results Within the sample, 22.29% were categorized into monthly regular investors only, 3.01% were investors using real-time stock-trading platforms, and 3.59% were cryptomarket traders. Real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptocurrency trading were associated with younger age and male gender. Cryptomarket traders were more likely to have an immigrant background and have taken instant loans. Both real-time stock-trading platform use and cryptomarket trading were associated with higher excessive behavior. Cryptomarket traders especially reported higher excessive gambling, gaming, and internet use than others. Cryptomarket traders reported also higher psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness. Conclusions Regular investing is not a risk factor for excessive behavior. However, rapid online trading platforms and applications were significantly more commonly used by participants reporting excessive behavior and mental health problems. The strong association between cryptomarket trading and excessive behavior in particular underlines the need to acknowledge the potential risks related to real-time trading platforms.","Oksanen, A.; Mantere, E.; Vuorinen, I.; Savolainen, I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.01.027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health; 205:72-78, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27828,""
"Mental health of children and adolescents with pre-existing psychiatric and developmental disorders during the first pandemic-related lockdown: A cross-sectional study in Greece","Since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the effects of the pandemic on youth with pre-existing mental health disorders. The present study aimed to explore change in emotional and behavioral symptoms (mood states) and daily behaviors during the lockdown in a clinical sample of children and adolescents in Greece. A cross-sectional survey, using the CoRonavIrus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) Questionnaire, was completed by 738 parents of children and adolescents aged 2â€“18 years attending 12 outpatient child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) across four geographical regions in Greece. Participants reported at a single time-point on their children's mood states and daily behaviors 3 months prior to the pandemic and during the past two weeks, as well as on life changes during the spring 2020 lockdown. Using paired samples t-tests no change was found in mean mood states scores pre- and post-pandemic onset in all subgroups investigated. Using McNemar's test, we found that among individual mood states, some symptoms increased, and others decreased or remained stable. Additionally, participants did rate several of their daily behaviours as having overall worsened, e.g., reduced sleep or time spent outdoors during the lockdown, as compared to 3 months prior the pandemic. Longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain which factors buffer against deterioration of mental health among children with pre-pandemic psychiatric or developmental disorders, in order to inform public mental health and educational policy.","Magklara, K.; Giannopoulou, I.; Kotsis, K.; Tsalamanios, E.; Grigoriadou, A.; Ladopoulou, K.; Koullourou, I.; Serdari, A.; Sadeghi, N.; O'Callaghan, G.; Priftis, D.; Ntakolia, C.; Stringaris, A.; Lazaratou, E.; Lagakou, E.; Mamaki, E.; Neou, E.; Polaki, O.; Triantafyllou, G.; Valvi, E.; Vassara, V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2022.100034","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100034, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27829,""
"COVID-19 related worry moderates the association between postpartum depression and mother-infant bonding: A longitudinal study","The aim of this study was to ask whether a substantial external stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affects the association between postpartum depression (PPD) and mother-infant bonding. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether worry regarding such an external threat differentially affected PPD and bonding by analyzing a longitudinal sample of postpartum women assessed before and during the pandemic. One-hundred forty women responded to online questionnaires at (T1) Pre-COVID-19: Six months postpartum (February 2018 to December 2019), and (T2) During COVID-19: Twenty-one months postpartum (April 2020 to January 2021). The strength of correlation between mother-infant bonding and PPD significantly declined from before (T1: RÂ =Â 0.64, pÂ &lt;Â 0.00) to during the pandemic (T2: RÂ =Â 0.44, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001;DifferenceÂ =Â 0.20, pÂ =Â 0.05). Furthermore, only PPD correlated with the worry due to the pandemic;thus the PPD-bonding association was weaker among women who were less concerned about the pandemic (F(3, 136)Â =Â 15.4, R2Â =Â 0.25). The study suggests that emotions and cognitions related to motherhood, such as mother-infant bonding, may be more resilient to external pressures such as a pandemic than affective states such as PPD.

"Antimicrobial Resistance in Zambia: A Systematic Review","Purpose Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widely acknowledged as a global health problem, yet its extent is not well evaluated, especially in low-middle income countries (LMICs). The SARS-COV-2 pandemic demonstrates the link between humans, animals, and the environment. It is challenging to promote policies without focusing on healthcare systems at a local level, therefore a baseline assessment of the AMR prevalence is a priority. This study reviewed published studies of AMR prevalence across human-animal-environmental domains in Zambia. Methods & Materials PubMed, Cochrane Libraries, Medical Journal of Zambia and African Journals Online databases were searched from inception to April 2021 for articles published in English in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Retrieval and screening of article was done using a structured search protocol with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results A total of 716 articles were retrieved, of which 25 articles met inclusion criteria for final analysis. AMR data was not available for six of the ten provinces of Zambia. Twenty-one different isolates from the human health, animal health and environmental health sectors were tested against 36 antimicrobial agents, across 13 classes of antibiotics. All the studies showed a degree of resistance to more than one class of antimicrobials. Majority of the studies focused on antibiotics, with only three studies (12%) highlighting antiretroviral resistance. Antitubercular drugs were addressed in only five studies (20%) despite an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. No studies focused on antifungals. The most common organisms tested, across all three sectors, were Staphylococcus aureus, with a diverse range of resistance patterns found;followed by Escherichia coli with a high resistance rate found to cephalosporins (24%-100%) and fluoroquinolones (20%-100%). Conclusion This review highlights three important findings. Firstly, AMR is understudied in the country as whole. Secondly, the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics is significant across the human, animal and environmental sectors. Thirdly, this review suggests that improved standardization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in Zambia could help to better delineate AMR patterns, allow comparisons across different locations and tracking of AMR evolution over time.","Nowbuth, A.; Asombang, A.; Tazikeng, N.; Makinde, O.; Sheets, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.042","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Infectious Diseases; 116:S17-S18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27831,""
"Therapeutic plant landscape design of urban forest parks based on the five senses theory: A case study of Stanley Park in Canada","As an important part of urban development, urban forest parks (UFPs) are critical community resources for supporting physical activity of people of all ages, and are also crucial for connecting people to nature, specifically for mental health benefits. During the COVID-19 pandemic, urban parks have experienced exponential increases in the volume of users as people have sought ways to enjoy green spaces and their benefits safely. As the park environment provides a pleasant, healthy and comfortable atmosphere for people of all ages, UFPs have a vital impact on human health, which has been recognized and recognized by more and more people all over the world.. The five senses, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting, are the most direct ways that humans perceive external information and assess experiences. Notably, Canada has a strong presence in and a long history of designing and conserving UFPs. Therefore, we used Stanley Park in Canada as a case study to analyze the therapeutic functions of and design methods for plant landscape in UFPs. We conducted an on-site survey of tourists to investigate their perception, level of satisfaction, possible inadequacies, and suggestions regarding potential therapeutic plants in Stanley Park. The results show that the high plant diversity in the park has created a functional therapeutic landscape that can be perceived by the five senses. The overall satisfaction level of visitors and their dependency on these therapeutic landscape components are high. The inadequacies are relatively simple vegetation structure and lack of wetland plants. The plant species in Stanley Park were categorized according to their sensory influences. Based on the survey results and the literature, we have provided feasible recommendations for the design and management of therapeutic landscapes in UFPs.","He, Mei, Wang, Yiyang, Wang, William J.; Xie, Zhong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgeop.2022.02.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Geoheritage and Parks;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27832,""
"Association of depression and COVID-induced PTSD with cognitive symptoms after COVID-19 illness","Objective Many patients recovering from COVID-19 report persistent psychological and cognitive symptoms months after viral clearance. We examined the association of depression and COVID-induced PTSD with cognitive symptoms following COVID-19 illness. Methods Patients treated for COVID-19 between March 26 and May 27, 2020 were surveyed three months later. Cognitive symptoms were assessed by asking â€œSince your COVID-19 illness, do you now have more difficulty: 1) Remembering conversations a few days later? 2) Remembering where you placed familiar objects? 3) Finding the right words while speaking?â€ Patients endorsing at least one such complaint were coded positive for cognitive symptoms. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of depression (PHQ-8Â =Â 10) and COVID-induced PTSD (PCL-5Â =Â 30) with cognitive symptoms, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. Results Among 153 participants, 44.4% reported at least one cognitive symptom, 18.3% were depressed, and 23.5% had COVID-induced PTSD. Adjusting for covariates, depression (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.30â€“20.35, pÂ =Â 0.02) and COVID-induced PTSD (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.13â€“11.89, pÂ =Â 0.03) were significantly associated with cognitive symptoms;self-reported history of mental illness was also associated (OR 4.90, 95% CI 1.24â€“19.41, pÂ =Â 0.02). Conclusions Depression, COVID-induced PTSD, and prior mental illness were strongly associated with cognitive symptoms three months after acute COVID-19 illness.","Liyanage-Don, Nadia A.; Winawer, Melodie R.; Hamberger, Marla J.; Agarwal, Sachin, Trainor, Alison R.; Quispe, Kristal A.; Kronish, Ian M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.02.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27833,""
"""With a PICC line, you never miss"": The role of peripherally inserted central catheters in hospital care for people living with HIV/HCV who use drugs","Background: People who use drugs (PWUD), and especially those who inject drugs, are at increased risk of acquiring bloodborne infections (e.g., HIV and HCV), experiencing drug-related harms (e.g., abscesses and overdose), and being hospitalized and requiring inpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy delivered through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). The use of PICC lines with PWUD is understood to be a source of tension in hospital settings but has not been well researched. Drawing on theoretical and analytic insights from ""new materialism,"" we consider the assemblage of sociomaterial elements that inform the use of PICCs. Methods: This paper draws on n = 50 interviews conducted across two related qualitative research projects within a program of research about the impact of substance use on hospital admissions from the perspective of healthcare providers (HCPs) and people living with HIV/HCV who use drugs. This paper focuses on data about PICC lines collected in both studies. Results: The decision to provide, maintain, or remove a PICC is based on a complex assemblage of factors (e.g., infections, bodies, drugs, memories, relations, spaces, temporalities, and contingencies) beyond whether parenteral intravenous antibiotic therapy is clinically indicated. HCPs expressed concerns about the risk posed by past, current, and future drug use, and contact with non-clinical spaces (e.g., patient's homes and the surrounding community), with some opting for second-line treatments and removing PICCs. The majority of PWUD described being subjected to threats of discharge and increased monitoring despite being too ill to use their PICC lines during past hospital admissions. A subset of PWUD reported using their PICC lines to inject drugs as a harm reduction strategy, and a subset of HCPs reported providing harm reduction-centred care. Conclusion: Our analysis has implications for theorizing the role of PICC lines in the care of PWUD and identifies practical guidance for engaging them in productive and non-judgemental discussions about the risks of injecting into a PICC line, how to do it safely, and about medically supported alternatives.","Guta, A.; Perri, M.; Strike, C.; Gagnon, M.; Carusone, S.

"The association between physical activity and prevalence of anxiety and depression in medical students during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected medical students both physically and mentally. Medical students have had to take online classes, which may have decreased their physical activity (PA) and increased their risk of mental health. This research aimed to explore the association between mental health problems and PA levels. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1stâ€“6thyear medical students, at a university in Southern Thailand;from September to October 2021. The participants completed online questionnaires;including, demographic data, Global Physical Activity, PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 questionnaire. The association between PA levels and mental health was assessed using ordinal logistic regression. Results Among 325 medical students, 42.8% were males and 51.1% were clinical medical students. The prevalence of moderate to severe depression and anxiety was 31% and 12.9%. In total, 49.7% of participants had low PA levels. Pre-clinical students had a higher risk of depression (OR 2.11 p-value 0.001) and anxiety (OR 2.20 p-value 0.045) than clinical students. We also found that moderate or high PA levels were not a significant factor with mental health status (p-value of depression 0.447, 0.823 and p-value of anxiety 0.362, p-value 0.574, respectively). Conclusion There were a lot of medical students with moderate to severe depression and anxiety, and about half of those had low PA levels;especially, pre-clinical students that learned online study activities. There was no significant association between PA levels and mental health status. However, the faculty should reconsiderate their medical student to increase physical activities and redesign the curriculum to support their students during these challenging times.","Chootong, Rattanaporn, Sono, Supinya, Choomalee, Kittisakdi, Wiwattanaworaset, Pakawat, Phusawat, Napapach, Wanghirankul, Natcha, Laojaroensuk, Pakkapon, Thongkhundum, Pongpisit, Saetang, Rasika, Euanontat, Sirada, Anantathaweekul, Supakorn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103408","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Medicine and Surgery;: 103408, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27835,""
"The Gender Life Satisfaction/Depression Paradox","According to the gender life satisfaction/depression paradox women are significantly more likely to report higher levels of life satisfaction than men after controlling for all relevant socio-demographic factors, but also significantly more likely to declare they are depressed. We find that the paradox holds in the cross-country sample of the European Social Survey and is stable across age, education, self-assessed health, macroregion and survey round splits. We find support for the affect intensity rationale showing that women are relatively more affected in their satisfaction about life by the good or bad events or achievements occurring during their existence and less resilient (less likely to revert to their standard levels of happiness after a shock). We as well discuss biological, genetic, cultural, personality rationales advocated in the literature that can explain our findings.","Becchetti, Leonardo, Conzo, Gianluigi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02740-5","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Indicators Research; 160(1):35-113, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27836,""

"Sex-specific vulnerability to depressive symptoms across adolescence and during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of the cingulum bundle","Background Females are at higher risk for developing depression during adolescence than are males, particularly during exposure to stressors like the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining structural connections between brain regions involved in executive functioning may advance our understanding of sex biases in stress and depression. Here, we examined the role of the cingulum bundle in differentiating trajectories of depressive symptoms in males and females across adolescence and during the pandemic. Methods In a longitudinal study of 214 youth (121 females;ages 9?13Â years at baseline), we examined whether fixel-based properties of the cingulum bundle at baseline predict changes in females' and males' severity of depressive symptoms across four timepoints (4?7Â years) in adolescence, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also tested whether cingulum properties predict self-reported resilience and stress during the pandemic. Results Females had lower fiber density and cross-section (FDC) of the cingulum than did males, a neural pattern that predicted greater increases in depressive symptoms, lower resilience, and higher stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cingulum morphometry predicted changes in depressive trajectories in females, but not in males;specifically, females with lower FDC had significant increases in symptoms throughout adolescence, whereas females with higher cingulum FDC did not. Conversely, males had low, stable depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and higher resilience and lower stress during the pandemic compared to females. Higher cingulum FDC predicted higher resilience and lower stress in both sexes. Conclusions In adults, the cingulum has been implicated in sex differences in stress reactivity. We show that in adolescents, the cingulum reflects sex differences in reports of stress and resilience that might contribute to the increased risk of stress-related mood disorders in females. Adolescent females might benefit from cognitive interventions that strengthen the structural properties of the cingulum and increase their perceived resilience during periods of adversity and disruption.","Chahal, Rajpreet, Ho, Tiffany C.; Miller, Jonas G.; Borchers, Lauren R.; Gotlib, Ian H.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcv2.12061","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: JCPP Advances; n/a(n/a):e12061, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27839,""
"Risk for youth anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: The interactive impact of financial stress and prepandemic electrocortical reactivity to negative self-referential stimuli","Despite evidence that stress exposure increases risk for internalizing symptoms in youth, it remains unclear which youth are most vulnerable. This study examined whether youth's prepandemic late positive potential (LPP), an electrocortical marker of sustained attention to affective stimuli, exacerbated the impact of stress on prospective increases in depression and anxiety symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 29 youth (ages 9?16, 82.8% girls) who completed depression and anxiety symptom measures and an affective words task to assess LPP to positive and negative self-referential stimuli prepandemic onset. Postpandemic onset, approximately 16.03 months (SDÂ =Â 8.86) after their baseline assessments, youth again completed symptom measures as well as the UCLA Life Stress Interview to assess ongoing social and financial chronic stress. Results indicated a significant interaction between youth LPP to negative words and financial stress. Greater exposure to financial stress during the pandemic predicted greater anxiety symptom increases specifically for youth who demonstrated enhanced prepandemic LPP to negative words. Results were specific to the prediction of anxiety, but not depression, symptoms. If replicated in larger studies, findings highlight enhanced LPP to negative stimuli as a promising target for intervention for youth exposed to greater financial stress.","Feurer, Cope, Granros, Maria, Calentino, Alison E.; Suor, Jennifer H.; Burkhouse, Katie L.","https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.22250","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Psychobiology; 64(3):e22250, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27840,""

"Defining Optimal Respiratory Support for Patients With COVID-19: The Journal of the American Medical Association","Noninvasive respiratory support is an essential component of critical care. Both noninvasive ventilation, with its different interface types and modes (including helmet and face masks), and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are successfully used to manage patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Noninvasive respiratory support can alleviate respiratory distress, improve oxygenation, and possibly reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Due to known adverse effects associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (eg, sedation, ventilator-induced lung injury, predisposition for infections), it is conceivable that noninvasive respiratory support may reduce mortality through reduction in the need for tracheal intubation. However, noninvasive ventilation may inappropriately delay tracheal intubation and increase patient self-inflicted lung injury, which may occur at varying degrees depending on the type and interface of noninvasive ventilatory support. The intense respiratory efforts by patients who are spontaneously breathing contribute to and exacerbate acute lung injury. Due to the complexity in the causes and presentations of acute respiratory failure, several randomized clinical trials are needed to clarify the specific roles of noninvasive respiratory support. However, the evaluation of respiratory support strategies for acute illness is challenging for several reasons. First, it is difficult to achieve a balance among trial protocol executability, comprehensiveness, and completeness. Second, the concomitant evaluation","Zampieri, Fernando G. M. D.

"An intervention package for supporting the mental well-being of community health workers in low, and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is an increasing reliance on community health workers (CHWs) to achieve its control especially in low, and middle-income countries (LMICs). An increase in the demand for their services and the challenges they already face make them prone to mental health illness. Therefore, there is a need to further support the mental health and well-being of CHWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We organised a workshop on Zoom to deliberate on relevant components of an intervention package for supporting the mental health of CHWs in LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a thematic analysis approach to summarise deliberations from this workshop. Outcomes Participants identified the need for a hub for coordinating CHW activities, a care coordination team to manage their health, training programs aimed at improving their work performance and taking control of their health, a communication system that keeps them in touch with colleagues, family, and the communities they serve. They cautioned against confidentiality breaches while handling personal health information and favoured tailoring interventions to the unique needs of CHWs. Participants also advised on the need to ensure job security for CHWs and draw on available resources in the community. To measure the impact of such an intervention package, participants encouraged the use of mixed methods and a co-designed approach. Interpretation As CHWs contribute to the pandemic response in LMICs, their mental health and well-being need to be protected. Such protection can be provided by using an intervention package that harnesses inputs from members of the broader health system, their families, and communities.","Yakubu, Kenneth, Musoke, David, Chikaphupha, Kingsley, Chase-Vilchez, Alyssa, Maulik, Pallab K.; Joshi, Rohina","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+intervention+package+for+supporting+the+mental+well-being+of+community+health+workers+in+low,+and+middle-income+countries+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Comprehensive psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27846,""
"â€œWe Need to Address the Traumaâ€: School Social Workers' Views About Student and Staff Mental Health During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent school disruptions shined a spotlight on the mental health needs of young people, and the importance of schools and school social workers (SSWs) in attending to those needs. This study sought to understand SSWsâ€™ views about mental health and trauma in relation to the pandemic and schools reopening. Data came from written responses to open-ended questions on a national survey of SSWs during Juneâ€“July 2020 (Kelly et al., 2021;Watson et al., 2022). In the national survey, 450 SSWs responded to open-ended questions, providing 115 single-spaced pages of detailed qualitative comments. A unified conceptual model for a trauma-informed school was created by integrating components suggested within the literature. This conceptual model was then used to generate a theory-based coding schema. Responses mapped well onto the conceptual model. Major themes included recognition of COVID-19 and 2020 social unrest as a unique period and potentially traumatic experience;the need for a trauma-informed school response;the challenges of addressing all facets of safety during the pandemic;and the essentiality and difficulty of maintaining school-based relationships during school closures and remote learning. Results demonstrated that SSWs used and discussed key components of a trauma-informed approach. Respondents offered several recommendations for implementing trauma-informed approaches during and after the pandemic, many of which required collaboration from other school staff. Findings provide empirical support for a unified school model that integrates components of a trauma-informed approach found in the literature.

However, it remains unknown how lockdown restrictions impacted individuals differently and who was more likely to change their exercise behavior and experience negative well-being. The current study examined exercise dependence as aÂ risk factor and its impact on exercise behavior and mood during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns on aÂ global scale in 11,898 participants from 17Â countries. Mixed effects models revealed that reducing exercise behavior was associated with aÂ stronger decrease in mood for individuals at risk of exercise dependence compared to individuals at low risk of exercise dependence.

"Online Music Therapy Groups During COVID-19: Perspectives from NDIS Participants and Caregivers","Thematic analysis of short-answer questions resulted in three themes: 1) The online music therapy groups were a positive experience;2) The groups provide opportunities for social engagements;3) Positive and negative aspects of group design. Working in the context of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) in Australia, music therapists and other allied health professionals have had to adapt service delivery to support NDIS participants to continue to work towards their goals during a time of global crisis. Group music therapy via telehealth has been found to be acceptable and positively received;evidence of psychosocial benefits and increased attendance has been reported for some clinical populations, including children with hearing loss (Fuller & McLeod, 2019), people with spinal cord injury (Tamplin et al., 2020), veterans (Vaudreuil et al., 2020) and people experiencing mental health challenges (Sasangohar et al., 2020).

"As Food Insecurity Worsens During COVID-19, Negative Mental Health Impact on Community Members Increases","IMPACT: For community engagement to be impactful and reduce health inequity, it needs to address timely needs in the community, including COVID-19 impacts. Here, we describe how pre- and post-COVID-19 food insecurity worsened mental health among community members served by HealthStreet University of Florida community engagement program. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: COVID-19 impacts the economic vitality and the mental health of communities;research and engagement activities must consider the context in which we are practicing and the needs of our community members. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: HealthStreet, the University of Florida community engagement program, sends Community Health Workers (CHWs) where people congregate to assess social determinants of health and medical histories, used to make referrals to services and research opportunities. CHWs conducted follow-up COVID-19 assessments measuring perceived stress, loneliness, depression, anxiety, binge drinking, and opioid use, as well as high blood pressure and food insecurity. Here, we consider mental health outcomes among 1,300 adults who reported being food insecure either at some time in the past 12 months at baseline, or at the COVID-19 follow-up assessment, and completed both. Chi-Square Test was used to determine p-values. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Overall, at the COVID-19 follow-up assessment, 37.1% (of 1,300) were still food insecure during COVID-19 (same), 20.3% (had become food insecure during COVID-19 (worse) and 42.6% were no longer food insecure (better). Those who were no longer food insecure were more likely to report less stress, while those still food insecure were more likely to report the highest stress and loneliness (p&lt;0.0001), while the worse off group was in the middle. Those who stayed food insecure were most likely to report depression and anxiety, and also high blood pressure and using opioids (p&lt;.05) compared to those getting worse or better. Binge drinking behavior was not significantly different across groups. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Community engagement activities across CTSIs must be sensitive to the needs of their communities. HealthStreet findings show that new and continuing food insecurity negatively influence mental health problems, pointing to the need for engagement to address multiple problems.","Striley, Catherine, Chaudhari, Piyush, Varma, Deepthi, Cottler, Linda","https://www.google.com/search?q=As+Food+Insecurity+Worsens+During+COVID-19,+Negative+Mental+Health+Impact+on+Community+Members+Increases","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of clinical and translational science; 5(Suppl 1):144-144, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27850,""

"The Bench Tutorials Program: An Essential Educational Pivot in response to COVID-19","IMPACT: The Bench Tutorials Program is an independent study course in biomedical research in which high school students are paired with graduate and post-doctoral students during the academic year. The purpose is to enhance the rigor of high school science education and build the pipeline of tomorrowâ€™s researchers. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The Bench Tutorials Program: <U+03BF> Proficiency in research design, implementation, and presentation;<U+03BF> Acquisition of hands-on laboratory skills;<U+03BF> Increase in scientific literacy;<U+03BF> Increase in analytical skills and critical thinking;<U+03BF> Career in science;<U+03BF> Build the pipeline of tomorrowâ€™s biomedical researchers METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: High School seniors are paired with graduate and postdoc mentors through a matching process. Students spend approximately four hours/week in supervised instruction and research from a participating laboratory in addition to classroom experience at their High School. Mentors design research projects relating to the larger research framework of their laboratories. In light of COVID-19, approaches have been adjusted to maintain the program safely through a hybrid method of using the high school lab for hands-on learning and through the use of Go-Pros â€™s to enable our mentors to video and narrate as they conduct experiments in their own labs to teach their mentees scientific methods and processes. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Since inception, more than 400 students and mentors have participated in the Bench Tutorialâ€™s program. This year we found a way to continue the program under COVID-19 restraints without putting anyone in harms way. Go-Pros have been essential for our program to maintain continuity for high school students who receive academic credit for this course. This program is also one of few in which our graduate students have the opportunity to serve as mentors in the scientific setting. Using Go-Proâ€™s will also enable us to provide teaching videos online for other academic institutions, so even in the absence of COVID-19 in the future, the continued use of these devices will still be of great value.

"Food insecurity, depressive symptoms, and the salience of gendered family roles during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa","Extensive research has indicated food insecurity to be associated with depressive symptoms, both of which have been indicated to increase globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies, however, have made use of nationally representative and longitudinal data to investigate this relationship, making causal claims difficult. In South Africa (SA), as with other low- and middle-income contexts, population-based studies have generally focused on mothers during the perinatal period and other vulnerable groups. This study made use of Cross-Lagged Dynamic Panel Models to examine the relationship between household food insecurity and the depressive symptoms of adults across three waves of the National Income Dynamics Surveyâ€“Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) study collected in 2020 and 2021, a dataset nationally representative of all adults in SA in 2017. Stratification of the sample by gender, parenthood and marital statuses allowed for the assessment of gender differences in family roles that might account for differential impacts of food insecurity on mental health outcomes. The findings of this study indicated a significant impact of food insecurity on the depressive symptoms of adults. Controlling for stable trait-like individual differences eliminated much of this relationship, indicating partial or full mediation by unobserved factors. Gender differences in food security's association with depressive symptoms amongst cohabitating parents following the inclusion of individual effects provided support for a gendered role response. These findings provide further evidence of the complex interactions between sex, gender and health.","Shepherd, Debra L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Food+insecurity,+depressive+symptoms,+and+the+salience+of+gendered+family+roles+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+South+Africa","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social science & medicine (1982);2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27853,""
"Anxiety, stress and depression levels among nurses of educational hospitals in Iran: Time of performing nursing care for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients","BACKGROUND: Following the global emergency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), health-care workers, especially nurses were encountered with an increasing workload. Therefore, due to the importance of this issue, the present study aimed to examine stress, anxiety, and depression levels among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in four educational hospitals affiliated to Kerman University of Medical Sciences in 2020. The standard Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire was applied to assess the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in nurse personnel with a census method (n = 403). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analytic statistics such as Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov, Mannâ€“Whitney, Kruskalâ€“Wallis, and multiple linear regression tests through the version 20, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, Software at the level of P &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that the mean scores of depressions (9.18 Â± 4.45), stress (9.62 Â± 4.94), and anxiety (10.32 Â± 4.85) in nurses were at moderate level. A significant relationship was observed between stressed, anxious, and depressed participants in the gender, marital status, level of education, and working hours per month. No statistically significant relationship was found between other demographic variables including age, work experience, and employment status with anxiety, depression, and stress categories. CONCLUSION: The results of this study can increase the awareness of health system managers, especially hospitals, about the level of stress, anxiety, and depression and can help in order to provide psychological support programs for improving the mental health of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sheikhbardsiri, Hojjat, Doustmohammadi, Mohammad Mahdi, Afshar, Parya Jangipour, Heidarijamebozorgi, Majid, Khankeh, Hamidreza, Beyramijam, Mehdi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety,+stress+and+depression+levels+among+nurses+of+educational+hospitals+in+Iran:+Time+of+performing+nursing+care+for+suspected+and+confirmed+COVID-19+patients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of education and health promotion; 10, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27854,""
"A Focus on Methodology: A Mixed-Methods Approach to Conduct a Comprehensive Evaluation of the Need for One Health Education for Medical and Veterinary Students in the Context of COVID-19","Background: The collaboration of health professionals across the interface of human, animal and environmental health, as embodied by the One Health concept (OH), is increasingly recognised as crucial for tackling diseases such as Ebola and COVID-19. This study was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in light of the current pandemic, the outcomes of this study highlight the need for educating Medical (MD) and Veterinary (DVM) students on the principles of OH. The purpose of this study was to determine the need for Interprofessional Education (IPE) initiatives that would familiarise MD and DVM students with the principles of OH, crucial to dissolving the siloes that have historically deterred collaboration. Method: We used a sequential explanatory Methods Research (MMR) approach design to evaluate the readiness of 428 students consisting of MD, DVM and dual degree Master of Public Health (MPH) students (MD/MPH, DVM/MPH) for IPE, as well as to obtain faculty perspectives across these disciplines, on the need for curricula inclusion of IPE and OH. Two methods of data collection were employed: A survey and 2 focus groups interviews. Results: The use of an MMR approach allowed us to comprehensively evaluate the need for OH education through the lenses of the students and faculty using a joint display that facilitated data integration and evaluation. Overall, the dual degree students had the greatest readiness for IPE, and MD students the lowest level of readiness for shared learning. The dual degree students had the most accurate understanding of OH competencies that consider the impacts of climate change, food security, antimicrobial resistance, health policy formation and zoonoses occurrence on human health. Themes derived from the focus group interviews revealed that faculty perceived OH education as crucial for preparing MD and DVM students for practice. Conclusion: The comprehensive assessment of the student and faculty perspectives, obtained using an MMR approach, illustrated that the incorporation of OH competencies within the MD and DVM curricula are crucial for preparing students for practice in the global environment. The dual degree pathway provides insight into how OH can be successfully incorporated within the curricula of these programmes.","Roopnarine, Rohini R.; Boeren, Ellen","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Focus+on+Methodology:+A+Mixed-Methods+Approach+to+Conduct+a+Comprehensive+Evaluation+of+the+Need+for+One+Health+Education+for+Medical+and+Veterinary+Students+in+the+Context+of+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental health insights; 16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27855,""
"Evolving and Thriving - Keeping Music Therapy Alive in a Pandemic World: The Royal Melbourne Hospital Music Therapy Response in 2020","Music therapy was required to (a) evolve and expand its clinical service due to a significant rise in referrals across the hospital resulting in a dramatic increase in referrals outside clinically allocated streams, and (b) focus on supporting healthcare workers' wellbeing across the entire organisation with the formation of Scrub Choir. Introduction Established in 1998 at one of Victoria's major adult hospitals, our music therapy (MT) program centres on live music and guided songwriting at the bedside for rehabilitation, comfort, pain reduction, mood elevation, end of life care and increased quality of life (O'Brien 1999, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2012, 2014). In the following brief literature review, we have explored practice-based papers and surveys of MT COVID-19 services and technology, established literature on the impact of singing for wellbeing, and research into health care workers' (HCW) mental health. There were some insightful limitations to the study in a cultural and gender context specific to the participants group, which included preconceptions of gender roles, which the authors believed influenced participation (the researchers found male participants were less reluctant to access music and dance than female participants), and the access by female participants appeared to be influenced by their hometown origins (with a greater uptake by females in Northern areas of India).","O'Brien, E.; Bedggood, J.; Ayling, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Evolving+and+Thriving+-+Keeping+Music+Therapy+Alive+in+a+Pandemic+World:+The+Royal+Melbourne+Hospital+Music+Therapy+Response+in+2020","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Australian Journal of Music Therapy; 32(1):80-96, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27856,""

"Psychological consequences of lockdown on dental professionals during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes COVID-19, mainly spreads through respiratory droplets. The dental profession is particularly at risk. Routine dental care was suspended after the announcement of the first lockdown in India. This makes the group vulnerable to psychosocial consequences. The present study aims to evaluate the psychosocial issues among dental professionals during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 627 dental professionals of India, using online Google Forms from April 23, 2020, through April 30, 2020. Participants were evaluated using self-constructed and self-administered personal and professional hardship and fear checklist specifically developed for this study. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Depression Scale and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and PHQ-15 were used to assess the depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. RESULTS: Fear had a remarkable impact on 80.7% of responders. Among the participants, 40.5%, 24.5%, and 30.6% reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, respectively. Somatic symptoms were significantly associated with gender (P = 0.000). Work setting was significantly associated with depression (P = 0.011) and anxiety symptoms (P = 0.001). Concern, worry, and fear due to COVID-19 were significantly associated with depression (P = 0.000), anxiety (P = 0.033), and somatic symptoms (P = 0.009). There was a positive correlation between depression and anxiety symptoms (P = 0.01) and between age and somatic symptoms (P = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: This group reported a high level of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Female dental professionals and private practitioners had more depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms.

"A CNN based coronavirus disease prediction system for chest X-rays","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) proliferated globally in early 2020, causing existential dread in the whole world. Radiography is crucial in the clinical staging and diagnosis of COVID-19 and offers high potential to improve healthcare plans for tackling the pandemic. However high variations in infection characteristics and low contrast between normal and infected regions pose great challenges in preparing radiological reports. To address these challenges, this study presents CODISC-CNN (CNN based Coronavirus DIsease Prediction System for Chest X-rays) that can automatically extract the features from chest X-ray images for the disease prediction. However, to get the infected region of X-ray, edges of the images are detected by applying image preprocessing. Furthermore, to attenuate the shortage of labeled datasets data augmentation has been adapted. Extensive experiments have been performed to classify X-ray images into two classes (Normal and COVID), three classes (Normal, COVID, and Virus Bacteria), and four classes (Normal, COVID, and Virus Bacteria, and Virus Pneumonia) with the accuracy of 97%, 89%, and 84% respectively.

"The New Normal: A Virtual Summer Foundations in Research","IMPACT: The Summer Foundation on Research gave undergraduate students the opportunity to do research despite the new normal - COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The COVID-19 pandemic prevented domestic and international undergraduate students from attending in-person Mayo Clinic Summer Undergraduate Research Programs. Mayo decided to redesign this program as a virtual, 4-week Summer Foundations in Research (SFIR) program. The goal of this program was to give students a scientific research experience. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The SFIR included an Introduction to Experimental Design, Dialogue methodology for communicating science, scientific mentoring, asynchronous online modules and a Resiliency component. Evaluations of the program were undertaken to gather feedback for program improvement and to assess the educational and mental health impact on participants. These evaluations asked student to rate each section of the program. Additionally, students were encouraged to provide their own comments and feedback. Statistical analysis of quantitative data was performed using excel. The qualitative data was studied using the identification, analysis and interpretation of patterns method per the studentâ€™s comments on each of the questions addressed in the survey. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: These evaluations revealed positive outcomes across program components: 66% of the participants found the Resiliency component extremely worthwhile, 80% of participants liked the experimental design and 70% liked the educational courses. Qualitative data showed that mentor/mentee interactions were highly valued, and both participants and faculty suggested increasing the amount of time devoted to these interactions. Small group discussions gave students the opportunity to get to know other peers and encouraged further discussions about science and the community. Participants suggested minor improvements to the program, such as re-creating the online modules specific for undergraduate students, increasing 1-to-1 and small groupâ€™s discussion, and increasing the length of the program. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Despite the quick pivot of the SFIR program, the re-design and new format supported the development of participantsâ€™ resilience skills and training as future scientists during a particularly challenging time.

"Development and validation of English version of COVID-19 Depression Scale for health-care workers","BACKGROUND: Health-care workers (HCWs) are highly vulnerable to depression during an epidemic outbreak. Protecting the mental well-being of HCWs is a priority while battling with COVID-19. However, documentation on COVID-19-related depression among HCWs is scarce due to the limited availability of measuring scales. Hence, this study was purposed to develop a scale to measure depression relating to COVID-19 and evaluate its psychometric properties among HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validation study was carried out among 320 HCWs including physicians of various medical specialties, dental specialists, and nurses in the year 2020. Exploratory factor analysis using Promax rotation with Kaiser normalization for the determination of factor structure was employed in data analysis using SPSS version 16 software. RESULTS: COVID-19 Depression Scale for HCWs (CDS-HW) demonstrated a two-component structure identified as â€œwork-related anxietyâ€ and â€œpsychological distress.â€ The mean CDS-HW score of the study participants was observed to be 23.67 Â± 2.82, and the scale demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.741).

According to the AUDIT-C results, the prevalence of harmful drinking was 38.5%. Those who reported that their alcohol consumption decreased during the pandemic had high scores on the AUDIT-C, indicating a moderate/severe risk of drinking. Moderate or severe anxiety was observed in 60.1% of participants. These results highlight the needs to assess the pandemicâ€™s consequences on the mental health of the population and to encourage the implementation of preventive approaches in PHC settings to address anxiety and harmful alcohol consumption.","de Vargas, Divane, Ramirez, Erika Gisset Leon, Pereira, Caroline Figueira, Jacinto Volpato, Rosa, de Oliveira, Sheila Ramos","https://www.google.com/search?q=Alcohol+Use+and+Anxiety+in+Primary+Health+Care+Patients+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+a+Phone-Based+Study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction;: 1-16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27863,""
"Mechanisms Underlying Lipidomic Changes in Major Depressive Disorder","IMPACT: Lipidomics is emerging as a powerful strategy to identify biomarkers for Major Depressive Disorder, as well as therapeutic targets in lipid metabolic pathways. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Lipidomics is increasingly recognized in precision psychiatry for global lipid perturbations in patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We will test the hypothesis that lipid metabolism dysregulation is associated with familial risk of depression. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Patients with MDD (G1), children (G2), and grandchildren (G3) have been part of a longitudinal study since 1982. If a parent G2 and grandparent G1 have MDD, G3 is considered a high risk of depression. Biospecimens (saliva and serum) were collected for full exome sequencing and RNA analysis. Samples will also be extracted for lipid content and lipids will be identified by mass spectrometry. A panel of nearly 600 lipid species can reliably be identified and quantified using liquid chromatography paired with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Dysregulated lipids will be correlated with familial risk of depression in samples of G3. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We hypothesize that dysregulation of lipids and lipid metabolism will be apparent in biospecimens from the high risk compared to the low risk of depression. Also, alterations in RNA transcriptomics of genes involved in lipid metabolic networks are associated with familial risk of depression. Several differential lipid species were previously identified to be associated with MDD. Reduced phosphatidylcholine(PC), phosphatidylethanolamine(PE), phosphatidylinositol(PI), and increased LysoPC, LysoPE, ceramide, triacylglycerol, and diacylglycerol levels have been correlated to MDD. However, these results need to be replicated in independent studies using lipidomics analysis. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: It is highly likely that completely novel cellular targets will emerge from these studies by uncovering the convergence of lipidomics and genetic variance of lipid metabolic enzymes as biomarkers for predisposition to MDD as well as potential targets for therapeutic development for MDD.","Costa, Ana Paula, van Dijr, Milenna T.; Talati, Ardesheer, Weissmann, Myrna M.; McIntire, Laura Beth","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mechanisms+Underlying+Lipidomic+Changes+in+Major+Depressive+Disorder","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of clinical and translational science; 5(Suppl 1):99-100, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27864,""
"Economic expectations and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: a one-year longitudinal evaluation on Italian university students","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced an extensive aggravation of peopleâ€™s anxiety level. Different policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus could affect anxiety in various ways. We built an ad hoc web-based survey, administered to the student population of three Italian universities at the beginning of the pandemic and at one yearâ€™s distance, to collect information on retrospective and current anxiety levels and the underlining reasons. The survey also included questions concerning sociodemographic, economic, labor, lifestyle, academic career, and on-line teaching features, which prevents students from identifying the main survey topic to be anxiety. This research aims at assessing the change in anxiety levels between the analyzed periods and the main determinants of such change, focusing on studentsâ€™ economic expectancies. Results from a Poisson regression model show that anxiety has increased compared to both the pre-pandemic level and the one quantified during the first lockdown. This increase is revealed to be mostly driven by economic and career-related uncertainties, rather than by job loss and proximity to COVID-19. Thus, policymakers should take action to provide certainties both in terms of economic prospects and reopening strategies, especially to avoid that the resulting increase in anxiety translates into an amplified suicide risk.","Busetta, Giovanni, Campolo, Maria Gabriella, Panarello, Demetrio","https://www.google.com/search?q=Economic+expectations+and+anxiety+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+a+one-year+longitudinal+evaluation+on+Italian+university+students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Quality & quantity;: 1-18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27865,""
"Giving birth during COVID-19 from the birthing personâ€™s perspective","IMPACT: This work provides context from the patient perspective on the impact of hospital policies on their birthing experiencing during the first peak of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The goal of this study was to report the intrapartum care experiences from people giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Place of birth included hospital, birth center and home births. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Studies that involved patient-related data collection are hindered by pandemic-related changes in clinical practices and research policies. Our aim was to assess patient experience during a pandemic, we explored data collection via a large online community of pregnant women. We asked if women who birthed during COVID-19 changed their birth setting and if they experienced less respectful care, more pressure to undergo induction and/or cesarean birth and newborn separation. We also wanted to explore whether there were differences in the care experience depending on the race of the woman. Open ended questions on care experiences were included and content analysis conducted. Bivariate analysis was conducted comparing those from high versus less COVID-19 impacted areas and by race (White/Black self-identifying). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The mean age was 31.5 years (SD = 5.0), 80.7% identified as White, 85.0% married, and 85.3% privately insured (N=388). Bivariate unadjusted analyses comparing high vs. low impact COVID-19 states, 22.3% considered changing their place of birth versus 12.7% in less impacted areas (p&lt;.05): no difference pressure for induction/cesarean based on region. In bivariate unadjusted analysis comparing White and Black people, Black people had higher odds of pressure for cesarean or induction compared to White (OR 10.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 48.6, p=.0003). Black people had lower respect scores vs. White (68.7 vs. 72.3 p&lt;.01) and higher odds of preterm birth 3.7 (1.1 to 12.4, p=0.04). Content analysis themes were institutional policies, changes in care, hospital staff interactions, sub-par care, support during birth and mental health. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The analysis demonstrated differences among participants from highly versus less impacted COVID-19 states. Disparities persisted with Black women reporting lower respect, pressure for interventions and more preterm birth when compared to White participants.

"Associations of Depression and Anxiety with Stigma in a Sample of Patients in Saudi Arabia Who Recovered from COVID-19","Purpose The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak combined with social distancing, isolation, and movement restrictions has had a profound impact on individualsâ€™ physical and psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of depression and anxiety with feelings of stigma among patients in Saudi Arabia who have recovered from COVID-19. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and December 2020. Trained healthcare providers contacted and interviewed participants by phone. Depression, anxiety, and stigma were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue stigma scale (EMIC). Data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and family history of mental illness were also collected. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore factors associated with depression and anxiety. Results A total of 174 adult participants (=18 years old) who had recently recovered from COVID-19 were interviewed. The mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were 7.53 (Â±5.04) and 3.77 (Â±4.47), respectively. About 68% of the participants had at least mild depression (PHQ-9 score of 5â€“9), whereas only 29.89% had at least mild anxiety (GAD-7 score of 5â€“9) during their infections with COVID-19. Multiple linear regression showed that females were more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders than their male counterparts were (ÃŸ=3.071 and ÃŸ=1.86, respectively). Notably, participantsâ€™ stigma scores were significantly associated with higher scores on depression and anxiety. Conclusion These findings highlight the negative consequences of COVID-19 infection on the mental health of recovered patients. Therefore, considerable attention from local and international health authorities is needed to improve the mental well-being of recovered COVID-19 patients.","Alkathiri, Munirah A.; Almohammed, Omar A.; Alqahtani, Faleh, AlRuthia, Yazed","https://www.google.com/search?q=Associations+of+Depression+and+Anxiety+with+Stigma+in+a+Sample+of+Patients+in+Saudi+Arabia+Who+Recovered+from+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology research and behavior management; 15:381-390, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27868,""

"Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment Training for Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Quasi-Experimental Comparison of Distance and Face-to-Face Learning","Alcohol and drug misuse continue to result in negative outcomes in the United States. Training nurses in screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) has been proposed as one approach to mitigating those harms. Such training can lead to improved attitudes and intention to use SBIRT in clinical practice, but whether those outcomes manifest similarly for distance or face-to-face learning has not been investigated. The current study is a quasi-experimental comparison of face-to-face and distance SBIRT education for undergraduate nursing students performed in Fall 2019. No differences in attitudes or intentions were observed between face-to-face and distance learning approaches. Self-reported competence meaningfully increased in both study arms, and there was some evidence of additional increases in perceived role legitimacy and intention to use SBIRT. To the degree that benefits are observed for SBIRT training, they may not vary between face-to-face and distance learning implementations of the same curriculum.

"Assessment of depression and anxiety in residents of a continuing care retirement community during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine","Purpose of Study During the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Louisiana implemented a quarantine to decrease the risk of infection. This situation led to a decrease in social interaction which is a risk factor for anxiety and depression, among the elderly population confined in residences. The objective was to determine whether being quarantined while living in a residential community would negatively affect the mental health of the elderly. Methods Used A short longitudinal assessment and analysis to assess anxiety and depression. Data was initially collected, then at 6 weeks, and 12 weeks during the quarantine. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) as these screening tools are designed for the elderly, to assess the incidence and severity during the quarantine. Summary of Results 57 residents of a Continuous Care Retirement Community (CCRC) in the New Orleans metropolitan area, stratified as nursing home residents, assisted living, and independent living of a 37 (80%) of the 46 patients were females, with a mean age of 86.1 (SD 9.1) years old;25 (54.3%) were nursing home residents, 13 (28.3%) were in assisted living, and 8 (17.4%) were in an independent living community. 16 (34.8%) patients were diagnosed with depression before taking the survey, and five (10.9%) had previously diagnosed anxiety. Anxiety scores decreased significantly from baseline (average 4.35 vs. 3.28, p-value =0.045) at 6 weeks but did not change from time 0 to week 12 or week 6 to week 12. Depression, scores did not change significantly between the time periods. Conclusions Our data indicate a trend toward an increase in depression and anxiety during periods of pandemic quarantine isolation. Because the elderly are particularly susceptible to loneliness and resulting depression assessing these indicators may help mitigate the economic burden and cognitive decline resulting from the complications of depression and anxiety in the elderly population residing in community centers during periods of unanticipated extended quarantine isolation.","Aguilar, E.

"Is psychological distress associated with carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms and nerve conduction study findings? AÂ caseâ€“control study from Syria","BackgroundCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist which causes severe symptoms. However, psychological aspects can affect patients' perception of this pain and can cause similar pain in some instances. This study aims to determine the association between symptoms severity, functional status, and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of adult patients with CTS and their anger, anxiety, and depression status.MethodsThis caseâ€“control study was conducted in clinics in Damascus, Syria. Controls were frequency matched by gender and age from a general clinic. Interviews based on questionnaires were used that included the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ-A), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Dimensions of Anger Reactions Scale-5 (DAR-5), and NCS.ResultsOverall, 242 patients (121 cases) were included in this study. Cases with CTS had significantly higher anxiety and depression when compared to controls, but not higher anger. Cases with higher anxiety, depression, and anger had significantly more CTS symptoms and less functional status. Anxiety was also higher in cases with normal NCS in the case group. When using regression, anxiety and depression remained significantly associated with having CTS.ConclusionAnxiety and depression are more prominent with CTS. Furthermore, having anxiety and depression were associated with more CTS symptoms in the hand. Having anger was also associated with more CTS symptoms among cases. These findings emphasize the importance of psychological aspects when having hand pain or CTS symptoms as these patients might have these symptoms despite having normal NCS.","Alsharif, Aya, Aya Al, Habbal, Daaboul, Yaman, Lama Al, Hawat, Osama Al, Habbal, Kakaje, Ameer","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2493","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain and Behavior; 12(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27876,""
"Physical Therapy Student Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Introduction. According to research studies and surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety have increased with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for young adults and has the potential to affect students' learning outcomes and long-term well-being. Review of Literature. Current research on the experience of stress for students in the health professions has focused on nursing and medical students. There are no published studies exploring pandemic-related stress in physical therapy. The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of stress for Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects. Twenty-four students in their first, second, and third year of study from 3 physical therapist education programs. Methods. Using a phenomenological qualitative approach, 60-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant through video conference in April and May of 2020. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify and refine codes and construct themes and subthemes. Results. Four themes resulted from analyses of these data: sources of stress, stress management, stress modifiers, and positive aspects of COVID. Sources of stress were related to academics, uncertainty, personal circumstances, and finances. DPT students described stress associated with the transition to online learning related to focus, engagement, workload, and reduced opportunities to practice hands-on skills. Uncertainty was particularly stressful for third-year students who were anxious about clinical experiences, board examinations, and future employment. Stress management strategies were centered on cognitive reappraisal, physical activity, and social support. Discussion and Conclusion. While students identified several sources of stress during the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, important stress modifiers, such as faculty and cohort-based peer support, were highlighted that have the potential to reduce stress for students both in times of crisis and under more typical circumstances. These factors, in combination with findings suggesting that increased flexibility and agency over learning mediated stress responses, have potential implications for instructional delivery and academic program design.","Anderson, Christina E.

"Acute food refusal in 12 year old with anorexia nervosa requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation for enteral feedings","Case Report Anorexia Nervosa is a mental health disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Acute food refusal is one of the indications for admission. We present a patient who went to extreme lengths to restrict food intake, requiring intensive care sedation and ventilation to enable enteral feedings. 12 year old male, was admitted with symptoms of anorexia nervosa and BMI of 12.0, (&lt;1%ile) with baseline BMI of 16 (25%ile), K of 3.3 and glucose of 54. He was treated with supervised eating on an inpatient pediatric floor with no need for enteral feeding. Psychiatry consultation confirmed the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and recommended the addition of Olanzapine to his Sertraline. He was discharged pending placement in an eating disorder center after 21 days of hospitalization with discharge BMI of 14. He was followed as an outpatient by his pediatrician, dietician and counselor but unfortunately, he required readmission 11 days after discharge due to acute food refusal, with BMI that had dropped to 13.1. Patient was readmitted and started on nasogastric (NG) feeds but he became severely agitated, pulling NG out multiple times and continued to lose weight with BMI dropping to 12. Sedation was attempted to facilitate maintenance of NG feedings, with Benadryl, Haldol and Ativan, but was ineffective at levels deemed safe without compromising his airway and breathing. Due to severe malnourishment and unsuccessful NG feeds he was transferred to PICU for sedation, endotracheal intubation and continuous nasoduodenal (ND) tube feedings on two separate occasions while inpatient. He was able to wean from the ventilator but once awake he found ways to manipulate delivery of his calories, even finding scissors and cutting the ND tube. The patient ultimately agreed to eat in order to avoid replacement of the feeding tube. He was finally transferred to an eating disorder facility, with a BMI of 13.9 and persistent anorexia thinking with restriction of eating anything but pizza. Patient completed three months of an inpatient program and had significant improvement in BMI to 19.3 (70%ile). He was subsequently discharged for continued outpatient follow-up and since discharge from the eating disorder center, his BMI has shown steady improvement in outpatient follow-up. He shows no signs of food refusal and is doing well with Family Based Therapy. This case highlights several unique characteristics in management of eating disorder patients. The age and being male along with extreme food refusal and resistance to enteral feeding that led to the requirement of deep sedation are quite unusual and not well described in the medical literature. The severity of his illness was a significant barrier to inpatient placement. In addition, despite a nationwide attempt to find an inpatient facility for him, which took several weeks, we identified shortages in eating disorder beds that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Andrucioli, A.; Burns, J.

"How People with a Chronic Health Condition Have Promoted their Health during COVID-19","To interview individuals with long-standing Multiple Sclerosis about their perceptions of COVID-19 restrictions on health, health care access, and health promotion. A descriptive qualitative approach with maximum variation sampling was used to facilitate low inference interpretation. After coming to consensus on the codes, the researchers clustered the codes and used them to identify emerging themes, consistent with analytic techniques suggested by Miles and Huberman. Telephone interviews were conducted with individuals with multiple sclerosis living in the community who were recruited from the mailing list of the National MS Society. The 24 individuals interviewed had an average age of 66 years, and had been diagnosed an average of 32 years. Half were married, and 75% were female. Many had college degrees;six were employed. This is a qualitative study with no intervention. Self-reported health, health care access, and health promoting behaviors. Four interconnected themes emerged from the analysis: negative effects on health and health promotion, being isolated, loss of spontaneity in daily life, and resilience. Although most individuals initially reported no effect of COVID-19 on their health, additional probing revealed that some felt weaker and had more balance problems. Normal exercise regimens had been disrupted for approximately half of them. Several also described decreased social interactions;80% expressed negative emotional impacts. Many utilized previously developed coping mechanisms, such as cognitive reframing, and support from family as they adapted to COVID-19. Most individuals reported no MS exacerbations and were able to have some contact with providers, usually through telehealth. Providers and researchers should monitor the on-going impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical functioning and emotional well-being among individuals with MS. Higher levels of depression have been previously reported among those with MS. For those needing mental health supports, rapid advancements in telehealth enable providers to refer them to psychological services provided through access from their homes. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.","Becker, Heather, Stuifbergen, Alexa, Britt, Katherine, Lim, Sungju","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2022.01.113","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation; 103(3):e40-e41, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27882,""
"Digital transformation in practice based learning","Keywords: Digital;Placement;Impact Purpose: Since February 2020 COVID 19 has presented significant challenges to physiotherapy staff and had devastating impact on many services putting continued provision of practice based learning (PBL) at significant risk. Academic and clinical professionals have been compelled to develop safe alternatives to traditional PBL thereby ensuring students have adequate opportunity to meet statutory and professional body requirements. The NHS Long Term Plan (NHS, 2019a) and Interim People plan (NHS, 2019b identify digital transformation and significant growth of the Allied Health Profession workforce as essential for the continued delivery of high quality health and social care. Implementation of these plans is contingent on both adequate volume and a continuous pipeline of digitally able AHP graduates. Working in partnership, Teesside University and Tees Esk & Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust coproduced a technology enhanced 5 week service development and leadership learning opportunity within the clinical specialisms of Mental Health and Learning Disability to enable continued high quality PBL. Methods: An iterative process of development began with wide ranging consultation and discussion across organisations and professional networks to inform the structure and content of the 5 week experience. A programme of learning was developed comprising: formal teaching, individual and group directed learning, consultation, individual, peer and group supervision Due to the new and novel nature of this PBL, students were briefed and invited to express interest in involvement;six students were subsequently allocated. In addition to standard evaluation processes all students took part in a focus group to enable them to share reflections and give comprehensive feedback to academic and clinical staff. All clinical staff completed a feedback questionnaire to inform future development. Results: Six students successfully completed 5 weeks technology enhanced PBL. All reported that this opportunity enabled them to achieve their personal, clinical, professional and statutory body outcomes and standards with a rounded experience of Mental Health and Learning Disabilities services. Students felt focused 1:1, group and peer supervision provided enhanced support and enabled high levels of learning and achievement. Students, clinical and academic staff all suggested the opportunity should continue with only minor modification to the current format. Placement capacity significantly increased. Whilst initial organisation was time consuming, with an overarching framework in place this will be considerably reduced for future occurrences. Conclusion(s): The revered model of PBL which is patient facing and involves a 1:1 model of supervision can be effectively replaced with technology enhanced non patient facing experience using an innovative mixed methods model of supervision. This approach can provide students with insight and experience which is not possible via traditional PBL, develop their digital literacy, confidence, resilience and emotional intelligence and foster a broad understanding of healthcare. Impact: This framework can be translated across organisations, settings and specialties offering solutions to the challenges presented by COVID19 and offer a high quality solution to ongoing PBL capacity deficit whilst adding value to the experience and development of students and clinical staff.

"Optimism and pessimism analysis using deep learning on COVID-19 related Twitter conversations","This paper proposes a new deep learning approach to better understand how optimistic and pessimistic feelings are conveyed in Twitter conversations about COVID-19. A pre-trained transformer embedding is used to extract the semantic features and several network architectures are compared. Model performance is evaluated on two new, publicly available Twitter corpora of crisis-related posts. The best performing pessimism and optimism detection models are based on bidirectional long- and short-term memory networks. Experimental results on four periods of the COVID-19 pandemic show how the proposed approach can model optimism and pessimism in the context of a health crisis. There is a total of 150,503 tweets and 51,319 unique users. Conversations are characterised in terms of emotional signals and shifts to unravel empathy and support mechanisms. Conversations with stronger pessimistic signals denoted little emotional shift (i.e. 62.21% of these conversations experienced almost no change in emotion). In turn, only 10.42% of the conversations laying more on the optimistic side maintained the mood. User emotional volatility is further linked with social influence.","Blanco, Guillermo, LourenÃ§o, AnÃ¡lia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.102918","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Information Processing & Management;: 102918, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27884,""
"What motivates older adults from community-based exercise groups to participate in home-based exercise?","Keywords: Home-based exercise;Motivation;Older adults Purpose: Physical activity is important to promote physical and mental health, yet over half of those in the UK aged 75 years or older are inactive. Many community-based exercise groups for older adults have been suspended to reduce COVID-19 transmission;therefore, it is important for older adults to find other ways to maintain an active lifestyle. Understanding what motivates older adults from exercise groups to engage in home-based exercise can help physiotherapists implement programmes that align with older adultsâ€™ motivations and consequently maximise participation, health, and well-being. Methods: Study design: This cross-sectional study used an online survey to record the motivations of older adults from two community-based exercise groups for participating in home-based exercise. Participants and setting: Participants were recruited from two community-based exercise groups in Derby, UK. Exercise class instructors managed access to the study population by acting as gatekeepers to maintain participantsâ€™ anonymity. Data collection: An online survey (n = 40) of adults aged 65â€“85 years recorded participantsâ€™ age, gender and exercise behaviours, and included the Exercise Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ-E) produced by The Center for Self-Determination Theory. According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), motivation is ranked along a continuum depending on the degree to which a behaviour is autonomously regulated, and consequently, of higher quality and value to the individual. The SRQ-E included 16 statements for which participants indicated their agreement using a seven-point Likert scale. These statements were grouped into the motivation subtypes defined by SDT: external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation. Statistical methods: Statistical analysis was conducted using the R statistical software environment. Analysis of Variance followed by a Tukey post-hoc test identified differences between motivation subtypes with P &lt; 0.05 indicating a significant result. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested the construct validity of the SRQ-E by identifying correlations between motivation subtypes and their corresponding SRQ-E statements. Results: Identified regulation was the main source of motivation for participation in home-based exercise;individuals deemed the value provided by exercise to be personally important (F = 88.11, df = 3, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the CFA indicated high validity of the SRQ-E for measuring motivation (<U+03C7>2 = 218, df = 98, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion(s): Identified regulation most strongly motivated participation in home-based exercise. According to SDT, this indicates that older adults from community-based exercise groups understood and found meaning from the benefits of home-based exercise. Future research should focus on sedentary older adultsâ€™ motivations to participate in exercise as these are the individuals most at risk from chronic disease due to inactivity, and therefore have much to gain from modifying their behaviour. Impact: To promote home-based exercise in older adults from exercise groups, physiotherapists should identify aspects of life which older adults find meaningful and highlight to them how exercise can help to maintain these. By increasing communication in this way, physiotherapists can also provide advice and reassurance, which may additionally increase intrinsic motivation for home-based exercise by supporting older adultsâ€™ psychological need for relatedness. Physiotherapists have the potential to dramatically improve motivation for participating in home-based exercise which has implications for the wellbeing of older adults.

"Assessment of the Teaching on Alcohol Use and Management in Current Health Professional Curricula in India","Alcohol consumption is globally a serious public health challenge, and it is rampant across all parts of India. The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the overall burden of alcoholism due to long working hours, increased mental stress, depression, and so on. Primary care physicians have an important role in assessing risk and providing counselling, intervention and treatment of alcohol misuse. Studies have demonstrated primary health care facilities to be ideally suited for alcohol prevention and cessation interventions as most patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) seek treatment from facilities in the primary care setting in India. Thus, the training of healthcare professionals is vital in addressing AUDs in India. The Indian government is setting up Health and Wellness Centres across the country intended to address long-term care and holistic health promotion. At the same time, healthcare providers have expressed their limited competence in cessation and counselling practices related to AUDs. One of the attributing factors for these limitations is the paucity of exposure during the formative years. With this background, a review was undertaken of the current prescribed undergraduate professional curricula (medical, nursing, dentistry and physiotherapy) in India to assess its current status and preparedness in addressing alcohol misuse. The study findings emphasise the need to bolster the continuing education of health professionals aimed at health promotion and preventive strategies by hands-on training, brief workshops, supervised clinical experience by extramural faculty such as addiction psychiatrists, use of standardised patients, role play, and other similar methods.","Chauhan, Arohi, Sinha, Rajeshwari, Kanungo, Srikanta, Nayak, Subhasish, Samantaray, Kajal, Chokshi, Maulik, Mokashi, Tushar, Nair, Arun, Mahapatra, Pranab, Pati, Sanghamitra","https://doi.org/10.1177/09720634221078068","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Health Management;: 09720634221078068, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27887,""
"Well-being and career change intention: COVID-19's impact on unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers","Purpose - This study aims to examine the psychological distress experienced by unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers during the COVID-19 crisis and further investigate how this distress affects their career change intentions. Design/methodology/approach - Derived from a sample of 607 unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the data for this research are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - This study reveals that unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers are financially strained, depressed, socially isolated and panic-stricken due to the pandemic's effects. These effects lead to impaired wellbeing and an increased intention to leave the hospitality industry. Female and younger employees are impacted to a greater extent, while furloughedworkers received fewer impacts compared to their laid-off compatriots. Research limitations/implications - This study suggests that lockdown restrictions need to be implemented more deliberately, and the psychological well-being of the hospitality workforce deserves more immediate and continuing attention. It advises that hospitality businesses consider furloughs over layoffs when workforce reduction measures are necessary to combat the financial crisis. Originality/value - This study adds to the current literature by examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from the employee perspective. New insights are offered on the psychological toll of workforce reduction strategies during the financial fallout and howthese distressing experiences affect career change intention.","Chen, C.

"Asian Americansâ€™ Parentâ€“Child Conflict and Racial Discrimination May Explain Mental Distress","Despite being stereotyped as problem-free and high-achieving, Asian Americans are vulnerable to mental distress (e.g., depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide), according to the limited available studies. Ethnic subgroups also have more variable outcomes than the monolithic category, ?Asians or Asian Americans,? may suggest, but even across communities, few utilize mental health care compared to other racial/ethnic groups. To illustrate the needed evidence, a longitudinal survey of Filipino and Korean Americans found that mental distress among young Asian Americans increased at an alarming rate during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Two prominent contextual factors, parent?child conflict and racial discrimination, explained the uptick in mental distress. The surge of anti-Asian discrimination since the COVID-19 pandemic requires anti-discrimination policy, while parent?child conflict requires working with families in a culturally competent way.","Choi, Yoonsun, Jeong, Eunseok, Park, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322211068173","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences; 9(1):18-26, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27889,""

"Cracks before the crisis: Polarization prior to COVID-19 predicts increased collective angst and economic pessimism","We examine how polarization within societies is associated with reduced confidence in national responses to the COVID-19 crisis. We surveyed 4,731 participants across nine countries at Wave 1 (France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, UK and US) and then at Wave 2 (three months later) recontacted 840 participants from two countries (UK and US). We found that perceived polarization in the years preceding COVID-19 predicted enhanced perception that a country's COVID response was anomic (i.e., disorganized, chaotic), which in turn predicted greater collective angst and economic pessimism. Moreover, polarization measured at Wave 1 continued to predict perceptions that the COVID-19 response was anomic at Wave 2, and in turn, enhanced collective angst, pessimism, and the perception that dramatic political change was required to recover from COVID-19. Our findings highlight how polarization may be associated with reduced confidence in leaders and government at times of crisis and how this predicts future-focused anxiety and pessimism.

"Does Spending Time in Nature Help Students Cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our economy, social lives, and mental health, and it therefore provides a unique chance for researchers to examine how people cope with changes to their everyday activities. Research suggests that people may be spending more time in nature than they did pre-pandemic. The current study sheds light on how nature is being used to cope with the stresses of the global health crisis and lockdowns. Canadian undergraduate students (N = 559) filled out a questionnaire during the fall of 2020 about their pandemic experience, including their affects, life satisfaction, and feelings of flourishing and vitality, in addition to a wide variety of nature variables. The weekly exposures, the perceived increases or decreases in the exposure to nature during the pandemic, and the feelings of connectedness (nature relatedness) were assessed. Those who felt like they were spending more time in nature than they did pre-pandemic experienced more subjective well-being. Nature-related individuals were more likely to access nature and to appreciate it more during the pandemic than others, but all people (even those less connected) experienced well-being benefits from spending more time in nature. Going into nature appears to be an increasingly popular and effective coping strategy to boost or maintain subjective well-being during the pandemic.","Desrochers, Jessica E.; Bell, Ashleigh L.; Nisbet, Elizabeth K.; Zelenski, John M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14042401","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(4):2401, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27893,""
"Internet addiction, cognitive, and dispositional factors among US adults","While a growing body of literature has examined internet addiction in the context of psychological factors, most of this work has focused on younger populations outside of the United States. A sample of 898 US adults ranging from 18-76 years of age were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform to complete the Internet Addiction Test and key measures of affect, disposition, and cognitive function. A series of multiple regressions were conducted to examine Internet Addiction level as a predictor of outcome variables. ANCOVAs with Fisher's LSD post-hoc analyses were conducted using level of internet addiction as the grouping variable to examine differences between groups. Results found that Internet Addiction was a significant predictor of depression, impulsiveness, self-control, need for cognition, theories of cognitive abilities, creativity achievement, cognitive failures, smartphone use behaviors, mental rotation test, and cognitive reflection test. Further, even mild levels of internet addiction were associated with less optimal outcomes. Additionally, a significant relation between age and internet addiction also emerged such that older adults were less likely to have higher levels of internet addiction than younger adults. However, age did not appear to modulate the association between internet addiction status and key psychological variables. To further elucidate the mechanisms and impact of internet addiction throughout the life course, future studies should collect online and in-person data, from individuals across a variety of backgrounds, throughout the lifespan.","Devine, Diana, Ogletree, Aaron M.; Shah, Priti, Katz, Benjamin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2022.100180","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computers in Human Behavior Reports;: 100180, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27894,""
"Perceptions of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Women with Infertility: Correlations with Dispositional Optimism","People who are more optimistic may experience better psychological health during stressful times. The present study examined the perceptions and emotions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic among American women who were experiencing fertility problems. We tested if dispositional optimism in these women was associated with less negative perceptions and emotions. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients from a single private infertility and reproductive clinic in an urban area in the Midwest, United States. Women, age 18 or older, primarily White and educated, who presented for an appointment to the clinic were invited to participate in an email-based survey. Respondents (N = 304) reported their perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility treatment, emotions associated with this impact, and perceived stress and depressive symptoms. They also completed measures of dispositional optimism and expectations for a future pregnancy. Findings indicated that women perceived an overall negative impact of the pandemic on their treatment plans, which was associated with more negative emotions, lower expectations of future pregnancy, and greater stress and depressive symptoms during the pandemic. However, further correlational analyses revealed that being higher in trait optimism was associated with perceiving a less negative impact of the pandemic, experiencing fewer negative emotions, and less overall stress and depressive symptoms. Although women with fertility problems have perceived the pandemic as negative and disruptive, those who are higher in optimism may be less affected.","Dillard, Amanda J.; Weber, Ava E.; Chassee, Amanda, Thakur, Mili","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052577","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2577, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27895,""
"NeuroSask Active and Connected: A neurorehab 2-way knowledge mobilization initiative","To use a virtual program to mobilize evidence-based knowledge on physical activity, mental health, and social support. To also use this platform as an avenue to provide updates on rapidly changing COVID-19 information specific to neurological conditions, and to gain insight on the current needs and concerns of participants. Program evaluation post and follow up (1-year). 'NeuroSask Active and Connected' started as a COVID-19 virtual knowledge-mobilization program designed to share information on evidence-based health-promoting behaviours, and to support social-connectedness amongst individuals with neurological conditions. The project targeted individuals with moderate disability from a neurological condition and was inclusive of wheelchair users. The primary activity was a 10-week virtual program that ran twice weekly and included an 'Active' and a 'Connected' portion. Program evaluation involved surveying participants at the end of the 10-weeks. Based on high uptake and positive participant feedback, the program was extended, and a one-year evaluation of the program was completed. Program evaluation. 800 participants registered for the initial 10-week program;approximately 1200 participants are enrolled in the extended program. 325 participants completed the one-year evaluation. 70% of participants have multiple sclerosis, with the remaining participants affected by other neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, and spinal cerebellar ataxia. Level of enjoyment was rated at 97%, and 100% agreed it was important for the program to continue running. Only 10% reported preferring in-person programs even outside of the pandemic (74% preferred virtual and 16% no preference). Participant-reported benefits included improved: physical wellbeing (96%);mental wellbeing (87%);sense of support (80%);awareness of existing resources (73%) and symptom management (55%).

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Aspects of Health Among Community Dwelling Survivors of a Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)","To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aspects of health and lifestyle behaviors among community dwelling survivors of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cross-sectional, descriptive study. Community-based. N = 28 community dwelling survivors of moderate/severe TBI and were at least one year up to 5-years post-injury (M age = 40.59;SD=18.61) and part of an ongoing study. N/A. A checklist of comprehensive health/lifestyle areas. Participants were asked think about their experiences over the past year since the COVID-19 breakout and to indicate if the COVID-19 pandemic impacted various areas of health and lifestyle (yes/no). If they endorsed ""yes"", they were then asked to indicate if the impact was for the better or worse for each endorsed area. They were then asked to elaborate on their response (qualitative data). All health areas were impacted by the pandemic. The most frequently impacted area was social relationships (64.3%) followed by leisure (53%), physical activity (46.4%), mental health (25%), mental activity (25%), stress management (21.4%), spirituality/purpose and meaning (21.4%), alcohol use (21.4%) and to a lesser extent tobacco use (17.9%), health knowledge/information (10.7%), nutrition (7.1%), and sleep (3.6%). Of those who endorsed being impacted by the pandemic, the following frequencies indicate health areas that worsened due to the pandemic: 92.3% for physical activity, 83.3% stress management, 83.3% social relationships, 83.3% spirituality/purpose and meaning, 71.4%, mental health, 66.7 % leisure, 66.7% tobacco use, 53.6% leisure, 50% alcohol use, and 25% mental activity. Areas that were reported ""better"" were 100% for nutrition and dietary intake, 100% for health knowledge/information, and 100% sleep. The pandemic negatively impact numerous health areas among community dwelling survivors of a TBI. Addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health areas along with taking into consideration the likely disruptions in healthcare will help identify survivors who may benefit from health promotion interventions to prevent or intervene on secondary health conditions.

"Dictionary Based Global Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Effects and Response","In December 2019, a new pandemic called the coronavirus began ravaging the world. By May 2020, the pandemic had caused great loss of lives and disrupted the way of lives in more ways than one. The nature of the disease saw several strategies to curb its spread rolled out. These strategies included closing of businesses and borders, restriction of movements and working from home, mask mandate among others. With these measures and the effects, many individuals have taken to the social media to express their frustrations, opinions and how the pandemic is affecting them. This study employs dictionary based method for sentiment polarization from tweets related to coronavirus posted on Twitter. We also examine the co-occurrence of words to gain insights on the aspects affecting the masses. The results showed that mental health issues, lack of supplies were some of the direct effects of the pandemic. It was also clear that the COVID-19 prevention guidelines were well understood by those who tweeted. The results from this study may help governments combat the consequences of COVID-19 like mental health issues, lack of supplies e.g. food and also gauge the effectiveness or the reach of their guidelines.","Elphas, Okango, Mwambi, Henry","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40745-021-00358-5","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Data Science; 9(1):175-186, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27899,""
"Can Technology Abate the Experience of Social Isolation for Those Affected by Dementia?","Background. The widespread social isolation measures recently utilized to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 to older adults may have exuded unexpected consequences. Social isolation among older adults is a risk factor for poor health outcomes. Innovative solutions to balancing public safety and health maintenance for those with dementia and their caregivers are needed. Methods. A sample of N=82 dementia caregivers participated in a web-based survey to investigate their perceptions on 1) changes in personal mental health due to isolation from their loved one, and 2) the perceived need for use of smart mobile device app use in these situations. Results. The majority of our sample (87%) reported experiencing negative mental health outcomes beyond those experienced in typical situations. Furthermore, over 70% of caregivers were concerned with the care their loved on received during social isolation. Finally, 67% reported perceived need to use SMD apps in these times of social isolation. Conclusions. Our findings provide preliminary insight into troubling consequences occurring when individuals with dementia are socially isolated from their caregivers. An inverse relationship between SMD app use and poor mental health points to the potential for communication technology to lessen the negative impacts of social isolation, when it becomes necessary to public safety.","Faieta, Julie, Faieta, Lily, Leblond, Jean, Routhier, FranÃ§ois, Best, Krista","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.779031","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27900,""

The aim was to explore the potential of an online singing and mindfulness programme for people with anxiety and/or depression. Seven participants were socially prescribed to a nine-week programme of online singing and mindfulness delivered by the practitioner-researcher. Participants completed the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and WEMWBS (Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale) at baseline and after the sessions. Participants kept journals and completed a questionnaire after the programme. Field notes were kept. Data were triangulated to form themes for discussion. Participants reported positive impacts on their -wellbeing. The programme offered a safe space to connect with others;build confidence;break down barriers and to feel both relaxed and energized.

"Mental and Behavioral Health Needs of Transition Age Youth Experiencing Homelessness During the COVID-19 pandemic","For the agencies interviewed, what were the best practices utilized for the behavioral and mental health issues in TAYEH before the COVID-19 pandemic? How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected TAYEH ability to access services and supports to address their behavioral and mental health needs? What programs/processes/procedures are being utilized now to assist TAYEH in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic? Qualitative Method were utilized to conduct a content analysis of the data collected via recorded virtual Interviews. The study was conducted on a virtual platform focusing on multiple agencies across the United States. Three organizations agreed to be interviewed, with four representatives being interviewed in total. There was no intervention. This was a qualitative content analysis. Findings from the interviews indicated increased numbers of youth trying to access services during the pandemic. In addition, the agencies interviewed were seeing increased numbers of youth with mental and behavioral health issues, including substance abuse, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The increase in need from TAYEH resulted in permanent services being added to their organization to help this population. The increase in need of services during the COVID-19 pandemic from TAYEH may have been due to limitations on the number of individuals allowed to occupy a space. It was agreed through the interviews that there could be ways to improve the services and resources for the behavioral needs of youth in their agencies. Although there were challenges to accessing services like virtual meetings and staff illness, agencies developed strategies to meet the needs of the youth. These included creating virtual drop in centers and providing more telehealth services.

"Real Picture of the World During COVID-19 Pandemic: Mental Health Matters","The present study focuses on the dangerous disease 'Coronavirus', which ruined the peaceful life of the universe. It started in the period from 2020 to 2021 and forced humans to think -'where they went wrong 'and asked the question to himself/herself 'is nature taking its revenge?"". The study aim is to portray the real grief, painful and horrific picture of the Universe- Developing countries like India and South African recording each day multiple new cases of Coronavirus, including the number of deaths climbing day by day. The group of survival is also undergoing a constant mental health problem. As the constant news of Coronavirus has plunged the world and disturbed each mental health especially youth who are experiencing a 'cage world' Thus, this study's main aim is not only to focus on the solution to the invisible pain but also will reveal the dark side of the young generation's mental health which is known as depression, anxiety, suppression, and ultimately how it takes its road into a horrific result as anorexia, insomnia, bipolar disorder, dementia, and suicide. The covid-19 situation has brought more complexities into the mind of adolescence and teenhood especially when they are confronting societal, personal, and educational issues. The major concern comes when a child suffers from the loss of childhood innocence during the pandemic and finds no space of their own due to parents' stressful relationship or having a terrible experience of losing both of their parents or close family member due to Covid disease. Moreover, asking for financial and emotional help in times of need became tough, and last but not least issue is a sharp rise in poverty when the covid-19 pandemic led to a strict nationwide lockdown and most of the youth are suffering from the loss of hope for any work opportunity.","Gupta, R.","https://doi.org/10.21786/bbrc/14.9.48","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications; 14(9):259-261, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27904,""
"Classroom discussion practices in online remote secondary school settings during COVID-19","Academically productive talk (APT) in classrooms has long been associated with significant gains in student learning and development. Yet, due to COVID-19 related restrictions, teachers around the world were forced to adapt their teaching to online, remote settings during the pandemic. In this investigation, we studied APT in junior high school during extended online, remote teaching spells. Specifically, we focused on the extent APT was a part of online teaching practices, what characterized teachers who tended to promote APT more in online, remote teaching, and associations between APT and teacher well-being, as well as student motivation and engagement. Findings from two survey studies (Study 1: 99 teachers, and 83 students;Study 2: 399 teachers) revealed the following patterns: Students and teachers agreed that APT was used to a lesser extent in remote, online classes, and associated with more interactive instructional formats (whole classroom discussion, peer group work, and questioning), but not with frontal teaching and individual task completion. Teachers with a higher sense of teaching self-efficacy, autonomous orientations, and higher empathy tended to promote APT in online, remote teaching more. More APT was associated with greater teachersâ€™ work-related (i.e., lower burnout, more commitment to teaching, and lower turnover intentions) and psychological well-being (i.e., less depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher subjective well-being). Finally, student experiences with APT in online, remote learning was positively associated with learning motivation and engagement. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Gutentag, Tony, Orner, Aviv, Asterhan, Christa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107250","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computers in Human Behavior;: 107250, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27905,""
"Environment and COVID-19 incidence: A critical review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented worldwide health crisis. Many previous research studies have found and investigated its links with one or some natural or human environmental factors. However, a review on the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and both the natural and human environment is still lacking. This review summarizes the inter-correlation between COVID-19 incidence and environmental factors. Based on keyword searching, we reviewed 99 relevant peer-reviewed articles and other research literature published since January 2020. This review is focused on three main findings. One, we found that individual environmental factors have impacts on COVID-19 incidence, but with spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty. Two, environmental factors exert interactive effects on COVID-19 incidence. In particular, the interactions of natural factors can affect COVID-19 transmission in micro- and macro- ways by impacting SARS-CoV-2 survival, as well as human mobility and behaviors. Three, the impact of COVID-19 incidence on the environment lies in the fact that COVID-19-induced lockdowns caused air quality improvement, wildlife shifts and socio-economic depression. The additional value of this review is that we recommend future research perspectives and adaptation strategies regarding the interactions of the environment and COVID-19. Future research should be extended to cover both the effects of the environment on the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19-induced impacts on the environment. Future adaptation strategies should focus on sustainable environmental and public policy responses.","Han, Jiatong, Yin, Jie, Wu, Xiaoxu, Wang, Danyang, Li, Chenlu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2022.02.016","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Environmental Sciences;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27906,""
"Pilot study of a â€˜Dance Fitness Groupâ€™ for children referred to physiotherapy","Keywords: Dance;Compliance;Group Purpose: Deconditioned, hypermobile, and symptomatic musculoskeletal pain in children can cause a reduced level of physical activity leading to weakened muscles and poor tolerance to exercise. Dance and music have been shown to positively affect mood and mental health in individuals, helping to increase compliance of physical activity. Group settings provide evidence for increasing compliance through improving patient's sense of belonging, self-confidence and social engagement. This pilot looks at combining the enjoyment of dance to music in a group setting with physiotherapy strengthening and core exercises to increase engagement, We aim to evaluate the outcome measures to direct the formation of a larger scale study. Methods: The pilot study included children aged 8â€“16 years old referred by Southampton Paediatric Physiotherapy team with a diagnosis of hypermobility, poor postural fitness and deconditioning with an interest in dance. Children were excluded if they were 7 years old or younger and if they would be unable to follow a group session. The group comprised of a four week (once weekly) group for 45 min consisting of group exercise with warm up, 15 min dance cardio fitness including balance, strengthening, core stability, and cool down sections. A questionnaire assessing patients perceived fitness, pain and overall enjoyment was the outcome measure completed at the beginning and end of the group. Results: Two patients attended the group between November 2020 and December 2020. The post group questionnaire showed both patients found the group very useful or extremely useful. The questionnaire also showed an improvement in sporting activity post group. Both patients also stated an interest in repeating the group and found that it was a positive experience for young people of their age to do fitness in a safe environment. The Coronavirus Pandemic impacted on the sample size of this pilot. Conclusion(s): The results of this small sample pilot have shown very positive outcomes. The pilot highlights the success of using dance as a positive motivator to increase physical activity in those deconditioned and hypermobile patients. The use of music and dance movements helped to engage patients to strengthen weakened muscles and improve compliance to exercise. Future Dance fitness groups could include patients with back pain with the outcome measure Rowland Morris to be used. Limitations of COVID-19 restrictions meant a small sample, however future groups should be repeated on a large scale with up to 6 children in a group. Impact: This was a small scale pilot study which has shown positive evaluation to transform the way we run our groups. With future larger scale quantitative and qualitative results we will further evaluate the impact on our physiotherapy practice. We aim to reduce 1:1 out-patient appointments due to positive outcomes of group treatment using a holistic and innovative approach to improve engagement and compliance to physical activity.

"Morningness-eveningness preference and shift in chronotype during COVID-19 as predictors of mood and well-being in university students","It is suggested that social obligations, such as early work/school starts, have a disadvantageous impact on sleep behavior that can further transfer to mental health problems. Lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic created a unique opportunity to research human sleep-wake behavior in naturalistic conditions of decreased social obligations. This study aimed to test whether a change in habitual sleep-wake timing (shift in chronotype) during the COVID-19 lockdown impacted mood and well-being, and whether the impact differs according to morningness-eveningness preference. University students (NÂ =Â 1011;MeanageÂ =Â 21.95Â Â±Â 1.95Â years) filled out self-report questionnaires containing measures of chronotype (midpoint of sleep) before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, morningness-eveningness preference, mood, and well-being. The impact of morningness-eveningness preference and shift in chronotype was tested via multiple regression analyses. Results showed that participants shifted their chronotype in line with their morningness-eveningness preference, and that shift toward earlier sleep-wake timing was related to better moods and well-being. Moreover, higher levels of positive mood (vigor) and well-being were found in individuals who shifted their sleep-wake timing earlier and were higher on morningness.","Hasan, M.

"Access courses and their contribution to the widening participation agenda in the UK","Reasons for mental health nursing shortages in the UK are many and complex. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to fill vacant posts, while at the same time negatively impacting on the UK's international recruitment strategy. Whereas international recruitment is essential to reduce workforce shortages, it offers only a short-term solution and potentially leaves lower-income countries with increased nursing shortages themselves. This article considers that a long-term domestic approach to recruitment is needed to reduce future workforce deficits. It is argued that benefits of access courses are increased if delivered by the university directly, as a familiarity with systems, the campus and supportive networks are promoted, and the potential for targeted support is increased. Further research is needed to establish the benefits, but access courses delivered this way may provide a more sustainable solution to nursing workforce shortages in the UK and beyond.","Haslam, Michael B.; Flynn, Anita, Connor, Karen","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjmh.2021.0030","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Mental Health Nursing; 11(1):1-5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27910,""
"Mobile phones for homeless patients in the emergency department, a lifeline to connect with vital support services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims/Objectives/BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic most of Londonâ€™s homeless day centres and hostels had to close, essential support services and GP practices were only contactable by phone or online. This created a precarious situation for vulnerable street homeless, leaving them with limited access to food, safe places or health care. Homeless patients attending our ED within hours could access homeless team support. However, an audit in our ED in May 2020 revealed that 70â€“80% of our homeless patients attended out of hours. We identified this shortfall in care, so conducted a pilot project to supply mobile phones to 30 homeless patients to facilitate a follow-up with our homeless team. This is the first study of this kind in an emergency department in the UK.Methods/DesignTwo grants from the GSTT charity and the Society of Catholic Medical Missionaries charity covered the purchase of 30 mobile phones. The phones were given together with contact numbers to 30 rough sleepers attending our department out of hours, who did not have access to a phone or an allocated support worker. In addition, we forwarded the patientâ€˜s details and mobile number to our homeless team who contacted the patient the next working day after discharge.Results/ConclusionsAll 30 phones were given out during a 3 month period. ED staff referred 21 of the 30 patients to the homeless team. The homeless team was able to contact 17 patients. 4 patients were eligible for council housing and 3 patients received alternative accommodation with charities. 6 patients were referred to other services including the first fit clinic, domestic violence service, the HIV clinic and the community mental health team. These outcomes are significant and life changing for these individuals and, considering the low cost of one phone (Â£26 per phone including top-up), application for further funding has been submitted.","Herrmann, Simone, Hooi-Ling, Harrison, Parkinson, Sophie, Russell, Hannah","https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2022-RCEM.13","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ; 39(3):249, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27911,""
"Evading the Lockdown: Animal Metaphors and Dehumanization in Virtual Space","COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to more than 200 countries, causing over one million deaths worldwide (as of December 2020) and leading to lockdowns that are unprecedented in modern times. Given the physical restrictions, social media platforms have become crucial for people to maintain contact and share ideas during the pandemic. In this paper, I examine the discursive representations of evaders of the Wuhan lockdown. Specifically, I investigate how social media users employed animal metaphors to portray the identities of people who fled Wuhan during this time. More than 250 posts with over 15,000 comments were collected from the Chinese microblogging site Weibo;data were thematically analyzed, and metaphors were identified. The results demonstrated that various kinds of animal metaphors were used to discredit the evaders and to highlight their objectionable behavior and moral standards. The use of violent expressions associated with animal metaphors also revealed the issue of dehumanization vis-Ã -vis all the residents in Wuhan, which has various theoretical and ideological implications.

"Neuropathic pain in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A prospective case-series","OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to report the demographic and clinical characteristics of eight hospitalized cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting with neuropathic pain (NeuP). DESIGN A prospective case series with one month follow-up SETTINGS COVID-19 dedicated wards of a tertiary care center PARTICIPANTS We included eight consecutive cases of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 (by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) who presented with NeuP during the course of their acute hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) was used to assess NeuP severity at presentation and at one month follow-up. Douleur Neuropathique (DN4) questionnaire was used to diagnose NeuP at presentation. RESULTS Most patients were diagnosed as moderate to severe COVID-19 (6/8) and presented with mild to moderate NeuP (6/8). A substantial proportion of the patients (4/8) displayed persistence of mild pain symptoms at one month follow-up. Furthermore, participants displayed a favourable response to gabapentinoids with or without antidepressants. CONCLUSION NeuP is a less commonly encountered symptom of COVID-19 but its early diagnosis and prompt management is of utmost importance. More studies including a larger cohort and longer follow-up are recommended for better understanding of COVID-19 associated NeuP.","Jena, Debasish, Sahoo, Jagannatha, Barman, Apurba, Dalai, Anchal, Patel, Suman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arrct.2022.100188","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Rehabilitation Research and Clinical Translation;: 100188, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27915,""
"POS-738 ASSESSMENT OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, SUICIDALITY AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN LEBANESE PATIENTS ON HEMODIALYSIS FOLLOWING THE BEIRUT EXPLOSION","Introduction: On the 4thof August 2020, Beirut witnessed a major blast in its port that led to 214 dead and more than 6500 injured. Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC) facing the port was subject to severe damage and was non-functional for around a month after the explosion. A considerable number of patients, and staff members present in the hospital at the time of the explosion were injured and subject to physical and psychological trauma, including patients who were undergoing their hemodialysis shift at the time of the blast. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidality, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this vulnerable population of end-stage renal disease patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in March and April 2021 among patients aged 18 years and older, undergoing hemodialysis on a chronic basis at the outpatient unit of SGHUMC. The Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders, while the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to screen for PTSD. Suicidality was assessed by direct questions about passive death wishes, suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts. Other measures included age, sex, marital status, education, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol and substance use, malnutrition risk assessment, comorbid medical diseases, past psychiatric history, history of severe COVID-19 infection and assessment of the exposure to the Beirut blast. Results: 42 patients (mean age 66.1;SD: 11.2 years) were included in the assessment of whom 45.2% were female. 69% were married, 31% had a high school level of education or above while 16.6% had earned a university degree. 59.5% were smokers and 40.5% were alcohol users while 2.4% reported alcohol misuse. In addition, 2.4% reported active drug use. 66.7% belonged to a middle socioeconomic status (SES) and 9.5% to a high SES. Around 7% were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Two thirds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition according to the GLIM criteria. Around 40% had cardiovascular disease and one fourth had thyroid problems. Only 12% had previously consulted a mental health professional. Anxiety and depression screening rates were found to be significantly high, reaching 54.8% and 57.1% using cut-offs of 6 and 7 respectively on the HADS. 9.5% of the patients reported being in the hospital at the time of the blast and 7.1% reported being injured. In addition, 23.8% had a close family member either injured or deceased because of the blast. 33.3% of our population screened positively for PTSD using a cut-off of 23 on the PCL-5. 26.2% had passive death wishes and 7.1% had suicide plans, however no one had attempted it. Conclusions: In an urban dialysis unit, affected by a major blast and the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, anxiety, and PTSD were found to be highly prevalent (figure 1), urging the need for a prompt psychiatric evaluation in similar settings and early intervention strategies aiming at improving the physical and mental well-being in this vulnerable population.

"Occupational Health and Safety Scope Significance in Achieving Sustainability","A safe and healthy working environment is vital for overall sustainability, due to the fact that it affects opportunities of economic and social development. However, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), despite the international commitment to Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) via the 2030&rsquo;s Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), work-related accidents are still far too common. Work-related mortality accounts for 5% of all deaths worldwide;a toll which has increased dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, in the context of COVID-19, new demands on the labour market, such as teleworking, adequate protective measures, and proper use of personal protective equipment when physical presence cannot be avoided, are necessitating new approaches to ensure health and safety. Arguably, education can be viewed as a cross-cutting strategy in advance of a culture of safety for future generations, through strengthening skills and broadening knowledge. Indeed, even though education cannot be considered a panacea, related to SDG 4, which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, it can be considered a critical component to deal with OSH issues using a preventive, rather than a reactive, approach. Given this fact, European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) has stressed the prevention approach through mainstreaming OSH in education at all levels, and in all fields of vocational and academic training. Aware of the potential of universities to provide graduates the broad-based knowledge to produce labour-market skills including OSH, the aim of this study is to contribute to the discussion on mainstreaming OSH into Greek university education, using Harokopio University (HUA) as a case study. For this purpose, a web-based survey was conducted to address HUA&rsquo;s students, faculty members, and staff OSH knowledge, risks awareness, and attitudes, as well as their perceptions, opinions, and beliefs about the role of OSH for academia. A statistical analysis depicted respondents&rsquo;high level of willingness to contribute to the promotion of OSH, while additional evidence suggests a considerable commitment of the respondents to participate in HUA&rsquo;s OSH-related training and education.","Kavouras, Sotirios, Vardopoulos, Ioannis, Mitoula, Roido, Zorpas, Antonis A.; Kaldis, Panagiotis","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14042424","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(4):2424, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27917,""
"Appraisal of Long COVID: Lessons to be Learned from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)","Little is known regarding after-effects of Long-COVID-19 (LC), while ME/CFS has been extensively researched. We performed a rigorous scoping review to inform a better definition of symptomatology of LC and cross-cutting similarities with ME/CFS. Our objective was to review the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ME/CFS Common Data Elements (CDEs), identify Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and link items to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) codes to inform efforts to define LC. NIH ME/CFS CDEs (Jan. 2020), Google Scholar, PubMed - search terms: Long COVID and ME/CFS. A review of 119 NIH ME/CFS CDEs applied the following inclusion criteria: 1) PROM based;2) assess symptomatology;3) specific to adults 18 years and over;4) no visual or pictographic scales. Of the 119 NIH ME/CFS CDEs, 38 met review criteria;items were entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Five researchers independently coded items using ICF linking rules and resolved discrepancies using a consensus-based process. Six articles specifically compared LC and ME/CFS for symptom overlap. Similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID symptoms include: fatigue, post exertional malaise (PEM), cognitive symptoms, sleep dysfunction, pain, noise and light hypersensitivity, orthostatic intolerance, cardiac, gastrointestinal and immune pathologies. The 944 items from 38 PROM CDEs were coded based on common ME/CFS and LC symptoms. The percent of items linked to one or more ICF categories (1288 codes) was as follows: Body Function (b codes) 73%: Fatigability, N=252 (20%);Cognitive functions, N=234 (18%);Sleep functions, N=139, 11%;and Pain, N=119, (9%). Activity and Participation (d codes), N=332, (26%). Environment (e codes), N=11, 0.9%. The ICF provides a common language to assess ME/CFS and LC cross-cutting symptoms and their impact on body function, activity and participation. This review of ME/CFS CDE's can help identify common symptoms, such as PEM, and encourage appropriate symptom management to prevent cycles of overexertion and relapse for those with LC.

"Assessment of Mental Health among Dental Professionals in North India during COVID-19 Global Pandemic: A Web-based Survey","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on mental health status of all health-care workers. Among them, dentists are at high risk due to being in close contact, facing moral responsibilities to reduce routine work, and financial implications which follow. We performed a study to assess the mental health status of dental professionals all over North India in present times. Materials and Methods: A structured 27-item questionnaire developed on Google forms was circulated to dentists across North India. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale was used to assess/grade depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 was used to screen/grade anxiety and worry/fear regarding other related aspects was studied. Results: One hundred and fifty-five responses were obtained, and data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 25.0. All participants belonged to the age range of 23-65 years with 78 males, 76 females, and 1 other. A majority of dentists (59.4%) were experiencing depression and considerable proportions (46.5%) were experiencing anxiety. Nearly all dentists (98.1%) were worried about changing dental practices and majority (72.9%) were fearful of doing aerosol procedure despite using protective equipment. The data were further analyzed for variation based on gender, qualification, years of experience, and job. Conclusion: In a pandemic, amidst burden of physical/financial needs, psychological needs are often overlooked. Currently, a considerable portion of dentists across North India are already experiencing mental health issues, there is a need to implement strategies to tackle the same.","Khatri, A.; Sabherwal, P.; Oberoi, S.

"Features of the integral (somatic, mental, spiritual) health of students (a case based on students from Kyiv universities)","At the present stage of social development, leading scientists in the field of information technologies have proposed a method of quantifying individual health as the trinity of its physical (somatic), mental and social (spiritual) statuses. Individual health testing should be performed out online on a personal computer using a single software package. Undoubtedly, this cybernetic method in the assessment of the health status will be used widely in the nearest future. However, in our opinion, we should not neglect the simple, affordable, not requiring computer technology, material costs and proven methods. On the basis of many years of researches done by the authors, substantiated methodology and methods for quantifying the level of integral (somatic, mental, spiritual) health of the person as the person are proved. It is advisable to use the express-method developed by us in the pedagogical practice when conducting health-improving trainings in order to self-control the effectiveness of physical loads and can be used in the preventive medicine as a screening test to assess the main components of the human health. The study involved students (boys and girls) 17-21 years of Kyiv Universities, who did not go in for sports (experimental group, n = 626), among them: students of the Faculty of Social Technologies of the Open International University of Human Development ""Ukraine"" (further University ""Ukraine"") (n = 163), Faculty of Physical Education and Sports of the National Pedagogical Dragomanov University (n = 235) and the Faculty of Health, Physical Education and Sports of Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University (n = 228). The control group consisted of their peers - student athletes (boxers, wrestlers, cyclists, skiers) of the Brovary Higher School of Physical Education (Kyiv region) (N = 75). The analysis of the results of the study showed that the integral health of non-athletes students is assessed as ""satisfactory"". The athletes-students have the highest level of absolute health. However, if the athletes-students have a high level of integral health indicators, mainly due to an increase in the average values of somatic health indicators and the lower level of spiritual health, then among the non-athletes students, a satisfactory level of health, on the contrary, is mainly achieved due to the higher values of spiritual and mental health indicators and, accordingly, to the lower somatic health indicators. The male and female students of the University ""Ukraine"" and female students of Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University have the highest level of spiritual health indicators.","Khoroshukha, Mykhailo, Ivashchenko, Sergii, Prysiazhniuk, Stanislav, Oleniev, Dmytro, Biletska, Victoriia, Tymchyk, Olesia, Harashchenko, Larysa","https://doi.org/10.7752/jpes.2021.s5398","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Physical Education and Sport; 21:2993-3000, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27920,""
"Follow-up characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A single-center retrospective chart review","Purpose of Study As of October of 2021, there have been over 43 million cases of COVID-19 and nearly 700,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. Many of those who have survived COVID-19 have been left with long-lasting symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, loss of smell or taste, and depression or anxiety. Mechanisms for these lasting symptoms are not fully known, so monitoring of patients after their infection has been cleared is important to determine both the rates and the mechanisms of the aptly named 'Long COVID.' The purpose of our study was to monitor the status of COVID-19 patients that were previously hospitalized at the UMC Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas after discharge. Methods Used We conducted a comprehensive chart review of 128 patients that were hospitalized for COVID-19 at any time between April 1, 2020 and April 1, 2021, and reviewed follow- up data for these patients after discharge. Summary of Results In our cohort of patients, 46% (n = 59) were men and 54% were women (n = 69) with an average age of 59.7 Â± 14.8 years old. 60.9% of patients identified their race as Hispanic or of Latino origin (n = 78), with the next largest group being Caucasian at 22.65% (n = 29). The average number of days until post-hospitalization follow-up was 36 Â± 38 days. Notable findings included a 50% rate of telehealth follow-up (n = 64), a 65.6% (n = 84) rate of diabetes, and a 73.4% (n = 94) rate of hypertension. 26.56% (n = 34) of patients reported respiratory symptoms at their follow- up appointments, 18.75% (n = 24) of patients reported constitutional symptoms, 9.37% (n = 12) of patients reported GI symptoms, and 19.5% (n = 25) of patients reported other symptoms such as paresthesia, lower extremity edema, or psychological symptoms. After discharge, 54 patients received follow- up X-rays. 75.9% (41/54) were found to still have abnormal findings consistent with COVID-19 imaging characteristics. During their follow-up appointment, 57 patients had a D-dimer lab value, 56 patients had a Ferretin value, and 59 patients had a Troponin T HS value. Of the follow-up patients with labs, 77.2% (44/57) had an elevated D-Dimer value, 78.6% (44/56) had an elevated Ferretin value, and 35.6% (21/59) had an elevated Troponin T HS value. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with pre-existing literature concerning higher rates of diabetes and hypertension in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as well as reports of lasting symptoms after viral clearance. The CXR findings indicating lasting lung damage have some explanatory power in regard to respiratory symptoms at follow-up. Furthermore, our findings of elevated lab values in patients who received lab testing after discharge align with the emerging literature on D-dimer and Long COVID. Our lab findings should be considered limited due to pre-existing conditions or unrelated hospital visits that would predispose some these lab findings to be elevated. More research should be conducted to further elucidate mechanisms and treatment options for patients with Long COVID.","Landis, D.; Le, D.; DeWare, C.; Conde, C.; Payne, D.","https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2022-SRMC.76","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Investigative Medicine; 70(2):492-493, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27921,""
"Injury-Related Emergency Department Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction On March 13, 2020, the U.S. declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be a national emergency. As communities adopted mitigation strategies, there were potentially changes in the trends of injuries treated in emergency department (EDs). This study provides national estimates of injury-related ED visits in the U.S. before and during the pandemic. Methods A secondary retrospective cohort study was conducted using trained, on-site hospital coders collecting data for injury-related ED cases from medical records from a nationally representative sample of 66 U.S. hospital EDs. Injury ED visit estimates the year before the pandemic (January 1, 2019â€“December 31, 2019) were compared to estimates the year of pandemic declaration (January 1, 2020â€“December 31, 2020) for overall nonfatal injury-related ED visits, motor vehicle, falls-related, self-harm-, assault-related, and poisoning-related ED visits. Results There was an estimated 1.7 million (25%) decrease in nonfatal injury-related ED visits during April through June 2020 compared with the same timeframe in 2019. Similar decreases were observed for ED visits due to motor vehicle-related injuries (199,329;23.3%) and falls-related injuries (497,971;25.1%). Monthly 2020 estimates remained relatively in line with 2019 estimates for self-harm-, assault-, and poisoning-related ED visits. Conclusions These findings provide updates for clinical and public health practitioners on the changing profile of injury-related ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the short- and long-term impacts of the pandemic is important to prevent future injuries.","Law, Royal K.; Wolkin, Amy, Patel, Nimesh, Alic, Alen, Yuan, Keming, Ahmed, Kamran, Idaikkadar, Nimi, Haileyesus, Tadesse","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2022.01.018","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Preventive Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27922,""
"Barriers to School and Work Transitions for Youth With and Without a Disability During The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Comparison","To explore barriers to school and work transitions for youth with and without a disability during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Perceived accessibility and mental health consequences of COVID-19 containment policies","Background Individuals have experienced various degrees of accessibility loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may consequently have influenced their mental health. Although efforts have been made to understand the mental health consequences of the pandemic and corresponding containment measures, the impacts of accessibility loss remain underexplored. Methods Based on 186 family interviews, a 569-respondent panel survey was designed and distributed monthly from February to October 2020 in Kunming, China. A 3-wave cross-lagged panel model was developed to understand the causal relationship between mental health and perceived accessibility of daily necessities, key services, and social activities. Results Goodness-of-fit indicators imply that the hypothesised model fits the observed data well: <U+03C7>2/dfÂ =Â 2.221, AGFIÂ =Â 0.910, NFIÂ =Â 0.907, CFIÂ =Â 0.933, RMSEAÂ =Â 0.052. The results indicate that perceived accessibility of daily necessities and social activities had lagged effects on mental health status. The within-wave effects show that perceived accessibility of daily necessities (0.619, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) and social activities (0.545, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) significantly influenced respondents' mental health during the peak of the pandemic whilst perceived accessibility of social activities dominantly influenced their mental health after restrictions were lifted (0.779, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). Perceived accessibility of public services such as healthcare did not significantly influence respondentsâ€™ mental health in any wave. COVID-19 containment policies had different mental outcomes across population groups. Disadvantaged people experienced mental health issues due to accessibility loss for daily necessities and social activities until the lifting of compulsory QR-code-for-buses, whilst better-off populations had better mental health during the early phase of the outbreak and rapidly recovered their mental health after mobility restrictions eased. Conclusion Reduced perceived accessibility of daily necessities and social activities may be an underlying cause of mental health problems. Relative accessibility deprivation exacerbated mental health inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Qiyang, Liu, Zhengying, Lin, Siyi, Zhao, Pengjun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2022.101354","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Transport & Health;: 101354, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27924,""
"Social presence in an Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in English during Covid-19","Many educational institutions had to move their face-to-face modality to online modality in a sudden way due to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Following the principles of qualitative research, on this reflection a foreign language teacher describes his social experience in an Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) when he moved his face-to-face classes to online ones. Based on Rourke et al.'s (2001) and Swan's (2019) social presence, three elements were found on his online experience: cohesive teaching strategies, affective teaching strategies, and interactive teaching experiences. Asking about students' mental health, giving advice, and keeping the video on were some of the strategies used. Conclusions suggest that it is vital to present people as human beings and touch their own realities during pandemic times.

"High-Precise Bipolar Disorder Detection by Using Radial Basis Functions Based Neural Network","Presently, several million people suffer from major depressive and bipolar disorders. Thus, the modelling, characterization, classification, diagnosis, and analysis of such mental disorders bears great significance in medical research. Electroencephalogram records provide important information to improve clinical diagnosis and are very useful in the scientific community. In this work, electroencephalogram records and patient data from the Hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain) were processed for a correct classification of bipolar disorders. This work implemented an innovative radial basis function-based neural network employing a fuzzy means algorithm. The results show that the proposed method is an effective approach for discrimination of two kinds of classes, i.e., bipolar disorder patients and healthy persons. The proposed algorithm achieved the best performance compared with other machine learning techniques such as Bayesian linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, or support vector machine, showing a very high accuracy close to 97%. Therefore, the neural network technique presented could be used as a new tool for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, considering the possibility of integrating this method into medical software.","Lujan, M.

"The evolution of community peer support values: reflections from three UK mental health project teams The McPin peer support evaluation writing collaborative","Objective: To explore emergent values for community-based peer support in three projects and use of peer research methodology. Background: Peer support refers to the support people with shared lived experiences provide to each other. Its roots are in the civil rights movement, providing alternatives to clinical treatments. This method of support is delivered in different settings, with varying degrees of structure. In this paper, it includes shared experience of mental health issues. Methods: We reviewed interview data from two evaluations and one development project - mental health (n = 69), women-only (n = 40), and maternal mental health (n = 24), respectively. Each project used peer research methods. Peer support values from each project were compared, along with reflections from mostly peer researchers who worked on them (n = 11). Results: Six peer support values emerged and were found to be identifiable and applicable in different contexts. Decisions on facilitation and leadership varied across projects and generated some concerns over professionalisation, including non-peer leadership. Frameworks were viewed as broadly useful, but peer support is heterogenous, and peer researchers were concerned about over-rigid application of guidance. Discussion: We propose caution applying frameworks for peer support. Values must remain flexible and peer-led, evolving in new contexts such as COVID-19. Evaluators have a responsibility to consider any potentially negative consequences of their work and mitigate them. This means ensuring research outputs are useful to the peer support community, and knowledge production is based upon methodologies, such as peer research, that complement and are consistent with the values of peer support itself.","Mackay, T.; Ahmed, N.; Andleeb, H.; Billsborough, J.; Currie, R.; Hazzard, R.; Haider, F.; Iqbal, N.; Matthews, F.; Mesaric, A.; Parker, J.; Pinfold, V.; Richmond, L.; Robotham, D.; Thompson, R.","https://doi.org/10.1080/18387357.2022.2033128","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Advances in Mental Health;: 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27927,""
"Psychological Interventions for Children with Autism during the COVID-19 Pandemic through a Remote Behavioral Skills Training Program","COVID-19 has impacted negatively on the mental health of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as on their parents. Remote health services are a sustainable approach to behavior management interventions and to giving caregivers emotional support in several clinical domains. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated the feasibility of a web-based behavioral skills training (BST) program for 16 parents and their children with ASD at home. The BST parent training package was tailored to each different specific behavioral disorder that characterizes children with ASD. After training, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of all the targeted behavioral disorders, as well as an improvement in psychological distress and the perception of the severity of ASD-related symptoms in parents. Our data confirm the efficacy of remote health care systems in the management of behavioral disorders of children with ASD, as well as of their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marino, Flavia, ChilÃ , Paola, Failla, Chiara, Minutoli, Roberta, Vetrano, Noemi, Luraschi, Claudia, Carrozza, Cristina, Leonardi, Elisa, BusÃ , Mario, Genovese, Sara, Musotto, Rosa, Puglisi, Alfio, Arnao, Antonino Andrea, Cardella, Giuliana, FamÃ , Francesca Isabella, Cusimano, Gaspare, Vagni, David, Martines, Pio, Mendolia, Giovanna, Tartarisco, Gennaro, Cerasa, Antonio, Ruta, Liliana, Pioggia, Giovanni","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11051194","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(5):1194, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27928,""
"Community-Engaged Use of Low-Cost Sensors to Assess the Spatial Distribution of PM25 Concentrations across Disadvantaged Communities: Results from a Pilot Study in Santa Ana, CA","PM2.5 is an air pollutant that is widely associated with adverse health effects, and which tends to be disproportionately located near low-income communities and communities of color. We applied a community-engaged research approach to assess the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in the context of community concerns and urban features within and around the city of Santa Ana, CA. Approximately 183 h of one-minute average PM2.5 measurements, along with high-resolution geographic coordinate measurements, were collected by volunteer community participants using roughly two dozen low-cost AtmoTube Pro air pollution sensors paired with real-time GPS tracking devices. PM2.5 varied by region, time of day, and month. In general, concentrations were higher near the cityâ€™s industrial corridor, which is an area of concern to local community members. While the freeway systems were shown to correlate with some degree of elevated air pollution, two of four sampling days demonstrated little to no visible association with freeway traffic. Concentrations tended to be higher within socioeconomically disadvantaged communities compared to other areas. This pilot study demonstrates the utility of using low-cost air pollution sensors for the application of community-engaged study designs that leverage community knowledge, enable high-density air monitoring, and facilitate greater health-related awareness, education, and empowerment among communities. The mobile air-monitoring approach used in this study, and its application to characterize the ambient air quality within a defined geographic region, is in contrast to other community-engaged studies, which employ fixed-site monitoring and/or focus on personal exposure. The findings from this study underscore the existence of environmental health inequities that persist in urban areas today, which can help to inform policy decisions related to health equity, future urban planning, and community access to resources.","Masri, Shahir, Cox, Kathryn, Flores, Leonel, Rea, Jose, Wu, Jun","https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020304","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Atmosphere; 13(2):304, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27929,""
"Establishing a novel digital platform supporting physical and emotional wellbeing for people living with kidney diseaseâ€“ The Kidney Beam pilot","Keywords: Chronic Kidney Disease;Wellbeing;Telerehabilitation Purpose: To establish and evaluate a novel digital intervention to provide people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) across the UK a means to manage their physical health and emotional wellbeing through the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and beyond. There is a significant association between CKD and more severe COVID-19 infection and a greater mortality rate than the general population. People living with end-stage CKD were classified as â€˜extremely clinically vulnerableâ€™ and asked to shield at home. Since people living with CKD do not receive routine physical and emotional wellbeing support as part of routine NHS care, a home-based solution was developed to fill this urgent need. Methods: We partnered with online exercise platform Beam to co-design Kidney Beam (https://beamfeelgood.com/home), a kidney-specific digital health platform, which aimed to offer people living with CKD a way to improve physical and mental health through live and on demand movement classes and educational videos from multidisciplinary experts, all from their own home. The platform was free at point of access for all adults with CKD. A voluntary survey collecting demographic data was completed by participants on sign-up and upon completion of the 6-month pilot to establish whether participants were meeting current physical activity guidelines, to investigate perceptions of health, and collect usability feedback about the platform. Results: A total of 959 participants aged &gt; 18 years from across the UK signed up to the platform within the 6-month time period. Of these, 71% were female, 50% were pre-dialysis and 32% had received a kidney transplant. A total of 1,105 on-demand classes and 829 live classes were completed. The pre-pilot survey was completed by 276 participants (29%), with 76 completing the post-pilot survey. The sample was representative of the baseline sign-ups. Responders to the survey had an 8% improvement in general health (change from perception of poor or fair health to good or very good health) by the end of the pilot. Additionally, 6% of responders reported an improvement in the perception of their emotional health. The pre-pilot survey revealed that only 31% of responders were achieving the recommended physical activity levels of &gt; 150 minutes weekly moderate intensity activity, which had increased to 50% of post-pilot responders. Strength training on 2 days of the week was reported by 31% of responders pre-pilot, compared with 42% post-pilot. 96% of participants would recommend Kidney Beam to a friend, with the biggest reported benefits being that it was kidney-specific and delivered by specialist kidney healthcare professionals. Conclusion(s): The Kidney Beam pilot was a pragmatic programme of care, rapidly evolved to deliver vital physical activity and emotional wellbeing support to people living with CKD at a time of crisis. This platform has been funded for a further 12 months, whilst a randomised controlled trial to evaluate clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness is undertaken to help inform NHS commissioning of the programme. Impact: This has been granted funding for an RCT to evaluate clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. If successful this will lead to the potential for NHS commissioning, as part of routine care. Funding acknowledgements: The pilot study was a collaboration between King's College Hospital, Kidney Research UK (KRUK) and Beam, a health-technology platform supporting people with health conditions to stay physically active.

"Suicide prevention for international students: a scoping review protocol","IntroductionThe existing literature demonstrates that international students face a variety of stressors and barriers that can heighten the risk of suicide. However, up to now, no research has sought to summarise the available literature on the prevention strategies for suicide for international students in tertiary education. This document provides a scoping review protocol that aims to systematically chart and synthesise the published, unpublished and grey literature on the prevention strategies for suicide in the international student community.Methods and analysisThe enhanced six-stage methodological framework for scoping reviews of Arksey and Oâ€™Malley will be used. Two main research questions guide the review: (1) What is the extent, range and nature of the evidence regarding suicide prevention for international students? and (2) What suicide prevention strategies are promising for targeting international students? Peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles, reports and policy documents will be eligible to be included in the review with no limits on publication date. Electronic searches of the CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, PsycInfo and ProQuest will be conducted to identify relevant academic publications. Grey literature searches will be undertaken on relevant databases as well as government and organisational websites. The reporting of the review will follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. Criteria for evidence inclusion and exclusion will be used during literature screening and mapping. Screening and data charting of the published and grey literature will be conducted by three reviewers. Relevant stakeholders and experts will be consulted regarding the findings and their input will be integrated into the final report.Ethics and disseminationThe study will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentations and consultations with relevant stakeholders in policy and professional settings. Ethical approval is not required for this review.","McKay, Sam, Li, Angela Yuen Chun, Bailey, Eleanor, Lamblin, Michelle, Robinson, Jo","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060266","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27931,""
"Negative Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Home Integration, Community Integration, and Productive Activities","Objective Social participation in daily living the activities requires the maintenance of a variety of social relationships with others and engagement in various social activities. Proper social participation increases the feeling of attachment, provides a stable sense of identity, and increases one's sense of worth, belonging, and dependence on society. Lack of social participation leads to anxiety, loneliness, depression, panic, mental disorders and many other mental problems and affects society in general. A new coronavirus, called COVID-19, was identified in late December 2019 in China. After just one year, it has been reportedly infected more than 85 million people (up to January 1, 2021) worldwide, and more than 1.8 million have died. Two public health measures to break the transmission chain include quarantine and social distancing. These measures restrict gatherings or separate individuals. Due to these measures in many countries, people's participation in many social activities has been disrupted. The purpose of this study is to survey the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on home integration, community integration and productive activities. Materials & Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 by using the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) which measures home integration, community integration, and productive activities, along with a demographic form which were sent to 461 participants in Iran (Mean +/- SD age= 36.86 +/- 5.8 years) on WhatsApp or via email and completed online. Participants were selected from among college students, patients, people with disabilities, their families and relatives, and others who could use smartphones, computers, tablets, and laptops. The effects of Covid-19 were evaluated by analyzing the CIQ scores before and after the pandemic in SPSS v. 22 software. Results Comparing the CIQ scores before and after the pandemic, results showed that it significantly reduced home integration (P&lt;0.0001), social integration (P&lt;0.0001), productive activities (P&lt;0.0001) and total score (P&lt;0.0001). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the social life of people. In addition to health threats of this disease, the fear of being infected and losing loved ones, job, educational opportunities, recreation, freedom and support, have profound psychological effects. Not only getting infected, but also the fear of getting infected can lead to a lack of access to resources that can improve people's resistance to this disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has direct and indirect psychological and social effects and can affect mental health. In order to reduce the negative psychosocial effects of quarantine and social distancing, the implementation of national strategies to promote social participation by Information and Communication Technology-based programs is recommended.","Monfared, E.; Vahedi, M.; Haghgoo, H.

"Virtual pulmonary rehabilitation programme â€“ A new era of working","Keywords: Digital;Improvement;Respiratory Purpose: In March 2020, all clinics and group sessions were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and most of our respiratory clients were shielding. During our initial contact with these clients, they reported being less active than they were pre-lockdown. Reduced physical activity is directly related to quality of life (QoL). So, it became important for our team to look into innovative ways to engage with our clients. The aim was to find an effective alternative way for clients to participate in our Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) while the restrictions were in place. Methods: This service evaluation used a mixed method approach to investigate the effectiveness of Virtual PR (VPR). Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected during the initial assessment (IA) and post assessment (PA) for comparison. Informal feedbacks were collected from clients and staff during the VPR group sessions. Quantitative data: 1. COPD Assessment Tool (CAT), measures the impact of condition on client's health. 2. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. 3. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety. 4. Exercise Tolerance test (ET) Qualitative data: 1. Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (MRC) 2. Client satisfactory survey during PA. Results: Of the 52 digitally enabled clients that were offered VPR, 88% completed the programme. 4% dropped out and the remaining 8% were expelled due to medical reasons. 11% of those who completed were housebound either due to their condition or lack of transport. 93% of the clients attended ten or more of the allocated 12 sessions. At the end of VPR, 13% of clients reported an improvement in MRC, and 65% of the clients had attained minimally important difference in ET. During IA, 86% reported to have medium to high impact on CAT. 43% of those clients had dropped to a lower impact level during post assessment. Initially, 63% reported to have psychological symptoms in at least one or both of the questionnaires (PHQ-9, GAD-7). Of these 29 clients who reported symptoms, 62% showed improvement at the end. 95% have said that VPR has motivated them to be active, 41% would have preferred face to face (F2F) sessions for the social aspects of the group, but all participants agreed that VPR was a good alternative. 95% of clients rated 8 or above for the quality of the sessions. During informal interviews, clients said VPR has saved them travel time and reduced dependency on family for transport. Staff reported lack of exercise equipment had an impact on the progress when compared to F2F. Conclusion(s): VPR as a digital solution has a positive effect on both physiological and psychological symptoms, thus improving QoL. Also, proved to be cost, time and clinically effective way to rehabilitate housebound clients. VPR is a good alternative to F2F sessions, but further work needs to be done to enable clients in digital and data poverty to uptake VPR to ensure fair access. Impact: VPR has been imbedded into our pathway and will be offered based on clinical decision and clientsâ€™ choice. Referral form will be revised to reflect the optional digital pathway. Funding acknowledgements: So far, this project has been funded at team level for the virtual platform licence. Funding has been secured for digital devices and data through the organisation (NELFT NHS trust) for a project on, â€˜VPR for clients in digital/data povertyâ€™.","Narasimhan, D.; Davis, G.; Sadhasivam, M.; Atiku, F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physio.2021.12.065","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Physiotherapy (United Kingdom); 114:e115, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27933,""
"Perceived Health Impact and Usage of Public Green Spaces in Brussels' Metropolitan Area During the COVID-19 Epidemic","To fight the COVID-19 epidemic, many countries implemented containment measures that made physical distancing the norm and imposed restrictions on the use of public space. In countries where access to public green spaces (PGSs) was safeguarded, they were expected to partially counterbalance the negative health outcomes of these containment measures, as they offered a unique opportunity to meet others, to avoid isolation, and to move, play and relax at a safe distance. Research on PGS use and its objective association with health during the COVID-19 epidemic is rather limited and is based on quantitative research methodologies. Such methodologies are useful to detect objective associations between PGS use and health or between COVID-19 and PGS use, but fall short in explaining the observed associations. This qualitative research filled this gap by examining how PGS users perceived the health advantages of PGSs and how the use of PGSs changed during the epidemic in the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. In total, 23 individual face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted in various PGSs. We found that while PGSs were initially perceived as a possible threat to health in the first period of the epidemic, they gradually became associated in users' minds with both improved physical and mental health. Although the mechanisms behind this association were also present prior to the epidemic, they became more tangible and more universal. We also found that the use of PGSs changed during the epidemic due to measures and restrictions and due to health risk perceptions. We distinguished five different health risk perception profiles in relation to COVID-19: the denier, the fatalist, the negotiator, the conformer and the worrier. These different health risk perceptions impacted on the use of and behaviour within PGSs. This research confirms the importance of PGSs during an epidemic and may inspire further research, offer pointers to policymakers for developing and implementing strategies related to the use of PGSs during epidemics, and assist them in providing available and accessible PGSs and in designing attractive, more epidemic-proof PGSs.","Noel, C.; Rodriguez-Loureiro, L.; Vanroelen, C.; Gadeyne, S.","https://doi.org/10.3389/frsc.2021.668443","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Sustainable Cities; 3:15, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27934,""
"School nursing intervention for COVID-19-related mental health issues in the school health office","The purpose of this review is to discuss the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental, physical and social health of children and young people aged 0â€“18 years, better understand the risk factors for these issues and explore available interventions to promote optimal health in this population globally. The risk factors, including increased screen time, economic instability, pre-existing mental illness and isolation, are explored in relation to their impact on paediatric health and wellbeing. Current mental health trends, including elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide, and gaps in the available literature are discussed. The impact of the pandemic on overall health, nutrition, physical activity, household environments and sleep are also analysed in relation to possible school nurse interventions for children, parents, and communities in developing solutions to improve the health of children and adolescents. As a result of this review, the authors found significant negative correlations between children and adolescents' mental health and COVID-19 restrictions, such as altered social interaction, disturbed sleep, changes in level of exercise, and altered dietary habits.","Ochinegro, Gabrielle, Doyle, Sydney, Perron, Tracy, Ehasz, Evelyn, Chaiko, Mary Grace, Forbes, Grayson","https://doi.org/10.12968/chhe.2021.2.5.218","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of School Nursing; 2(5):218-222, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27935,""

"Contact With Nature as a Mental Health Buffer for Lower Income Communities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Despite a growing number of research outputs on the importance of nature contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, we know of no longitudinal research conducted prior to and during the pandemic among low-income and minority ethnicity populations, i.e., those that might be most affected. Furthermore, we have scant information about how and to what degree contact with nature might protect mental health or mitigate worsening of mental health during the pandemic. We filled these gaps using a subset of a longitudinal study of n = 86 individuals in low-income, predominantly African American, neighborhoods in Detroit, MI, USA. The study addressed the following research questions: (1) did self-reported use and perceived value of nature change during, vs. prior to, the pandemic;(2) did perceived access to outdoor spaces buffer people against mental health issues such as stress, anxiety and depression symptoms;or (3) did objectively measured quality of nature views from home buffer people against mental health issues, taking into account relevant covariates and pandemic experiences (e.g., loss of employment, death of a friend/relative)? While attitudes to nature improved slightly from pre- to during the pandemic, we also observed significant decreases in most types of outdoor physical activity and passive enjoyment of nature (e.g., smelling plants/rain). We found a positive association between visibility of greenspace and perceived stress and anxiety, which not only contradicts previous research findings, but was especially surprising given that overall there was a decrease in perceived stress from 2019-2020. We did not detect associations between perceived access/use of nature and mental health. However, higher depressive symptoms were associated with exposure to more COVID-19-related stressors (lost employment, death of friends from COVID-19, etc.). Taken together, our results indicate that COVID-19 may serve to prolong or exacerbate mental health issues, rather than create them, in this population and that low quality greenspace may perhaps limit the ability for nature view to buffer mental health during the pandemic.","Pearson, A.

Christianity and the New Spirit of Capitalism is, then, less of a direct engagement with Weber, and more of a staged contrast between a number of central components of â€œfinance-dominated capitalismâ€ with the Christian calling of Tannerâ€™s own context. [...]Weberâ€™s methodology concerns the effect of the worldview and theological doctrines of Protestantism (rather than personal beliefs) on the capitalist drive for profit.","Petterson, Christina","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0017816022000086","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Harvard Theological Review; 115(1):136-147, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27939,""
"Mental Health First Aid training and assessment in Australian medical, nursing and pharmacy curricula: a national perspective using content analysis","Background Suicide is among the leading causes of death among people aged 15 to 29 worldwide. Healthcare professionals interact with people at risk of suicide regularly, yet mental health and crisis first aid training is lacking in curricula. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training teaches crucial communication and crisis first aid skills and is increasingly recognised as integral to healthcare education. This study aimed to explore the extent of, as well as barriers and enablers to MHFA training delivery and assessment in Australian medical, nursing and pharmacy curricula. Methods All accredited Australian medical, nursing and pharmacy program providers were identified through Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and National Boards websites and invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. A purpose-designed interview guide explored if and how MHFA training was delivered and assessed in curricula, as well as perceptions of and barriers and enablers to MHFA training. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim, allowing for deductive content analysis to compare MHFA training provision across programs. Results Of 75 invited program providers, 36 (48%;13 medical, 13 nursing and 10 pharmacy) participated, of which 15 representatives (42%;six medical, two nursing and six pharmacy) reported providing MHFA training to students. Differences in mandating training, year level of students completing training, type of training delivered and source of MHFA instructors were identified. Barriers to MHFA implementation included perceived adequacy of existing curricula, lack of funding and time, while facilitators included perceived benefit and availability of funding. Conclusion MHFA training is provided to more than one third of medical, nursing and pharmacy students in Australia. Increased funding may facilitate the integration of MHFA as a minimum standard of mental health training for future healthcare professionals. Further research exploring the effectiveness of MHFA in improving behaviours and its impact on patient outcomes is warranted.

"The role of outdoor and indoor air quality in the spread of SARS-CoV-2: Overview and recommendations by the research group on COVID-19 and particulate matter (RESCOP commission)","There are important questions surrounding the potential contribution of outdoor and indoor air quality in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and perpetuation of COVID-19 epidemic waves. Environmental health may be a critical component of COVID-19 prevention. The public health community and health agencies should consider the evolving evidence in their recommendations and statements, and work to issue relational occupational guidelines. Evidence coming from the current epidemiological and experimental research is expected to add knowledge about virus diffusion, COVID-19 severity in most polluted areas, inter-personal distance requirements and need for wearing face masks in indoor or outdoor environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for maintaining particulate matter concentrations at low levels for multiple health-related reasons, which may also include the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Indoor environments represent even a more crucial challenge to cope with, as it is easier for the SARS-COV2 to spread, remain vital and infect other subjects in closed spaces in the presence of already infected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people. The potential merits of preventive measures, such as CO2 monitoring associated with natural or controlled mechanical ventilation and air purification, for schools, indoor public places (restaurants, offices, hotels, museums, theatres/cinemas etc.) and transportations need to be carefully considered. Hospital settings and nursing/retirement homes as well as emergency rooms, infectious diseases divisions and ambulances represent higher risk indoor environments and may require additional monitoring and specific decontamination strategies based on mechanical ventilation or air purification.","Piscitelli, Prisco, Miani, Alessandro, Setti, Leonardo, De Gennaro, Gianluigi, Rodo, Xavier, Artinano, Begona, Vara, Elena, Rancan, Lisa, Arias, Javier, Passarini, Fabrizio, Barbieri, Pierluigi, Pallavicini, Alberto, Parente, Alessandro, D'Oro, Edoardo Cavalieri, De Maio, Claudio, Saladino, Francesco, Borelli, Massimo, Colicino, Elena, GonÃ§alves, Luiz Marcos G.; Di Tanna, Gianluca, Colao, Annamaria, Leonardi, Giovanni S.; Baccarelli, Andrea, Dominici, Francesca, Ioannidis, John P.

"Psychological Effects of Social Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic 2020","The SARS-CoV2 pandemic meant considerable restrictions in the social life of many people. Older people belong to the high-risk group for a severe to fatal course of the SARS-CoV2 disease, which is why these groups received special protection. This protection included drastic restrictions on their personal and social contacts, including the suspension of psychosocial therapies. This study examines the cognitive and emotional effects of social isolation on older people. A group of 49 participants who lived in nursing homes was tested before and after social isolation in 2020. The results of the present study provide empirical evidence for the negative effects of social isolation of older people in nursing homes regarding cognitive performance, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and quality of life.","Plangger, B.; Unterrainer, C.; Kreh, A.; Gatterer, G.; Juen, B.","https://doi.org/10.1024/1662-9647/a000283","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Geropsych-the Journal of Gerontopsychology and Geriatric Psychiatry;: 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27942,""
"The Aging, Community and Health Research Unit Community Partnership Program (ACHRU-CPP) for older adults with diabetes and multiple chronic conditions: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Background Older adults (=65 years) with diabetes and multiple chronic conditions (MCC) (&gt; 2 chronic conditions) experience reduced function and quality of life, increased health service use, and high mortality. Many community-based self-management interventions have been developed for this group, however the evidence for their effectiveness is limited. This paper presents the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness and implementation of the Aging, Community and Health Research Unit-Community Partnership Program (ACHRU-CPP) to usual care in older adults with diabetes and MCC and their caregivers. Methods We will conduct a cross-jurisdictional, multi-site implementation-effectiveness type II hybrid RCT. Eligibility criteria are: =65 years, diabetes diagnosis (Type 1 or 2) and at least one other chronic condition, and enrolled in a primary care or diabetes education program. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention (ACHRU-CPP) or control arm (1:1 ratio). The intervention arm consists of home/telephone visits, monthly group wellness sessions, multidisciplinary case conferences, and system navigation support. It will be delivered by registered nurses and registered dietitians/nutritionists from participating primary care or diabetes education programs and program coordinators from community-based organizations. The control arm consists of usual care provided by the primary care setting or diabetes education program. The primary outcome is the change from baseline to 6 months in mental functioning. Secondary outcomes will include, for example, the change from baseline to 6 months in physical functioning, diabetes self-management, depressive symptoms, and cost of use of healthcare services. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models will be used to analyze all outcomes, with intention-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation to address missing data. Descriptive and qualitative data from older adults, caregivers and intervention teams will be used to examine intervention implementation, site-specific adaptations, and scalability potential. Discussion An interprofessional intervention supporting self-management may be effective in improving health outcomes and client/caregiver experience and reducing service use and costs in this complex population. This pragmatic trial includes a scalability assessment which considers a range of effectiveness and implementation criteria to inform the future scale-up of the ACHRU-CPP.

"Stress Among the Nurses and Their Family Involved in COVID-19 Patient Management","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has caused havoc and many deaths around the world. Coronavirus is highly contagious and spreads like wildfire in the community. The nurses and other frontline health-care workers (HCWs) bore the brunt of this pandemic with maximum effect because they all worked with infected patients. Direct exposure has caused stress, anxiety, and physical cum mental discomfort among them. Objective: This study aimed to assess stress among nurses and family members related to COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: In this study, mixed method of prospective approach was used. The study was conducted virtually using social media platforms by online questionnaire. It included 150 participants and information was collected on demographic data, change in relationship with family, spouse, children, self-concept, and perceived stress among themselves and their family members. Results: All the nurses were involved in the direct care of COVID-infected patients. Many participants (47%) became anxious and worried about themselves. More than half (56.7%) respondents had no change in relationship, while 40.7% experienced change in relationship with their family. Majority of the participants (88%) had long travel hours and accommodation issues. Although the nurses working for COVID patients were stressed, frightened, and anxious, most of them took pride in their work as a contribution toward the nation during this current pandemic. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that frontline HCWs were at increased risk of mental health consequences such as stress, anxiety, and frustration. Their children developed behavioral changes such as agitation and aggressiveness. Many nurses got more family support than before for their contribution during COVID-19 pandemic.","Rai, P.; Kumari, S.; Roy, D.; Sahu, M.

"Anxiety and Coping Strategies Among Medical Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study","Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of medical students due to multiple factors like the fear of getting infected, the stress of maintaining the preventive measures, the demands of the online classes, and the uncertainty of the future. Aim: To assess the anxiety levels of the medical students and strategies, they used to cope up with the anxiety during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among all the first and final year MBBS students of a Women's Medical College and Teaching Hospital in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The questionnaire contained a total of 25 questions- three questions to collect the demographic data, a 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD), and 15 questions assessing their coping strategies;was distributed to all the study participants as a Google form. Data from completed questionnaires were entered into an excel sheet and analysed using Jamovi software version 1.6.23.0. Results: A total of 164 students completed the questionnaire-59.1% first year MBBS students and 40.8% final year MBBS students. Mean age of the participants was 19.4 years among the first year MBBS students, and 21.7 years among the final year MBBS students. Majority of the participants had mild anxiety (43.2%). There was no statistically significant difference in the anxiety levels of the first year MBBS and final year MBBS students. The most commonly used coping strategy factor was putting trust in the god (59.7% of first year MBBS, and 62.6% of final year MBBS) while the least commonly used coping strategy was substance abuse-use of alcohol or drugs to feel better (0 among first year MBBS and 2.9% among the final year MBBS). There was statistically significant association between one of the coping strategy and anxiety-I can adjust to the situation and deal with the changes and anxiety levels (p=0.010). Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of medical students by causing anxiety. There is a need to mitigate these negative effects by introducing supportive programs in the form of educational programs, yoga and meditation to relieve anxiety and maintain mental health of medical students.","Reddy, C.

"The placement wellbeing project: A remote intervention to support student health and wellbeing whilst on practice placement","Keywords: Wellbeing;Placement Purpose: Physiotherapy students commencing their practice placement journeys in the Covid-19 pandemic experienced unique challenges. Prior to the pandemic there was already an exponential rise in student mental health needs and higher education institutions (HEIs) have been urged to be proactive in preparing to support studentsâ€™ mental health. The Placement Wellbeing Project (PWP) was a newly constructed, remote intervention delivered using Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) and was piloted to support studentsâ€™ health and wellbeing whilst on placement. Methods: This action research project used a single group, repeated measures design to explore the effect of the intervention on self-efficacy and coping skills in a cohort of 14 physiotherapy students. Ethical approval was gained from the Queen Margaret University Divisional Ethics Committee. Participants worked through a digital Placement Wellbeing Toolkit, which contained resources and activities to promote positive coping strategies for a range of challenges faced on placement. Participants then took part in a pre-placement peer group discussion facilitated by a wellbeing advisor using MS Teams and a placement de-briefing session after placement. Outcomes were measured using the Placement Coping Scale (PCS) and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE). Scores were taken at baseline, pre-placement and post-placement. Qualitative feedback about the whole project was gained through a project evaluation. Results: Significant improvements were observed in the total PCS score (Friedman's test <U+03C7>2(2) = 19.75, p = 0.000) and all individual items of the PCS from baseline to post-placement. Post hoc analysis (Bonferroni correction applied) detected significant improvements between baseline and pre-placement total PCS scores (p = 0.005). Improvements were observed across all items of the PCS between baseline and pre-placement score, however only item â€œI have strategies to help me cope with the challenges of placementâ€ saw statistically significant improvements (p =.010). Total GSE scores improved significantly from baseline to final measure (Wilcoxon sum-rank test Z = 2.105, p =.035). Conclusion(s): The results of this study indicate that physiotherapy students may benefit from interventions aimed to develop positive coping strategies to prepare them for the challenges of placement. This intervention has been successfully delivered remotely which may allow for flexibility of future delivery. These results are in a single institution and further research is required to evaluate the project with a larger number of students at different institutions. Seeking to understand which parts of the intervention were most helpful and why, may also support the delivery of this project at scale. Impact: To develop a resilient future workforce we need to ensure that students are prepared for the challenges faced on placement and in the practice setting and can manage their own wellbeing in response to those challenges. This project has developed and evaluated a successful intervention which may be used in other HEIs in the UK. Furthermore, improving the coping skills of students on placement may support practice educators supervising students at this challenging time.

"Resilience coaching for healthcare workers: Experiences of receiving collegial support during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To explore experiences of receiving collegial support from the department of psychiatry at an acute care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method The Resilience Coaching program launched in April 2020, with the aim of offering a timely response to supporting psychosocial needs of healthcare workers (HCWs), leveraging collegial relationships and mental health training to offer support. Twenty-four HCWs were interviewed about their experiences receiving support from resilience coaches. Results Participants reported that Resilience Coaching offered hospital staff opportunities for connection, encouragement to attend to personal wellness, and avenues to learn practical skills to assist with coping. Coaching also assisted HCWs in accessing clinical mental health support when that was requested by staff.

"The data will not save us: Afropessimism and racial antimatter in the COVID-19 pandemic","The Trump Administration's governance of COVID-19 racial health disparities data has become a key front in the viral war against the pandemic and racial health injustice. In this paper, I analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic joins an already ongoing racial spectacle and system of structural gaslighting organized around â€œracial health disparitiesâ€ in the United States and globally. The field of racial health disparities has yet to question the domain assumptions that uphold its field of investigation;as a result, the entire reform program called for by racial health disparities science is already featured on the menu of the white supremacist power structure. The societal infrastructure that produces scientific knowledge about patterns of health and disease in the human population needs to confront its structural position as part of the racial spectacle organized around racial health disparities in the United States. This paper offers an interpretation of racial antimatter to explain why the data will not save us in the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing on articulations of racial spectacle and structural gaslighting within critical race theory and Afropessimist thought. By positioning events in the COVID-19 pandemic together within the same racially speculative frame, I show how the collection of racial health disparities data came up against white supremacistsâ€™ political ambitions in a time-space where the demand for human life to matter and the iterative regeneration of racial antimatter collided. This paper highlights the need for ongoing analysis of the unfolding and future spectacles organized around racial health disparities.","Ryan Hatch, Anthony","https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211067948","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Big Data & Society; 9(1):205395172110679-205395172110679, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27951,""
"Relationships between nature connectedness, biodiversity of private gardens, and mental well-being during the Covid-19 lockdown","Private gardens have an enormous impact on urban biodiversity, making individual householder behavior critical to the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity in urban areas. Nature connectedness is considered to be a prerequisite for proenvironmental behavior, but how it manifests in private gardens is largely unexplored. Nature connectedness has also been found to be associated with several well-being dimensions. The present study investigates the associations between nature connectedness, biodiversity of private gardens, and mental well-being during the Covid-19 lockdown, a stressful period in many peopleâ€™s lives. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to analyze data from an online survey of private gardeners in two cities, one in Germany and one in New Zealand, in May 2020, approximately two months after the beginning of the first Covid-19 lockdown. Garden characteristics explained a significant amount of variance in depression symptoms during the Covid- 19 lockdown. In light of rising pressures on urban green spaces, the findings point to the importance of private garden qualities for mental health and well-being. Nature connectedness emerged as a significant predictor of feature richness, a measure of the heterogeneity of habitats that support wildlife, and plant growth form richness in peopleâ€™s gardens in both city samples. Nature connectedness was also a significant predictor of the extent to which people experienced positive emotions during the Covid-19 lockdown but not negative emotions and depression symptoms. Our results suggest that nature connectedness can provide benefits for both the environment and people through its positive association with private garden biodiversity and positive emotions.","Samus, Andreas, Freeman, Claire, Dickinson, Katharine J.

"Psychophysiological effects of yoga on stress management among medical and allied health professional students during COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review","The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised health concerns worldwide. Medical and allied health professional schools are seeking ways to alleviate stress and improve the quality of life among students. The effects of yoga have proven to be successful against stress. The review aimed to examine the psychophysiological effects of yoga on stress management among medical and allied health professional students during COVID-19 pandemic. The authors reviewed existing literature and official documents, which mostly focussed on the effect of yoga among medical and health professional students. Mental stress among these students is known to be higher than that of the general population. Sudden changes due to the pandemic are likely to have a significant impact on these students. Uncertainties concerning teaching, learning and assessment generate stress and anxiety, and social distancing further contributes to loneliness. Yoga has gained recognition not only in improving mental health and quality of life, but it also helps in improving respiratory and immune health. Although many published studies examined the psychophysiological effects of yoga among health professional students;only a few medical and allied health professional schools have incorporated yoga into an integrated curriculum for a holistic approach. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the use of yoga for stress reduction and immune modulation should be considered as a complement to other treatments. There is a need to integrate yoga into medical and health science curricula to prepare physically fit and mentally sound prospective healthcare professionals.","Sarkar, S.; Sa, B.; Singh, K.; Gaur, U.; Bharatha, A.; Victor, V.; Rahman, S.; Majumder, M.

The results revealed common symptoms including fever (79.1%), cough (74.5%), anosmia& ageusia (68.4%), and dyspnea (66.9%). The patients were nonsmokers (83.9%), while 9.7% were mild smokers. The percentage of infected patients with comorbidities versus those without comorbidities were 29%, 71%, respectively. The highest incidence of infection was in those patients with hypertension (14.8%) and diabetes (10.9%), especially females with age &gt;50 years and obesity (BMI;30&ndash;39.9). The highest risks were observed for anticoagulants in the age above 50 years, morbid obesity, presence of comorbidities, and being a healthcare worker. The predictors of clot risk were in the age above 50 years, non-educated, and eating meat and eggs. Nonetheless, the highest risk of using antidepressants was in patients &gt;50 years and those who traveled abroad. These findings and similarities within the surrounding region, the Middle East, North Africa, and South Europe, indicate the possibility of sharing the same viral strain and characteristics that may predict a similar vaccine efficacy and response.","Schaalan, Mona, Abou Warda, Ahmed E.; Osman, Samir M.; Fathy, Shaimaa, Sarhan, Rania M.; Boshra, Marian S.; Sarhan, Neven, Gaber, Sayed, Ali, Ahmed Mahmoud Abdelhaleem","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14030448","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Viruses; 14(3):448, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27954,""
"Uplifting the Grassroots Through Community Entrepreneurship Development: A Case Study of Sualkuchi Handloom Town of Assam, India","A strong foundation of the economy lies in strengthening the grassroots. A robust rural economy and sound financial health at the grassroots is imperative for a balanced economic growth of any region. This Covid-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown showed the helplessness of industrialization with 10 million immigrant workers in India rushing back to their native places in search of food and shelter. A sustainable income that provides adequate stability to not just one but future generations is the need of the hour. After agriculture, the largest labour intensive sector in India is handloom. It employs around 4.3 million people, contributes 2.3 % to the country's GDP and 12% to earnings from exports. Total handloom export stood at US$ 176.97 million (April 2020 to January 2021) as per Ministry of Textiles, Government of India. So this sector has potential for an increased GDP and per capita rural income. Some facts about India's rich history of trade and commerce give an insight into the high demand of Indian textiles all across the globe. Apart from spices, herbs and minerals, India exported silk and cotton textiles to Central Asia, Southeast Asia and even Europe as early as in the 3rd - 4th centuries. Silk rearing and weaving are skills that are passed on from one generation to the other in rural areas of our country. Investments in terms of infrastructure and skill training would be extremely minimal if this tradition is taken up as an entrepreneurial venture within a geographical community. This paper attempts to study the handloom weavers of Sualkuchi town of Assam, their problems and future growth plans. This paper would also try to understand the possibilities of developing a community entrepreneurial programme for these weavers. This would be an initiative to motivate the younger generation to take up this tradition and enjoy a healthy sustainable living within their geographical boundaries rather than contributing towards growing urban slums.","Sharma, S.; Vijay, P.","https://doi.org/10.21786/bbrc/14.9.50","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications; 14(9):268-271, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27955,""
"Job Satisfaction and Psychological Distress among Help-Seeking Men: Does Meaning in Life Play a Role?","Men&rsquo;s low job satisfaction has been shown to be associated with greater symptoms of psychological distress. Meaning in life may be an important factor in this relationship, but its role as a mediator has not been reported. The present study investigated meaning in life as a mediator in the relationship between job satisfaction and psychological distress among men. A total of 229 employed Canadian men participated in a cross-sectional survey, completing measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, anger severity, job satisfaction, and the presence of meaning in life. Zero-order correlations were calculated, and regression with mediation analyses were conducted;two models were tested: one for anxiety/depression symptoms and one for anger, as the dependent variables. Both mediation models emerged as significant, revealing a significant mediating effect for job satisfaction on the symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety/depression symptoms, anger) through meaning in life, even while controlling for salient confounding variables including COVID-related impacts. Lower job satisfaction was associated with less meaning in life, which in turn was associated with more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger. The findings highlight the importance of job satisfaction in the promotion of a sense of meaning in life among men, leading to improved psychological well-being both inside and outside of the workplace.","Simard, Aiden A.

"THE CLINICAL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FIRST WAVE ON PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN NEW YORK1]","Background : People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) may be at risk of complications from COVID-19 but the impact of COVID-19 on pwCF remains unknown. Methods : We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic first wave on pwCF in the New York metropolitan area (NY) from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. Objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of COVID-19 by PCR and IgG antibody testing, (2) the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, (3) delay in routine outpatient care, and (4) the effect on anxiety and depression in pwCF. Results : There were 26 COVID-19 cases diagnosed by PCR or antibody testing among the study cohort of 810 pwCF. The prevalence of COVID-19 by PCR (1.6%) and IgG antibody (12.2%) testing was low. 58% of cases were asymptomatic and 82% were managed at home. 8% were hospitalized and 1 person died. 89% of pwCF experienced delay in care. The prevalence of anxiety increased from 43% baseline to 58% during the pandemic (P&lt;0.01). In post-hoc analysis, the proportion of patients with diabetes (38% versus 16%, P&lt;0.01) and pancreatic insufficiency (96% versus 66%, P&lt;0.01) were higher while CFTR modulator use was lower (46% versus 65%, P=0.05) in pwCF who tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusions : The prevalence of COVID-19 among pwCF in NY during the pandemic first wave was low and most cases were managed at home. CFTR modulators may be protective. PwCF experienced delay in routine care and increased anxiety.","Simonson, Joseph L.; Esposito, Christine, Frantzen, Theresa, Henthorne, Katherine, Espinal, Aileen, Romano, Serena, Ramdeo, Ramona, Trentacoste, Jessica, Tsang, Donna, La Vecchia, Geralyn, Abdullah, Robert, Berdella, Maria, Bonitz, Lynn, Condos, Rany, Constantinescu, Andrei, DeCelie-Germana, Joan K.; DiMango, Emily, Draine, Myah, Gimeli, Tara, Giusti, Robert, Guzman, Jessenia, Hammouda, Soumia, Keating, Claire, Kier, Catherine, Lennox, Alison T.; Liriano, Carmen, Messer, Zachary, Plachta, Amy, Sadeghi, Hossein, Schwind, Elinor, Stables-Carney, Teresa, Walker, Patricia, Wang, Janice","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2022.02.012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27957,""

Many who entered SIP hotels had opioid use disorder. In fall 2020, Community Behavioral Health Services Pharmacy partnered with SIP hotel medical staff to launch a pilot project, where on-site SIP medical providers prescribed buprenorphine (BUP) and clinical pharmacists hand-delivered BUP to SIP residents to increase BUP initiation and engagement. A retrospective chart review of 3 patients living in SIP hotels starting BUP to demonstrate the feasibility of a SIP hotel BUP delivery program. In all 3 cases, patients were able to start and continue BUP with on-site medical staff visits and delivery of medications by pharmacists. Each case highlights different barriers that were overcome by this system. Our findings suggest that this system of onsite medical care with pharmacist delivery is possible and has the potential to allow for greater outreach and increased ease of obtaining medications for patients.","Samuel, Caygill-Walsh, Suen, Mohebbi, Geier","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000989","20220304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27959,""
"Risk factors for depression and anxiety in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from meta-analysis","The prevalence of anxiety and depression in pregnant women has significantly increased after the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. We carried out this meta-analysis to reveal the information about risk factors for depression and anxiety in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched the PubMed, Embase and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases for all articles. The odds ratio (OR) corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to assess the risk factors for mental health. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistics. We collected 17 studies including 15,050 pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results found that factors including decrease in the perception of general support and difficulties in household finances have damage effects on anxiety, and factors including undereducated, unemployed during pregnancy, with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy, decrease in the perception of general support, difficulties in household finances, disobey the isolation rules, and smoking during pregnancy have increased risk of depression. Our meta-analysis revealed some risk factors for mental health in pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic.

"Predicting Uptake of the COVID Coach App Among US Military Veterans: A Funnel Analysis Using a Probability-Based Panel","Although the COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a uniform increase of mental health concerns among older adults, there is evidence to suggest that some older veterans did experience an exacerbation of pre-existing mental health conditions, and that mental health difficulties were associated with a lack of social support and increasing numbers of pandemic-related stressors. Mobile mental health apps are scalable, may be a helpful resource for managing stress during the pandemic and beyond, and could potentially provide services that are not accessible due to the pandemic. However, overall comfort with mobile devices and factors influencing the uptake and usage of mobile apps during the pandemic among older veterans are not well known. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed for pandemic-related stress. Public usage data have been evaluated, but its uptake and usage among older veterans has not been explored. The purpose of the current study was to characterize smartphone ownership rates among U.S. veterans, identify veteran characteristics associated with downloading and use of COVID Coach, and characterize key content usage within the app. Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3,078 U.S. military veterans before and one year into the pandemic. The NHRVS sample was drawn from KnowledgePanelÃ‚Â®, a research panel of more than 50,000 households maintained by Ipsos, Inc. Median time to complete the survey was nearly 32 minutes. The research version of COVID Coach was offered to all veterans who completed the peri-pandemic follow-up assessment on a mobile device (n = 814; weighted 34.2% of total sample). App usage data from all respondents who downloaded the app (n = 34; weighted 3.3% of the mobile completers sample) were collected between November 14, 2020 and November 7, 2021. We found that most U.S. veterans (81.5%) own smartphones, and that veterans with higher education, greater number of adverse childhood experiences, higher extraversion, and greater severity of pandemic-related PTSD symptoms were more likely to download COVID Coach. Although uptake and usage of COVID Coach was relatively low (3.3% of eligible participants, n = 34), 50% of the participants returned to the app for more than one day of use. The interactive tools for managing stress were used most frequently. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for and creation of digital mental health tools. However, these resources may require tailoring for older veteran populations. Future research is needed to better understand how to optimize digital mental health tools, such as apps, to ensure uptake and usage among older adults, particularly those who have experienced traumas across the lifespan.","Jaworski, Taylor, Ramsey, Heinz, Steinmetz, Owen, Tsai, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.2196/36217","20220304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27961,""
"Physical isolation and mental health among older US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: longitudinal findings from the COVID-19 Coping Study","We investigated the relationships between physical isolation at home during the period when many US states had shelter-in-place orders and subsequent longitudinal trajectories of depression, anxiety, and loneliness in older adults over a 6Ã‚Â month follow-up. Data were from monthly online questionnaires with US adults agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°55 in the nation-wide COVID-19 Coping Study (April through October 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3978). Physical isolation was defined as not leaving home except for essential purposes (0, 1-3, 4-6, and 7Ã‚Â days in the past week), measured at baseline (April-May). Outcomes were depressive symptoms (8-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), anxiety symptoms (5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory), and loneliness (3-item UCLA loneliness scale), measured monthly (April-October). Multivariable, population- and attrition-weighted linear mixed-effects models assessed the relationships between baseline physical isolation with mental health symptoms at baseline and over time. Physical isolation (7Ã‚Â days versus 0Ã‚Â days in the past week) was associated with elevated depressive symptoms (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85; 95% CI 0.10-1.60), anxiety symptoms (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.22; 95% CI 0.45-1.98), and loneliness (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.06; 95% CI 0.51-1.61) at baseline, but not with meaningful rate of change in these mental health outcomes over time. The symptom burden of each mental health outcome increased with increasing past-week frequency of physical isolation. During the early COVID-19 pandemic, physical isolation was associated with elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness, which persisted over time. These findings highlight the unique and persistent mental health risks of physical isolation at home under pandemic control measures.","Joseph, O'Shea, Eastman, Finlay, Kobayashi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02248-4","20220304","Aging; Isolation; Loneliness; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27962,""
"Investigation and influencing factors about well-being level of elderly chronic patients during COVID-19 postpandemic period in Beijing","The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has huge impacts on the world, including human health and economic decline. The COVID-19 has severe infectivity, especially the elderly with chronic diseases will cause various complications after infection and accelerate the disease process. In addition, COVID-19 will also affect their mental health. Therefore, the mental health of elderly patients with chronic diseases cannot be ignored. The aim of this study was to investigate the well-being level of elderly people with chronic disease during COVID-19 postpandemic period in Beijing and analysis related influencing factors, so as to provide a basis for improving the well-being level of elderly chronic patients during the postpandemic period.Elderly patients with chronic diseases who met the inclusion criteria in 5 different administrative regions in Beijing were selected to carry out a questionnaire survey. The contents of the questionnaire included general data, the Memorial University of Newfoundland Happiness scale and the awareness situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 500 questionnaires were distributed by WeChat and 486 valid questionnaires were collected. The t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to compare Memorial University of Newfoundland Happiness scores between 2 or more groups, multiple linear regression analysis was used to conduct multiple factor analysis to explore the related factors about well-being level of elderly chronic patients.A total of 109 cases (22.43%) were evaluated high well-being level, 319 cases (65.64%) were evaluated moderate well-being level and 58 cases (11.93%) were evaluated low well-being according to the Memorial University of Newfoundland Happiness (MUNSH) scores rating. The multiple linear regression indicated that the education level, number of chronic diseases, medical expenses, frequency of children's visits, taking care of grandchildren or not, and group activity frequency significantly affected the well-being of patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19 postpandemic period in Beijing (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05).Most elderly patients with chronic diseases had moderate or above sense of well-being during postpandemic period, but we should still pay attention to the mental health of those elderly chronic patients with low education level, much comorbidity, more medical expenses, less visits by children, not take care of grandchildren and never participate in group activities.","Wu, Liu, Liu, Yan, Zhao, Zeng, Zhou, Rao, Sun, Jiao, Xi","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000028976","20220304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27963,""
"The relationship between older adults' technology use, in-person engagement, and pandemic-related mental health","The objectives of this study are to 1) describe changes in in-person communication/activity and changes in older adult technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) examine whether less in-person communication/activity mediates the relationship between pandemic-related mental health and technology use. Linear regressions (stratified by age and financial strain) and structural equation modeling were employed using a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of 3,188 older adults from the 2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study's COVID-19 Questionairre. Older adults engaged in more technology-based activity (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24; p&lt;.001), more technology-based health care communication (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22; p&lt;.001), and more technology-based food acquisition (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.21; p&lt;.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to before the pandemic. Results indicate that adults &lt;80Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old demonstrated greater increases in technology-based activity, technology-based health communication, and technology-based food acquisition, compared to adults Ã¢â€°Â¥80Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old. Change in in-person communication significantly mediated the relationship between pandemic-related mental health and technology-based communication (standardized coefficient=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.012; p=.005), and change in in-person activity significantly mediated the relationship between pandemic-related mental health and technology-based activity (standardized coefficient=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.017; p=.020). This study suggests that older adults are utilizing technology more, and therefore should be considered in technology design and dissemination. Technology use could be an important positive response to help those with pandemic related worries stay safely engaged with friends and family. Technologies should be produced that are modifiable for older adults with disabilities and affordable for older adults with fixed incomes.","Drazich, Li, Perrin, Szanton, Lee, Huang, Carlson, Samuel, Regier, Rebok, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2046695","20220304","COVID-19; Technology; mental health; older adults; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27964,""
"Supporting someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed methods analysis of cancer carer's health, Quality of Life and need for support","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the delivery of cancer care. Due to social restrictions and reductions in health service contact, it is expected that the burdens experienced by informal carers have risen. This study provides an analysis of cancer carer's experiences and needs as a consequence of the pandemic. An online mixed method design was used. The survey included open-ended responses to explore carer's experiences and measures of health status (EQ-5D-5L), Quality of Life (WHOQoL-BREF) and impact of COVID-19. Open-ended responses were analysed thematically according to Miles and Huberman techniques and quantitative data were analysed descriptively. One hundred and ninety-six cancer carers participated in the online survey. Mixed method analysis demonstrated that carers were experiencing major difficulties. Of these nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 142/72.4% experienced challenges related to anxiety and depression; 35.2% rated these problems as slight with 25% rating these as moderate and 11.2% as severe. Qualitative analysis identified significant and sustained negative impacts of the pandemic on psychological health, social isolation, finance and access to health services with carers requiring urgent information and support. Carer's challenges have deepened throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to develop innovative ways to provide support for carers to provide palliative and supportive care at home now and during recovery from the pandemic.

"Community Engagement in Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Research in Brazil, Ethiopia, and Sri Lanka: A Decolonial Approach for Global Health","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic skin disease endemic in at least 88 countries where it presents an urgent, albeit often ""neglected"" public health problem. In this paper, we discuss our model of decolonial community engagement in the ECLIPSE global health research program, which aims to improve physical and mental health outcomes for people with CL. The ECLIPSE program has four interlinked phases and underpinning each of these phases is sustained and robust community engagement and involvement that guides and informs all activities in ECLIPSE. Our decolonial approach implies that the model for community engagement will be different in Brazil, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. Indeed, we adopt a critical anthropological approach to engaging with community members and it is precisely this approach we evaluate in this paper. The data and material we draw on were collected through qualitative research methods during community engagement activities. We established 13 Community Advisory Groups (CAGs): in Brazil (<i>n</i> = 4), Ethiopia (<i>n</i> = 6), and Sri Lanka (<i>n</i> = 3). We identified four overarching themes during a thematic analysis of the data set: (1) Establishing community advisory groups, (2) CAG membership and community representation, (3) Culturally appropriate and context-bespoke engagement, and (4) Relationships between researchers and community members. During our first period of ECLIPSE community engagement, we have debunked myths (for instance about communities being ""disempowered""), critiqued our own practices (changing approaches in bringing together CAG members) and celebrated successes (notably fruitful online engagement during a challenging COVID-19 pandemic context). Our evaluation revealed a gap between the exemplary community engagement frameworks available in the literature and the messy, everyday reality of working in communities. In the ECLIPSE program, we have translated ideal(istic) principles espoused by such community engagement guidance into the practical realities of ""doing engagement"" in low-resourced communities. Our community engagement was underpinned by such ideal principles, but adapted to local sociocultural contexts, working within certain funding and regulatory constraints imposed on researchers. We conclude with a set of lessons learned and recommendations for the conduct of decolonial community engagement in global health research.","Polidano, Parton, Agampodi, Agampodi, Haileselassie, Lalani, Mota, Price, Rodrigues, Tafere, Trad, Zerihun, Dikomitis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.823844","20220304","community advisory boards; community partnerships; decoloniality; empowerment; ethnography; low-resourced settings; neglected tropical diseases; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27966,""
"Construction of Relationship Model between College Students' Psychological Status and Epidemic Situation Based on BP Neural Network","In view of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of college students, this paper proposes a study on the relationship between psychological status and epidemic situation of university students based on BP neural network, so as to provide theoretical basis for universities to take targeted mental health education. This paper investigates the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological emotions of college students. According to the behavior and psychological characteristics of college students, the relevant investigation results are obtained through event monitoring, early warning, and usual performance, and a relationship model between college students' psychological status and epidemic situation based on BP neural network is constructed. This paper studies several factors through the relationship model and uses the principal component analysis method to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' psychology. According to the model prediction and result analysis, it concluded that the influence of COVID-19 should focus on improving the professional quality, physical quality, humanistic quality, and moral quality of university students, so as to improve the stability of colleges and universities in the event of public health emergencies. The model constructed in this paper can provide reference for carrying out mental health education and formulating effective intervention programs.","Yao","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5115432","20220304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27967,""
"The Professional Identity and Career Attitude of Chinese Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey in China","Although professional identity is a strong predictor of career choice, only a few studies have reported on medical students' career attitude during a public health emergency. This study investigates the changes in medical students' professional identity and career attitude during the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluates their mental health and social support system under stress, and explores the relationship between their career attitude and other factors. An online survey of 6,226 Chinese medical students was conducted to collect information on demographics, professional identity, and career attitude. The collected data were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Social Support Rating Scale. The results revealed that most (80.8%) of the participants did not change their career attitude and the professional identity of most participants strengthened, and they preferred to participate on the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students was 22.86% and 35.43%. Low social support, depressive symptoms, male gender, and higher grades were factors that negatively affected career attitude. After the outbreak of the pandemic, it was necessary to conduct diversified professional identity research to support medical students, especially those with low social support and depressive symptoms.","Yang, Gao, Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Zhou, Qi, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.774467","20220304","COVID-19 pandemic; China; career attitude; health emergency; medical students; professional identity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27968,""
"Child and Parent Physical Activity, Sleep, and Screen Time During COVID-19 and Associations With Mental Health: Implications for Future Psycho-Cardiological Disease?","The COVID-19 pandemic has afforded the opportunity for some to improve lifestyle behaviours, while for others it has presented key challenges. Adverse changes in global lifestyle behaviours, including physical activity, sleep, and screen time can affect proximal mental health and in turn distal cardiovascular outcomes. We investigated differences in physical activity, sleep, and screen time in parents and children during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia compared to pre-COVID-19 national data; and estimated associations between these movement behaviours with parent and child mental health. Cross-sectional baseline data from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Study (CPAS; <i>N</i> = 2,365) were compared to nationally representative pre-pandemic data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC; <i>N</i> = 9,438). Participants were parents of children aged Ã¢â€°Â¤ 18 years, residing in Australia. Parents provided self-report measures of mental health, physical activity and sleep quality, and reported on child mental health, physical activity and screen time. Children in CPAS had significantly more sleep problems and more weekend screen time. Their parents had significantly poorer sleep quality, despite increased weekly physical activity. Children's sleep problems were significantly associated with increased mental health problems, after accounting for socioeconomic status, physical activity, and screen time. Poorer parent sleep quality and lower levels of physical activity were significantly associated with poorer mental health. Monitoring this cohort over time will be important to examine whether changes in movement behaviour are enduring or naturally improve with the easing of restrictions; and whether these changes have lasting effects on either parent or child mental health, and in turn, future risk for CVD.","Olive, Sciberras, Berkowitz, Hoare, Telford, O'Neil, Mikocka-Walus, Evans, Hutchinson, McGillivray, Berk, Teague, Wood, Olsson, Westrupp","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.774858","20220304","adults; anxiety; children; depression; physical activity; psychiatry; screen time; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27969,""
"Association of frailty and cognitive function disorders in old patients with COVID-19: a protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 infections have become an urgent worldwide public health concern. Although it is primarily a respiratory disease, up to two-thirds of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exhibit nervous system damage and an increased risk of frailty. In this study,we aim to investigate the relationship between frailty and cognitive function disorders in patients with COVID-19 with a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. This meta-analysis has been registered by the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. We will search for relevant studies from PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biological Medical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, from their inception to 5 July 2021. We will also search reference lists of selected articles for additional studies. Our search strategy will have no language restrictions. We will employ a Ã¯Â¬Âxed or random-effects model to calculate OR and 95% CIs for pooled data, and assess heterogeneity using Cochrane's Q and I<sup>2</sup> tests. The primary outcome will be the rate of cognitive disorders related to frailty in old patients with COVID-19. Ethical approval is not essential since data will be extracted from previously published studies. The results of this meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Depression among medical students in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of communication between universities and their students","Medical students are vulnerable to stress and depression during medical school, and the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated these issues. This study examined whether depression risk was associated with COVID-19 pandemic-related medical school communication. A 144-item pilot cross-sectional online survey of medical students in the US, between September 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2020. Items on stress, depression, and communication between students and their medical schools were included. This study examined associations of student perceptions of universities' communication efforts and pandemic response with risk of developing depression. The sample included 212 students from 22 US states. Almost half (48.6%) were at risk of developing depression. Students felt medical schools transitioned well to online platforms and the curriculum was just as rigorous as in-person courses. Students at risk of developing depression reported communication was poor more frequently compared to students at average risk. Students at risk of depression were more than 3 times more likely to report their universities' communication about scholarships or other funding was poor in adjusted analyses. Universities communicated well with medical students during the pandemic. However, this study also highlights the need for ongoing efforts to address student mental health by medical schools.","Ecker, Berenson, Gonzalez, Zoorob, Hirth","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.56","20220304","SARS-CoV-2; curriculum; medical; mental health; students; universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27971,""
"Does m-health-based exercise (guidance plus education) improve efficacy in patients with chronic low-back pain? A preliminary report on the intervention's significance","The utilization of mobile health (m-health) has rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is still a lack of relevant clinical data pertaining to chronic low-back pain (CLBP) management. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of m-health-based exercise (via guidance plus education) versus exercise (via guidance) during CLBP management. Participants (n = 40) were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received m-health-based exercise (via guidance plus education), whereas the control group received m-health-based exercise (via guidance). The exercise prescription video and educational content were sent to participants by the application (app), Ding Talk. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test the baseline's intervention effects, 6-week follow-up, and 18-week follow-up. We selected function (Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain intensity (current, mean, and most severe Numeric Rating Scale in the last 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks) as the primary outcomes, changes of negative emotion (depression, anxious), and quality of life as the secondary outcomes. Time's significant effect was found in pain, function, and health-related quality of life in both groups, but time did not show significant interaction effects. Participants were able to use m-based education with their anxiety and depression after treatment, but the relief only lasted until week 6. No differences were found on the aspect of mental health-related quality of life. Preliminary findings suggest that m-health-based exercise (via guidance) may be a convenient and effective method to treat CLBP. However, additional health education didn't help more. More rigorous controlled trials are needed to improve the therapeutic effect in future studies. Chinese Clinical Trials Registry Number ChiCTR2000041459 .

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Rohingya refugees with pre-existing health problems in Bangladesh","Mental disorders among refugees have been well explored in several studies. However, longitudinal studies on the impact of the pandemic on refugee populations are widely lacking. This study was designed to examine the impact of the current pandemic on the mental health of Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh. This longitudinal study involved a convenience sample of 732 Rohingya people with pre-existing health problems who lived in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The first recruitment was performed on 5 July 2019 (prepandemic visit) and assessed the health status of refugees using the Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15). The follow-up survey was conducted on 10 November 2020, approximately 15Ã‚Â months later, during the pandemic. A total of 342 Rohingya refugees who completed the initial survey participated in the follow-up survey. A newly developed COVID-19 Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale was used alongside the RHS-15 scale during the second survey. Ethical measures were taken in compliance with the current Declaration of Helsinki. The analysis was performed using SPSS 26. A total of 342 Rohingya refugees completed this longitudinal survey. The average age of participants was 32.25Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.01Ã‚Â years (SD), and the predominant age group wasÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã‚Â years (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°207, 60.5%). Most of the participants were female (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°209, 61.1%). A significant increase in stress was noted from the prepandemic to pandemic periods, as determined by the RHS-15 scale (RHS-15 Part I: 22.96Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.43 vs. 46.72Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.87, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; and RHS-15 Part II: 4.43Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.59 vs. 6.91Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.49, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The mean COV19-QoL score of the participants was 4.47Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15 (out of 5), indicating a perceived negative impact of the pandemic in their lives. In the multiple regression analysis, female sex (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.604, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017) and COV19-QoL score (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.537, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) were significantly associated with higher perceived distress among participants. Rohingya refugees experienced a significant deterioration of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside other socioeconomic, environmental, and political factors, the pandemic itself might have been a crucial contributor to this negative trend.","Palit, Yang, Li, Khan, Hasan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-022-00443-3","20220304","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; RHS-15; Refugee; Rohingya","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27973,""
"COVID 19-impact on substance use treatment utilization and provision in South Africa","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted people with substance use disorders (SUDs) worldwide. The aim of this study was to explore, changes in the number of SUD treatment episodes provided during the height of the pandemic and, SUD treatment providers' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19-related restrictions on people with SUDs and the delivery of SUD treatment services in South Africa. We used administrative data collected as part of the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU) project to assess whether the number of treatment episodes changed during the height of COVID-19 restrictions. We used data from an online survey of SUD treatment providers to assess providers' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on SUD treatment delivery. Eight seven SUD facilities were recruited to participate in the online survey. Sixty-three organisations (out of a total of 86) participated in the survey, yielding a 73.2% response rate. About half (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30; 47.6%) of the sample thought the need for SUD treatment had remained the same or had increased during the COVID-19 lockdown. Half the sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32; 50.7%) reported decreased availability of SUD services during COVID-19 lockdowns. Participants believed that the lack of services during COVID-19 lockdown impacted negatively on patients that were enrolled in their programmes and on individuals who wished to access the service. Furthermore, changes in service provision seemed to increase patients' anxiety, exacerbate pre-existing mental health problems and in some cases were thought to precipitate relapse. In addition, patient disengagement and attrition from treatment were thought to have increased during this period. Whilst 47.6% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30) of providers agreed with the value of the alcohol ban, 23.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15) of providers thought it had unintended negative consequences. Based on the findings it is evident that SUD treatment services in South Africa have been significantly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic and more severely during the onset of the pandemic. Together with service providers, more effective ways should be sought on how to feasibly expand access to SUD treatment for all South Africans and enhance the country's preparedness for future health emergencies.","Harker, Johnson, Erasmus, Myers","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-022-00446-6","20220304","COVID-19; South Africa; Substance use disorders; Treatment utilisation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27974,""
"Virtual Technology's Critical Role in Sustaining Coordinated Specialty Care in Texas During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This report examined challenges and adaptations to sustaining multidisciplinary team-based coordinated specialty care (CSC) for early-onset psychosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. In June 2020, team leaders from 23 Texas CSC sites participated in semistructured phone interviews about CSC implementation barriers and adaptations. Transcripts were analyzed with thematic analysis. CSC implementation barriers included difficulty delivering critical CSC components (i.e., community education and vocational exploration) and client recruitment limitations. Virtual technology integration (i.e., texting and videoconferencing) largely sustained CSC outreach, service delivery, and client engagement. However, sites faced virtual competency and accessibility issues, exhaustion from virtual technology use, lack of structural support, and unanticipated disengagement. The surveyed sites rapidly integrated virtual technology into CSC delivery. This integration promoted CSC engagement during the pandemic, especially in rural areas, and increased insight into what resources and policies are needed to sustain virtual technology use among community mental health providers.","McCormick, Sevillano, Klodnick, Lopez, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100429","20220304","Adolescents; COVID-19 pandemic; Coordinated specialty care; First episode psychosis; Service delivery systems; Virtual technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-05","",27975,""
