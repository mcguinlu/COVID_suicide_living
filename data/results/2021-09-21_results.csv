"Protocol: A two-wave cross-sectional study in England investigating suicidal behaviour and self-harm amongst healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction There have been longstanding concerns regarding an increased risk of suicide amongst healthcare workers. The Covid-19 pandemic has placed an additional burden on staff, yet few studies have investigated the impact of the pandemic on their risk of suicide and self-harm. We aimed to investigate the cumulative incidence, prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury amongst healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods and Analysis NHS Check is an online survey that was distributed to all staff (clinical and non-clinical), students, and volunteers in 18 NHS Trusts across England during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data collected in wave 1 (collected between April 2020 and January 2021) and wave 2 (collected 6-month after wave 1) will be analysed. The full cohort of wave 1 participants will be weighted to represent the age, sex, ethnicity, and roles profile of the workforce at each Trust, and the weighted prevalence and cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury will be described. Two-level random effects logistic regression models will be used to investigate the relationship between suicidal behaviour and self-harm, and demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity) and workplace factors (concerns regarding access to personal protective equipment, re-deployment status, moral injury, confidence around raising and the management of safety concerns, support by supervisors or managers, satisfaction with standard of care provided). Results will be stratified by role (clinical/non-clinical).","Prianka Padmanathan; Danielle Lamb; Hannah Scott; Simon Wessely; Paul Moran","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.16.21263255","20210921","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18098,""
"Correlates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and refusal among employees of a safety net California county health system with an early and aggressive vaccination program: Results from a cross-sectional survey","Information on vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers is needed as health professionals provide front line care to COVID-19 patients. We developed and implemented an anonymous internet-based cross-sectional survey with direct solicitation among employees of a safety net health system. Items queried demographic and health-related characteristics, experience with and knowledge of COVID-19, and determinants of decisions to vaccinate. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance groups (acceptors, hesitant, refusers) were defined; an adapted version of the WHO vaccine hesitancy scale was included. The survey demonstrated good reliability (Cronbachs alpha = 0.92 for vaccine hesitancy scale; 0.93 for determinants). General linear and logistic regression methods examined factors which were univariately associated with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine acceptance, respectively. Multivariable models were constructed with stepwise model-building procedures. Race/ethnicity, marital status, job classification, immunocompromised status, flu vaccination and childhood vaccination opinions independently predicted hesitancy scale scores. Gender, education, job classification and BMI independently predicted acceptance, hesitancy and refusal groups. Among hesitant employees, uncertainty was reflected in reports of motivating factors influencing their indecision. Despite a strong employee-support environment and job protection, respondents reported physical and mental health effects. Appreciation of varied reasons for refusing vaccination should lead to culturally sensitive interventions to increase vaccination rates in healthcare workers.","Nicole M.

"[Which Digital Services do Psychosomatic Rehabilitation Patients Use During the Corona Pandemic and do Interrelations with Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Exist?]","The COVID-19 pandemic requires numerous measures to protect against infection, such as contact reduction and adherence to hygiene and social distancing rules. The former leads to mental disorders (possibly requiring treatment) due to social isolation, the latter require adaptation in the implementation of medical therapies. With overall limited therapy capacities, the use of digital (health) applications can be of particular importance in the therapy of chronic and psychological diseases in particular. The present study investigates which health apps are being used by people with mental health problems. 1,060 insured persons in preparation for psychosomatic rehabilitation measures were surveyed by means of an online questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, frequency analyses, and analyses of variance with post-hoc tests and correlation analyses were used for evaluation. Participants used on average three apps; the most common topics were ""nutrition"" (n=313), ""self-diagnosis"" (n=244) and ""relaxation"" (n=234). Female participants were more likely to use apps than male participants, and younger participants were more likely to use apps than older participants. Symptoms of anxiety were correlated to the use of digital applications, especially concerning heart rate and blood pressure monitoring, while depressive symptoms were not associated with a more frequent use of apps. Digital apps are being frequently used by people with mental health problems. Increasing acceptance of digital (health) apps has significant potential in the treatment of chronic mental illness in particular. The focus should be on individual applications with integration into the regular care process. Increasing digitalization, also in the healthcare sector, can be used to ensure care, especially in times of contact restrictions and limited human resources. Die Corona-Pandemie erfordert zum Infektionsschutz zahlreiche MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen wie Kontaktreduktion und Einhalten von Hygiene- und Abstandsregeln. Ersteres kann durch eine soziale Isolation zu (mÃƒÂ¶glicherweise behandlungsbedÃƒÂ¼rftigen) psychischen StÃƒÂ¶rungen fÃƒÂ¼hren, letztere erfordern Anpassungen in der DurchfÃƒÂ¼hrung medizinischer Therapien. Bei insgesamt begrenzten TherapiekapazitÃƒÂ¤ten kann der Nutzung digitaler (Gesundheits-) Anwendungen in der Therapie insbesondere chronischer psychischer Erkrankungen eine besondere Bedeutung zukommen. Die vorliegende Studie hat daher als Ziel, zu untersuchen, welche Gesundheits-Apps von psychisch vorerkrankten Menschen genutzt werden. Es wurden 1.060 Versicherte in Vorbereitung auf eine psychosomatische RehabilitationsmaÃƒÅ¸nahme mittels eines Online-Fragebogens befragt. Die Auswertung erfolgte mit deskriptiven Analysen, Frequenzanalysen und Varianzanalysen mit Post-hoc Tests sowie Korrelationsanalysen. Die Teilnehmenden nutzten im Durchschnitt drei Apps; die hÃƒÂ¤ufigsten Themen waren Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ErnÃƒÂ¤hrungÃ¢â‚¬Å“ (n=313), Ã¢â‚¬Å¾SelbstdiagnoseÃ¢â‚¬Å“ (n=244) und Ã¢â‚¬Å¾EntspannungÃ¢â‚¬Å“ (n=234). Weibliche Teilnehmende nutzten Apps hÃƒÂ¤ufiger als mÃƒÂ¤nnliche und jÃƒÂ¼ngere Teilnehmende hÃƒÂ¤ufiger als ÃƒÂ¤ltere. Eine Angstsymptomatik hing mit der Nutzung von Apps zusammen, insbesondere zu Herzfrequenz/Blutdruck; wÃƒÂ¤hrend eine depressive Symptomatik nicht mit der Nutzung digitaler Anwendungen korrelierte. Einige Gesundheits-Apps werden hÃƒÂ¤ufig durch psychisch vorerkrankte Menschen genutzt. Eine zunehmende Akzeptanz von digitalen (Gesundheits-)Anwendungen bietet erhebliches Potenzial in der Behandlung insbesondere psychisch erkrankter Menschen. Der Fokus sollte auf individuellen Anwendungen mit Einbindung in den regulÃƒÂ¤ren Versorgungsprozess liegen. Die zunehmende Digitalisierung auch im Gesundheitswesen kann dazu genutzt werden, die Versorgung gerade in Zeiten der KontaktbeschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen und begrenzter personeller Ressourcen sicherzustellen.","Dahmen, Keller, Derksen, KÃƒÂ¶tting, Lippke","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1503-5548","20210920","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18100,""
"Prospective effects of loneliness on frequency of alcohol and marijuana use","Loneliness is a widespread problem, with demonstrated negative health effects. However, prospective data on the relationship between loneliness and problematic substance use are lacking, and few studies have examined specific commonplace substances, such as alcohol and cannabis. This study used prospective data from a community sample of US adults with problematic alcohol or cannabis use to examine whether loneliness was a predictor of subsequent increased substance use. Participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 210) were recruited between 05/2016-06/2019 from a New York City medical center. At baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups, participants completed identical computerized questionnaires. We used generalized estimating equations to assess the average effect of past 2-week loneliness on subsequent number of days of alcohol or cannabis use, controlling for baseline days of use, demographic characteristics, and past 2-week DSM-5 depression. Compared with individuals who were never lonely, participants with moderate or severe loneliness had a significantly higher frequency of alcohol or cannabis use at the subsequent assessment (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.25 95% CI: 0.08-0.42). Individuals experiencing loneliness at least a few times in the past 2Ã‚Â weeks reported more days of subsequent alcohol or cannabis use compared with individuals who were not lonely. This is cause for concern, as national surveys of US adults indicate increasing rates of loneliness, depression and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest the need for health care providers to screen for feelings of loneliness and potentially harmful coping behaviors such as substance use, and to offer healthier alternative coping strategies.","Gutkind, Gorfinkel, Hasin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107115","20210920","Alcohol; Loneliness; Marijuana","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18101,""

"Advancing insights on ÃŽÂ² -cyclodextrin inclusion complexes with SSRIs through lens of X-ray diffraction and DFT calculation","Depression-the global crisis hastened by the coronavirus outbreak, can be efficaciously treated by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexation is a method of choice for reducing side effects and improving bioavailability of drugs. Here, we investigate in-depth the ÃŽÂ² -CD encapsulation of sertraline (STL) HCl (1) and fluoxetine (FXT) HCl (2) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT complete-geometry optimization, in comparison to the reported complex of paroxetine (PXT) base. X-ray analysis unveiled the 2:2 ÃŽÂ² -CD-STL/FXT complexes with two drug molecules inserting their halogen-containing aromatic ring in the ÃŽÂ² -CD dimeric cavity, which are stabilized by the interplay of intermolecular O2-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯N1-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯O3 H-bonds, C3/C5-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯ Ãâ‚¬ and halogenÃ¢â€¹Â¯halogen interactions. Similarly, the 1:1 ÃŽÂ² -CD-tricyclic-antidepressant (TCA) complexes have an exclusive inclusion mode of the aromatic ring, which is maintained by C3/C5-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯ Ãâ‚¬ interactions. By contrast, the 2:1 ÃŽÂ² -CD-PXT complex has a total inclusion that is stabilized by host-guest O6-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯N1-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯O5 H-bonds and C3-HÃ¢â€¹Â¯ Ãâ‚¬ interactions. The inherent stabilization energies of 1 and 2 evaluated using DFT calculation suggested that the improved thermodynamic stabilities via CD encapsulation facilitates the reduction of drug side effects.

"An outbreak of appreciation: A discursive analysis of tweets of gratitude expressed to the National Health Service at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic","The early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prompted unprecedented displays of gratitude to healthcare workers. In the United Kingdom, gratitude was a hotly debated topic in public discourse, catalysing compelling displays of civic togetherness but also attracting criticism for being an unhelpful distraction that authorized unrealistic expectations of healthcare workers. Expressions of thanks tend to be neglected as drivers of transformation, and yet, they are important indicators of qualities to which people attach significance. This study aimed to use discursive analysis to explore how the National Health Service (NHS) was constructed in attention-attracting tweets that expressed and/or discussed gratitude to the NHS. Having determined that Twitter was the most active site for traffic relating to gratitude and the NHS, we established a corpus of 834 most-liked tweets, purposively sampled from Twitter searches on a day-by-day basis over the period of the first lockdown in the United Kingdom (22 March-28 May 2020). We developed a typology for tweets engaging with gratitude as well as analysing what the NHS was thanked for. Our analysis, informed by a discursive psychology approach, found that the meanings attributed to gratitude were highly mobile and there were distinct patterns of activity. The NHS was predominantly-and sometimes idealistically-thanked for working, effort, saving and caring. Displays of gratitude were seen as incommensurable with failures of responsibility. The clap-for-carers campaign was a potent driver of affect, especially in the early parts of the lockdown. The social value of gratitude is implicated in the re-evaluation of the risks and rewards of healthcare and social care work in the wake of the pandemic. We caution against cynicism about gratitude overshadowing the well-being effects that expressing and receiving gratitude can engender, particularly given concerns over the detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental health. This study involves the analysis of data provided by the public and published on social media.","Day, Robert, Leedham-Green, Rafferty","https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13359","20210920","COVID-19; NHS; Twitter; discursive psychology; gratitude","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18104,""
"Associations between older African academics' physical activity, walkability and mental health: a social distancing perspective","This study aimed to assess the moderating influence of neighborhood walkability on the association between physical activity (PA) and mental health among older African academics aged 50 years or more in cities with social distancing protocols in response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 905 volunteer academics participated in the study. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was employed to conduct sensitivity analyses and test the study hypotheses. After controlling for sex, education and age, there was a positive association between PA and mental health. Neighborhood walkability moderated the relationship between PA and mental health, which suggests that during the pandemic PA was associated with higher mental health scores in more walkable neighborhoods. The study concludes that PA was beneficial to mental health in the social distancing context and was associated with higher mental health in more walkable neighborhoods, particularly in a social distancing context.","Asiamah, Vieira, Kouveliotis, Gasana, Awuviry-Newton, Eduafo","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab093","20210920","Africa; academics; mental health; neighborhood walkability; physical activity; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18105,""
"StayWell at Home: A Text Messaging Intervention to Counteract Depression and Anxiety during COVID-19 Social Distancing","Social distancing and stay-at-home orders are critical interventions to slow down person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. While these societal changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19 related depression and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United States. This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants' anxiety and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text messages. We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used two-tailed paired t-tests to detect the change in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later. The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were statistically significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an average reduction of -1.72 (95% CI: -2.35, -1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and -0.48 (95% CI: -0.71, -0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 scores and GAD-2, respectively. StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during the 60-day intervention period. Text messaging interventions could serve as an important public health tool for disseminating strategies to manage mental health. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04473599.

"Home-Based Telemental Health: A Proposed Privacy and Safety Protocol and Tool","<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> To describe the development of a protocol and practical tool for the safe delivery of telemental health (TMH) services to the home. The COVID-19 pandemic forced providers to rapidly transition their outpatient practices to home-based TMH (HB-TMH) without existing protocols or tools to guide them. This experience underscored the need for a standardized privacy and safety tool as HB-TMH is expected to continue as a resource during future crises as well as to become a component of the routine mental health care landscape. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The authors represent a subset of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Telemental Health Consortium. They met weekly through videoconferencing to review published safety standards of care, existing TMH guidelines for clinic-based and home-based services, and their own institutional protocols. They agreed on three domains foundational to the delivery of HB-TMH: environmental safety, clinical safety, and disposition planning. Through multiple iterations, they agreed upon a final Privacy and Safety Protocol for HB-TMH. The protocol was then operationalized into the Privacy and Safety Assessment Tool (PSA Tool) based on two keystone medical safety constructs: the World Health Organization (WHO) <i>Surgical Safety Checklist/Time-Out</i> and the <i>Checklist Manifesto.</i> <b><i>Results:</i></b> The PSA Tool comprised four modules: (1) <i>Screening for Safety for HB-TMH</i>; (2) <i>Assessment for Safety During the HB-TMH Initial Visit</i>; (3) <i>End of the Initial Visit and Disposition Planning;</i> and (4) the <i>TMH Time-Out and Reassessment</i> during subsequent visits. A sample workflow guides implementation. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The Privacy and Safety Protocol and PSA Tool aim to prepare providers for the private and safe delivery of HB-TMH. Its modular format can be adapted to each site's resources. Going forward, the PSA Tool should help to facilitate the integration of HB-TMH into the routine mental health care landscape.","Sharma, Feuer, Stuart, Folk, Doan, Kulkarni, Ramtekkar, Fortuna, Myers","https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2021.0020","20210920","child and adolescent; patient safety; service delivery; telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18107,""

"Evaluating Well-being of Individuals With Chronic Visual Conditions Requiring Regular Eyecare During COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study","To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its predictors among individuals with chronic vision conditions during COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional, survey-based study targeted Jordanian adults with a variety of chronic vision conditions requiring regular ophthalmic follow-up. Outcome measures included HRQoL measured by the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), mental health symptoms measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and vision ability measured by the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ-25) General Vision and Role Limitation subscales. Data were analyzed descriptively and using a multiple variable linear regression model to identify HRQoL predictors. A total of 203 participants with a mean age of 52.09 (Ã‚Â±15.41) years participated, and SF-12 mean scores were 58.15 for the physical component and 57.48 for the mental component. The level of HRQoL was significantly associated with VFQ-25 Role Limitation subscale, diabetes, the need of ophthalmic follow-up, and stress. The regression model explained 47.1% of the variance in HRQoL (r2=0.471, F=35.57, P&lt;0.001). Jordanian individuals with chronic vision conditions demonstrated low levels of HRQoL during COVID-19 lockdown. Participants also showed high levels of mental health symptoms and reported low accessibility to ophthalmic care.

"COVID-19 and Transgender and Gender Expansive Children and Youth","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has put strains on transgender and gender expansive (TGE) children and youth, with increased rates of anxiety and depression, lower access to medical and mental health services, and greater exposure to unaccepting home environments. At the same time, for some of these young people, particularly those with supportive living situations, sheltering in place and online schooling has afforded them the opportunity to freely explore and consolidate their gender, protected from the strains of socially induced anxieties, and anticipated or experienced negative, hostile messages from their surrounding environment (ie, school or public meeting places). Culling from emerging data on the psychosocial effects of the pandemic on TGE children and youth, an argument is made for an understanding of these young people's experiences as both stress-inducing and resilience-building, each existing in dialectic tension with the other.

"Associations Between Mental Health and Job Loss among Middle- and Low-Income Veterans and Civilians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Study","This study examined the relationship between job loss and mental health during the pandemic among a nationally representative sample of middle- and low-income military veterans and civilians. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk in May to June 2020. Our sample was comparable to the U.S. population with respect to key demographics (i.e., sex, race, ethnicity, and geographic region). More veterans were male (36.9% civilians vs. 74.1% veterans), and on average they were older than civilians (M<sub>civilians</sub> =47.86 vs. M<sub>veterans</sub> =52.64). After controlling for sociodemographic factors, probable anxiety (adjusted odds ratio for veterans (AORv)=1.96, 95%[1.22-3.15]) was significantly associated with job loss among veterans, whereas among civilians, probable anxiety (adjusted odds ratio for civilians (AORc) =1.48, 95%[1.21-1.81]), probable COVID-19 era-related stress (AORc = 1.73, 95% [1.45 - 2.07]), and loneliness (AORc=1.09, 95%[1.04-1.13]) were associated with job loss. Results demonstrated that veteran sample's effect sizes were larger than civilian sample's effect sizes; however, our moderation analyses results revealed that veteran status did not moderate the relationships between mental health and job loss. The findings in this study support a relationship between job loss and poorer mental health, suggesting that increased mental health services may be important to address ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are reports of excessive use of steroids, both in terms of use in patients who do not require the same and use in doses higher than the recommended. There are reports of the emergence of different adverse outcomes of excessive steroid use in the form of diabetes mellitus and a higher incidence of mucormycosis. However, little attention has been paid to the mental health impact of the use of steroids. This review attempts to evaluate the existing data in terms of incidence of psychiatric side effects of steroids, and the risk factors for steroid associated psychiatric manifestations. Additionally, an attempt is made to discuss the pathogenesis of steroid-associated psychiatric side effects and why it is likely that the incidence of psychiatric side effects may be more in patients with COVID-19 infection. There is a need to improve the awareness about the psychiatric side effects of steroids, both among the physicians and mental health professionals, as in any patient presenting with new-onset psychiatric symptoms while having COVID-19 infection or during the post-COVID-19 infection phase, a possibility of steroid associated side effect needs to be considered.","Grover, Sahoo, Rijal, Mehra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100345","20210920","COVID-19; Delirium; Depression; Insomnia; Mania; Psychiatric side effects; Psychosis; Steroids","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18112,""
"Follow-Ups on Persistent Symptoms and Pulmonary Function Among Post-Acute COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<b>Objective:</b> As the number of recovering COVID-19 patients increases worldwide, the persistence of symptoms and signs through the post-acute phase indicates an urgent need for prolonged follow-up care. To explore existing data about post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, this meta-analysis assesses the prevalence of persistent manifestations in multiple systems and abnormalities in lung function, as well as their related risks in patients with various severities. <b>Methods:</b> Articles about discharged COVID-19 patients (published from January 1, 2020 to February 23, 2021) were obtained by searching four databases. Cohort studies with follow-up periods &gt;1 month post-discharge or &gt;2 months post-admission were included. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4,478 COVID-19 patients from 16 cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. Fatigue or weakness (47%) were the most prevalent physical effects of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, while psychosocial (28%) symptoms were the most common manifestations among several systems. Abnormalities in lung function of recovering patients, i.e., DLCO &lt;80% (47%, 95% CI: 32-61%) persisted for long periods. Severe patients were more likely to present joint pain (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11-3.04) and decreased lung functions compared with non-severe patients, with pooled ORs for abnormal TLC, FEV1, FVC, and DLCO of 3.05 (95% CI: 1.88-4.96), 2.72 (95% CI: 1.31-5.63), 2.52 (95% CI: 1.28-4.98), and 1.82 (95% CI: 1.32-2.50), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our research indicates that patients recovering from COVID-19 manifest long-term, multi-system symptoms, and the adverse effects on psychosocial health and lung functions were the most extensive and persistent. These findings together may facilitate much needed in-depth study of clinical treatments for long-term, post-acute phase symptoms that affect a great number of recovering COVID-19 patients.","Long, Li, Hu, Bai, Zheng, Gao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.702635","20210920","SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology; meta-analysis; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; post-discharge","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18113,""
"Differences in Stress and Anxiety Among Women With and Without Children in the Household During the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns have had a disproportionate impact on parents of children under 18, particularly women. Mandatory school closures and loss of childcare resulted in parents balancing work, teaching, and childcare needs. A number of studies have examined changes in mental health of parents, but to date no studies have compared the differences in stress and anxiety levels between women with and without children in the United States. Adult women from the Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR) (<i>N</i> = 1,014, pair <i>N</i> = 529) and mothers of twin children enrolled in the WSTR (<i>N</i> = 147) completed an online survey examining several health-related behaviors and outcomes and their self-reported changes due to COVID-19. We conducted two studies to examine the impact of children on stress and anxiety levels among women. In study 1, we assessed whether women living in households with children under the age of 18 have higher levels of stress and anxiety than those without children in their household. We found that perceived stress levels did not differ between women with and without children in the household, but anxiety levels were higher among women living with children than those without. In study 2, we assessed whether the correlation between children in the household and stress/anxiety is accounted for by non-random genetic and environmental selection effects, causal processes, or both using a sample of adult female twins. We found that the presence of children in the household was associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety. However, this association is confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. Our findings highlight the need to provide supporting resources to women living with children in the household during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Avery, Tsang, Seto, Duncan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.688462","20210920","COVID-19; anxiety; mothers; perceived stress; twins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18114,""
"Use and self-perceived effects of social media before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-national study","To (i) examine the use of social media before and after the COVID-19 outbreak; (ii) examine the self-perceived impact of social media before and after the outbreak; and (iii) examine whether the self-perceived impacts of social media after the outbreak varied by levels of mental health. A cross-national online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia. Participants (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3810) reported which social media they used, how frequently they used them before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and the degree to which they felt social media contributed to a range of outcomes. The participants also completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. The data were analyzed by chi-square tests and multiple linear regression analysis. Social media were used more frequently after the pandemic outbreak than compared to before the outbreak. Self-perceived effects from using social media increased after the COVID-19 outbreak, and in particular stress and concern for own and others' health. Emotional distress was associated with being more affected from using social media, in particular in terms of stress and concern for own or others' health. The use of social media has increased during the coronavirus outbreak, as well as its impacts on people. In particular, the participants reported more stress and health concerns attributed to social media use after the COVID-19 outbreak. People with poor mental health appear to be particularly vulnerable to experiencing more stress and concern related to their use of social media.","Thygesen, Bonsaksen, Schoultz, Ruffolo, Leung, Price, Geirdal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12553-021-00595-x","20210920","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Cross-national study; Emotional distress; Mental health; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18115,""
"Emerging Needs and Viability of Telepsychiatry During and Post COVID-19 Era: A Literature Review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in nationwide stay-at-home orders in an effort to slow the spread severely impacting the healthcare sector. Telepsychiatry provides aÃ‚Â platform bridging the gap through advanced technologies connecting mental health providers and patients who need their services, overcoming previous barriers of great distances, lack of transportation, and even time constraints. The most obvious benefit is increased accessibility to mental healthcare, especially in underserved and remote areas where there is no easy access for in-person care. It is important to note that benefits are not limited to patients, but also allow clinicians greater flexibility in scheduling and reduced practice overhead costs, both of which aid with physician burnout and burden. Telepsychiatry during COVID-19 provides its own unique advantages over in-person visits. The risk of exposure to healthcare workers and patients receiving care is reduced, allowing immunocompromised patients to receive much-needed psychiatric care. Without the need to meet in person, self-isolating psychiatrists can still provide care, decreasing strain on their co-workers. Although telepsychiatry is relatively new, it has already exhibited considerable success in its effectiveness at treating psychiatric conditions and widespread corollary benefits. Telepsychiatric consults may be carried out synchronously and asynchronously, each having benefits and setbacks. Different mobile application interventions have been explored, which are available for the purpose of both monitoring/assessing patients and/or providing treatment. The scope of conditions these applications address is broad, from anxiety disorders to schizophrenia to depression. As promising and beneficial telepsychiatry may seem, it is necessary to recognize that building the program can be challenging. It involves adapting to new methods in medicine. We highlighted barriers to general telepsychiatry, the most prominent being technological literacy of both physician and patient, and possible negative effects of eliminating the in-person patient-doctor interaction.","Gude, Subhedar, Zhang, Jain, Bhela, Bangash, Veluri, Hsieh, Sheikh, Shah, Mansuri, Aedma, Patel, Parikh","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16974","20210920","communication; covid 19; technology; tele mental health; tele psychiatry; viability of telepsychiatry; virtual clinics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18116,""
"Improving lifestyle obesity treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: New challenges for weight management","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to daily life and many health-related behaviors. The objective of this study was to examine how the stay-at-home/safer-at-home mandates issued in Colorado (March 2020-May 2020) impacted lifestyle behaviors and mental health among individuals with overweight or obesity participating in two separate behavioral weight loss trials (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 82). Questionnaires were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data on challenges to weight loss presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes in dietary intake, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and mental health during the stay-at-home/safer-at-home mandates. Using a convergent mixed method approach integrating qualitative and quantitative data, the greatest challenge experienced by participants was increased stress and anxiety, which led to more unhealthy behaviors. The majority perceived it to be harder to adhere to the prescribed diet (81%) and recommended physical activity (68%); however, self-reported exercise on weekdays increased significantly and 92% of participants lost weight or maintained weight within Ã‚Â±1% 5-6 weeks following the stay-at-home mandate. Study results suggest that obesity treatment programs should considerÃ‚Â and attempt to address the burden of stress and anxiety stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and other sources due to the negative effects they can have on weight management and associated behaviors.","Caldwell, Thomas, Rynders, Holliman, Perreira, Ostendorf, Catenacci","https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.540","20210920","Anxiety; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; behavioral obesity treatment; home environment; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18117,""
"Performance evaluation of wastewater treatment plants under the sewage variations imposed by COVID-19 spread prevention actions","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread prevention actions (SPAs) have affected a large number of human activities globally in 2020-2021. Temporary lockdowns, stay-at-home policies, movement restrictions, and personal health care actions have relatively changed the daily life routine in urban areas which can eventually affect the characteristics of municipal wastewater (MW). This study evaluates the performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) during COVID-19 pandemic and related SPAs. This evaluation also considers MW variations in quality and quantity andÃ‚Â compares the performance of WWTPsÃ‚Â (2020) with earlier data (2015-2019). For this purpose, 23 WWTPs located in Isfahan province, Iran, were chosen as the study area and classified based on their locations, biological treatment unit, and capacities. Results indicate that the inflow of WWTPsÃ‚Â increasedÃ‚Â 20Ã¢â‚¬â€°% on averageÃ‚Â during SPAs, while the concentrations of COD and BOD in MWÃ‚Â decreased 23 and 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, respectively. Nevertheless, the performance of WWTPs remained rather constant. It is concluded that increasing the dilute domestic proportion of MW, particularly in smaller communities, as a matter of COVID-19 SPAs could not impose adverse impacts on wastewater treatment operations and pollution removal. Different types of secondary treatment units, such as activated sludge, stabilization pond, and aerated lagoon showed stable performances.Ã‚Â However, disinfection was enhancedÃ‚Â in WWTPsÃ‚Â in order to reduce the probability of viral transmission via wastewater forÃ‚Â reuse. This study also recommends that the characteristics of MW, and not treated wastewater, can be used as anÃ‚Â indicator for coordinating SPAsÃ‚Â in similar epidemics. This notification can be helpful for the management of WWTPs and risk control in urban areas.","Yazdian, Jamshidi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40201-021-00717-7","20210920","Coronavirus; Pandemic; Pollution assessment; Wastewater treatment; Water consumption","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18118,""
"Development of a framework for the implementation of electronic interventions in mental health: a protocol for a meta-synthesis of systematic reviews","<b>Background:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been necessary to incorporate technologies in the care of mental health problems. But there have been difficulties in the application of technology-based interventions in mental health. Some quantitative systematic reviews don't allow us to fully identify and properly describe this subject. In order to answer the question ""how do electronic interventions apply in mental health and what makes the application of any of these interventions work"", this study will carry out an overview of systematic reviews, which will make it possible to develop a theoretical framework on the implementation of electronic care in mental health problems. <b>Methods:</b> We will search MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases from 1st January 2015 to September 2020, with no language restriction. We will follow a qualitative method approach and include systematic reviews that assess primary studies relating to adults with common mental health problems using any type of mobile mental health intervention that includes a synchronic component and communication with a mental health professional. For the analysis, we will make a meta-synthesis of the systematic reviews, using an emergent grounded theory approach to synthesize the information, prioritizing the systematic reviews with the lowest risk of bias in the AMSTAR-2 tool. The meta-synthesis will be based on interpreting, integrating, and inferring the evaluation elements to understand better the e-health implementation process for patients with mental health problems. Finally, we will present the overall assessment in a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results will allow a better understanding of the facilitator and limitations in implementing e-health interventions for mental health problems.","Villarreal-Zegarra, Alarcon-Ruiz, Melendez-Torres, Torres-Puente, Ambrosio-Melgarejo, Romero-Cabrera, Lindo-Cavero, Huarcaya-Victoria","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27150.1","20210920","Internet-Based Intervention; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Online Systems; Qualitative Research; Remote Consultation; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18119,""
"Mental health indicators in the later phase of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in healthy youth combined elderly people: a web-based cross-sectional survey","Lockdown was implemented throughout the world in March 2020 to control the spread of covid-19 infection. It affected the mental health of people in various ways. This web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the general population of India with an aim to evaluate the mental health of the healthy individuals in the later stage of the lockdown period. Data on socio-demographic factors, anxiety, depression (HADS scale), perceived stress (PSS scale), insomnia (insomnia severity index), subjective psychological feeling of well-being (WHO-5 well-being Index), and attitude towards covid-19 (7-point Likert scale) was collected. Univariate regression analysis and Karl Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the correlation of mental health abnormalities with socio-demographic factors. 119 subjects of mean age of 36.03 Ã‚Â± 18.04 years took part in the study. Their average number of days of stay at home during the lockdown and the average number of days of the lifestyle changes was 49.07 Ã‚Â± 31.92 and 61.39 Ã‚Â± 20.03 days, respectively. Depression, anxiety, stress, and clinical insomnia due to covid-19 were reported in 13.45%, 10.92%, 14.29%, and 11.76% subjects, respectively. There was a significant correlation of depression, anxiety, stress, and WHO-5 well-being score with age, socio-economic status, and the average number of days of the change in lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic (P &lt; 0.05).

"The Persistence of Slowed Time Experience During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Two Longitudinal Studies in France","The home confinement imposed on people to fight the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the flow of time by disrupting daily life, making them feel that time was passing slowly. The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the evolution over time of this subjective experience of time and its significant predictors (boredom, decreased happiness, life rhythm, and sleep quality). Twso samples of French participants were followed up: the first for several weeks during the first lockdown (April 2020) and then 1year later (April 2021; Study 1), and the second during the first lockdown (April 2020) and then 6months (November 2020) and 1year later (April 2021; Study 2). Our study shows that the French participants have the feeling that time has passed slowly since the beginning of the first lockdown and that it has not resumed its normal course. This is explained by a persistent feeling of boredom characteristic of a depressive state that has taken hold in the population. The findings therefore suggest that the repeated contexts of confinement did not contribute to re-establishing a normal perception of time, to which a subjective acceleration of time would have testified.","Droit-Volet, Martinelli, ChevalÃƒÂ¨re, Belletier, Dezecache, Gil, Huguet","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.721716","20210920","COVID-19; boredom; emotion; lockdown; longitudinal studies; rhythm of life; sleep; time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18123,""

Healthcare workers have a high risk of suffering a mental disorder after the first wave. In this way, psychologists, who deal with mental health issues and are considered as healthcare workers in many countries, are of interest in this context. The present study aimed to examine anxiety, depression, stress, and obsessions and compulsions across psychologists, healthcare professionals, and the general community. These variables were measured through the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), as well as the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), which are related to different sociodemographic variables. The study was carried out after the first wave in Spain through an online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling and a multigroup analysis were carried out across the groups and variables under study. The results suggested that; (i) healthcare workers and general community depicted similar results in anxiety and stress, as well as obsessions; (ii) the group of psychologists depicted better scores than the other groups under study; (iii) stress and anxiety did not predict compulsions in the group of psychologists; (iv) anxiety predicted obsessions for all the professions, while the relationship of this variable with stress was different for each group; and (v) invariance reached a full metric level.","Reno-Chanca, Van Hoey, Santolaya-Prego de Oliver, Blasko-Ochoa, Sanfeliu Aguilar, Moret-Tatay","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644212","20210920","COVID-19; OCD; distress; health care workers; mental health; psychologist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18125,""
"Mental Health in Affectionate, Antagonistic, and Ambivalent Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Latent Profile Analysis","The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents an acute stressor affecting mental health.

Adult Croatian citizens engaged in intimate relationships (<i>N</i> = 727) reported their relationship characteristics and assessed symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the state lockdown in May 2020. Three relationship profiles based on variations in key relationship characteristics were identified using latent profile analysis. Profiles represented distinct relationship types described as affectionate, ambivalent, and antagonistic relationships. These relationship types differed in their levels of love and perception of humility, responsiveness, and behavior of the partner. Relationship type was associated with mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and state lockdown. Being in an affectionate relationship was associated with the lowest levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, while in an antagonistic relationship these are in the highest levels. Ambivalent relationships were characterized by moderate levels on all measured mental health indicators with no difference in anxiety compared with affectionate relationships. The results emphasized the link between relationship functioning and successful coping with mental health hazards such as the fear of disease or restrictive measures put in place to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","MehuliÃ„â€¡, Kamenov","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631615","20210920","COVID-19 pandemic; adult Croatian citizens; anxiety; depression; dyadic coping; intimate relationships types; latent profile analysis; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18126,""

Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for oxygen and C-reactive protein. <b>Results:</b> One hundred patients (34% women, median age: 60 years [interquartile range: 49-72)] completed the neuropsychological assessment at follow-up. In multivariable analyses, cognitive complaints at 1-month were associated with greater HADS score (OR for one interquartile range: OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.08-3.57) and older age (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09) and, negatively, with admission in ICU (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.90). In contrast, none of the objective neuropsychological test scores was significantly associated with cognitive complaints. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive complaints were associated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms. <b>Discussion:</b> These preliminary results suggest that cognitive complaints at 1 month after a hospitalization for COVID-19 are associated with psychological distress, independently of objective neuropsychological status. Anxiety and depression symptoms should be systematically screened in patients presenting with cognitive complaints after a severe COVID-19 episode.","Gouraud, Bottemanne, Lahlou-LaforÃƒÂªt, Blanchard, GÃƒÂ¼nther, Batti, Auclin, Limosin, Hulot, Lebeaux, Lemogne","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.725861","20210920","COVID-19; anxiety; attention; comorbidity; concentration; depression; long COVID; psychiatric disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18127,""
"Depression and Anxiety in Mothers Who Were Pregnant During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Northern Italy: The Role of Pandemic-Related Emotional Stress and Perceived Social Support","The COVID-19 pandemic is a collective trauma that is threatening citizens' mental health resulting in increased emotional stress, reduced social support, and heightened risk for affective symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of antenatal pandemic-related emotional stress and perceived social support on the symptoms of depression and anxiety of mothers who were pregnant during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy. A sample of 281 mothers was enrolled at eight maternity units in the first hotspot region of the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy. Participants filled out online questionnaires assessing the direct or indirect exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, pandemic-related stress, perceived social support, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. Depressive and anxious symptomatology was above clinical concern, respectively, in 26 and 32% of the respondents. Mothers who reported no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and those who reported at least one direct or indirect exposure did not differ in terms of affective symptoms. Continuous scores and risk for severe depression and anxiety were positively associated with prenatal pandemic-related emotional stress and negatively linked with perceived social support during pregnancy. Women who become mothers during the COVID-19 emergency may be at high risk for affective problems. Dedicated preventive programs are needed to provide adequate preventive support and care for maternal mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grumi, Provenzi, Accorsi, Biasucci, Cavallini, Decembrino, Falcone, Fazzi, Gardella, Giacchero, Guerini, Grossi, Magnani, Mariani, Nacinovich, Pantaleo, Pisoni, Prefumo, Sabatini, Scelsa, SpartÃƒÂ , Spinillo, Giorda, Orcesi, Borgatti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.716488","20210920","COVID- 19; anxiety; depression; mothers; pandemic; pregnancy; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18128,""
"Mental Health and Wellbeing of 9-12-year-old Children in Northern Canada Before the COVID-19 Pandemic and After the First Lockdown","<b>Objectives:</b> Children's mental health and wellbeing declined during the first COVID-19 lockdown (Spring 2020), particularly among those from disadvantaged settings. We compared mental health and wellbeing of school-aged children observed pre-pandemic in 2018 and after the first lockdown was lifted and schools reopened in Fall 2020. <b>Methods:</b> In 2018, we surveyed 476 grade 4-6 students (9-12Ã‚Â years old) from 11 schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in Northern Canada that participate in a school-based health promotion program targeting healthy lifestyle behaviours and mental wellbeing. In November-December 2020, we surveyed 467 grade 4-6 students in the same schools. The 12 questions in the mental health and wellbeing domain were grouped based on correlation and examined using multivariable logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> There were no notable changes pre-pandemic vs. post-lockdown in responses to each of the 12 questions or any of the sub-groupings. <b>Conclusion:</b> Supporting schools to implement health promotion programs may help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on children's mental health and wellbeing. The findings align with recent calls for schools to remain open as long as possible during the pandemic response.","Dabravolskaj, Khan, Veugelers, Maximova","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2021.1604219","20210920","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€œ19; children; health promotion; internalizing problems; mental health and wellbeing; public health; school health; social determinansts of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18129,""
"Impaired psychological well-being of healthcare workers in a German department of anesthesiology is independent of immediate SARS-CoV-2 exposure - a longitudinal observational study","<b>Background:</b> The study aimed to assess the mental well-being of healthcare professionals at a German department of anesthesiology and critical care with a specialized ICU for treatment of COVID-19 patients during the first two peaks of the 2020 pandemic, and identifying risk and protective factors. <b>Methods:</b> A single-center longitudinal, online-based survey was conducted in healthcare workers from a department of anesthesiology and critical care in Bavaria, the most affected federal state in Germany at the time of assessment. Validated scores for depression, anxiety, somatic disorders, burnout, resilience, and self-management were used and complemented by questions about perceived COVID-19-related stressors. In parallel, patient characteristics in the ICU were collected. <b>Results:</b> 24 and 23 critically ill COVID-19 patients were treated during both observation periods in April/May and November/December 2020, respectively. 87.5% and 78.2% of patients had moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. From March 6, 2020 onwards, the hospital had switched to a command and control-based hospital incident command system (HICS) and increased work forces. Point prevalence of depression-like symptoms (13.6% and 12.8%) and burnout (21.6% and 17.4%) in the department's healthcare professionals was high. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 did not increase psychological burden. Consequences of the lockdown were rated as highly distressing by a majority of all ICU personnel. High self-reported trait resilience was protective against signs of depression, generalized anxiety, and burnout. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the pandemic, healthcare professionals have been suffering from increased psychological distress compared to reference data for both the general population and ICU personnel. General effects of the lockdown appear more relevant than actual COVID-19 patient contact. High trait resilience has a protective effect, yet vulnerable individuals may require specific support. Prevention against potential after effects of the lockdown, and in particular measures allowing to avoid another lockdown, appear warranted. <b>Hintergrund:</b> Die Studie hatte zum Ziel, die psychische Gesundheit der anÃƒÂ¤sthesiologischen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter einer UniversitÃƒÂ¤tsklinik mit einer auf COVID-19 spezialisierten Intensivstation wÃƒÂ¤hrend der ersten beiden Wellen der Pandemie im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr und Herbst 2020 zu untersuchen und sowohl Risikofaktoren als auch protektive Faktoren zu identifizieren.<b>Methoden:</b> Es wurde eine monozentrische, Web-basierte Umfrage unter medizinischen Angestellten der Klinik fÃƒÂ¼r AnÃƒÂ¤sthesiologie, UniversitÃƒÂ¤tsklinikum WÃƒÂ¼rzburg, durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Hierzu wurden validierte Tests zu den DomÃƒÂ¤nen DepressivitÃƒÂ¤t, Ãƒâ€žngstlichkeit, somatoforme StÃƒÂ¶rungen, Burnout, Resilienz und Selbstmanagement verwendet und des Weiteren offene Fragen zu subjektiv belastenden, COVID-19-assoziierten Faktoren gestellt. ZusÃƒÂ¤tzlich wurden Charakteristika der in den UmfragezeitrÃƒÂ¤umen behandelten Patientinnen und Patienten sowie Informationen zum Krankenhausmanagement wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie erfasst.<b>Ergebnisse:</b> In den beiden ErhebungszeitrÃƒÂ¤umen wurden 24 bzw. 23 kritisch kranke COVID-19-Patientinnen und -Patienten behandelt. 87.5% bzw. 78.2% der Patientinnen und Patienten litten an einer moderaten bis schweren Form des adulten akuten Lungenversagens. Ab dem 6. MÃƒÂ¤rz 2020 implementierte die Klinik eine streng hierarchische Notfall-Einsatzleitung, um tagesaktuell auf die Dynamik der Pandemie reagieren zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen, und die personellen Ressourcen wurden erhÃƒÂ¶ht. PunktprÃƒÂ¤valenzen von DepressivitÃƒÂ¤t (13,6% und 12.8%) und Burnout (21,3% und 17.4%) bei den Studienteilnehmerinnen und -teilnehmern waren hoch. Die unmittelbare psychische Belastung war unabhÃƒÂ¤ngig von einer Exposition gegenÃƒÂ¼ber SARS-CoV-2. Die Auswirkungen der AusgangsbeschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen wurden von einer Mehrheit der Untersuchten als stark beeintrÃƒÂ¤chtigend beschrieben. Hohe Resilienz schien protektiv zu wirken gegen Anzeichen von DepressivitÃƒÂ¤t, generalisierter Angst und Burnout.<b>Schlussfolgerungen:</b> Im Verlauf der ersten Monate der Pandemie litt das medizinische Personal unter erhÃƒÂ¶hter psychischer Belastung verglichen mit frÃƒÂ¼heren Vergleichsdaten sowohl der AllgemeinbevÃƒÂ¶lkerung als auch von Personal auf Intensivstationen. Die allgemeinen Auswirkungen der AusgangsbeschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen schienen hierbei einen grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÅ¸eren Einfluss gehabt zu haben als der tatsÃƒÂ¤chliche Kontakt mit COVID-19-Patientinnen und -Patienten. AusgeprÃƒÂ¤gte Resilienz hatte einen positiven Effekt. Allerdings kÃƒÂ¶nnten anfÃƒÂ¤llige Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter unter UmstÃƒÂ¤nden gezielte UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung benÃƒÂ¶tigen.

"Effects of COVID-19 Fear on Society's Quality of Life","The COVID-19 pandemic is an important factor affecting the health of people worldwide, as well as a source of fear, stress, and anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine the level of fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkish society and evaluate its effects on quality of life. The sociodemographic information form, COVID-19 Fear Scale (FCV-19S), and WHOQOL-BREF Quality of Life Scale were applied to the participants. A total of 705 people, who were accessed via the internet, responded willingly to the study, which was planned as a cross-sectional analytical study. The mean FCV-19S score was 17.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.9 (7-32) points. Fear points were higher among females than males (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and among single individuals than among those who were married (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.049). Fear scores were low for tradesmen, those with low educational status, and those with high income levels (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). According to the WHOQOL-BREF Scale, the FCV19S of those with very good quality of life was low (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.042), and the FCV-19S of those who were not satisfied with life was high (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Statistically, a weak negative correlation was detected between the fear scores, and physical health and psychological health (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.190, <i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.198, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Fear level varies according to gender, education, and income level, regardless of age. As fear increases, quality of life decreases, and physical and psychological health were negatively affected. The authors believed that the outcome of the study would help inform the public about COVID-19, as well as cope with the psychological effects and fears of COVID-19.","Demirbas, Kutlu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00550-x","20210920","COVID-19; Fear; Mental health; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18131,""

"Frequent callers to UK ambulance services in the COVID-19 pandemic: managing mental health, social isolation and loneliness","Patients who frequently call ambulance services are a vulnerable yet heterogeneous population with unmet multiple and complex physical health, mental health and/or social care needs. In this article, we report the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced for ambulance services across the UK when managing frequent callers, and reflect on how existing systems and practices are adapting to support changing patient needs. Data reported in this article comprise reflections from the frequent caller leads in each ambulance service in the UK. All data were provided between 23 April 2020 and 1 May 2020, shortly after the peak of the outbreak in the UK. A single anonymised case study is also reported to illustrate how the pandemic is affecting people's circumstances and contributing to frequent caller behaviour. Ambulance services are observing changes to the frequent caller population, with many new frequent callers due to health anxiety caused or exacerbated by the pandemic. Management of frequent callers is also changing, with multidisciplinary and multi-agency working becoming more challenging due to decreased access to external services, whether in social care or the community and voluntary sector, and the redeployment of ambulance service staff. There is also decreased face-to-face contact with frequent callers, meaning that opportunities to deliver person-centred care are reduced. However, the introduction or increased use of tele/video conferencing with other organisations has mitigated some of these challenges, and in some cases has improved engagement among external organisations. Health anxieties, lack of access to other health, social and community and voluntary sector services and exacerbations of social isolation and/or loneliness have reportedly contributed to changing behaviour among frequent callers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected how ambulance services have been able to manage frequent callers. Ambulance services should continue to engage with external organisations to aid the delivery of person-centred care, particularly organisations with experience in multiple complex needs such as mental health, social isolation and/or loneliness. Future research should examine the consequences of the pandemic for frequent users of ambulance services, and how these impact on the wider health and care community.","Scott, Burtrand, Churchill, Cole, Collins, Daxner, Fidler, Hammond-Williams, Marlow, McNally, O'Keefe, Petterson, Powell, Scott, Scaife, Smylie, Strickland","https://doi.org/10.29045/14784726.2021.09.6.2.66","20210920","COVID-19; mental health; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18133,""

"COVID-19 and social wellbeing in Malaysia: A case study","The world has witnessed the largest single disruption to social wellbeing since the first known case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in China in December 2019. In Malaysia, the government implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this paper highlights how the Malaysian government responded to COVID-19 in comparison with some Asian countries; and what has and has not worked for the MCO imposed by the government. The paper adopts a review approach that is supported by findings from both grey and academic literature. The findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has significant impacts on the society's wellbeing in Malaysia, the most severe of which are negative mental health and job unemployment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has sparked a surge of volunteering in society. This paper presumably and hopefully represents a frontier review with more empirical research to be conducted to investigate the extent of the social impact of COVID-19, the outcomes of which are a call for re-envisioning of social policies in Malaysia. To the best knowledge of the authors, little empirical research has been conducted to explore the social-wellbeing implications of COVID-19 in Malaysia. By reflecting on the various scenarios-both detrimental and beneficial in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the paper identifies potential avenues for relevant research in the social wellbeing realm.","Yong, Sia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02290-6","20210920","COVID-19; Malaysia; Mental health; PEST; Social wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18135,""
"How the COVID-19 outbreak affected patients with diabetes mellitus?","Global COVID-19 outbreak has been such a stressful experience for most of the people. Using a web-based cross-sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the acute stress response, depression, and anxiety in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the effect of these psychiatric problems on diet habits and glycemic controls of patients. This web-based survey of COVID-19 was sent to the patients through the Whatsapp platform. All participants reported their demographic data, diabetes-related information, changes in self-monitoring blood glucose measurements, physical parameters, and eating habits after COVID-19, then completed Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale, Revised (IES-R) questionnaires which assessed acute stress sypmtoms, anxiety, and depression. Three hundred and four patients with DM [(141 type 1 DM (T1D) and 163 type 2 (T2D)] were included in the study. In our study, female gender, higher BMI and weight, decreased in financial income after outbreak, presence of diabetic complications and comorbid diseases (i.e., retinopathy, neuropathy, diabetic foot, hypertension, dyslipidemia), worsened glycemic levels, increased carbohydrate consumption, and snacking were associated with higher anxiety and depression scores. Depression was higher in patients with T2D and duration of illness was correlated with acute stress level. It is important to be aware of the possibility of acute stress, depression, and anxiety after pandemic in patients with DM whose glycemic control is impaired. Psychological problems should not be ignored beyond physical inactivity and worsening eating habits.","Sisman, Polat, Aydemir, Karsi, Gul, Cander, Ersoy, Erturk","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13410-021-00992-y","20210920","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Diabetes mellitus; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18136,""

Affect dysregulation partially accounted for the associations between family stress from confinement and psychological maltreatment on both internalizing and externalizing symptoms for youth and caregiver report. Suppression partially accounted for the associations between family stress and maltreatment on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the youth sample, but only for internalizing symptoms in the caregiver sample.

In our study, we assess the level of psychological distress and psychosocial factors among students in Mexico at the beginning of the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional exploratory study with 848 participants, the majority undergraduate or postgraduate (79.7%). Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised to measure emotions, and a COVID-19 questionnaire. We conducted a logistic regression analysis to find variables associated with stress: 36% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°309) had elevated stress, 31.4% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°266) anxiety, and 18.2% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°154) sadness often or all the time. Those who identified as women and reported a reduction in their incomes also reported a higher stress level. Stress was positively correlated with anxiety, anger, sadness, days in isolation, and hours watching TV daily; and negatively correlated with relaxation and happiness. The variable most strongly correlated with stress was a high perception of infection risk.

"Six-Month Quality of Life in COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit Survivors","Because there is increasing evidence of serious deterioration in long-term quality of life (QoL) in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) intensive care unit (ICU) survivors, the authors identified predictors of poor quality of life in these patients. Prospective cohort study. Research hospital repurposed into a COVID-19 center. Consecutive patients admitted in COVID-19 ICUs between March and June 2020. An SF-36 questionnaire, which included physical and mental items, was used six months after patient's discharge. A total of 403 patients were managed in the ICU, with a hospital mortality of 181 of 403 (44.9%), and 16 (4.0%) patients died within six months. Among the 125 questionnaire responders, only 32.0% and 52% had a normal quality of life in terms of the physical and mental component of health. Multivariate analysis identified low-molecular-weight heparin treatment in the ICU as the only modifiable factor associated with an increase in physical component of QoL odds ratio (OR) 3.341 (95% confidence interval 1.298-8.599), pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.012, and age Ã¢â€°Â¥52 years OR 0.223 and female sex OR 0.321 were significantly associated with a decrease in the physical component.

"Healthcare professionals' experiences during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the intensive care unit: A qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic called for rapidly considerable changes in the healthcare system. Healthcare professionals from different departments within the hospital settings were enrolled in the emergency preparedness. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the healthcare professionals' experiences attending the ICU-preparedness and caring for patients with COVID-19 during the initial stage of the pandemic. A descriptive explorative qualitative study was conducted by interviewing healthcare professionals during spring 2020, exploring their experiences as part of the ICU-preparedness team and caring for patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. Healthcare professionals from different departments were recruited by purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. Sixteen nurses and four physicians from a university hospital in Denmark participated. The analysis revealed three main themes and eight sub-themes. The main themes were (1) Professionalism in work-life (adaption, the patient's welfare, insecurity, and security), (2) Community Spirit (responsibility and contribution), and (3) Institutional organisation (the role of management, loss of freedom, and information). Despite work specialities and professions, the participants reported a uniformity of similar experiences of uncertainties, but also a sense of community arose during the first phase of COVID-19. To ensure resilience and mental health, and well-being for the healthcare professionals, comprehensive support should be provided. Guidelines for interventions and training are necessary to promote preparedness and reduce psychological stress.","Mortensen, Zachodnik, Caspersen, Geisler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103130","20210920","COVID-19; Experience; Health care professionals; Intensive care unit; Qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18143,""
"Addressing Moral Injury in Emergency Medicine","Moral injury, which is described as the psychological distress that results from actions, or lack of them, that go against one's beliefs or values, has become front and center among issues facing the practice of emergency medicine. Although it predates the COVID-19 outbreak, the pandemic has played a significant role in the increased rate of burnout, and even suicide, among emergency physicians. This paper includes several clinical vignettes to highlight incidents that may occur in the emergency department (ED) whenÃ‚Â physicians experience violations of their moral codes, leading to distress and moral injury. TheseÃ‚Â scenarios explore the conflicts posed between competingÃ‚Â bioethical principles such as beneficence, nonmaleficence, end-of-life decision-making, medical futility, respect for self-determination (autonomy), resource scarcity and triage, duty to care, and physician impairment. There are significant similarities between moral injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with some authors describing moral injury as a subset of PTSD. We explore these commonalities to provide coping mechanisms and mitigation strategies for those suffering from moral injury. Physicians experiencing moral injury may benefit from the many available evidence-based treatments for PTSD to identify and manage moral injury and to support patient care and personal well-being.","Giwa, Crutchfield, Fletcher, Gemmill, Kindrat, Smith, Bayless","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.07.066","20210920","COVID; PTSD; ethical dilemmas; moral distress; moral injury; pandemic: emotional trauma; physician suicide; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18144,""
"Suicide in late life: A viewpoint","Suicide in old age represents a sad public health concern. Despite the global decline in rates of suicide and the general amelioration of quality of life and access to health care for older adults, their rates of suicide remain the highest virtually in every part of the world. With the aging of the world population and the growing number of mononuclear families, the risk of an increase in isolation, loneliness and dependency does not appear ungrounded.

"Suicide prevention in the covid-19 era","The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the health of people all around the world including mental health as social isolation which has been one of the best infection mitigation efforts is strongly associated with anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide attempts. These feelings are consistent with past pandemics where there was loss of routine and sociability. Suicidality has been on the rise in the United States and it is within this context that the pandemic has struck. With the risk of suicide being increased, preventative measures need to be implemented at the universal, selective and indicated levels. Universal suicide prevention is needed for the population as a whole regardless of their risk of suicide. Selective prevention is for subgroups at an increased risk and lastly indicated prevention corresponds to people at a very high risk, for example those with recent suicide attempts. Telemedicine, informative and responsible media, as well as monetary help from governments, banks and other major institutions can all help with suicide prevention in these during the pandemic. These resources can broadly help the population at large, but more targeted approaches will be needed for high risk individuals including those with psychiatric diagnoses, COVID-19 survivors, frontline healthcare workers and the elderly. Additionally, those with recent suicide attempts should warrant even more attention.","Rothman, Sher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106547","20210920","Covid-19; Mental health; Prevention; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18146,""

Preliminary data project educational losses at many levels and verify the increased anxiety and depression associated with the changes, but there are not yet data on long-term outcomes. Guidance from oversight organizations regarding the safety and efficacy of new delivery modalities for education have been quickly forged.

"The COVID-19 pandemic: an opportunity to make mental health a higher public health priority","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first recognised in December 2019. The subsequent pandemic has caused 4.3 million deaths and affected the lives of billions. It has increased psychosocial risk factors for mental illness including fear, social isolation and financial insecurity and is likely to lead to an economic recession. COVID-19 is associated with a high rate of neuropsychiatric sequelae. The long-term effects of the pandemic on mental health remain uncertain but could be marked, with some predicting an increased demand for psychiatric services for years to come. COVID-19 has turned a spotlight on mental health for politicians, policy makers and the public and provides an opportunity to make mental health a higher public health priority.

"Public health consequences after ten years of the Syrian crisis: a literature review","Ten years of the Syrian war had a devastating effect on Syrian lives, including millions of refugees and displaced people, enormous destruction in the infrastructure, and the worst economic crisis Syria has ever faced. The health sector was hit hard by this war, up to 50% of the health facilities have been destroyed and up to 70% of the healthcare providers fled the country seeking safety, which increased the workload and mental pressure for the remaining medical staff. Five databases were searched and 438 articles were included according to the inclusion criteria, the articles were divided into categories according to the topic of the article.Through this review, the current health status of the Syrian population living inside Syria, whether under governmental or opposition control, was reviewed, and also, the health status of the Syrian refugees was examined according to each host country. Public health indicators were used to summarize and categorize the information. This research reviewed mental health, children and maternal health, oral health, non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, occupational health, and the effect of the COVID -Ã¢â‚¬â€°19 pandemic on the Syrian healthcare system. The results of the review are irritating, as still after ten years of war and millions of refugees there is an enormous need for healthcare services, and international organization has failed to respond to those needs. The review ended with the current and future challenges facing the healthcare system, and suggestions about rebuilding the healthcare system.Through this review, the major consequences of the Syrian war on the health of the Syrian population have been reviewed and highlighted. Considerable challenges will face the future of health in Syria which require the collaboration of the health authorities to respond to the growing needs of the Syrian population.

"Factors associated with SARS-CoV2 infection and care pathways among the most vulnerable populations living in Marseille: a case control study","The Covid-19 pandemic has led to substantial and unexpected increases in morbidity and mortality in France. Vulnerable populations housed in accommodation centres have a greater risk of infection because collective housing and their dependence on social support services mean it is more difficult to apply preventive measures. They are also at greater risk of developing severe forms of Covid-19 and waiting longer before seeking healthcare (for Covid-19 or other) treatment. We aimed to identify the factors associated with SARS-CoV2 infection in the most vulnerable populations in the city of Marseille. The study sample comprised users of various services provided by the association AAJT in Marseille, France, some presenting symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 and others not. All had routine health surveillance provided by AAJT's dedicated healthcare team between March 2020 and May 2020. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we studied the influence of several variables on morbidity associated with Covid-19. The study included 64 participants, 29 of whom tested positive for Covid-19 and 35 control subjects. Median age was 21.16Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old. Individuals in the 'Covid-19 case' group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005) - which included persons testing positive and those suspected of being infected - were younger. The study sample's male/female ratio was seven. In our multivariate analyses, living in a shared apartment and poor adherence to social distancing measures were factors associated with Covid-19 infection. Furthermore, mental health problems - such as anxiety disorder - were very frequent in the study sample. Allocating more and specific housing units to structures providing accommodation services to the most vulnerable people would seem to be a decisive factor in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV2, and deserves more attention from public authorities.","AlsaÃƒÂ¯di, De Sousa Santos, Plard, Janvier, Tinland, Hafni, Mosnier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11716-6","20210920","COVID-19; Healthcare delivery; Healthcare disparities; Risk factors; Social determinants of health; Vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18150,""
"Approaching a New Normal: Lessons Learned Transitioning Family Education Programming to a Virtual Environment","The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting deep-rooted health inequities. While the virus itself does not discriminate, gaps in access to services and disparities in health outcomes are prevalent. Concerns over worsening mental health outcomes and increases in family violence exist. Thus, service organizations have faced an unprecedented call to rethink services, with many transitioning to virtual programming to ensure the needs of their clients can be met. This brief highlights lessons learned as one organization pivoted to meet critical client needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests atypically high engagement and retention in family education and family violence reduction programming under Safer at Home orders when compared with pre-COVID engagement. Findings suggest key tenants for program success are tied to strong programming, staff engagement, and participation retention and satisfaction. Program adaptations create opportunities for increasing service equity, improving engagement and satisfaction, and improving family and mental health outcomes by maintaining connections, while providing a model for delivering services to reduce child maltreatment during times of social isolation and increased hardship.","Corvin, Nabours, Bularca, Haile","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399211034814","20210920","COVID-19; engagement; family violence; virtual programming; zoom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18151,""
"Long COVID and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A survey of elderly female survivors in Egypt","This study aimed to investigate post COVID 19 symptoms amongst elderly females and whether they could be a risk factor for developing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) later on. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, in the form of an online survey. A total of 115 responses were finally included. The mean age was 73.18Ã‚Â±6.42. Eighty-nine reported symptoms in the post recovery period; of these 54 had no symptoms of CFS, 60 were possible, and only 1 was probable. Fatigue was reported by 66, musculoskeletal symptoms by 56, and sleep problems by 73. Twenty-nine patients visited a doctor's office as a result. Post recovery symptoms were significantly related to stress, sadness and sleep disturbances. Also, stress, sadness, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and recurrent falls were all significantly associated with CFS like symptoms. From our findings the presence of fatigue, cognitive impairment, stress, sadness, sleep disturbances, and recurrent falls in the post-recovery period were all significantly associated with CFS like symptoms. To conclude it would be reasonable to screen for Long COVID and consider the potential for developing CFS later on. Whether it can be a risk factor for developing CFS like other viral infections will need more larger scale studies to confirm this.","Aly, Saber","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14886","20210919","Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; Elderly; Long COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18152,""
"The impact of providing end-of-life care during a pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of health and social care staff: Systematic review and meta-synthesis","Disease outbreaks and disasters can result in excess deaths and severe disruption of usual end-of-life care processes. We aimed to: i) synthesise evidence describing the experiences of health and social care staff providing end-of-life care during a disease outbreak or humanitarian disaster, ii) understand the impact on their mental health and wellbeing and, iii) identify means of support. A systematic review with meta-synthesis was conducted including studies of health and social care staff providing end-of-life care during disease outbreaks (Ebola, COVID-19, SARs, MERs) or humanitarian disasters (2001-2020). MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and grey literature databases were searched systematically, with forward and backward citation searching of included studies. Any research study designs, in any care settings, were included. Study quality was assessed using an appraisal tool relevant to each study design. Qualitative meta-synthesis was used to analyse the findings, which were then reported narratively. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020181444. Nineteen studies were included, including 10 Ebola studies and two COVID-19 studies. The analysis generated two superordinate themes: individual experience and organisational responsibilities. Individual experience comprised four themes: dignity in death, positive experiences, negative experience and support for staff. Organisational responsibilities comprised four themes: preparation, adaption, resources, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). No studies quantitively measured the impact of providing end-of-life care on staff mental health and wellbeing, however qualitative studies described experiences in varied settings. Serious disease outbreaks and disasters can expose care staff to abnormally high levels of mortality and suffering.

"Factors associated with post-traumatic growth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a national sample of US military veterans","The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous negative effects globally, contributing to mortality, social restriction, and psychological distress. To date, however, the majority of research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has focused on negative psychological outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although there is debate about the constructive vs. illusory nature of post-traumatic growth (PTG), it has been found to be prevalent in a broad range of trauma survivors, including individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to identify pre- and peri-pandemic factors associated with pandemic-related PTG in a national sample of U.S. veterans. Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of 3078 U.S. veterans. A broad range of pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic factors associated with pandemic-related PTG were evaluated. Curve estimation and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to characterize the association between pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and PTG. Worries about the effect of the pandemic on one's physical and mental health, PTG in response to previous traumas (i.e., new possibilities and improved interpersonal relationships), and pandemic-related avoidance symptoms were the strongest correlates of pandemic-related PTG. An inverted-U shaped relationship provided the best fit to the association between pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and endorsement of PTG, with moderate severity of PTSD symptoms optimally efficient in identifying veterans who endorsed PTG. Results of this study suggest that psychosocial interventions that promote more deliberate and organized rumination about the pandemic and enhance PTG in response to prior traumatic events may help facilitate positive psychological changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic in U.S. military veterans. Longitudinal studies on functional correlates of PTG may help inform whether these changes are constructive vs. illusory in nature.","Na, Tsai, Southwick, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114409","20210919","COVID-19; Post-traumatic growth; Trauma; Veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18154,""

"Afghanistan: Decades of collective trauma, ongoing humanitarian crises, Taliban rulers, and mental health of the displaced population","More than half of the Afghan population suffers from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, including many survivors of conflict-related violence, yet only about 10 percent receive effective psychosocial therapy from the government. As a result of decades of bloodshed, many Afghans have sustained serious psychological traumas. Due to unfair social standards, women and girls confront additional challenges, and millions of Afghans have suffered psychologically as a result of 41 years of conflict. While effective mental health investment is vital, funds must be spent judiciously to ensure access to adequate assessment while also adhering to human rights standards. The global mental health crises caused by the lengthy political struggle, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, have collided in Afghanistan, worsening a complex humanitarian disaster and adding to the country's mounting mental health burden. Mental health is an issue that, at least in Afghanistan's current socio-political setting, requires immediate attention. While effective mental health investment is vital, funds must be spent judiciously to ensure access to adequate assessment.","Mohd Saleem, Shoib, Dazhamyar, Chandradasa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102854","20210919","Conflict; Humanitarian crises; Psychological well-being; Social well-being; Trauma; War","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18158,""
"Implementing the national suicide prevention strategy: Time for action to flatten the curve","Since 1999, the Office of the United States Surgeon General has identified suicide prevention as a national public health priority. The National Strategy on Suicide Prevention, coordinated by the public-private Action Alliance, was most recently updated in 2012. In early 2021, the Surgeon General's office released a Call to Action to fully implement the national strategy. Six core types of actions to prevent suicide include adopting a broad public health approach, addressing upstream factors including social determinants of health, reducing access to multiple forms of lethal means, adopting evidence-based care for persons at risk, enhancing crisis care and care transitions, and improving the quality and use of suicide-related data. From 1999 through 2018, suicide rates in the U.S. increased by approximately one-third, and suicide had become the tenth leading cause of death. While most recent national data indicate a small reduction in the suicide rate, decreases were not seen across all demographic groups. Population groups which may require special emphasis or outreach efforts include adolescents, working age adults, military veterans, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Increases in social isolation, mental distress, and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate clear needs to address the full spectrum of suicidal behavior. This will require a multisector and whole of government approach, using contemporary evidence-informed approaches and best practices as well as innovative methods including those based on predictive analytics.","Iskander, Crosby","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106734","20210920","Prevention; Suicidal behavior; Suicidality; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18159,""
"Determinants of Shielding Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associations With Well-being Among National Health Service Patients: Longitudinal Observational Study","The UK National Health Service (NHS) classified 2.2 million people as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) during the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, advising them to ""shield"" (to not leave home for any reason). The aim of this study was to measure the determinants of shielding behavior and associations with well-being in a large NHS patient population for informing future health policy. Patients contributing to an ongoing longitudinal participatory epidemiology study (Longitudinal Effects on Wellbeing of the COVID-19 Pandemic [LoC-19], n=42,924) received weekly email invitations to complete questionnaires (17-week shielding period starting April 9, 2020) within their NHS personal electronic health record. Question items focused on well-being. Participants were stratified into four groups by self-reported CEV status (qualifying condition) and adoption of shielding behavior (baselined at week 1 or 2). The distribution of CEV criteria was reported alongside situational variables and univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Longitudinal trends in physical and mental well-being were displayed graphically. Free-text responses reporting variables impacting well-being were semiquantified using natural language processing. In the lead up to a second national lockdown (October 23, 2020), a follow-up questionnaire evaluated subjective concern if further shielding was advised. The study included 7240 participants. In the CEV group (n=2391), 1133 (47.3%) assumed shielding behavior at baseline, compared with 633 (13.0%) in the non-CEV group (n=4849). CEV participants who shielded were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.76), female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), older (OR per year increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), living in a home with an outdoor space (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70) or three to four other inhabitants (three: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.94; four: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.01), or solid organ transplant recipients (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.77), or have severe chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Receipt of a government letter advising shielding was reported in 1115 (46.6%) CEV participants and 180 (3.7%) non-CEV participants, and was associated with adopting shielding behavior (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.82-3.95 and OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.04-3.99, respectively). In CEV participants, shielding at baseline was associated with a lower rating of mental well-being and physical well-being. Similar results were found for non-CEV participants. Concern for well-being if future shielding was required was most prevalent among CEV participants who had originally shielded. Future health policy must balance the potential protection from COVID-19 against our findings that shielding negatively impacted well-being and was adopted in many in whom it was not indicated and variably in whom it was indicated. This therefore also requires clearer public health messaging and support for well-being if shielding is to be advised in future pandemic scenarios.","Bachtiger, Adamson, Maclean, Kelshiker, Quint, Peters","https://doi.org/10.2196/30460","20210920","COVID-19; behavior; determinant; epidemiology; health policy; longitudinal; mental health; observational; personal health record; protection; public health; shielding; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18160,""
"The Association Between Neighborhood Social Vulnerability and Cardiovascular Health Risk Among Black/African American Women in the InterGEN Study","Black/African American women in the United States are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability than other racial/ethnic groups, even when adjusting for personal income. Social vulnerability, defined as the degree to which the social conditions of a community affect its ability to prevent loss and suffering in the event of disaster, has been used in research as an objective measure of neighborhood social vulnerability. Black/African American women also have the highest rates of hypertension and obesity in the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood social vulnerability and cardiovascular risk (hypertension and obesity) among Black/African American women. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the InterGEN Study that enrolled Black/African American women in the Northeast United States. Participants' addresses were geocoded to ascertain neighborhood vulnerability using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index at the census tract level. We used multivariable regression models to examine associations between objective measures of neighborhood quality and indicators of structural racism and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and obesity (body mass index &gt; 24.9) and to test psychological stress, coping, and depression as potential moderators of these relationships. Seventy-four percent of participating Black/African American women lived in neighborhoods in the top quartile for social vulnerability nationally. Women living in the top 10% of most socially vulnerable neighborhoods in our sample had more than a threefold greater likelihood of hypertension when compared to those living in less vulnerable neighborhoods. Objective neighborhood measures of structural racism (percentage of poverty, percentage of unemployment, percentage of residents &gt;25 years old without a high school diploma, and percentage of residents without access to a vehicle) were significantly associated with elevated diastolic blood pressure and obesity in adjusted models. Psychological stress had a significant moderating effect on the associations between neighborhood vulnerability and cardiovascular risk. We identified important associations between structural racism, the neighborhood environment, and cardiovascular health among Black/African American women. These findings add to a critical body of evidence documenting the role of structural racism in perpetuating health inequities and highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to policy, research, and interventions to address racial health inequities.","Basile Ibrahim, Barcelona, Condon, Crusto, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNR.0000000000000523","20210920","Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; COVID-19; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Middle Aged; Ohio; Social Segregation; Socioeconomic Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18161,""
"COVID-19 and people who use drugs: Impact of the pandemic on general anxiety and depressive disorders among adults in Belgium","Background During previous pandemics people who use drugs (PWUD) were categorized among the most vulnerable. In the current study, firstly, we wanted to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among PWUD. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the prevalence of these disorders with that of members from the general population who did not use drugs. Methods We used a matched cohort design based on two separate repeated cross-sectional online surveys (April and November 2020) among PWUD and the general population. Results of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used as outcome variables. We calculated absolute and relative risks for matched pairs for both affective disorders, and logistic regression to compare affective disorders over both waves for PWUD. Results In April, the prevalence of affective disorders was similar for PWUD and the general population. In November, the risks for anxiety disorders increased with 64% for PWUD compared to non-PWUD (RRÂ =Â 1.64, 95%CI 1.42â€“1.88), whereas the risks for depressive disorders more than doubled (RRÂ =Â 2.29, 95%CI 1.97â€“2.67). Having a job and being male were protective factors for PWUD for both anxiety and depressive disorders. Limitations As this study used self-reported data, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 give an indication of the presence of anxiety and depression which might differ from a clinician's judgement. Conclusions PWUD might be disproportionally affected by COVID-19. Health care providers should be attentive to substance use as an indicator for increased risk of mental health problems.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.069","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","",18162,""
