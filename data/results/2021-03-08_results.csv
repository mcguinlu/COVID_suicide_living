"A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Increases in mental health problems have been observed in some studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether changes have been large and experienced by most population sub-groups, persisted over time or been symptom specific. Methods: We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined changes in mental health among the same group of participants before and during the pandemic (PROSPERO: CRD42021231256). Searches for published and unpublished studies were conducted in January 2021. Changes in mental health (standardised mean change; SMC) were examined using meta-analyses. Findings: Sixty-five studies were included. There was an overall increase in mental health symptoms that was most pronounced during March-April 2020 (SMC = .102 [95% CI: .026 to .192], p = 0.03) before significantly declining over time (May-July SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157], p = .141). Compared to measures of anxiety (SMC = 0.13, p = 0.02) and general mental health (SMC = -.03, p = 0.65), increases in depression and mood disorder symptoms tended to be larger (SMC = 0.22, p < .001) and reductions over time appeared less pronounced. Increased mental health symptoms were observed across most population subgroups examined but there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples with a pre-existing mental health condition. Interpretation: There was a small increase in mental health symptoms soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that decreased and was comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020 among most population sub-groups and symptom types.

"THROUGH THE COVID-19 LOOKING GLASS: COPING SKILLS FOR STEM EDUCATORS IN THE TIME OF A PANDEMIC AND BEYOND","The 2020 pandemic led to the immediate lockdown of schools and universities worldwide with far-reaching implications for educators and learners  Individual stories of lockdown and isolation are documented using direct quotations from discussion forums, emails, live chats, and structured journal entries from the Blackboard learning management system  A 'qualitative sense' of a common narrative of turmoil and success within this 'new [ab] normal' is established  Educators' contrasting accounts of uncertainty and hope are highlighted  The notion of anticipatory anxiety as a result of social lockdown restrictions is covered in terms of its impact on mental health and wellbeing, with special reference to the neuroscience that underpins this phenomenon  Strategies for the management of stress-related autonomic nervous system activation, as well as for building resilience and coping skills in classrooms, are highlighted, along with the need to address issues of cognitive dissonance and fatigue caused by increased online/blended teaching demands during uncertain times  The online format was found to be potentially impersonal and cold without the essential 'human factor'  Despite technology in education there has to be human and social interaction, as well as support online  The most benefit was derived from live sessions and social interaction","","https://doi.org/10.33225/jbse/20.19.1068","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Baltic Science Education;19(6A):1068-1077, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Baltic Science Education;19(6A):1068-1077, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-08","",11607,""

"Predictors of distress and coping during pandemic-related self isolation: The relative importance of personality traits and beliefs about personal threat","During pandemics such as COVID-19, voluntary self-isolation is important for limiting the spread of infection  Little is known about the traits that predict distress or coping with pandemic-related self-isolation  Some studies suggest that personality variables (e g , introversion, conscientiousness, resilience, optimism) are important in predicting distress and coping during self-isolation, but such studies have not controlled for important variables such as stressors associated with self-isolation, demographic variables, and individual differences in beliefs (worries) about the dangerousness of COVID-19  The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the role of personality traits, demographic characteristics, and COVID-related beliefs about contracting the coronavirus  Data from a population representative sample of 938 adults from the United States and Canada, in voluntary self-isolation, revealed that COVID-related threat beliefs were more important than various personality variables in predicting (a) self-isolation distress, (b) general distress, (c) stockpiling behaviors, and (c) use of personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and visors  There was little evidence that personality traits influenced threat beliefs  The findings are relevant for understanding distress and protective behaviors during the current pandemic, in subsequent waves of this pandemic, and in later pandemics, and for informing the development of targeted mental health interventions  Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110779","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;176, 2021.; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;176, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-08","",11621,""
