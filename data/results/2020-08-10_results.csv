"COVID-19 anxiety among frontline nurses: predictive role of organisational support, personal resilience and social support","This study examines the relative influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety in frontline nurses. Anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses' well-being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus-related anxiety among frontline nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety among nurses. This cross-sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardised scales. Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support (ÃŽÂ² = -0.142, p = 0.011), personal resilience (ÃŽÂ² = -0.151, p = 0.008) and organisational support (ÃŽÂ² = -0.127, p = 0.023) predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID-19. COVID-19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience-promoting and stress management interventions.","Labrague, de Los Santos","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13121","20200809","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coronavirus; nursing; organizational support; resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-10","",3738,""
"Mental Distress in Dermatologists During COVID-19 Pandemic: Assessment and Risk Factors in A Global, Cross-Sectional Study","There is a sparsity of data regarding the mental health status of dermatologists during COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluate the effects of pandemic on mental health of dermatologists on a large scale and identify risk factors for mental distress. 733 dermatologists were included in this cross-sectional, web-based survey. Mental distress was reported by 77.2% of responders. Considerable percentages of participants experienced stress (73.9%), irritation (33.7%), insomnia (30%), or depression (27.6%), and 78.6% were overwhelmed with the amount of pandemic information they were receiving. Mental distress was significantly associated with practice years, volume of patients seen per week before pandemic, personal protective equipment availability at hospital (P=.001 for each), practice location (continent) (P &lt;.001), and participant's assessment that the healthcare system was not equipped for the pandemic (P=.003). Stress was associated with hospital service (P=.003), and depression with being overwhelmed with the amount of pandemic information received (P=.004). In a logistic model, teledermatology use was the most powerful predictor of mental distress (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.07-2.32]). Mental distress was common among dermatologists during this pandemic. Teledermatology use was the most powerful predictor of mental distress. Preventative strategies and psychosocial interventions should be implemented. This article is protected by copyright.

"Symptoms of burnout in intensive care unit specialists facing the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented healthcare crisis with a high prevalence of psychological distress in healthcare providers. We sought to document the prevalence ofÃ‚Â burnout syndrome amongst intensivists facing the COVID-19 outbreak. Cross-sectional survey among intensivists part of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Symptoms of severe burnout, anxiety and depression were collected. Factors independently associated withÃ‚Â severe burnout were assessed using Cox model. Response rate was 20% (1001 completed questionnaires were returned, 45Ã‚Â years [39-53], 34% women, from 85 countries, 12 regions, 50% university-affiliated hospitals). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression or severe burnout was 46.5%, 30.2%, and 51%, respectively, and varied significantly across regions. Rating of the relationship between intensivists and other ICU stakeholders differed significantly according to the presence of anxiety, depression, or burnout. Similar figures were reported for their rating of the ethical climate or the quality of the decision-making. Factors independently associated with anxiety were female gender (HR 1.85 [1.33-2.55]), working in a university-affiliated hospital (HR 0.58 [0.42-0.80]), living in a city ofÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â million inhabitants (HR 1.40 [1.01-1.94]), and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.83 [0.77-0.90]). Independent determinants of depression included female gender (HR 1.63 [1.15-2.31]) and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.84 [0.78-0.92]). Factors independently associated with symptoms of severe burnout included age (HR 0.98/year [0.97-0.99]) and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.76 [0.69-0.82]). The COVID-19 pandemic has had an overwhelming psychological impact on intensivists. Follow-up, and management are warranted to assess long-term psychological outcomes and alleviate the psychological burden of the pandemic on frontline personnel.","Azoulay, De Waele, Ferrer, Staudinger, Borkowska, Povoa, Iliopoulou, Artigas, Schaller, Hari, Pellegrini, Darmon, Kesecioglu, Cecconi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00722-3","20200809","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Coronavirus; Depersonalization; Exhaustion; Pneumonia; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-10","",3740,""
"Nurses' Mental Health During the Covid-19 Outbreak: A Cross-sectional Study","To describe nurses' mental health status during the Covid-19 outbreak and to explore the factors that might accentuate the negative consequences on their mental health. We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic variables, working conditions, family dynamics, and mental health variables in nurses working in healthcare settings, in Portugal, during the Covid-19 outbreak. Portuguese nurses presented higher depression, anxiety and stress levels, when compared to the Portuguese general population, during the outbreak. Overall, nurses who did not consider the quantity and quality of personal protective equipment as adequate presented significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Our results suggest that nurses' mental health status seems to be particularly affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and that some modifiable elements might accentuate the impacts on their mental health.","Sampaio, da Cruz Sequeira, da Costa Teixeira","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001987","20200809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-10","",3741,""
"An analysis on self-management and treatment-related functionality and characteristics of highly rated anxiety apps","Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Drissi, Ouhbi, Janati Idrissi, Ghogho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243","20200809","Anxiety; M-health; Mental health; Mobile apps; Mobile mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-10","",3742,""

"The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients","While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives. The majority of coronavirus disease deaths are due to pneumonia. Mostly, stress and depression are associated with coronavirus disease infection and thus, resulting in weakening of patients' immune response and hence, more severe respiratory symptoms or even death. We propose using a class of antidepressants named selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for their reported potential antiviral effect, modulatory effect of respiratory symptoms, antioxidant properties and immunoregulatory effects beside their main action as antidepressant. In addition, the low cost of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might add a benefit for coronavirus disease patients.","Hamed, Hagag","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140","20200809","COVID-19; Cytokines; Depression; Pneumonia; SSRIs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-10","",3744,""
"Who is lonely in lockdown? Cross-cohort analyses of predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","There are concerns internationally that lockdown measures taken during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could lead to a rise in loneliness. As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear, who is lonely in lockdown? This study compared sociodemographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL (University College London) COVID-19 Social Study, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 60,341). Risk factors for loneliness were near identical before and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk of being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30 years, people with low household income and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with people living before COVID-19 emerged. Furthermore, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those sociodemographic groups already identified as high risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but potentially to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","Bu, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.036","20200809","COVID-19; Loneliness; Pandemic; Social isolation; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-10","",3745,""
