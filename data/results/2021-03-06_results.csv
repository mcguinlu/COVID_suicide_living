"Sharing positive changes made during COVID-19 national lockdown: a multi-method co-production study","Objectives: A multi-method co-production study was designed to share psychosocial insights into the adoption of positive changes made during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. We examined: i) the psychosocial patterning of positive changes, ii) the psychosocial processes by which positive change was realised, and worked with partner organizations to share our insights. Method: A sequential multi-method design included an online survey (n=2445) assessing positive changes in sleep and physical activity patterns, socio-demographics, mood, social support, coping, and resilience, with multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also employed interviews with a purposive diverse sub-sample of people self-reporting high levels of positive change (n=48) and used thematic analysis. Finally, partnership work translated insights into positive change-sharing targeted resources. Results: The survey identified positive change was significantly patterned by age, gender and vulnerability to COVID-19. Higher positive reframing and higher active coping were associated with higher levels of cross-domain positive change. Higher symptoms of depression, planning, and self-distraction were associated with less cross-domain positive change. Thematic analysis showed the centrality of perceptions of time, opportunities to self-reflect and engage with the natural world, access support in diverse ways, actively build routine and purposefully build self-efficacy and a sense of control were key to initiating positive change. Our partner organizations focused on the rapid co-production of a series of online resources that shared study insights. Conclusions: Our study, based around a salutogenic ethos and the constraints of COVID-19, sought to identify and share insights into achieving positive changes at a time of international crisis.","Lynn Williams; Bradley MacDonald; Lesley Rollins; Xanne Janssen; Leanne Fleming; Madeleine Grealy; Alison Kirk; David Young; Paul Flowers","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252809","20210305","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11571,""
"Mining topic and sentiment dynamics in physician rating websites during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Machine learning approach","An increasing number of patients are voicing their opinions and expectations about the quality of care in online forums and on physician rating websites (PRWs). This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.","Shah, Yan, Qayyum, Naqvi, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104434","20210305","COVID-19; Discrete emotions; Dynamics of healthcare topics; LDA; Text mining; Topic modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11572,""
"Changes in dietary fat intake and associations with mental health in a UK public sample during the COVID-19 pandemic","Consumption of unhealthy foods may have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored how dietary fat intake was impacted in a sample of the UK public who were social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from a UK COVID-19 online survey. Fat intake was measured using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education questionnaire. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using Becks' Anxiety and Depression Inventories, while the short-form Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale assessed mental well-being. Differences between individuals who increased versus decreased fat intake were explored using chi-square or independent sample t-tests. Association between fat intake and mental health was explored using adjusted linear regression models. Eight hundred and eighty-seven adults were included. Approximately, 34% recorded medium-to-high levels of fat consumption during social distancing. Around 48% reported decreased fat intake during social distancing compared to usual levels, while 41.3% documented increased fat intake. Fat intake was not significantly associated (PÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.05) with any measures of mental health. A higher proportion of a sample of UK adults social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic recorded decreased fat intake when compared to levels prior to social distancing. There appeared to be no associations between fat intake and mental health.","Wilson, McMullan, Blackburn, Klempel, Yakkundi, Armstrong, Brolly, Butler, Barnett, Jacob, Koyanagi, Smith, Tully","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab009","20210305","COVID-19 pandemic; cross-sectional study; fat intake; mental health; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11573,""
"The Covid-19 pandemic and mental health of first-year college students: Examining the effect of Covid-19 stressors using longitudinal data","The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented stress to students and educational institutions across the world. We aimed to estimate the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of college students. We used data on 419 first-year students (ages 18-20) at a large public university in North Carolina both before (October 2019-February 2020) and after (June/July 2020) the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. After evaluating descriptive data on mental health and stressors by students' demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between Covid-19 stressors (including work reductions, health, distanced learning difficulties and social isolation) and mental health symptoms and severity controlling for students' pre-pandemic mental health, psychosocial resources, and demographic characteristics. We found that the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety increased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% within four months after the pandemic began; and the prevalence of moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5% to 31.7%. White, female and sexual/gender minority (SGM) students were at highest risk of increases in anxiety symptoms. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, female, and SGM students were at highest risk of increases in depression symptoms. General difficulties associated with distanced learning and social isolation contributed to the increases in both depression and anxiety symptoms. However, work reductions as well as Covid-19 diagnosis and hospitalization of oneself, family members or friends were not associated with increases in depression or anxiety symptoms. Colleges may be able to reduce the mental health consequences of Covid-19 by investing in resources to reduce difficulties with distance learning and reduce social isolation during the pandemic.","Fruehwirth, Biswas, Perreira","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247999","20210305","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11574,""

"Built Environment, Transport, and COVID-19: a Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted daily-life activities around the world. Multiple countries and cities are implementing different mitigation strategies to reduce their transmission (e.g., physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, avoiding large gatherings). Such interventions have been related to positive and negative health externalities. Currently, the selection of mitigation strategies has not been systematically considering a long-term vision for urban health equity. This review presents evidence and a framework linking COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the built environment, and transport to health determinants and outcomes. In addition, the paper provides a set of urban interventions aimed at supporting COVID-19 mitigation strategies and promoting a long-term health equity vision. COVID-19 mitigation strategies, in addition to helping reduce disease transmission, have also decreased urban road transport, resulting in indirect benefits on air quality, traffic noise, and traffic incidents. On the other hand, the same mitigation strategies have had negative impacts on physical activity, mental health, home isolation, and access to transport options, among others. COVID-19 mitigation strategies are an opportunity to test and implement built environment and transport interventions aimed to maximize health equity and minimize health risks. National and local authorities should systematically integrate a long-term urban health equity vision when designing and implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies. COVID-19 offers an opportunity to rethink the built environment and transport infrastructure with the aim to support short-term mitigation strategies and reduce long-term urban health inequities.","Rojas-Rueda, Morales-Zamora","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-021-00307-7","20210305","Built environment; COVID-19; Environmental health; Equity; Transport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11576,""

"Virtual Reality as a Technological-Aided Solution to Support Communication in Persons With Neurodegenerative Diseases and Acquired Brain Injury During COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 poses an ongoing threat to lives around the world and challenges the existing public health and medical service delivery. The lockdown or quarantine measures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has caused the interruption in ongoing care and access to medical care including to patients with existing neurological conditions. Besides the passivity, isolation, and withdrawal, patients with neurodegenerative diseases experience difficulties in communication due to a limited access to leisure opportunities and interaction with friends and relatives. The communication difficulties may exacerbate the burden on the caregivers. Therefore, assistive-technologies may be a useful strategy in mitigating challenges associated with remote communication. The current paper presents an overview of the use of assistive technologies using virtual reality and virtual body ownership in providing communication opportunities to isolated patients, during COVID-19, with neurological diseases and moderate-to-severe communication difficulties. We postulate that the assistive technologies-based intervention may improve social interactions in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and acquired brain injury-thereby reducing isolation and improving their quality of life and mental well-being.","Stasolla, Matamala-Gomez, Bernini, CaffÃƒÂ², Bottiroli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.635426","20210305","COVID19; assistive technology; caregivers burden; healthcare; neurodegenerative diseases; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11578,""
"Consequences of COVID-19 Confinement on Anxiety, Sleep and Executive Functions of Children and Adolescents in Spain","Children and adolescents are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to be forced to live in confinement. The change in life to which they have been abruptly subjected forces us to understand the state of their mental health in order to adequately address both their present and future needs. The present study was carried out with the intention of studying the consequences of confinement on anxiety, sleep routines and executive functioning of 1,028 children and adolescents, aged from 6 to 18 years, residing in Spain to; assess if there are differences regarding these consequences in terms of sex and age; how anxiety affects executive functioning in males and females; and to examine the possible correlations between the measured variables. For this purpose, an online questionnaire containing five sections was designed: the first section gathers information on sociodemographic and health data, while the following sections gather information from different standardized scales which measure anxiety, sleep and executive functions, whose items were adapted in order to be completed by parents, and/or legal guardians. The statistical analyzes carried out highlights significant differences in executive functioning between males and females. In turn, in regards to age, greater difficulties were detected in anxiety in the 9 to 12 age group and greater sleep disturbances between 13 and 18 year olds. On the other hand, significant differences were found in intra-sexual executive functioning depending on whether they presented greater or lesser anxiety, with executive functioning being more tendentiously maladjusted in males than in females, revealing a significantly relevant effect size (<i>p</i> = 0.001; <i>Ãâ€°<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.27 BRIEF-2; <i>Ãâ€°<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.19 BDEFS-CA; 95%).

"Effect of COVID-19 Quarantine on the Sleep Quality and the Depressive Symptom Levels of University Students in Jordan During the Spring of 2020","<b>Objectives:</b> This study was designed to assess the effect of COVID-19 home quarantine and its lifestyle challenges on the sleep quality and mental health of a large sample of undergraduate University students in Jordan. It is the first study applied to the Jordanian population. The aim was to investigate how quarantine for several weeks changed the students' habits and affected their mental health. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted using a random representative sample of 6,157 undergraduate students (mean age 19.79 Ã‚Â± 1.67 years, males 28.7%) from the University of Jordan through voluntarily filling an online questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) were used to assess sleep quality and depressive symptoms, respectively. <b>Results:</b> The PSQI mean score for the study participants was 8.1 Ã‚Â± 3.6. The sleep quality of three-quarters of the participants was negatively affected by the extended quarantine. Nearly half of the participants reported poor sleep quality. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among participants was 76% (males: 71.5% and females: 77.8%). Similarly, the prevalence of the depressive symptoms was 71% (34% for moderate and 37% for high depressive symptoms), with females showing higher prevalence than males. The overall mean CES-D score for the group with low depressive symptoms is 9.3, for the moderate group is 19.8, while it is 34.3 for the high depressive symptoms group. More than half of the students (62.5%) reported that the quarantine had a negative effect on their mental health. Finally, females, smokers, and students with decreased income levels during the extended quarantine were the common exposures that are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Mass and extended quarantine succeeded in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus; however, it comes with a high cost of potential psychological impacts. Most of the students reported that they suffer from sleeping disorders and had a degree of depressive symptoms. Officials should provide psychological support and clear guidance to help the general public to reduce these potential effects and overcome the quarantine period with minimum negative impacts.","Saadeh, Saadeh, Almobaideen, Al Refaei, Shewaikani, Al Fayez, Khawaldah, Abu-Shanab, Al-Hussaini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.605676","20210305","CES-D; COVID-19 quarantine; PSQI; University students; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11580,""
"The Unprecedented Movement Control Order (Lockdown) and Factors Associated With the Negative Emotional Symptoms, Happiness, and Work-Life Balance of Malaysian University Students During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic","<b>Background and Aims:</b> Malaysia's first Movement Control Order (MCO) or &quot;lockdown&quot; was in place for 6 weeks to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Consequently, all universities were forced to close temporarily with abrupt changes to teaching and learning activities. However, there has been a lack of consensus regarding students' actual psychological status and mental health during the MCO implementation. This study investigates the link, state, and differences of negative emotional symptoms, happiness, and work-life balance among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methodology:</b> This study recruited 1,005 university students across Malaysia. Data was collected online using Qualtrics to measure negative emotional symptoms (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale), happiness (The Oxford Happiness Inventory), and work-life balance (Work-Family Conflict Scale). All data was analyzed using SPSS version 25 and AMOS version 26 using <i>T</i>-test, ANOVA, logistic regression analyses, and path analysis method. <b>Findings:</b> Findings indicated that 22, 34.3, and 37.3% of the university students scored moderate to extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, respectively. Half scored rather happy or very happy (50%) for happiness levels. Meanwhile, 50.4 and 39.4% scored high to very high levels of work-to-family and family-to-work conflict. Significant differences in stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, work-family conflict, and family-work conflict were recorded across different demographic factors. Happiness was found to be a protective factor with a lesser likelihood of experiencing severe stress (OR = 0.240, 95% CI: 0.180, 0.321), anxiety (OR = 0.336, 95% CI: 0.273, 0.414), and depression (OR = 0.121, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.165) with higher happiness levels. Higher score of work-to-family conflict contributes to greater odds of having severe levels of anxiety (OR = 1.453, 95% CI: 1.161, 1.818). While greater likelihood of developing severe stress (OR = 1.468, 95% CI: 1.109, 1.943) and severe anxiety (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.059, 1.638) under increasing score of family-to-work conflict. Besides, happiness is found to negatively linked with lower negative emotional symptoms, while work-family conflict and family-work conflict are positively linked with higher negative emotional symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> Lockdown implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have a significant impact on university students' negative emotional symptoms, happiness, and work-life balance. Happiness was found to be a protective factor while the state of work-life balance is a risk factor that can predict students' negative emotional symptoms.","Wan Mohd Yunus, Badri, Panatik, Mukhtar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.566221","20210305","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; happiness; lockdown; stress; students; work-life balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11581,""
"Promoting the Resilience of the Italian Population Against SARS-CoV-2","The COVID-19 pandemic, due to its exceptional level of impact on the populations of the richest and most technologically advanced nations-which are experiencing unprecedented widespread mortality, fear, and social isolation-and due to the considerable difficulties faced by health services in coping with the emergency and the uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic and its foreseeable heavy economic repercussions on a global scale, requires a change in the approach to the prevention and treatment of the infection based on the integration of biomedical and psychological sciences and professions. A survey of the Italian pandemic population, the results of which we report here, shows a widespread state of psychological distress, which, based on decades of scientific and clinical evidence on the relationship between mental states and immune system efficiency that we summarize in this paper, plausibly weakens the resistance of individuals and the population to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Italy can deploy a great force, represented by tens of thousands of psychologists and psychotherapists, who, as health workers, could be employed, alongside local and hospital medicine, in primary care and in promoting the resilience of citizens and health workers themselves, who are subject to a deadly work stress that also includes a widespread threat to their lives.","Bottaccioli, Lazzari, Bottaccioli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.560017","20210305","COVID-19; immune system; mental health; pandemic; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11582,""
"Psychological distress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in an Italian population living with HIV: an online survey","The aim of this study was to explore the psychological impact of the initial stage of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people living with HIV (PLWH), a population at increased risk of psychological distress. PLWH participated in an online survey exploring demographic and clinical data, physical symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures and additional information about COVID-19 during the first phase of the pandemic in Italy. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) (identifying the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific traumatic life event) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) also formed part of the survey. Out of 98 participants, 45% revealed from mild to severe psychological impact from COVID-19 according to IES-R. A lower percentage, instead, complained of significant levels of depression (14%), anxiety (11%) or stress (6%) according to DASS-21. Higher education, being unemployed, number of perceived COVID-19 physical symptoms, concerns about risk of contracting COVID-19 and the pandemic situation in Italy, and needing additional information to prevent COVID-19 infection were positively associated to a higher risk of negative psychological impact. Moreover, among the participants, female gender, age, fewer years from HIV diagnosis and not being aware of their own viremia were associated to a higher risk of negative psychological outcomes. Almost half of our PLWH sample experienced significant levels of distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, elderly patients and those with recent HIV diagnosis appear to be the more psychologically fragile subgroups. Our findings could help identify patients most in need of psychological interventions to improve the wellbeing of PLWH.","Delle Donne, Ciccarelli, Massaroni, Lombardi, Lamonica, Borghetti, Fabbiani, Cauda, Di Giambenedetto","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+distress+during+the+initial+stage+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+an+Italian+population+living+with+HIV:+an+online+survey.","20210305","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11583,""
"Suicide and the agent-host-environment triad: leveraging surveillance sources to inform prevention","Suicide in the US has increased in the last decade, across virtually every age and demographic group. Parallel increases have occurred in non-fatal self-harm as well. Research on suicide across the world has consistently demonstrated that suicide shares many properties with a communicable disease, including person-to-person transmission and point-source outbreaks. This essay illustrates the communicable nature of suicide through analogy to basic infectious disease principles, including evidence for transmission and vulnerability through the agent-host-environment triad. We describe how mathematical modeling, a suite of epidemiological methods, which the COVID-19 pandemic has brought into renewed focus, can and should be applied to suicide in order to understand the dynamics of transmission and to forecast emerging risk areas. We describe how new and innovative sources of data, including social media and search engine data, can be used to augment traditional suicide surveillance, as well as the opportunities and challenges for modeling suicide as a communicable disease process in an effort to guide clinical and public health suicide prevention efforts.","Keyes, Kandula, Olfson, Gould, MartÃƒÂ­nez-AlÃƒÂ©s, Rutherford, Shaman","https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000536X","20210305","Google; Suicide; contagion; environment; infectious; spatial; time trend","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11584,""

"An appropriate and reactive response to the repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by the national medico-psychological network (CUMP) in France","France has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","Prieto, Vignaud, Darbon, Cheucle, Philippe","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764021997492","20210305","COVID-19; crisis intervention; psychiatric disorders; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-06","",11586,""
"Smell disorders in COVID-19 patients: role of olfactory training: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread around the world, a surge of evidence suggests that smell disorders are common symptoms in COVID-19 infection. This dysfunction may cause loss of appetite, malnutrition, poisoning, and depression. Obviously, the impairment has a strong impact on the quality of life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify effective treatments. Various therapies have been studied to treat smell disorders after infection, and olfactory training (OT) is considered a promising treatment option. Assessing the effectiveness and safety of olfactory training for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders is the main purpose of this systematic review protocol. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang Database, ClinicalTrials.gov trials registry, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry will be searched from January 2019 to January 2021. A combination of subject words and free text words will be applied in the searches. The language is limited to Chinese and English. The complete process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and meta-analyses. Endnote X9.3 will be used to manage data screening. The statistical analysis will be completed by Review Manager V.5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) or Stata V.16.0 software. This proposed study will assess the effectiveness and safety of OT for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders. The conclusion of this study will provide evidence to prove the effectiveness and safety of olfactory training for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders.

"Lockdown and adolescent mental health: reflections from a child and adolescent psychotherapist","The author, a child and adolescent psychoanalytic psychotherapist working in the UK NHS, discusses the varied impacts of 'lockdown' on adolescents, their parents and the psychotherapists who work with them, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in this short observational paper that contributes to the <i>Waiting in Pandemic Times</i> Wellcome Collection in response to COVID-19.
