"Childhood Trauma Exposure Increases Long COVID Risk","Background: A proportion of those who contract COVID-19 will develop long COVID (i.e., symptoms that persist for three months or more). Childhood trauma contributes to a pro-inflammatory state in adulthood evidenced by high morbidity and early mortality, but it has not yet been investigated as a risk factor for long COVID. Methods: Participants (N=338) completed online measures of premorbid health, COVID-19 positivity, symptoms, recovery, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Questionnaires about childhood and recent traumatic experiences were completed by half of the sample (N=162). Results: Fifty-three percent of participants developed long COVID, of whom over 60% endorsed exercise intolerance and protracted myalgias, headaches, brain fog, and shortness of breath. Participants who experienced at least one childhood traumatic event were 3-fold more likely to develop the syndrome (OR=3.11, 95% CI, 1.49 to 6.48), while risk was nearly 6-fold increased for two or more events (OR=5.67, CI, 2.44 to 13.13). Regression models showed childhood trauma (OR=5.32, CI, 1.44 to 19.68), older age (OR=1.11, CI, 1.06 to 1.16), female sex (OR=4.02, CI, 1.34 to 12.12), along with chest pain (OR=8.77, CI, 2.80 to 27.43), brain fog (OR=3.33, CI, 1.16 to 9.57) and phantosmia (OR=5.90, CI, 1.40 to 24.86) during acute illness accurately classified long COVID status in 87% of participants. Interpretations: Early adversity is a risk-factor for long COVID, likely due to altered immune response, central sensitization, and peripheral dysfunction. Childhood trauma, a crucial social determinant of health, should be routinely assessed in COVID-19 survivors and may aid in determining prognosis.","Alicia W.

"The efficacy, effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2 disinfection methods (including ozone machines) in educational settings for children and young people","While evidence for the importance of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated surfaces is limited, ozone disinfection methods have been considered for surface cleaning as a response to stopping the spread of the virus in educational settings. This rapid evidence summary aimed to search the available literature and summarise findings on the surface survival of SARS-CoV-2, efficacy and effectiveness of ozone machines against SARS-CoV-2, and benefits and harms caused by using these cleaning technologies, including their impact on health. Alternative cleaning technologies, such as light-based technologies and hydrogen peroxide vapour, were also investigated. Findings indicate that gaseous ozone can inactivate different bacteria and viruses, although there is a lack of direct evidence investigating the effect of these cleaning methods on SARS-CoV-2 in real-world settings, specifically in schools. However, regarding harm, ozone is a highly reactive oxidising agent, and high concentrations can contribute to decay of building materials, and health issues (mainly respiratory) by direct exposure or by-product formation. Therefore, leading environmental health organisations do not recommend the use of ozone cleaning technologies in real-world settings, such as schools. Research and policy focus may need to shift towards other interventions that could help reduce transmission, and consequently minimise disruption to education.","Deborah Edwards; Judit Katalin Csontos; Elizabeth Gillen; Ruth Lewis; Alison Cooper; Micaela Gal; Rebecca-Jane Law; Adrian Edwards","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.21.22271281","20220222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27341,""
"Psychological and financial impacts of COVID-19-related travel measures: An international cross-sectional study","Background: The impact of COVID-19 international travel restrictions has to date, not been fully explored, and with the ongoing threat that new variants could potentially restrict movement further, it is important to consider the impacts that travel restrictions have on community members. This study aimed to evaluate the psychological and financial impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions on those separated from their partners or immediate families, as well as temporary visa holders who were unable to migrate. Methods: Between 4 November 2021 to 1 December 2021, we executed a cross-sectional online survey targeting three specific groups; (1) those stranded from their partners; (2) those stranded from immediate families; and (3) temporary visa holders unable to migrate or cross international borders. We collected data on respondents demographic profile; the nature of COVID-19-related travel impacts; depression, anxiety, and stress levels (using the validated DASS-21); and finally, data on respondents financial, employment and accommodation situation. Results: 1363 respondents located globally completed the survey. 71.2% reported financial stress, 76.8% reported moderate-to-extremely severe depression, 51.6% moderate-to-extremely severe anxiety, and 62.6% moderate-to-extremely severe stress levels. Statistically significant factors associated with moderate-to-extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress included being female, chronic illness, and experiencing financial stress. Employment during COVID-19, specifically essential services workers or unemployed, was associated with higher levels of anxiety and stress, with only essential workers being a predictor of higher stress severity. Factors that provided psychological protection included being older and having children. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to explore the impact COVID-19-related international travel restrictions have had on the financial status and psychological health of affected individuals. It highlights the significant human cost associated with the restrictions and identifies psychologically vulnerable populations. These results will help the design of targeted health and social policy responses.","Pippa McDermid; Soumya Sooppiyaragath; Adam Craig; Meru Sheel; Katrina Blazek; Siobhan Talty; Holly Seale","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.21.22271299","20220222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27342,""
"A Therapist's Guide to Treating Eating Disorders in a Social Media Age","Les troubles alimentaires et autres problemes cliniquement peu apparents comme l'alimentation dÃ©sordonnÃ©e et la honte/insatisfaction a l'Ã©gard de son image corporelle continuent de croÃ®tre dans notre sociÃ©tÃ©. Cela est particulierement le cas depuis que l'avenement de la COVID-19 a modifiÃ© notre paysage social, menant a un plus grand isolement, plus d'anxiÃ©tÃ© et au recours a la technologie pour le travail, les relations, et la vie. Notre Ã©poque de rÃ©seaux sociaux comporte a la fois des obstacles et des possibilitÃ©s en matiere de santÃ© mentale et de dÃ©veloppement de l'identitÃ©, surtout en ce qui concerne les personnes qui souffrent de troubles alimentaires et d'autres problemes connexes. Dans son premier ouvrage majeur, Shauna Frisbie navigue habilement parmi tous ces sujets, crÃ©ant ainsi une sorte de courtepointe a l'intention des cliniciens, aussi bien novices que chevronnÃ©s, afin de leur permettre de mieux comprendre dans quelle mesure on peut Ã©valuer, dÃ©monter, et exploiter la consommation des rÃ©seaux sociaux pour aider les clientes et les clients aux prises avec des troubles de l'alimentation. GuidÃ©e par les sujets centraux de la conscience de soi et du dÃ©veloppement de l'identitÃ©, ainsi que par des techniques de thÃ©rapie photographique, la Dre Frisbie crÃ©e une histoire captivante qui s'inspire a la fois de la recherche et d'Ã©tudes de cas tirÃ©s de sa propre pratique.Alternate :Eating disorders and other ""sub-clinical"" problems such as disordered eating and body shame/dissatisfaction grow more prevalent in our society. This is particularly true since the advent of COVID-19 changed our social landscape, leading to increases in isolation and anxiety and in the use of technology to work, to connect, and to live. Social media in this age present both barriers and possibilities for mental health and identity development, particularly for individuals who suffer from eating disorders and related problems. In her seminal first book, Shauna Frisbie deftly weaves through each of these topics, creating a tapestry for both novice and expert clinicians to view and understand how social media consumption can be assessed, dismantled, and harnessed to help clients who struggle with disordered eating. Guided by the central topics of selfhood and identity development and by the techniques of phototherapy, Dr. Frisbie creates a compelling story that draws on both research and case studies from her practice.","Sharpe, Hillary","https://doi.org/10.47634/cjcp.v55i3.73033","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Counselling and Psychotherapy (Online); 55(3):410-412, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27343,""

"Psychological Factors Related to Fear of COVID-19 in the General Salvadoran Population","Introduction: The objective of this article is to determine the psychological factors which are associated with the fear toward COVID-19 as experienced by the Salvadoran population in general. Method: This study is exploratory, with a cross-sectional design. For data collection a digital survey in Google Forms was used. There was a non-probabilistic sample of 328 Salvadorans. The mean age in general was 27.90 years-old, with a standard deviation (SD) of 9.10;the mean age for men was 29.05 years-old (SD = 9.94), and the mean age for woman was 27.42 years-old (SD = 8.70). Results: The results reveal the existence of small and medium correlations between anxiety, depression, instrumental support and positive social interaction with the variables of fear to COVID-19;the regression model predicted that the fear to COVID-19 depends on anxiety and affective support, predicting a 23% of fear to COVID- 19, with medium effect. Conclusion: This research suggests anxiety and affective support are explanation of the 23% of fear towards COVID-19 in Salvadoran population in general, findings provide useful information for future researches which perform a follow up or intervention in Salvadoran population in general.

"Determination of Ongoing Symptoms, Quality of Life Levels, and Risk Factors in Post-COVID-19 Patients","Objective: Studies have reported that most post-COVID-19 patients experience post-disease symptoms, but the results of these studies have not been interpreted correctly. The present study aimed to determine the ongoing symptoms and quality of life levels in post-COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional research was carried out with 151 post-COVID-19 patients in Turkey. A sociodemographic data form and the general quality of life scale EQ-5D-5L were used. Results: Most of the participants completed outpatient COVID-19 treatment (93.4%). Of the participants, 84.7% had at least one post-COVID-19 symptom and 41.7% had six or more symptoms. Fatigue (70.9%), joint pain (45.7%), and muscle pain (38.4%) were the most common post-COVID-19 symptoms. The longest-lasting post-COVID-19 symptoms were hair loss (104.2 +/- 51.5 days), memory problem (101.9 +/- 53.3 days), and depression (96.3 +/- 48.6 days). The mean of the visual analog scale was 83.9 +/- 16.1 and lower in individuals with six or more post-COVID-19 symptoms (p=0.001). In female participants, post-COVID-19 symptoms increased by 2.7 times (p=0.020). The prevalence of certain COVID-19 symptoms was significantly higher in females (loss of smell, hair loss, and heart palpitation), those aged 40 years and older (intermittent fever), and obese individuals (heart palpitation and intermittent fever). Conclusion: Considering that post-COVID-19 symptoms can be seen in patients with mild illness at a high rate and for a long period of time, patient follow-up should be given importance especially for the females, elderly, and obese.","Akova, I.; Gedikli, M.

"College-level Personal Health Courses: A Perspective for Improving Their Relevance and Reducing Health Disparities in the US","Objective: In this paper, we explore how the relevance of college-level personal health courses could be enhanced and how these courses could be leveraged for improving student health and providing access to information useful in reducing health disparities and improving overall health in adulthood. Methods: We examine and interpret literature on college student health and the content and delivery of personal health courses. Results: College-level personal health courses occur in many different academic units and through numerous delivery modes. College students' ability to access and use health information may be a social determinant of health later in life. Whereas specific course content varies, it underperforms in relevance to students' lives. Specific areas needing improvement are mental health, interpersonal relationships, food selection and preparation on a budget, harm reduction with respect to alcohol use, and other areas that currently receive insufficient attention. Conclusion: Personal health courses may have the potential to reduce health disparities if access to college and relevant health-related information can be operationalized better. Motivated by the impact on collegiate life by the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend research that leads to reform of college-level personal health courses responsive to student interests and delivery mechanisms that enhance motivation to learn, and result in reduced susceptibility to chronic diseases and improved adult health and quality of life.","Brewer, K.

"COVID-19 and the Mental Health of Frontline Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Study in Southwestern Iran","Background: Nurses, as frontline health workers, are exposed to the risks of adverse mental health outcomes due to their direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the mental health of frontline nurses in Behbahan, southwestern Iran. Methods: In this web-based cross-sectional study, data from 173 frontline nurses were collected in 3 COVID-19 referral hospitals in Behbahan, southwestern Iran. This study included demographic information and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the variables affecting mental health. Results: The present study included 173 frontline nurses (nurses and nurse assistants), 71.7% of whom were female and 28.3% of whom were male. Further, 76.3% of frontline nurses were suspected of poor mental health, and 23.7% were mentally healthy. The results of the multivariable logistic regression model showed that female participants had poorer mental health than men (odds ratio [OR], 2.51;95% CI, 1.16 - 5.41;P = 0.01). The mental health of nurses with a history of COVID-19 infection was poorer than that of nurses without a history of COVID-19 infection (OR, 3.3;95% CI, 1.42 - 7.53;P = 0.006). Conclusions: The findings of our study showed that female nurses with a history of COVID-19 were more at risk for poor mental health.

"Psychometric Properties of Coronavirus Anxiety Scale in Iranian Population","Background: One of the most common mental health-related issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic is high levels of distress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological well being and conservation of the general population are utterly significant components of facing COVID-19 pandemic. It seems that despite the availability of highly standardized tools to investigate COVID19-related anxiety, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) can be helpful in different populations due to its short design. Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Persian (Iranian) version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (P-CAS). Methods: In this web-based cross-sectional study, 305 individuals (184 females vs. 121 males) participated. All participants were evaluated by five questionnaires, including the P-CAS, COVID Stress Scales (CSS), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Whiteley Index (WI), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Cronbach's alpha, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and correlation coefficient were used for data analysis using SPSS 23 and AMOS-23 software. Results: The results of CFA demonstrated that the factor structure of the P-CAS was good, and the scale had an appropriate internal consistency (alpha = 0.80). A satisfactory convergent validity was shown due to positive correlations of the P-CAS with the related scales. Test-retest reliability of P-CAS was also satisfactory (ICC = 0.95). Conclusions: According to our results, the P-CAS is a valid and reliable instrument to evaluate the severity of dysfunctional anxiety due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Abasi, I.; Fard, A.

"Factors That Affect Sleep Quality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia","Objective: Sleep is important for metabolism and the immune system. Disturbed sleep may be a risk factor for poor recovery from diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has been the most common cause of hospitalization in the last year. This study aimed to evaluate the sleep quality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the factors that affect their sleep quality. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were hospitalized at a pandemic clinic. The demographic data, symptoms, laboratory parameters, and hospitalization duration were evaluated. After the first night of admission, the patients completed Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Results: This study included 105 patients, of whom 55 were with mild-moderate pneumonia and 50 with severe pneumonia. The mean value of the total PSQI score was 8.43Â±2.03 in the non-severe group and 12.64Â±2.24 in the severe group. Positive correlations were found between the total PSQI score and age, HAD-A score, HAD-D score, length of hospital stay, and ferritin. Negatively significant correlations were found between the PSQI score and leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, albumin, and oxygen saturation. Independent factors, such as disease severity, HADS scores, oxygen saturation, and dyspnea, were associated with the total PSQI score (R2=0.630). Conclusion: Patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia had poor sleep quality. Sleep quality was affected by disease severity. Anxiety and depression levels, oxygen saturation, and dyspnea are associated with sleep quality in these patients. AmaÃ§: Uyku, metabolizma ve bagisiklik sistemi iÃ§in Ã¶nemlidir.

"Effect of pandemic on Quality of life in Diabetics (QOLID) assessment: Data from a teach in hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India","Background: Quality of life in Diabetics (QOLID) questionnaire is a validated tool to assess the quality of life affected by diagnosed diabetic patients and has 8 sub domains, which are essential factors that have proven effect on the management. In a state of art Diabetic clinic in Bhubaneswar city, the tool was used to add more quality to diabetic management. Methods: The ongoing assessment through the months of 2020 (study period being from December 2019 to August 2020), offered an opportunity to assess the effect of the pandemic on QOLID scores and review some nascent or strong factors which may be affecting chronic disease management. Results: Complete data could be collected from 599 subjects, 343 from pre pandemic and 256 from pandemic period. The overall scores which were on 100, did not show any significant difference for pre covid and the Covid period, interestingly nearly 1.93 points better in Covid period (69.69 +/- 11.10 vs71.62 +/- 8.49;p=0.396). Mild difference in overall scores of 4.82 points is seen in females in Covid period;and as seen in age group data maximum gain in sub domains, more for females is seen in the emotional and mental health. Though women reporting to the clinic in both periods are usually in 1:2 ratios, as against men;but QOLID scores in both men and women in Covid period was 71 to 80 points. After the univariate analysis for significant factors, it was that Covid (1.50;1.08 - 2.07) ;compliance to medications (2.27;1.48 - 3.50) and reporting of all diabetic complications especially that of eye and depression are coming out to be strong associative factors to affect QOLID scores. Interestingly, rising education has a protective effect on QOLID scores that was significant as higher awareness and better job or earning opportunities may be a contributor for higher QOLID scores for the well educated. Conclusion: This brings out a strong emphasis on QOL assessments to be made an inbuilt part of Diabetic management at all centers to maximize treatment outcomes","Meher, D.; Kar, S.","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_287_21","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care; 10(10):3780-3784, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27355,""

"COVID-19 Vaccination Improved Psychological Distress (Anxiety and Depression Scores) in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: A Prospective Study","The purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 on anxiety and depression scores in patients with different modalities of chronic kidney disease. One hundred and seventeen renal patients (50 hemodialysis patients, 13 peritoneal dialysis patients, 32 kidney transplants, and 22 advanced chronic kidney disease patients at pre-dialysis care) were evaluated for depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and perceived fears and resources with standardized (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and self-reported questionnaires. The measure points were before vaccination and 15 days after vaccination. The main finding of the study was that there was a decrease in the global mean of normal scores for anxiety and depression symptoms in chronic kidney disease patients post-vaccination. We did not find statistically significant differences in depression or anxiety scores, nor any HRQOL differences between the treatment groups. The three main fears reported by the participants at baseline were those of adverse effects, not getting the vaccine, and lack of information. These findings highlight the potential interest of assessing psychological variables related to the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.

"Strategic Assessment of Neighbourhood Environmental Impacts on Mental Health in the Lisbon Region (Portugal): A Strategic Focus and Assessment Framework at the Local Level","Scientific evidence shows that each place/environment generates specific conditions with associated impacts on the mental health and well-being of the population. A holistic, multilevel and integrated environmental approach to mental health enhances the understanding of this phenomena, supporting the local decision-making processes to improve spatial planning of neighbourhood environments. The aim of this study is to develop a strategic assessment framework, based on four municipalities in the Lisbon Region (Portugal), that explores policy and planning initiatives capable of generating favourable neighbourhood environmental conditions for mental health while also detecting risks. Using baseline results of significant statistical associations between individualsâ€™ perceptions of their neighbourhood environment and their mental health in the Lisbon Region, a Strategic Focus on Environmental and Mental Health Assessment framework (SEmHA) was built, by applying the methodology â€œStrategic Thinking for Sustainabilityâ€ in Strategic Environmental Assessment, developed by PartidÃ¡rio in 2012. Taking into account the promotion of the populationâ€™s mental health, four critical decision factors of neighbourhood environments were identified: (1) public space quality (e.g., improving sense of place), (2) physical environment quality (e.g., low levels of noise exposure), (3) professional qualification and creation of economic activities (e.g., attracting new economic activities), and (4) services and facilities (e.g., improving access to health and education services). The proposed strategic focus and assessment framework contributes to ensuring that interventions in neighbourhood environments truly achieve community mental health benefits and reduce inequalities, thus helping policy makers to assess impacts at the local level.","Loureiro, Adriana, Maria do RosÃ¡rio, PartidÃ¡rio, Santana, Paula","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031547","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(3):1547, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27358,""
"Adolescent Positivity and Future Orientation, Parental Psychological Control, and Young Adult Internalising Behaviours during COVID-19 in Nine Countries","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many young adults&rsquo;lives educationally, economically, and personally. This study investigated associations between COVID-19-related disruption and perception of increases in internalising symptoms among young adults and whether these associations were moderated by earlier measures of adolescent positivity and future orientation and parental psychological control. Participants included 1329 adolescents at Time 1, and 810 of those participants as young adults (M age = 20, 50.4% female) at Time 2 from 9 countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States). Drawing from a larger longitudinal study of adolescent risk taking and young adult competence, this study controlled for earlier levels of internalising symptoms during adolescence in examining these associations. Higher levels of adolescent positivity and future orientation as well as parent psychological control during late adolescence helped protect young adults from sharper perceived increases in anxiety and depression during the first nine months of widespread pandemic lockdowns in all nine countries. Findings are discussed in terms of how families in the 21st century can foster greater resilience during and after adolescence when faced with community-wide stressors, and the results provide new information about how psychological control may play a protective role during times of significant community-wide threats to personal health and welfare.","Skinner, Ann T.; Ã‡iftÃ§i, Leyla, Jones, Sierra, Klotz, Eva, OndruÅ¡kovÃ¡, Tamara, Lansford, Jennifer E.; Alampay, Liane PeÃ±a, Al-Hassan, Suha M.; Bacchini, Dario, Bornstein, Marc H.; Chang, Lei, Deater-Deckard, Kirby, Di Giunta, Laura, Dodge, Kenneth A.; Gurdal, Sevtap, Liu, Qin, Long, Qian, Oburu, Paul, Pastorelli, Concetta, Sorbring, Emma, Tapanya, Sombat, Steinberg, Laurence, Uribe Tirado, Liliana Maria, Yotanyamaneewong, Saengduean","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11020075","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(2):75, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27359,""

"Relationships between Dairy and Calcium Intake and Mental Health Measures of Higher Education Students in the United States: Outcomes from Moderation Analyses","Background: The prevalence of mental health concerns among university students in the United States (U.S.) continues to increase, while current treatments, including medication and counseling, present shortcomings. Higher dairy and calcium intakes are associated with protective effects on mental health;however, previous studies have focused on investigating singular relationships between dairy and calcium intakes and mental health measures. A more complex exploration of these relationships is warranted to better examine whether increasing dairy and calcium intakes could serve as an intervention to improve mental health. The present study sought to further characterize the relationships between dairy and calcium intake, perceived stress, and a variety of mental health measures using linear regression and moderation analyses. Methods: The present cross-sectional study involved students studying at three large U.S. universities, and data collection occurred from April to May 2020 when students were learning remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey comprising validated tools was distributed among students to assess dairy and calcium intake, perceived stress, anxiety, negative and positive moods, rumination, and resilience, sleep quality and duration, dietary risk, and physical activity. Results: A total of 1233 students completed the study. Higher dairy and calcium intake was coincident with lower perceived stress and higher positive mood scores, while higher calcium intake was also coincident with lower anxiety, rumination, and higher resilience scores. Additionally, as calcium intake increased, the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety and the relationship between perceived stress and negative mood weakened. Dairy intake did not have this effect. Conclusions: Based on the results, and considering that calcium is a shortfall nutrient, universities should consider initiating programs and public health campaigns to promote dairy and calcium intake among this population.","Du, Chen, Hsiao, Pao Ying, Ludy, Mary-Jon, Tucker, Robin M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040775","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(4):775, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27361,""
"Relationship between Recovery from COVID-19-Induced Smell Loss and General and Oral Health Factors","Background and Objectives: Loss of smell is one of the strongest predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can persist long after other symptoms have resolved. &ldquo;Long&rdquo;cases (&gt;28 days) of smell dysfunction present future challenges to medical and dental professionals, as there is a lack of evidence on the causes and any exacerbating or relieving factors. This study aimed to explore the persistence of COVID-19-induced smell loss and association with physical, lifestyle and oral health factors. Materials and Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey of 235 participants. Recovery of smell was explored, comparing rapid recovery (&le;28 days) with prolonged recovery (&gt;28 days). Associative factors included age, sex, illness severity, diet, BMI, vitamin D supplementation, antidepressants, alcohol use, smoking, brushing frequency, flossing, missing teeth, appliances and number of dental restorations. Results: Smell loss showed 87% resolution within 30 days. Prolonged smell loss was significantly associated with older age (mean &plusmn;95%, CI = 31.53 &plusmn;1.36 years for rapid recovery vs. mean &plusmn;95%, CI = 36.0 &plusmn;3 years for prolonged recovery, p = 0.003) and increased self-reported illness severity (mean &plusmn;95%, CI = 4.39 &plusmn;0.27 for rapid recovery vs. 5.01 &plusmn;0.54 for prolonged recovery, p = 0.016). Fisher&rsquo;s exact test revealed flossing was associated with rapid recovery, with flossers comprising 75% of the rapid-recovery group, compared to 56% in the prolonged-recovery group (odds ratio &plusmn;95%, CI = 2.26 (1.23&ndash;4.15), p = 0.01). All other factors were not significantly associated (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Increased age and illness severity were associated with prolonged smell recovery. Use of floss was the only modifiable factor associated with rapid recovery of smell loss. As 87% of cases resolve within 30 days, future studies may benefit from targeted recruitment of individuals experiencing prolonged sense loss. This would increase statistical confidence when declaring no association with the other factors assessed, avoiding type II errors.","Catton, Georgia, Gardner, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58020283","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(2):283, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27362,""
"Why Was the Perception of Human Rights Respect and Care Satisfaction So High in Users of Italian Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The aim of this study was to compare users&rsquo;and mental health workers&rsquo;(MHW) perception of respect of human rights and job/care satisfaction in mental health services in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of users and MHW of Sardinia, Italy, fulfilled the &ldquo;Well-Being at work and respect for human rights questionnaire&rdquo;(WWRR). The study included 240 MHW and 200 users. Users showed a higher level of satisfaction of care than MHW of work, and a higher perception of the satisfaction of users and human rights respected for health workers. Both user and MHW responses were about 85% of the maximum score, except for satisfaction with resources. Responses were higher for users, but users and MHW both showed high levels of satisfaction. In previous surveys, MHW of Sardinia showed higher scores in all items of WWRR, except for satisfaction with resources, compared with workers from other health sectors of the same region, and with MHW from other countries. The low score for satisfaction with resources (in users and staff) is consistent with a progressive impoverishment of resources for mental health care in Italy. The study, although confirming the validity of the Italian model, fully oriented towards community, sets off an alarm bell on the risks resulting from the decrease in resources.","Carta, Mauro G.; Sancassiani, Federica, Ganassi, Ruben, Melis, Paola, Dâ€™Oca, Silvia, Atzeni, Michela, Velluzzi, Fermanda, Ferreli, Caterina, Atzori, Laura, Aviles-Gonzales, Cesar I.; Serrentino, Maria Roberta, Angermeyer, Matthias C.; Cossu, Giulia","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11040997","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(4):997, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27363,""

When adjusting for confounding variables, it was observed that the physically active and non-sedentary profile was associated with better general mental health (p &lt; 0.01) in contrast to those who are physically active and sedentary. Conclusions: Chilean university students with a physically inactive and sedentary profile during the pandemic presented worse well-being and mental health, with a sedentary lifestyle being one of the variables that most affects the mental health of these students. Therefore, measures should be implemented to encourage this population to maintain adequate levels of physical activity and reduce sedentary times.","Reyes-Molina, Daniel, Alonso-Cabrera, JesÃºs, Nazar, Gabriela, Parra-Rizo, Maria Antonia, Zapata-Lamana, Rafael, Sanhueza-Campos, Cristian, Cigarroa, Igor","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042107","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4):2107, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27367,""
"Reflections on Experiencing Parental Bereavement as a Young Person: A Retrospective Qualitative Study","Background: It is estimated that approximately 41,000 children and young people experience the death of a parent each year. Grief responses, such as anxiety and depression, can follow. This research investigated the adult reflections of experiencing parental death as a young person. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults (N = 14;female n = 8) who experienced parental death as a young person, which occurred over 5 years ago (time since death, M = 12.9 years;age at death, M = 16.4 years;age at interview, M = 30.9 years). The data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. Results: Seven themes revealed that parental bereavement can lead to (1) &ldquo;Distance and isolation&rdquo;and is an (2) &ldquo;Emotional journey&rdquo;with (3) a &ldquo;Physical impact&rdquo;. Many experienced (4) &ldquo;Post-traumatic growth&rdquo;but acknowledged that (5) &ldquo;Life will never be the same&rdquo;, highlighting the importance of (6) &ldquo;Support and understanding&rdquo;and triggers for (7) &ldquo;Re-grief&rdquo;. Conclusions: Parental bereavement has significant emotional and physical consequences, but can also lead to personal growth. Talking therapies were rarely accessed, often due to a lack of awareness or desire to engage, revealing a translational gap between existing support services and uptake. Enabling open conversations about grief and identifying suitable support is a public health priority. This need has been amplified since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be a trigger for grief empathy and re-grief in those who have already been bereaved.","Chater, Angel Marie, Howlett, Neil, Shorter, Gillian W.; Zakrzewski-Fruer, Julia K.; Williams, Jane","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042083","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4):2083, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27368,""
"Sensory Processing, Perceived Stress and Burnout Symptoms in a Working Population during the COVID-19 Crisis","Although previous research suggests an association between sensory processing and perceived stress in a broad spectrum of mental health conditions, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon occurs independently from psychopathology. The present study investigated the association between sensory processing patterns, perceived stress and occupational burnout as a stress-related condition in a working population. We focused on different aspects of sensory processing and used the momentum of a particularly stressful period: during the first months of the global COVID-19 crisis. A total of 116 workers at a mental healthcare institution in The Netherlands completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT). Our results demonstrated that higher scores on sensory sensitivity and low registration were associated with higher scores on perceived stress and core burnout symptoms. Sensory hypersensitivity was also associated with more secondary burnout symptoms. Associations were not driven by underlying sensory-related disorders (e.g., ASD or ADHD). In conclusion, sensory processing difficulties are relevant predictors of stress and occupational burnout, also in healthy employees. This phenomenon warrants further attention, as relatively simple adjustments in working environment may possess important preventive effects.","van den Boogert, Frank, Spaan, Pascalle, Sizoo, Bram, Bouman, Yvonne H.

"Levels, Predictors, and Distribution of Interpersonal Solidarity During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since introducing the first non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to decelerate the spread of the virus, European governments have highlighted the role of &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;. However, the role and levels of solidarity, especially during the past lockdowns, is uncertain. The present study thus explores the levels, the role, and the distribution of received and demonstrated interpersonal solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pooled cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2020 to March 2021 in Germany, including 19,977 participants. Levels of solidarity between the first and the second lockdowns in Germany were compared, possible predictors were examined, and three clusters were defined to unveil distributional patterns of solidarity reception and/or demonstration. To compare solidarity levels between the first and the second lockdowns in Germany, a dummy-coded lockdown variable was introduced and regressed on the two solidarity items. To identify predictors of received and demonstrated solidarity, two multiple linear regression models were computed, testing several demographic and psychological factors. For further exploratory analyses, clusters of &ldquo;helpers&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-helpers&rdquo;, and &ldquo;help-receivers and helpers&rdquo;were computed based on a k-means cluster analysis. Results revealed a lower level of solidarity during the second lockdown compared with the first one. Demonstrated solidarity was positively predicted by adherent safety behavior to avoid COVID-19 infection and by middle age, and negatively by depression symptoms, male gender, and high age. Received solidarity was positively predicted by higher age, by both adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior in avoidance of COVID-19 infection, and by lower educational level. &ldquo;Helpers&rdquo;reported little received solidarity but demonstrated high solidarity, &ldquo;non-helpers&rdquo;showed both little demonstrated and received solidarity, and &ldquo;help-receivers and helpers&rdquo;showed middle&ndash;high received and demonstrated solidarity. The three clusters differed the most regarding the variables of age, adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior, fear of COVID-19, subjective risk perceptions regarding contraction of COVID-19 and the respective consequences, and trust in governmental interventions in response to COVID-19. The decrease in interpersonal solidarity over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its predictors, should be considered regarding prospective impositions. Furthermore, as depressive symptoms were identified to negatively predict interpersonal solidarity, the adequate provision of mental health services, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, becomes even more important.","Kaup, Theodor, Schweda, Adam, Krakowczyk, Julia, Dinse, Hannah, Skoda, Eva-Maria, Teufel, Martin, BÃ¤uerle, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042041","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4):2041, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27370,""
"Professional Mental Health Help-Seeking Amongst Afghan and Iraqi Refugees in Australia: Understanding Predictors Five Years Post Resettlement","The current longitudinal study sought to identify predictors of professional help seeking for mental health problems amongst Afghan and Iraqi refugees five years post-settlement utilising the Building a New Life in Australia dataset (BNLA). Data were collected via face-to-face or phone interviews across five waves from October 2013 to March 2018. Afghan and Iraqi born refugees numbering 1180 and over 18 years of age with a permanent humanitarian visa were included in this study. The results suggest differences in help-seeking behaviors amongst the two ethnic groups. Amongst the Afghan sample, older adults with high psychological distress were more likely to seek help, while living in regional Australia, not requiring interpreters, and knowing how to find out information about government services were related to lower likelihood of help-seeking. Within the Iraqi sample, poor overall health and knowing how to find out about services were related to a greater likelihood of help-seeking, while fewer financial hardships decreased the likelihood of help-seeking. Amongst those with probable PTSD, disability was associated with an increased likelihood of help-seeking while experiencing fewer financial hardships and living in regional Australia resulted in a lower likelihood of help-seeking in this group. These results have implications for promotional material and mental health interventions, suggesting that more integrated services tailored to specific characteristics of ethnic groups are needed.","Tomasi, Ana-Marija, Slewa-Younan, Shameran, Narchal, Renu, Rioseco, Pilar","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031896","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1896, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27371,""
"The Effect of Periodontal Treatment on Clinical and Biological Indicators, Quality of Life, and Oral Health in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Quasi-Experimental Study","Non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) has been shown to have systemic effects. It has been suggested that, similar to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontitis (PD) has an impact on general health, in terms of psychological, physical, and social aspects. This study determines the effect of periodontal treatment in RA activity, health-related quality of life, and oral health self-perception before and after periodontal treatment in RA patients. A quasi-experimental, prospective, non-randomized study was conducted, and 52 patients were included in the study. Periodontal parameters and the instruments disease activity score-28 (DAS-28), SF-36, and OHIP-14 were measured at baseline and at 3 months after NSPT. All differences were statistically assessed. The study protocol was registered in Clinical Trials (NCT04658615). No statistically significant differences were found in the scores of DAS-28 before and after the intervention in the group with PD and reduced periodontium. When the effect of periodontal treatment was analyzed in the group of 29 patients who were followed up, it was found that there were statistically significant differences before and after in variables such as psychological distress, emotional role, and mental health, which indicates an improvement in the scores of these variables. NSPT influenced the health-related quality of life measured with SF-36 and OHIP-14 in patients with RA. In conclusion, NSPT has an effect on self-reported quality of life and health indicators more than the RA activity as measured with DAS-28. However, the clinical effect of periodontal treatment in RA patients provides important data to support periodontal care in patients.","Posada-LÃ³pez, Adriana, Botero, Javier Enrique, Pineda-Tamayo, Ricardo Antonio, Agudelo-SuÃ¡rez, AndrÃ©s A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031789","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1789, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27372,""

"Using a Loneliness Measure to Screen for Risk of Mental Health Problems: A Replication in Two Nationally Representative Cohorts","Background: Loneliness co-occurs alongside many mental health problems and is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. It could therefore be a phenomenon of interest to clinicians as an indicator of generalised risk for psychopathology. The present study tested whether a short measure of loneliness can accurately classify individuals who are at increased risk of common mental health problems. Methods: Data were drawn from two nationally representative cohorts: the age-18 wave of the UK-based Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study and the age-38 wave of the New Zealand-based Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. In both cohorts, loneliness was assessed using the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, plus two stand-alone items about feeling alone and feeling lonely. Outcome measures consisted of diagnoses of depression and anxiety and self-reports of self-harm/suicide attempts, assessed via a structured interview. Results: ROC curve analysis showed that the Loneliness Scale had fair accuracy in classifying individuals meeting criteria for all three outcomes, with a cut-off score of 5 (on a scale from 3 to 9) having the strongest empirical support. Both of the stand-alone items showed modest sensitivity and specificity but were more limited in their flexibility. The findings were replicated across the two cohorts, indicating that they are applicable both to younger and older adults. In addition, the accuracy of the loneliness scale in detecting mental health problems was comparable to a measure of poor sleep quality, a phenomenon which is often included in screening tools for depression and anxiety. Conclusions: These findings indicate that a loneliness measure could have utility in mental health screening contexts, as well as in research.","Matthews, Timothy, Bryan, Bridget T.; Danese, Andrea, Meehan, Alan J.; Poulton, Richie, Arseneault, Louise","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031641","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1641, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27374,""
"Predictors of Postpartum Depression among Italian Women: A Longitudinal Study","Introduction: Postpartum depression is commonly experienced by mothers worldwide and is associated with anxiety disorders, parenting stress, and other forms of distress, which may lead to a complex illness condition. Several studies have investigated the risk factors for this disorder, including biological and socio-demographic variables, medical and obstetric factors, and psychological and relational dimensions. The present study aimed to describe the psychological status of mothers up to 12 months postpartum, and to investigate the predictors of depressive symptoms at 12 months postpartum, considering obstetric factors along with psychological and relational variables. Methods: A sample of 137 women completed a questionnaire composed of a sheet on anamnestic and obstetric information and the following scales: Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory;Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale;Parenting Stress Index (Short Form);Dyadic Adjustment Scale;and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Data were collected at four assessment times: 2â€“3 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum. Results: Findings showed that the highest percentage of women with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (state and trait) and depression was found at 12 months postpartum, which indicated that this was the most critical time. The quality of childbirth experience and trait anxiety at three months postpartum emerged as significant predictors of postpartum depression at 12 months. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of providing stable programs (such as educational programs) to mothers in the first year postpartum. Furthermore, because the quality of the childbirth experience is one of the most important predictors of PPD at 12 months postpartum, effort should be made by healthcare professionals to guarantee a positive experience to all women to reduce possible negative long-term consequences of this experience.","Molgora, Sara, Saita, Emanuela, Maurizio Barbieri, Carones, Ferrazzi, Enrico, Facchin, Federica","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031553","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1553, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27375,""
"Relationships between Volunteering, Neighbourhood Deprivation and Mental Wellbeing across Four British Birth Cohorts: Evidence from 10 Years of the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Volunteering is associated with greater mental, physical and social wellbeing. However, less is known about whether the health benefits of volunteering vary with two sets of factors known to shape population health and health-related behaviours: (1) age and birth cohort, and (2) place of residence. This study examined how these factors influence the relationship between volunteering and self-reported mental health using five waves of data from Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) enriched with information on neighbourhood deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015). Two self-reported mental health and wellbeing outcomes were examined: mental distress (GHQ-12) and health-related quality of life (SF-12). The sample was stratified by cohort: pre-1945 (born before 1945), Baby Boomers (born 1945â€“1964), Gen X (born 1965â€“1979), and Millennials (born from 1980). Fixed-effects regressions revealed that volunteering was associated with reduced levels of mental distress and greater levels of health-related quality of life in older generations, but not amongst younger generations. No moderating effect of area deprivation was found. This study suggests that generational social attitudes and changes in how volunteering is portrayed and delivered could influence not only whether people volunteer, but also whether doing so bolsters health.","Hei Wan, Mak, Coulter, Rory, Fancourt, Daisy","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031531","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1531, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27376,""
"Social Determinants of Health and Depression among African American Adults: A Scoping Review of Current Research","Depression in the United States (US) is increasing across all races and ethnicities and is attributed to multiple social determinants of health (SDOH). For members of historically marginalized races and ethnicities, depression is often underreported and undertreated, and can present as more severe. Limited research explores multiple SDOH and depression among African American adults in the US. Guided by Healthy People (HP) 2030, and using cross-disciplinary mental health terminology, we conducted a comprehensive search to capture studies specific to African American adults in the US published after 2016. We applied known scoping review methodology and followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. From 12,315 initial results, 60 studies were included in our final sample. Most studies explored the HP 2030 Social and Community Context domain, with a heavy focus on discrimination and social support;no studies examined Health Care Access and Quality. Researchers typically utilized cross-sectional, secondary datasets;no qualitative studies were included. We recommend research that comprehensively examines mental health risk and protective factors over the life course within, not just between, populations to inform tailored health promotion and public policy interventions for improving SDOH and reducing racial and ethnic health disparities.","Yelton, Brooks, Friedman, Daniela B.; Noblet, Samuel, Lohman, Matthew C.; Arent, Michelle A.; Macauda, Mark M.; Sakhuja, Mayank, Leith, Katherine H.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031498","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1498, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27377,""
"Exploring the Physiological and Psychological Effects of Digital Shinrin-Yoku and Its Characteristics as a Restorative Environment","This study investigated the physiological and psychological therapeutic effects of a digital Shinrin-yoku environment constructed indoors in an urban facility as well as the characteristics of the environment that contribute to restorativeness (restorative traits). We measured the fluctuations in the physical and mental states of 25 subjects by obtaining both beforeâ€“after measurements and continuous measurements while exposed to a digital Shinrin-yoku environment that reproduced visual, auditory, and olfactory elements. The results demonstrated that the parasympathetic nerve activity was significantly increased and that the heart rate was significantly decreased during the exposure compared with that during the resting state. As for mood, five of the six Profile of Mood States (POMS) scales (â€œTensionâ€“Anxiety,â€ â€œDepression,â€ â€œAngerâ€“Hostility,â€ â€œFatigue,â€ and â€œConfusionâ€) were significantly decreased after the experience. In addition, psychological restorative effects were also confirmed, with a significant decrease in â€œnegative affectâ€ (measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)) and a significant increase in the sense of restorativeness (Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS)) after the experience. In contrast, comparing the digital Shinrin-yoku environment with the actual forest environment and the urban environment using POMS, PANAS, ROS, and Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), the psychological effects and environmental traits of the digital Shinrin-yoku were found to be considerably similar to those of the actual forest environment.","Takayama, Norimasa, Morikawa, Takeshi, Koga, Kazuko, Miyazaki, Yoichi, Harada, Kenichi, Fukumoto, Keiko, Tsujiki, Yuji","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031202","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1202, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27378,""
"The UP150: A Multifactorial Environmental Intervention to Promote Employee Physical and Mental Well-Being","Physical activity (PA) is a major health factor and studies suggest workplaces could promote PA by modifying office design, motivational strategies and technology.

Forty-five employees were randomly divided into the experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups. The PF was assessed pre-post intervention using the cubo fitness test (CFT), the amount of PA was evaluated using the IPAQ questionnaire and accelerometers while the workload was assessed using the NASA-TLX questionnaire and psycho-physical health by using the SF-12 questionnaire. The EG worked in UP150 offices while the CG worked in their usual offices for 8 weeks. The EG and CG came back 4 weeks after the intervention for CFT retention. The EG improved CFT motor efficiency and the amount of moderate PA, while it reduced mental load. The EG retained reached motor efficiency levels 4 weeks after the intervention. No differences were found in IPAQ. The UP150 demonstrated to be a proactive environment and to be efficient in the promotion of PA, improving PF and mental health while decreasing mental load.","Invernizzi, Pietro Luigi, Signorini, Gabriele, Scurati, Raffaele, Michielon, Giovanni, Benedini, Stefano, Bosio, Andrea, Staiano, Walter","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031175","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1175, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27379,""

"Anxiety Levels among Polish and Turkish Dentists during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Working conditions, work-related stressors and high risk of infection, as well as the fear of contagion and spreading the disease to family members, may have influenced dentists&rsquo;mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anxiety levels among Polish and Turkish dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate any relevant predictors. The study was an anonymous online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study that was conducted among dentists from two countries: Poland and Turkey. In total 400 dentists (200 from each country) participated in the study. The survey consisted of two parts: part 1 comprised demographic data, including age, gender, country of origin, COVID-19 infection history, place of work and lockdown history;part 2 was based on the State&ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The mean trait and state anxiety levels of the Polish dentists was statistically significantly lower than that of the Turkish dentists (p = 0.000;p &lt; 0.05). However, Polish dentists had higher state anxiety levels than trait levels, while both types of anxiety among Turkish dentists were almost at the same level. The number of dentists who suffered from COVID-19 was found to be statistically significantly higher in Poland (54%) than in Turkey (16%) (p = 0.000;p &lt; 0.05). The percentage of dentists reporting anxiety was 51% in Poland and 95.5% in Turkey. Polish dentists reported a lower mean anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic than the dentists in Turkey but their anxiety levels were more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as they had a higher difference between their state and trait anxiety levels. The higher coronavirus infection rate and lack of governmental lockdowns of dental practices during the pandemic in Poland compared with those in Turkey may explain the difference in the state and trait anxiety levels.","Olszewska-Czyz, Iwona, Sozkes, Sarkis","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020357","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(2):357, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27381,""
"Can &ldquo;Free-From&rdquo;Food Consumption Be a Signal of Psychological Distress during COVID-19?","During the last year, feelings of anxiety and depression were registered among the Italian population and affected food consumption. Among the research that explored people&rsquo;s dietary inclinations during the current pandemic, no previous studies have explored psychological factors associated with the &ldquo;free-from&rdquo;dietary pattern. Our study is aimed at understanding if free-from food consumption orientations can be associated with negative psychological distress. We conducted a web-based survey between 27/10/2020&ndash;03/12/2020 on a representative sample of 963 Italians. Psychometric scales and ad hoc items were used to measure people&rsquo;s levels of anxiety, depression, fear for contagion and consumption orientation towards &ldquo;free-from&rdquo;foods. Of the sample, 18.2% frequently purchased gluten-free food products and 22.5% purchased lactose-free foods. Most of the population (44.1%) feels very at risk of contagion from COVID-19 and suffers from anxiety (52.8%) and depression (55.0%). Free-from consumers are more anxious, depressed, have higher risk of contagion, and are younger than the non-consumers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, free-from foods can represent for the people a way to restore control over their lifestyle, which was denied during the emergency. However, we highlight possible negative long-term effects of this dietary choice.","Savarese, Mariarosaria, Castellini, Greta, Morelli, Lorenzo, Graffigna, Guendalina","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11040513","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Foods; 11(4):513, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27382,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People with Lived Experience of Mental Illness Integrated into Community-Based Psychosocial Rehabilitation Structures in Portugal","Background: To analyze the prevalence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with lived experience of mental illness integrated into community-based psychosocial rehabilitation structures in Portugal. Methods: One hundred and thirty-nine people with lived experience of mental illness integrated into community-based psychosocial rehabilitation structures in Portugal answered an online survey that included dimensions related to COVID-19 pandemic prevalence, routine/lifestyle, social support, access to health care, mental health and well-being during the pandemic and confinement, and life satisfaction and postpandemic future expectations. Results: The results point to a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this sample. High levels of resilience and mental well-being were identified in the individuals. We also found that participants were satisfied with the social support during this phase and their routine/lifestyle. Conclusions: The study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic seems not to have had a significant negative impact on people with experience of mental illness integrated into community-based psychosocial rehabilitation structures in Portugal. However, more research in this field should be done in the future.","Costa, Ana, Santos, Marta, SimÃµes de Almeida, Raquel, Monteiro, FÃ¡tima, Marques, AntÃ³nio","https://doi.org/10.3390/covid2020015","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: COVID; 2(2):200-210, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27383,""
"Examining Association of Personality Characteristics and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Post-COVID Syndrome","Background: We aimed to evaluate personality traits in patients with post-COVID syndrome, as well as the association with neuropsychiatric symptoms present in this disorder. Methods: The Big Five Structure Inventory was administered to 93 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome as defined by the WHO and to demographically matched controls. We also performed a comprehensive evaluation of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, cognitive function, and olfactory function. Results: Patients with post-COVID syndrome scored lower for emotional stability, equanimity, positive mood, and self-control. Extraversion, emotional stability, and openness correlated negatively with anxiety and depression levels. Conscientiousness correlated negatively with anxiety. No statistically significant correlations were observed between personality traits and cognitive function, sleep quality, olfactory function, or fatigue. Personality scores explained 36.3% and 41% of the variance in scores on the anxiety and depression scales, respectively. Two personality profiles with lower levels of emotional stability were associated with depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Our study shows higher levels of neuroticism in patients with post-COVID syndrome. Personality traits were predictive of the presence of depression and anxiety, but not cognitive function, sleep quality, or fatigue, in the context of post-COVID syndrome. These findings may have implications for the detection of patients at risk of depression and anxiety in post-COVID syndrome, and for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Delgado-Alonso, Cristina, Valles-Salgado, MarÃ­a, Delgado-Ãlvarez, Alfonso, GÃ³mez-Ruiz, Natividad, Yus, Miguel, Polidura, Carmen, PÃ©rez-Izquierdo, Carlos, Marcos, Alberto, Gil, MarÃ­a JosÃ©, MatÃ­as-Guiu, Jorge, Matias-Guiu, Jordi A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12020265","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 12(2):265, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27384,""
"Influences of Dog Attachment and Dog Walking on Reducing Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed people&rsquo;s lives and increased their vulnerability to physical and mental health hazards. While Korea has avoided nationwide lockdown measures since the COVID-19 outbreak, the prolonged restrictions and social isolation measures have resulted in detrimental psychological effects, such as increased anxiety, boredom, and loneliness. The present study investigated dog attachment and changes in dog walking during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of dog attachment and dog walking on the loneliness of Korean dog owners. An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in the fall of 2021 in which 249 dog owners responded to questionnaires that asked questions about dog attachment, their perception of dog walking, and their feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most dog owners responded that they spent more time with their dogs and developed a stronger bond with them during the pandemic. Additionally, respondents stated that they walked their dogs more often than they did before COVID-19 and that their dogs aided in reducing loneliness. We found that dog walking directly affected attachment and indirectly influenced the loneliness of dog owners. Further research is required to determine how dog walking impacts positive psychological effects and promote dog walking.","Lee, Hyung-Sook, Song, Jin-Gyeoung, Lee, Jeong-Yeon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12040483","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Animals; 12(4):483, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27385,""
"Viability Study of Machine Learning-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Pandemic Impact in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Patients","Background: Machine learning modelling can provide valuable support in different areas of mental health, because it enables to make rapid predictions and therefore support the decision making, based on valuable data. However, few studies have applied this method to predict symptomsâ€™ worsening, based on sociodemographic, contextual, and clinical data. Thus, we applied machine learning techniques to identify predictors of symptomatologic changes in a Spanish cohort of OCD patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: 127 OCD patients were assessed using the Yaleâ€“Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and a structured clinical interview during the COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning models for classification (LDA and SVM) and regression (linear regression and SVR) were constructed to predict each symptom based on patient's sociodemographic, clinical and contextual information. Results: A Y-BOCS score prediction model was generated with 100% reliability at a score threshold of Â±6. Reliability of 100% was reached for obsessions and/or compulsions related to COVID-19. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were predicted with less reliability (correlation R of 0.58 and 0.68, respectively). The suicidal thoughts are predicted with a sensibility of 79% and specificity of 88%. The best results are achieved by SVM and SVR. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that sociodemographic and clinical data can be used to predict changes in OCD symptomatology. Machine learning may be valuable tool for helping clinicians to rapidly identify patients at higher risk and therefore provide optimized care, especially in future pandemics. However, further validation of these models is required to ensure greater reliability of the algorithms for clinical implementation to specific objectives of interest.","TubÃ­o-FungueiriÃ±o, MarÃ­a, Cernadas, Eva, GonÃ§alves, Ã“scar F.; Segalas, Cinto, BertolÃ­n, Sara, Mar-Barrutia, Lorea, Real, Eva, FernÃ¡ndez-Delgado, Manuel, MenchÃ³n, Jose M.; Carvalho, Sandra, Alonso, Pino, Carracedo, Angel, FernÃ¡ndez-Prieto, Montse","https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2022.807584","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Neuroinformatics;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27386,""
"The Neuropsychiatric Changes After COVID-19 Quarantine in Patients With Cognitive Impairment and Their Caregivers in Chongqing, China: A Cohort Study","Background: The follow-up study on neuropsychiatric changes after the lifting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine in patients with cognitive impairment and their caregivers is still lacking, and relative information is needed to formulate more comprehensive healthcare prevention measures worldwide. Aims: To provide data on the changes in neuropsychiatric performance after the lifting of COVID-19 quarantine in patients with cognitive disorders and their caregivers. Methods: Two surveys in Chongqing, China were conducted via telephonic interview with 531 patients and their caregivers. The baseline survey was performed from February 11 to 23, 2020, and the follow-up was from October 24 to November 9, 2020. The data of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), sleep, nutrition, and chronic diseases of patients, as well as the burden of care, anxiety, and depression of caregivers were evaluated. Results: Significant alleviation of NPSs after the lifting of COVID-19 quarantine was observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (both P &lt; 0.05). Compared with baseline, the prevalence for NPSs of all participants dropped from 57.94 to 38.82%. Among NPS subdomains, apathy displayed the biggest decline at follow-up by 10.72%, followed by nighttime behavior by 8.65%. Mixed effect generalized estimation equation analysis showed significant amelioration in hallucination, depression, apathy, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, and nighttime behavior (all P &lt; 0.05), with the most prominent changes in nighttime behavior and apathy. Among the patients with unsatisfactory control of chronic disease, the medication adherence rate dropped by approximately 30% after the lifting of quarantine. More importantly, around 13% increase of care burden was observed among the caregivers at follow-up, with both depression and anxiety rising by nearly 4%. Conclusion: The prolonged quarantine may exacerbate NPS in patients with memory disorders, while the care burden and mental stability of the caregivers after the pandemic should also be concerned.","Yuan, Shiyun, Zhang, Wenbo, Yao, Qiang, LÃ¼, Wenqi, Yu, Wuhan, Zhong, Fuxin, Wang, Yan, Xing, Dianxia, Wang, Xiaoqin, Song, Jiaqi, Huang, Hong, Chen, Chenxi, Liu, Junjin, Yu, Weihua, LÃ¼, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.762907","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience; 14:1-9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27387,""
"PUPILS' ATTITUDES TOWARD DISTANCE EDUCATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The educational context has been disrupted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to explore attitudes of pupils in Serbia toward distance education during the pandemic. Specifically, we aimed to explore the cognitive component of pupils' attitudes through their perception of positive and negative aspects of distance education, the motivational component based on the expressions of how distance education affects pupils' motivation to learn, and emotional component through verbal expressions of emotions toward distance education. The sample for the study included 110 pupils attending primary (5th to 8th grade) and secondary schools in Serbia. A semi-structured interview was employed. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The findings suggest that majority of pupils have negative attitudes toward distance education and that they find insufficient interaction between teachers and pupils to be the major shortcoming of distance education. Positive aspects of distance education which could be preserved after the pandemic according to the participants' views are: communication between teachers and pupils using information technologies (IT), technical possibilities for a better presentation of learning topics and permanent availability of learning materials on online platforms. The study revealed the lack of intrinsic learning motivation and deficiencies in pupils' self-regulation of learning which are important to be overcome as they impede pupils' academic development both in distance and in classroom education.","Stojkovic, I.; Jelic, M.","https://doi.org/10.2298/zipi2102239s","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Zbornik Instituta Za Pedagoska Istrazivanja; 53(2):239-+, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27388,""
"Addressing Gaps in Public Health Education to Advance Environmental Justice: Time for Action","At a time when environmental public health crises dominate headlines, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic originating from a zoonotic source to extreme weather events linked to global climate change, we want to call attention to the erosion of environmental health (EH) content within master of public health (MPH) programs. The lack of EH content in MPH programs places the already strained public health workforce at risk for not adequately understanding the close interdependence of health on the environment and the major public health challenges of our time, from climate change to systemic racism. A major contributing factor to the decline in EH curricula may be the revision of the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) accreditation standards for schools and programs in public health in 2016, which was done with the intention that graduates from all MPH programs would demonstrate foundational public health knowledge and competencies.1 Yet five years later, the curricular revisions and course restructuring initiated by public health schools and programs in response to the revised CEPH requirements have resulted in a reduction of EH courses offered.Other contributing factors to the decline in EH content could be at play, including not understanding the foundational role of the environment in health and years of inaction on climate change, leading to a consequential lack of demand from students. However, interests of incoming students appear to be shifting as they are in other health professions seeking to add EH content to prepare their future workforce to be skilled in managing complex, interdisciplinary public health challenges of environmental origin. The Association for Prevention Teaching and Research, via a working group on EH competency, reviewed these trends in public health education and expressed concern over this disconnect in the public health learning curriculum. Here we describe more fully the unintended consequences for graduate public health education of the CEPH accreditation revisions related to EH, the potential consequences for the public health workforce, and recommendations for reversing these effects and fostering innovative EH education for the next generation of public health professionals.","Levy, Carly R.

"Health-related quality of life of younger and older lower-income households in Malaysia","Background Globally, a lower income is associated with poorer health status and reduced quality of life (QOL). However, more research is needed on how being older may influence QOL in lower-income households, particularly as older age is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and care needs. To this end, the current study attempts to determine the health-related QOL (HRQOL) among individuals from lower-income households aged 60 years and over compared to lower-income adults aged less than 60 years. Methods Participants were identified from the Department of Statistics Malaysia sampling frame. Surveys were carried out with individual households aged 18 years and older through self-administered questionnaires. Information was collected on demographics, household income, employment status, number of diseases, and HRQOL assessed using the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) tool. Results Out of a total of 1899 participants, 620 (32.6%) were female and 328 (17.3%) were aged 60 years and above. The mean (SD) age was 45.2 (14.1) and mean (SD) household income was RM2124 (1356). Compared with younger individuals, older respondents were more likely to experience difficulties in mobility (32.1% vs 9.7%, p&lt;0.001), self-care (11.6% vs 3.8%, p&lt;0.001), usual activities (24.5% vs 9.1%, p&lt;0.001), pain/discomfort (38.8% vs 16.5%, p&lt;0.001) and anxiety/depression (21.4% vs 13.5%, p&lt;0.001). The mean (SD) EQ-5D index scores were lower among older respondents, 0.89 (0.16) vs 0.95 (0.13), p = 0.001. After adjusting for covariates, age was a significant influencing factor (p = 0.001) for mobility (OR = 2.038, 95% CI:1.439â€“2.885), usual activities (OR = 1.957, 95% CI:1.353â€“2.832) and pain or discomfort (OR = 2.241, 95% CI:1.690â€“2.972). Conclusion Lower-income older adults had poorer HRQOL compared to their younger counterparts. This has important implications concerning intervention strategies that incorporate active ageing concepts on an individual and policy-making level to enhance the QOL and wellbeing, particularly among the older lower-income population.","Hussein, Rizal, Mas Ayu, Said, Hazreen Abdul, Majid, Su, Tin Tin, Tan Maw, Pin, Ismail, Rozmi, Mohd Azlan Shah, Zaidi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263751","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27390,""
"The impact of face masks on emotion recognition performance and perception of threat","Facial emotion recognition is crucial for social interaction. However, in times of a global pandemic, where wearing a face mask covering mouth and nose is widely encouraged to prevent the spread of disease, successful emotion recognition may be challenging. In the current study, we investigated whether emotion recognition, assessed by a validated emotion recognition task, is impaired for faces wearing a mask compared to uncovered faces, in a sample of 790 participants between 18 and 89 years (condition mask vs. original). In two more samples of 395 and 388 participants between 18 and 70 years, we assessed emotion recognition performance for faces that are occluded by something other than a mask, i.e., a bubble as well as only showing the upper part of the faces (condition half vs. bubble). Additionally, perception of threat for faces with and without occlusion was assessed. We found impaired emotion recognition for faces wearing a mask compared to faces without mask, for all emotions tested (anger, fear, happiness, sadness, disgust, neutral). Further, we observed that perception of threat was altered for faces wearing a mask. Upon comparison of the different types of occlusion, we found that, for most emotions and especially for disgust, there seems to be an effect that can be ascribed to the face mask specifically, both for emotion recognition performance and perception of threat. Methodological constraints as well as the importance of wearing a mask despite temporarily compromised social interaction are discussed.","Grahlow, Melina, Rupp, Claudia Ines, Derntl, Birgit","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262840","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: PloS one; 17(2):e0262840, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27391,""
"Experience of Perceived Stress and Impact of Health Locus of Control During COVID-19 Pandemic: Investigating Entrepreneurs and Corporate Employees","The sudden, rapid and ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has forced social distancing and lockdowns. Many people have already started experiencing an elevated feeling of loneliness, emotional distress, anxious and depressive thoughts related to the concerns for the disrupted social, emotional, spiritual, professional and financial wellbeing of family, friends and self. Many are feeling distressed on recurring thoughts about how long this pandemic will last, whether our family and friends will be infected and how long we will be living in this condition. Hence, the researchers of this study anticipated that the COVID-19 outbreak would be highly stressful to the people and will have psychological consequences of varying degrees. This study examines the relationship of stress, anxiety with health locus of control (HLOC) among entrepreneurs and employees serving in organisations, and the coping strategies they have adopted to overcome it. Using the quasi-experiment method, the data were collected using the perceived stress scale (PSS) and multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC) from 91 entrepreneurs and employees. The findings indicated a significant association between HLOC and stress. It was observed that respondents were aware that the current work stress is arising because of a struggle to balance personal and professional lives during the pandemic. Further, it was also observed that stress was significantly higher in employees than entrepreneurs, and HLOC types positively impacted their stress levels.","Chandra, Yamini, Yagnik, Jignasu","https://doi.org/10.1177/23220937221076245","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: South Asian Journal of Human Resources Management;: 23220937221076245, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27392,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 Related School Closures and SPORT CANCELLATIONS on the Health of Adolescent Athletes","Background: In March 2020, schools were closed to in-person teaching and interscholastic sports cancelled in an attempt to slow the spread of the COVID-19. Child health experts have stated that school closures may have profound psychosocial consequences for students and need further study. Hypothesis/Purpose: To identify how COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations impacted the health of adolescent athletes. Methods: Adolescent athletes in Wisconsin were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in May 2020 while schools were closed to in-person teaching and interscholastic and club sports were cancelled. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PHQ-9, PFABS and PedsQL scores were compared with historical data (HD) of Wisconsin adolescent athletes (N = 5,231) collected during normal school and sport operations in the years 2016â€“2018. Results: A total of 3,243 (58% female, Age = 16.1+1.2 yrs., grades 9 â€“ 12) participated in the study. May 2020 participants reported higher (worse) PHQ-9 scores than the HD participants (mean: 8.0 (95%CI: 7.8, 8.2) vs 3.3 (3.1, 3.5), p &lt; 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of moderate to severe levels of depression (32.9% vs 9.7%, p &lt; 0.001). May 2020 Participants also reported lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean: 12.2 (95%CI: 11.9, 12.5) vs 24.7 (24.5, 24.9) p &lt; 0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to athletes in the HD group (78.4 (78.0, 78.8) vs. 90.9 (90.5, 91.3) p &lt; 0.001). Females in May 2020 reported increased moderate and severe anxiety percentages than the males in May 2020 (27.7% vs 22.3%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations in Wisconsin were associated with increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased physical activity and quality of life in adolescent athletes. The potential negative health impacts of prolonged school closures and sport cancellations should be taken into account when evaluating steps to limit the spread of COVID-19.","McGuine, Timothy, Biese, Kevin, Hetzel, Scott, Kliethermes, Stephanie, Reardon, Claudia, Bell, David, Alison, Brooks M.; Watson, Andrew","https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967121S00170","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine; 9(7_suppl3), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27394,""

"Experiences of pain in paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: a single-centre qualitative study","BackgroundModerate to severe pain affects up to two-thirds of children with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and is associated with worse fatigue and physical functioning. This research aims to gain a greater insight into pain experienced by these children.MethodsThematic analysis of qualitative data from semistructured interviews with 13 children with CFS/ME (mean age=15.3 years, 67% female) was completed.ResultsThematic analysis enabled construction of three themes: childrenâ€™s wide-ranging experiences of pain, negative impact of pain and lack of effective treatment for pain and nine subthemes. The first theme demonstrated highly varied pain experiences, ranging from â€˜like [being]â€¦ on fireâ€™, like â€˜being stabbedâ€™ to â€˜likeâ€¦leadâ€™. Children experienced pain in multiple sites and with wide-ranging frequency and severity. The second theme highlighted the profound negative impact of pain on multiple aspects of childrenâ€™s lives. Physical activity was severely impaired;some children â€˜couldnâ€™t leave bedâ€™ or â€˜couldnâ€™tâ€¦brush [their] own hairâ€™. Abdominal pain meant some would â€˜goâ€¦days without eatingâ€™. Pain substantially impacted on mental health, leaving children feeling â€˜agitatedâ€™, experiencing â€˜really bad panic attacksâ€™ or making them â€˜[want to] breakdownâ€™. Children felt they â€˜canâ€™t do the things that everyone else can doâ€™, had â€˜missed outâ€™ and are â€˜behind everyoneâ€™.

"Protocol for integrating mental health services into primary healthcare facilities: a qualitative study of the perspectives of patients, family members and healthcare providers in rural Bangladesh","IntroductionIn Bangladesh, Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for 67% of all deaths. Mental health services are not available in routine healthcare at the primary facilities in Bangladesh. The protocol is for a qualitative study that seeks to understand the perceptions, beliefs and norms regarding common mental disorders (CMDs) among patients with NCD with and without CMDs to identify barriers to accessing mental health services in rural communities in Bangladesh. We also aim to explore the feasibility of integrating mental healthcare into routine NCD services at primary health facilities in rural Bangladesh.Methods and analysisThis study will be conducted at the outpatient departments in two subdistrict hospitals and one district hospital in Munshiganj district in Bangladesh. We will purposefully select patients with hypertension and diabetes from the patient inventory generated from a recently completed randomised control trial titled â€˜Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lankaâ€™ in two subdistricts in Munshiganj district in Bangladesh. The selected participants will be screened for CMD using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) over the telephone. Sixty in-depth interviews with patients and family members, 8â€“10 key informant interviews with healthcare providers and 2 focus group discussions with community health workers will be held following consent.The study is conceptualised under Levesque et alâ€™s framework. Thematic analysis will be applied following the study objectives and key issues, and commonly emerging topics generated by the data. The findings will be presented anonymously to corroborate the interpretation.Ethics and disseminationApproval has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board at icddr,b (PR-19108) and the University of York (HSRGC/2020/382/F). Written informed consent or audio recording consent form in Bangla will be obtained. For dissemination, we will invite representatives of the collaborating institutions to share the findings in national or international conferences and peer-reviewed journals.","Naheed, Aliya, Mir, Nabila Ashraf, Chakma, Nantu, Jennings, Hannah Maria, Nahar, Papreen","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052464","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27397,""

Institutional racism within the health services also meant that pregnant women from ethnic minority groups were more likely to experience and report discrimination and bias in their care and to distrust medical professionals. The paper recommended that detailed social determinant data should be routinely recorded for all pregnant women and that records be shared between healthcare providers, which can be especially useful for recording history of self-harm, domestic abuse, or children in care.","Mahase, Elisabeth","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o333","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 376, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27400,""

"Experiences of staff working in a mental health trust during the COVID-19 pandemic and appraisal of staff support services","Purpose The health and well-being of healthcare staff came into focus during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as already strained workforces responded to new and additional challenges. Organisational support services made efforts to adapt staff support provision. However, most literature and recommendations are centred on surveys of medical and clinical staff. The present study included staff across clinical and non-clinical workforces within a mental health trust over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, and aimed to understand workforces' access to and experiences of organisational support. Design/methodology/approach The current study was a qualitative one using convenience and purposive sampling. Semi-structured individual and group interviews were conducted using a topic guide. Reflexive thematic analysis was used in a phenomenological framework to analyse data. Findings 35 staff, broadly representative of the trust workforce, were recruited. Six global themes summarised the experiences of staff in relation to work practices, personal well-being and support access over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: COVID-19 disease, interpersonal relationships, individual considerations, change, working environment and support. Practical implications The findings from the study have implications for organisational support provisions for healthcare workers and the dissemination of these services.

"Visualization, benchmarking and characterization of nested single-cell heterogeneity as dynamic forest mixtures","A major topic of debate in developmental biology centers on whether development is continuous, discontinuous, or a mixture of both. Pseudo-time trajectory models, optimal for visualizing cellular progression, model cell transitions as continuous state manifolds and do not explicitly model real-time, complex, heterogeneous systems and are challenging for benchmarking with temporal models. We present a data-driven framework that addresses these limitations with temporal single-cell data collected at discrete time points as inputs and a mixture of dependent minimum spanning trees (MSTs) as outputs, denoted as dynamic spanning forest mixtures (DSFMix). DSFMix uses decision-tree models to select genes that account for variations in multimodality, skewness and time. The genes are subsequently used to build the forest using tree agglomerative hierarchical clustering and dynamic branch cutting. We first motivate the use of forest-based algorithms compared to single-tree approaches for visualizing and characterizing developmental processes. We next benchmark DSFMix to pseudo-time and temporal approaches in terms of feature selection, time correlation, and network similarity. Finally, we demonstrate how DSFMix can be used to visualize, compare and characterize complex relationships during biological processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, spermatogenesis, stem cell pluripotency, early transcriptional response from hormones and immune response to coronavirus disease. Our results indicate that the expression of genes during normal development exhibits a high proportion of non-uniformly distributed profiles that are mostly right-skewed and multimodal; the latter being a characteristic of major steady states during development. Our study also identifies and validates gene signatures driving complex dynamic processes during somatic or germline differentiation.","Anchang, Mendez-Giraldez, Xu, Archer, Chen, Hu, Plevritis, Motsinger-Reif, Li","https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac017","20220222","cell differentiation; forest mixtures; minimum spanning tree; multimodality; nested models; single-cell trajectory analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27404,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of medical staff considering the interplay of pandemic burden and psychosocial resources-A rapid systematic review","In times of the global corona pandemic health care workers (HCWs) fight the disease at the frontline of healthcare services and are confronted with an exacerbated load of pandemic burden. Psychosocial resources are thought to buffer adverse effects of pandemic stressors on mental health. This rapid review summarizes evidence on the specific interplay of pandemic burden and psychosocial resources with regard to the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to derive potential starting points for supportive interventions. We conducted a rapid systematic review following the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. We searched 7 databases in February 2021 and included peer-reviewed quantitative studies, that reported related data on pandemic stressors, psychosocial resources, and mental health of HCWs. 46 reports were finally included in the review and reported data on all three outcomes at hand. Most studies (n = 41) applied a cross-sectional design. Our results suggest that there are several statistically significant pandemic risk factors for mental health problems in HCWs such as high risk and fear of infection, while resilience, active and emotion-focused coping strategies as well as social support can be considered beneficial when protecting different aspects of mental health in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence for patterns of interaction between outcomes were found in the context of coping style when facing specific pandemic stressors. Our results indicate that several psychosocial resources may play an important role in buffering adverse effects of pandemic burden on the mental health of HCWs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, causal interpretations of mentioned associations are inadequate due to the overall low study quality and the dominance of cross-sectional study designs. Prospective longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the missing links.","Hannemann, Abdalrahman, Erim, Morawa, Jerg-Bretzke, Beschoner, Geiser, Hiebel, Weidner, Steudte-Schmiedgen, Albus","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264290","20220222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27405,""
"COVID-19 epidemic and Chinese medical students: perception, emotions, attitudes, and conformity during domicile quarantine","Students from Shantou University Medical College were subject to domicile quarantine during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated their experience during March-April 2020 using a cross-sectional, self-administered, anonymous online survey. Out of 531 respondents, 75.7% became aware of the outbreak via the Internet (61.7%), WeChat (57.8%), and Weibo (49%). Nearly all students knew COVID-19 manifestations, incubation period, and transmission modes; about half considered wearing facemask and hand hygiene as effective epidemic interventions. They experienced various emotional reactions that changed significantly in response to the outbreak, lockdown, and quarantine (ps &lt; 0.001), with depression in 23.3%. Most students (83.4%-99.4%) had positive attitudes and good compliance towards domicile quarantine and preventive measures. Females were significantly better than males in hand hygiene compliance (p = 0.04). More students with positive attitudes and good compliance than those without educated their families (ps &lt; 0.05 - ps &lt; 0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed negative relationships between anger and hand hygiene attitude (OR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01-0.87); confusion and quarantine compliance (0.30, 0.12-0.76); and anger and compliance with quarantine (0.32, 0.11-0.93), facemask (0.12, 0.03-0.50), and hand hygiene (0.27, 0.08-0.88). This study revealed how multichannel risk communication, early awareness, positive attitudes, and conformity of medical college students might have contributed to the favorable outcome from the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Clear, accurate, consistent, early risk communication by the local, national, and international public health authorities seems critical to promote public understanding, correct risk perception, and rational emotions and attitudes, leading to optimal conformity.","Zhang, Ba-Thein","https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14328","20220222","Pandemic; compliance; facemask; hand hygiene; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27406,""
"How vaccine ambivalence can lead people who inject drugs to decline COVID-19 vaccination, and ways this can be addressed: a Qualitative Study","People who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately impacted by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, yet frequently do not accept vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 when offered. To explore why PWID decline free vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2, and how barriers to vaccination can potentially be addressed. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 17 unvaccinated adult PWID during August and September 2021, at a New York City syringe service program where approximately three quarters of participants identify as Latino (55%) or African American (22%). Interviews lasted roughly 20 minutes. The interview guide examined reasons for declining vaccination, participants' understanding of COVID-19 risks, and how messages could be developed to encourage vaccine uptake among PWID. Participants acknowledged they faced increased risk from SARS-CoV-2 due to their injection drug use, but feared long term substance use may have weakened their health, making them especially vulnerable to side effects. Fears of possible side effects, compounded by widespread medical mistrust and questions about the overall value of vaccination contributed to significant ambivalence among our sample. The desire to protect children and older family members emerged as key potential facilitators of vaccination. Community-developed messages are needed in outreach efforts to explain the importance of vaccination, including the far greater dangers of COVID-19 compared to possible unintended side effects. Messages that emphasize vaccines' ability to prevent inadvertently infecting loved ones, may help increase uptake. Community focused messaging strategies, like those used to increase HIV/HCV testing and overdose prevention among PWID, may prove similarly effective.","Aronson, Bennett, Ardouin-Guerrier, Rivera-Castellar, Gibson, Santoscoy, Vargas-Estrella","https://doi.org/10.2196/35066","20220222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27407,""
"School considerations for children with heart disease during the COVID-19 pandemic","This article presents data on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related learning, health, and mental health concerns of 134 families of children with heart disease (HD), the most common birth defect, who are followed by a unique hospital-based Educational Achievement Partnership Program (EAPP) designed to serve as a liaison across the family, the child's medical team, and school. At-school, remote, and hybrid learning alternatives prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic presented families with an especially complex decision to make for children with HD due to competing complications in this population: Increased susceptibility to illness, greater risk of neuropsychological problems, and higher level of individualized education services that are not readily transferable to a home learning platform. Parents of school-aged children with HD completed a survey about COVID-19-related school support needs as part of a quality improvement project. Survey results revealed 51% of children would learn from home during the 2020-2021 school year due to concerns about the child's underlying health condition, indicating a marked change in schooling modality compared to prior years (4% in 2019). Nearly 75% of families requested medical guidance for COVID-19-related school health and education plan addendums. Seventy-three percent of families had mental health concerns about their child; severity of HD was related to families' reports about mental health concerns. Findings suggest follow-up is needed by school psychologists and medical consultative collaborative partners to support the transition back to in-person schooling after the COVID-19 pandemic concludes and to identify long-term educational consequences of disrupted learning during this period.

"Subjective mental well-being among higher education students in Finland during the first wave of COVID-19","Increased mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic have become a major concern among young adults. Our aim was to understand which COVID-19-related questions predicted mental well-being during the outbreak. Two cross-sectional datasets were used.

Mental well-being was assessed with the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Relationships between mental well-being and COVID-19-related questions were investigated with lasso regression. As an exploratory analysis, two-way ANOVAs were used to compare mental well-being before and during the outbreak. Higher levels of mental well-being were associated with lower levels of academic stress and COVID-19-related worry, along with a higher satisfaction with the procedures and information provided by the higher education institutions and the government. COVID-19-related symptoms and infections did not have an impact on students' mental well-being during the outbreak.

"Psychiatric emergencies in migrant adolescents","Stress factors associated with migration may expose minor immigrants to mental health problems. The aim of the study was to describe acute psychiatric problems, in terms of reasons for hospitalization and diagnosis at discharge, in a sample of Italian and Migrant adolescents (both first and second generation). We collected data on socio-demographic and clinical-diagnostic characteristics of 423 Italian and Migrant adolescents (mean age: 15 years Ã‚Â± 1.44; range 12-17.91), hospitalized at the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit of the Spedali Civili of Brescia between 2014 and 2019, period prior to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic.

"The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on worry and medical disruptions reported by individuals with chromosome 22q112 copy number variants and their caregivers","The world has suffered immeasurably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased distress and mental and medical health concerns are collateral consequences to the disease itself. The Genes to Mental Health (G2MH) Network consortium sought to understand how individuals affected by the rare copy number variations of 22q11.2 deletion and duplication syndrome, associated with neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric conditions, were coping. The article focuses on worry and disruptions in medical care caused by the pandemic. The University of Pennsylvania COVID-19 Stressor List and care disruption questions were circulated by 22 advocacy groups in English and 11 other languages. A total of 512 people from 23 countries completed the survey; most were caregivers of affected individuals. Worry about family members acquiring COVID-19 had the highest average endorsed worry, whilst currently having COVID-19 had the lowest rated worry. Total COVID-19 worries were higher in individuals completing the survey towards the end of the study (later pandemic wave); 36% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 186) of the sample reported a significant effect on health due to care interruption during the pandemic; 44% of individuals (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 111) receiving care for their genetic syndrome in a hospital setting reported delaying appointments due to COVID-19 fears; 12% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 59) of the sample reported disruptions to treatments; and of those reporting no current disruptions, 59% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 269) worried about future disruptions if the pandemic continued. Higher levels of care disruptions were related to higher COVID-19 worries (PsÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.005). Minimal differences by respondent type or copy number variation type emerged. Widespread medical care disruptions and pandemic-related worries were reported by individuals with 22q11.2 syndrome and their family members. Reported worries were broadly consistent with research results from prior reports in the general population. The long-term effects of COVID-19 worries, interruptions to care and hospital avoidance require further study.","White, Crowley, Finucane, Garcia-Minaur, Repetto, van den Bree, Fischer, Jacquemont, Barzilay, Maillard, Donald, Gur, Bassett, Swillen, McDonald-McGinn","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12918","20220222","22q11.2 deletion syndrome; 22q11.2 duplication syndrome; COVID-19; copy number variations (CNVs); neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders (NPDs)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27412,""
"COVID-19 effects on practice: Perspectives of Tennessee APRNs","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tennessee's Governor issued executive orders temporarily suspending certain practice restrictions on advanced practice registered nurses (APRN), which expired after 2 months as the pandemic worsened. This purpose of this qualitative study was to analyze APRN interview data to evaluate how prepandemic APRN practice barriers, executive orders, and the pandemic affected APRN practice in Tennessee. Fifteen Tennessee APRNs who completed the National APRN Practice and Pandemic study also completed follow-up interviews via a HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform. Given the unprecedented circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a qualitative descriptive study seeking descriptions and unique perspectives of Tennessee APRNs. Consistent with qualitative study design, we conducted an atheoretical study that featured interviews, purposeful sampling with maximum variation sampling, and content analysis. The major themes were practice changes, impact of executive orders, and ongoing care barriers. The data revealed that patients, APRNs, and other health care providers were strained in new and profound ways during the pandemic. An underlying theme was Tennessee APRNs' frustration with continued regulatory and other practice barriers despite their state's health and health care disparities and under resourced health care system. These findings indicate the need to improve care access and health outcomes, advocate for full practice authority for APRNs, support telehealth expansion, address transportation deficiencies, and respond to the pandemic-precipitated mental health crisis.","Myers, MuÃƒÂ±oz, Stansberry, Schorn, Kleinpell, Likes","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12711","20220222","COVID-19; advanced practice nursing; delivery of health care; health policy; mental health; policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27413,""
"School-Based Health Services in Virginia and the COVID-19 Pandemic","Schools have a long history of delivering health services, but it is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic may have disrupted this. This study examined changes in school-based health services and student needs before and during the pandemic and the factors important for delivering school-based health services. A web-based survey regarding the impact of the pandemic on school-based health services was distributed via email to all 1178 Virginia public elementary schools during May 2021. Responding schools (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 767, response rateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 65%) reported providing fewer school-based health services during the 2020-2021 school year than before the pandemic, with the largest declines reported for dental screenings (51% vs 15%) and dental services (40% vs 12%). Reports show that mental health was a top concern for students increased from 15% before the pandemic to 27% (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Support from families and school staff were identified by most respondents (86% and 83%, respectively) as very important for the delivery of school-based health services. Schools reported delivering fewer health services to students during the 2020-2021 school year and heightened concern about students' mental health. Understanding what schools need to deliver health services can assist state and local education and health officials and promote child health.","Kranz, Steiner, Mitchell","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13147","20220222","COVID-19; elementary schools; school nurse; school-based health; social determinants of health; surveys","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27414,""
"The impact of COVID-19 and control measures on public health in Thailand, 2020","The COVID-19 virus has been an emerging disease causing global outbreaks for over a year. In Thailand, transmission may be controlled by strict measures that could positively and negatively impact physical health and suicidal behavior. The incidence of COVID-19 was retrieved from the Department of Disease Control (DDC). The impact of viral diseases was retrieved from the open-source of the DDC and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. The road accidents data were from the Thai Ministry of Transport. The suicidal behavior data were obtained from the Department of Mental Health. We compared data from the year 2019 with the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak period in 2020, before lockdown, during lockdown, easing, and new wave period using unpaired t-test and least-squares linear regression. We compared the impact of the outbreak on various data records in 2020 with corresponding non-outbreak from 2019. There was a significant decline in cases of influenza (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and norovirus (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in RSV cases (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.17). There was a dramatic increase in attempt to suicides and suicides (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). There was no impact on roadside accidents and outpatient department visits. The extensive intervention measures during lockdown during the first wave positively impacted total cases for each period for acute respiratory and gastrointestinal tract diseases, car accidents, and injuries and negatively impacted indicators of suicidal behavior.

"Effect of remote mindfulness-based interventions on symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is high worldwide, and patients with COPD commonly suffer from mood disorders, such as symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, it is difficult to communicate with patients face to face to solve these psychological problems in the case of the fluctuations in symptoms of COPD and COVID-19 prevalence, which may lead to the fact that patients with COPD are more likely to suffer exacerbations, frequent readmissions and worse survival. Mindfulness-based interventions are a stress-reducing therapy with mindfulness at its core. Remote mindfulness-based interventions combine the advantages of high availability, accessibility, low cost and anonymity and can solve the barriers to access that many patients face when attending face-to-face programmes. Therefore, remote mindfulness-based interventions may be an effective way to improve the mental health of patients with COPD. We will search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, PsycNET, MEDLINE, Psychology &amp; Behavioral Sciences Collection and Web of Science to select eligible studies that were published. The eligible studies will be screened, extracted and then the methodological quality will be evaluated independently by two reviewers. Review manager software V.5.3 software and Stata V.14.0 software will be used for meta-analysis. Ethical approval is not required for a systematic review protocol. Findings of the proposed systematic review will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Psychological distress of frontline healthcare workers in the intensive care unit during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study from China","The rapid spread of COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare systems across the world. During the early stage of the pandemic, frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) caring for patients at intensive care units (ICUs) faced extreme pressure and challenges. This qualitative study aimed to describe the different phases of psychological distress of FHWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative study. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, a designated hospital for patients with COVID-19 in central China. Eight physicians and six nurses working in the ICU who provided direct patient care for COVID-19 patients. A descriptive phenomenological study using thematic analysis was applied. Semi-structured one-on-one interviews over telephone or Wechat (a social platform in China) rather than face-to-face interviews were conducted due to quarantine. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and then were analysed thematically. A total of 14 interviews were conducted, and each interview lasted 20-60 min. Five thematic categories were identified, and the participants' psychological experiences were classified into five stages (1) the mobilisation period: a sense of responsibility with worries; (2) the preparation period: worries, fears and doubts about the epidemic; (3) the transitional period: complex and diverse psychological feelings; (4) the adaptation period: self-adjustment and help from external support and (5) the reflection period: a reflection on life and nature. The study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had significant psychological impacts on FHWs. Self-regulation and external support help FHWs to overcome challenges to a certain extent. More attention should be paid to the psychological wellbeing of ICU FHWs in COVID-19-designated hospitals.","Yin, Zhang, Jia, Wang, Hao, Yang, Zhang, Du, Yue","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049627","20220222","COVID-19; mental health and psychiatry; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27417,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Arthroplasty Surgeons","After the COVID-19 pandemic declaration in March 2020, all the elective total joint replacement surgeries in Canada were abruptly canceled for an indefinite period of time. The principal objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological morbidity experienced by arthroplasty surgeons during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives included characterizing influential variables affecting the surgeon's well-being and suggesting directives for improvement. This study surveyed Canadian Arthroplasty Society (CAS) members regarding their psychological well-being using the validated General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult (PWI-A). As well, the survey included questions regarding concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures, personal well-being, and sociodemographic characteristics. A total of 80 surgeons (52% of those surveyed) completed the questionnaire, representing all 10 provinces in Canada. The prevalence of emotional distress and depression were 38% and 29%, respectively. Psychological morbidity most commonly resulted from concerns of loss of income/operating time, experiences of emotional conflict, and generalized safety worries. The surgeons commonly (93%) demonstrated insight in recognizing the impact of COVID-19 on their emotional health. Canadian arthroplasty surgeons demonstrated emotional resilience and insight during COVID-19. Continual communication, as well as remuneration action plans, could improve the mental well-being of at-risk individuals.","Suraci, Wood, Tanzer, Keegan, Burnett, Leighton, Zukor, Wadey, Johnston, Desy, Kim, Howard, Lanting, Rosen, MacDonald, Schemitsch, Antoniou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2021.11.020","20220222","COVID-19; arthroplasty; emotional; psychological; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27418,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lifestyle and behaviours, mental health and education of students studying healthcare-related courses at a British university","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most industries, including health education. In this study, we surveyed students studying healthcare-related courses at our university on how their lifestyles and behaviours, mental health and education had been affected by the pandemic. Mixed methods cross-sectional study. Two hundred thirty-three students responded to the questionnaire. Lifestyle and behaviours: 51.5% of the participants changed their diet (n=120); 45.5% (n=106) exercised less; 66.5% (n=155) experienced a change in sleep; 51.1% (n=119) reported a change in appetite. Mental health: 84.2% (n=196) reported worrying too much about different things; 61.9% (n=144) could not stop or control worrying; 71.2% experienced trouble relaxing on several days or more (n=166). At least sometimes, 72.1% (n=168) felt unable to cope with things they had to do; 8.5% (n=20) never, or almost never, felt confident about handling personal problems. Education: 65.7% (n=153) struggled to complete learning outcomes with online delivery; 82% (n=191) worried about practical skills being affected; 60.5% (n=141) worried about the impact of COVID-19 on their future career. Almost half (48.9%, n=114) believed that online teaching should be part of the standard curriculum. In general, there was a negative impact on behaviours, lifestyle and mental health and virtual education was perceived as necessary in making up for the loss of face to face experiences.

"Compliance with COVID-19-preventive behaviours among employees returning to work in the post-epidemic period","The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of behaviours such as social distancing in controlling pandemics. Currently, the epidemic is under control in China and production has resumed in various industries. This study investigates the behavioural compliance and related factors for COVID-19 prevention among employees returning to the workplace and provide strategic recommendations for improving individual-level preventive behaviour to prevent a new outbreak. A cross-sectional study design was used. Data were gathered from returning employees in China using an online questionnaire survey, from March to May, 2020. The questionnaire covered participants' COVID-19-related knowledge, compliance with recommended preventive behaviours, and levels of depression and anxiety. Univariate and multi-factor methods were used to analyse the data and identify factors influencing behaviour compliance. Of the 1300 participants completing the full survey, more than half were male (71.92%) and 61% were aged between 31 and 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Six hundred and ninety-eight (53.7%) participants showed high compliance, while 602 (46.3%) showed low compliance.

"Perceptions on barriers, facilitators, and recommendations related to mental health service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, Canada: a qualitative descriptive study","There was an increase in self-reported mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, with research showing reduced access to mental health services in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. This paper explores 1) barriers and facilitating factors associated with mental health service delivery via primary care settings during the first two pandemic waves in Quebec, Canada, and 2) recommendations to addressing these barriers. A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants (health managers, family physicians, mental health clinicians) were conducted and coded using a thematic analysis approach. Barriers and facilitating factors were organized according to Chaudoir et al. (2013)'s framework of structural, organizational, provider- and patient-related, as well as innovation (technological modalities for service delivery) categories. Barriers included relocation of mental health staff to non-mental health related COVID-19 tasks (structural); mental health service interruption (organizational); mental health staff on preventive/medical leave (provider); the pandemic's effect on consultations (i.e., perceptions of increased demand) (patients); and challenges with the use of technological modalities (innovation). Facilitating factors included reinforcements to mental health care teams (structural); perceptions of reductions in wait times for mental health evaluations during the second wave due to diminished FP referrals in the first wave, as well as supports (i.e., management, private sector, mental health trained staff) for mental health service delivery (organizational); staff's mental health consultation practices (provider); and advantages in increasing the use of technological modalities in practice (innovation). To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore barriers and facilitating factors to mental health service delivery during the pandemic in Quebec, Canada. Some barriers identified were caused by the pandemic, such as the relocation of staff to non-mental health services and mental health service interruption. Offering services virtually seemed to facilitate mental health service delivery only for certain population groups. Recommendations related to building and strengthening human and technological capacity during the pandemic can inform mental health practices and policies to improve mental health service delivery in primary care settings and access to mental health services via access points.","Spagnolo, BeausÃƒÂ©jour, Fleury, ClÃƒÂ©ment, Gamache, SauvÃƒÂ©, Couture, Fleet, Knight, Gilbert, Vasiliadis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-022-01634-w","20220222","COVID-19; Canada; Mental health; Primary care; Quebec; Service delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-23","",27421,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 Confinement on Cognition and Mental Health and Technology Use Among Socially Vulnerable Older People: Retrospective Cohort Study","COVID-19 forced the implementation of restrictive measures in Spain, such as lockdown, home confinement, social distancing, and isolation. It is necessary to study whether limited access to basic services and decreased family and social support could have deleterious effects on cognition, quality of life, and mental health in vulnerable older people. This study aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia as the main outcome and the quality of life, perceived health status, and depression as secondary outcomes and to analyze the association of living alone and a change in living arrangements with those outcomes and other variables related with the use of technology and health services. Likewise, this study aims to analyze the association of high and low technophilia with those variables, to explore the access and use of health care and social support services, and, finally, to explore the informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses of information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cohort study was conducted in MÃƒÂ¡laga (Spain). In total, 151 participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, from the SMART4MD (n=75, 49.7%) and TV-AssistDem (n=76, 50.3%) randomized clinical trials, were interviewed by telephone between May 11 and June 26, 2020. All participants had undergone 1-3 assessments (in 6-month intervals) on cognition, quality of life, and mood prior to the COVID-19 breakout. The outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, and mood of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Perceived stress was reported as moderate during the outbreak. After correction for multiple comparisons, living alone, a change in living arrangements, and technophilia were not associated with negative mental health outcomes. However, being alone was nominally associated with self-perceived fear and depression, and higher technophilia with better quality of life, less boredom, perceived stress and depression, and also less calmness. Overall, health care and social support service access and utilization were high. The most used ICTs during the COVID-19 outbreak were the television for informative, cognitive, and entertainment-related uses and the smartphone for socialization. Our findings show that the first months of the outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, perceived health status, and depression of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Living alone and low technophilia require further research to establish whether they are risk factors of mental health problems during lockdowns in vulnerable populations. Moreover, although ICTs have proven to be useful for informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses during the pandemic, more evidence is needed to support these interventions.

"Impact of the COVID pandemic on survivors of childhood cancer and survivorship care: lessons for the future","The COVID pandemic has greatly impacted cancer care, with survivorship care being accorded low priority. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic on survivorship services at our centre, as well as on survivors of childhood cancer (CCS). We analyzed the trends in survivorship care at our centre from March 2020 to June 2021 compared to previous years. We also conducted an online survey of adolescent and young adult (AYA-CCS) following up at the After Completion of Treatment Clinic, Mumbai, to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic and ensuing restrictions on our cohort of survivors. Sibling responses were used as comparator (CTRI/2020/11/029029). There was a decrease in in-person follow-ups and increase in remote follow-ups over the first few months of the pandemic. While in-person visits steadily increased after October 2020 and reached pre-pandemic numbers, distant follow-ups continue to be higher than pre-pandemic. Evaluable responses from the survey of 88 AYA-CCS and 25 siblings revealed new-onset health concerns in 29.5% of AYA-CCS, missed follow-up visit in 52% and varying degrees of mental health issues in 12.5%.
