"Plights of Migrant Workers in Lockdown amid COVID-19","Migrant workers are highly marginalised and vulnerable group who are subjected to undergo various kind of exploitation. Catastrophe caused by COVID 19 has utterly affected migrant workers who work in unorganised sectors in India. Unplanned, mismanagement and monumental mistake of policy makers have been forced migrant worker to suffer in silence. Migrant workers stranded on street and struggled to survive. Daily wagers are among worst hit. They do not have source of survival. Landlords have thrown them out of the rented house when they are unable pay rent. Lockdown has pushed them to destitution and devastation. Huger hunts them. They started walking with humble belonging on their heads in scratching heat, swollen and injured foot to reach destination. Many migrant workers have died during lockdown due to starvation, accidents, suicide, police brutality and lack of medical care. Even today one can see the helpless, hapless and sapless conditions of migrant worker. Lockdown has exposed how unequal the society is and how much vulnerable migrant workers are. This article talks about how people and policies have become insensitive towards migrant workers, how lockdown has caused massive miseries to migrant workers and role played by Government, Judiciary and NGOs in India to address the issues of migrant workers.","Siddaramu, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Plights+of+Migrant+Workers+in+Lockdown+amid+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: AAYAM : AKGIM Journal of Management; 12(1):13-17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37704,""

"School leadership and adaptation in response to the COVID-19 crisis","The purpose of this study was to explore the leadership dynamics that supported the emergence of adaptive behavior among a school's professional staff in response to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. When schools closed their doors in the spring of 2020, they were required to transition to a remote teaching and learning model, something that few, if any, were fully prepared to do. Adapting to a remote model and later to hybrid and simultaneous models required schools to rethink their operations and teachers to be innovative in their instructional strategies. Further, the pandemic's impact on students' mental health and social emotional development was an area of concern. Social distancing, contact tracing, and masking became more important as students returned to in-person learning in greater numbers in the 2020-2021 school year. All of these challenges required effective adaptation at the school level. Managing this scale of adaptation required effective school leadership. Using the framework of Complexity Leadership Theory, this case study examines how one school staff worked collaboratively to respond to the pandemic's challenges and how administrators and teachers collectively created and supported the conditions that allowed adaptation to occur.

"I miss a normal life It's gone on so long': A qualitative interpretation of youth's perceptions of a third national COVID-19 lockdown on their well-being and physical activity","Background Youth have experienced unprecedented restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to ascertain youth's perceptions of how the lockdown restrictions have impacted their well-being. Given the varying restrictions imposed in different countries, exploring the impact relative to the specific restrictions is imperative. This study investigated youth's views on the impact of a third national lockdown on their well-being and physical activity. Methods Following informed parental consent, youth aged 8-18 years attending state schools in Wales, UK, were invited to complete an online questionnaire using an individualised link sent to the email addresses provided by parents (January 2021). A total of 4,259 survey links were issued. The questionnaire included questions on children's physical activity, mental well-being and experience of COVID-19. This study reports on free text responses from an optional two-part open-ended question on their experience during restrictions employed to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales. The questions were (a) How does lockdown make you feel?, followed by (b) Why do you feel this way?. Flexible thematic analysis was employed to analyse the data and identify themes and sub-themes. Results Valid responses were received from 1,681 youth (11.8Â±2.3 years;50% girls). Most participants expressed only a negative emotional response to their lockdown experience. Whilst there were no overall sex differences in the responses, age differences were observed. Specifically, the 12-13 year-old age group reported the lowest number of negative responses, compared to 8-9 year-olds who reported the highest. Six distinct negative emotional responses were identified: sadness, anger, worry, loneliness, boredom, laziness. Nevertheless, a small cohort of participants identified positive emotional responses that focused on being happy. Mixed emotions were also reported by participants which were most prevalent amongst 16-18 year-olds and least reported in 10-11 year-olds. Finally, the inability to participate in team sports was reported negatively, however, some youth reported the additional time facilitated greater participation in exercise. Conclusions The predominance of negative emotions highlights the significant and potentially long-lasting impact the lockdowns have had on youth's mental well-being. In addition, the findings evidence that youth associated sport participation with their mental health. Furthermore, the age differences identified highlight that youth's developmental stage, both emotionally and societally, should be considered in the recovery response to improve and reduce further deterioration in youth's mental health. This evidence should be considered when ministers evaluate the wider evidence to inform future restrictions required to manage the exit from COVID-19 and other future pandemics.","Sharp, Catherine, McNarry, Melitta, Hurter, Liezel, Hill, Denise, Stratton, Gareth, Mackintosh, Kelly","https://www.google.com/search?q=I+miss+a+normal+life.+It's+gone+on+so+long':+A+qualitative+interpretation+of+youth's+perceptions+of+a+third+national+COVID-19+lockdown+on+their+well-being+and+physical+activity","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37707,""

"The healthy pastor: Surviving in ministry without losing your soul","The Christian Church is facing a severe problem with ministers finishing early, if at all in their calling. Each month seemingly brings another case of immorality or suicide among prominent ministers. Among those less well known it is even more widespread. Most reasons for not finishing well can be traced to mental and emotional problems. Usually, it is a soul problem more than anything else. Many things can cause harm to the emotional health and soul of ministers to keep them from finishing well. There are many reasons for burnout and bail out. It is vital to discover what ministers are doing right and what they are doing wrong in relation to emotional health. If those reasons can be identified, best practices can be established to better disciple and prepare ministers for the longevity in ministry. Many statistics exist about the longevity and health of pastors. Some are out of date, but many are current. In addition to researching the current literature about the mental health of pastors, the subjects were given a survey to find what most contributed to their emotional health. I used a survey designed by Peter Scazzero to evaluate the general emotional health of the ministers of the Ozark region of Rhema Ministerial Association International. Additionally, I interviewed a smaller group to gather more specific information. Chapters 4 and 5 summarize the findings of this project. One of the most glaring lessons learned is the lack of personal discipleship for those entering the ministry. Much time and effort are being spent on their training in the Bible and practical ministry practices, but much too little is being spent on their personal development. Another lesson that this project highlights is the coming structural changes in the Church around the world, and especially in the West. The future Church will most likely look much different than the present model with hybrid churches meeting online and in public spaces much more often. COVID-19 and technological improvements, among other changes, are ushering the Church into a whole new world. The present model for training pastors and ministers, as well as the entire Church structure, must be prayerfully brought into the twenty-first century. Hopefully this project adds some insight into that reality.

"Resilience and sociodemographic factors involved in the presence of depressive, anxiety and of stress symptoms in the Chilean adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great impact on people's mental health. The objective of this study was to examine the role of resilience and sociodemographic factors involved in the presence of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms in the Chilean adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 501 participants answered the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). The results indicate that there are high prevalence rates of mental health symptoms during the current health crisis. We found that resilience is inversely associated with the three types of symptoms, also turning out to be a predictor variable for them. It may be concluded that there are groups with a higher risk for experiencing higher levels of depressive, anxiety and stress symptomatology, which indicates the importance of developing strategies that promote mental health.

"Patient Barriers to Accessing Hospital-Based Neuropsychological Services","Objective: Annually, thousands of youths are admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and are at increased risk for long-lasting neurocognitive and psychiatric sequelae, referred to as Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). Research shows that youth with PICS strongly benefit from neuropsychological follow-up services;however, high proportions of referred patients (i.e., 25-33% at our hospital) do not attend follow-up appointments. The current study aims to better understand the barriers that hinder familiesâ€™ abilities to access follow-up services. Method: Participants included guardians of children ages 0-18 years (N = 149) referred for follow-up neuropsychological assessment and did not attend the appointment. Data was collected via individual 10-minute structured telephone interviews focusing on treatment barriers chosen from prior research on social determinants of health. Participants identified the extent to which various barriers impacted appointment attendance. Results: Data collection is currently underway. Preliminary results demonstrate time limitations/scheduling difficulties and challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic as the most frequent barriers to accessing treatment with 60% endorsement rates each. Relatedly, 50% reported difficulty taking time off from work. Several endorsed confusion surrounding the purpose of the appointment (40%), financial concerns (30%), family stress/mental health (30%), limited childcare (20%), transportation (10%), housing difficulties (10%), and language barriers (20%). Conclusion: Current findings highlight challenges that contribute to inequities in familiesâ€™ access to care. These challenges represent important targets for interventions aimed at minimizing health care disparities. Such interventions hold promise for mitigating the extent to which PICS-related difficulties negatively impact youthâ€™s social, psychological, and academic functioning following inpatient hospitalization.","RichWimmer, Natalia, Larson, Kera, Smith-Russell, Dierdre, Tornberg, Emma, Williams, Cydni N.; Hall, Trevor A.; Vanderlind, Michael","https://www.google.com/search?q=Patient+Barriers+to+Accessing+Hospital-Based+Neuropsychological+Services","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists; 37(6):1369-1369, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37713,""

"Changes in mental health and physical activity patterns before and during the covid-19 pandemic in Swedish adolescents - a longitudinal study","Background The covid-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the daily lives of adolescents, even in Sweden where the restrictions were relatively mild. The aim of this study was to examine if there had been a change in mental health outcomes and if these changes were related to changes in physical activity patterns before and during the pandemic. Methods In this longitudinal study, data were collected in the autumn 2019 and in follow-up measurements in the spring 2021. Physical activity and sedentary time were measured for seven consecutive days by accelerometry (Actigraph). The mental health outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychosomatic health were measured with questionnaires (KIDSCREEN-10 and PSP). ANCOVA analyses were applied to estimate the associations between change in physical activity patterns and mental health outcomes. Results In total, 585 boys (45%) and girls (55%), aged 13-14 years (baseline) from 34 schools around Stockholm, were included in the study. Between 2019-2021 there was a decrease in HRQoL (p &gt; 0.001) and increase in psychosomatic problems (p &gt; 0.001) among both boys and girls. There was a significant positive relationship between change in MVPA and change in HRQoL (ÃŸ = 0.02, CI: 0.00, 0.05). Conclusions The results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has impaired the mental health of Swedish adolescents but increased physical activity was related to positive changes in the mental health outcome HRQoL.

A two-year care-PA initiative specifically developed for citizens with a low SES, X-Fittt 2.0, was offered free of charge to participants, and included 12 weeks of intensive guidance and sports sessions, and 21 months of aftercare. Here, we study the impact of X-Fittt 2.0 on health, quality of life (QoL), and societal participation using a mixed-methods design. Methods Questionnaires and body measurements were taken from 208 participants at the start of X-Fittt 2.0 (t0) and after 12 weeks (t1), one year (t2) and two to three years (t3). We also held 17 group discussions (t1, n = 71) and 68 semi-structured interviews (t2 and t3). Continuous variables were analysed using a linear mixed-model analysis (corrected for gender, age at t0, height, education level and employment status at the different time points), while we used descriptive statistics for the categorical variables. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic analysis. Results Body weight was significantly lower at all three post-initiative time points compared with the baseline, with a maximum of 3.8 kg difference at t2. BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure and self-perceived health only significantly improved during the first 12 weeks. A positive trend regarding paid work was observed, while social visits decreased. The latter might be explained by the COVID-19 pandemic, as lockdowns limited social life. Furthermore, participants reported increased PA (including sports) and a few stopped smoking or drinking alcohol. Participants mentioned feeling healthier, fitter and more energetic. Additionally, participants' self-esteem and stress levels improved, stimulating them to become more socially active. However, the participants also mentioned barriers to being physically active, such as a lack of money or time, or physical or mental health problems. Conclusions X-Fittt 2.0 improved the health, QoL and societal participation of the participants. Future initiatives should take into account the aforementioned barriers, and consider a longer intervention period for more sustainable results. More complete data are needed to confirm the findings.","Mulderij, Lisanne, Verkooijen, Kirsten, Groenewoud, Stef, Koelen, Maria, Wagemakers, Annemarie","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+a+care-physical+activity+initiative+for+people+with+a+low+socioeconomic+status+on+health,+quality+of+life,+and+societal+participation","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37718,""
"Mental health effects of COVID-19","The physical effects of COVID-19 are felt globally. However, one issue that has not been sufficiently addressed is the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens worldwide are enduring widespread lockdowns;children are out of school;and millions have lost their jobs, which has caused anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress. Mental Health Effects of COVID-19 provides a comprehensive analysis of mental health problems resulting from COVID-19, including depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, trauma, and PTSD. The book includes chapters detailing the impact of COVID-19 on the family's well-being and society dynamics. The book concludes with an explanation on how meditation and online treatment methods can be used to combat the effects on mental health.

"Suicide prevention risk strategies addressing the needs of youth","The purpose of my research was to understand LAUSD counselors' perceptions related to professional development around crisis response before and during COVID. The goal of this project was to learn how we can best support prevention efforts for students. I learned about counselors' understanding of the suicide preventative measures the district endorses, if they felt comfortable implementing those strategies, and if they perceived those strategies to impact the student needs we see in schools. I was particularly interested in suicide prevention from an academic counselor's perspective. While there are supplemental counselors, I was particularly interested in the role of the norm-generated counselor. Thus, I learned learn what supports counselors' need to implement suicide prevention appropriately and with confidence in their skills to do so.

"The controversy around the vaccine against Covid-19","Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the phenomenon known as conspiracy theories started to develop under the uncertainty of what is going to happen next and why we are forced to live in times like that. Meanwhile, researchers tried to develop as soon as possible a vaccine that would mitigate the damage caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and eventually put an end to this pandemic. But, the effort of creating a vaccine is threatened by a vast number of people that tend to reject the idea of vaccination because of distrust in vaccine efficiency, fear related to side effects, the composition of vaccine and so on. What fuels these negative attitudes towards anti-Covid-19 vaccination are the controversies born from conspiracy theories, that tend to be attractive to some categories of people, such as younger individuals, women, people with low-income levels, a low level of education and people from ethnic minorities. In this paper, I tried to capture what are the reasons for people's vaccine hesitancy, and how we can resolve this problem.","Molea, Raluca-Mihaela","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+controversy+around+the+vaccine+against+Covid-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Comparative Research in Anthropology and Sociology; 12(2):21-29, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37721,""

"Postintensive care syndrome in COVID-19 Unicentric pilot study Calm does not come after the storm SÃ­ndrome post cuidados intensivos en COVID-19 Estudio piloto unicÃ©ntrico La calma no llega tras la tempestad","Introduction Postintensive care syndrome (PICS) is the physical, cognitive or psychiatric deterioration that appears after a critical illness and persists beyond hospital admission. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of PICS in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit of the Consorcio Hospital General Universitario de Valencia. Patients They benefited from a standardized assessment, addressing health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5D-3L), a physical status (6 MWT, â€œtest up and goâ€ and hand dynamometer), a nutritional assessment (MUST and the Global Subjective Assessment), cognitive impairment (MoCA), mental health disorders (HADS and Davidson Trauma Scale) and pain (visual analogue scale and DN4). Results From March to June 2020, 59 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were admitted to our ICU. 29 of these were recruited for the study. The stay in the ICU and the mechanical ventilation time were long (24 days [IQR 12â€“36], and 18 days [IQR 7â€“31] respectively). The SOFA upon admission to the ICU was high (3 [IQR 3â€“5]). Tracheostomy was performed in 52% and pronation in 93%. 90% had some abnormal test. 20% had post-traumatic stress syndrome. Conclusions We found that 9 out of 10 survivors of SARS-CoV-2 admitted had at least one PICS alteration at 4â€“6 weeks from discharge from the Hospital.

"The Relationship Between Mood, Cognition, and Functional Impairment in Recovered COVID-19 Patients","Objective: Recent studies exploring the psychological and cognitive effects of COVID-19 indicate decline in memory, language, and executive functioning, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between acute COVID-19 symptom load and self-report of psychological, cognitive, and functional outcomes after recovery. Method: 65 adults treated by Staten Island University Hospital for COVID-19 participated in a brief battery of screening measures. The protocol included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5, and World Health Organization Schedule Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS). Participants were asked about 11 symptoms they may have experienced when acutely ill to determine the total COVID-19 symptom load (CSL) and current cognitive and psychological symptoms. Pearsonâ€™s correlation was used to investigate associations between variables. Results: CSL was not associated with total WHODAS score, although it was weakly associated with the Self-Care and Life Activities domains. Current cognitive symptom load was moderately associated with most WHODAS domains. It was most strongly associated with Understanding and Communication (r=0.36;p=0.003). All psychological domains were associated with greater WHODAS impairment, and depression had the strongest association (r=0.43;p&lt; 0.001). Conclusions: CSL does not appear to predict the functional impacts of COVID-19. Psychological factors, particularly depression, appear to be slightly more associated with functional impairment than cognitive symptoms. Results highlight the importance of targeted intervention for current cognitive and psychological symptoms in recovered COVD-19 patients, regardless of CSL.","Keren, Yocheved, Russell, Katherine E.; Basile, Rosemarie","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Relationship+Between+Mood,+Cognition,+and+Functional+Impairment+in+Recovered+COVID-19+Patients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists; 37(6):1432-1432, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37727,""
"A prophetic coaching strategy for African American churchgoers' mental hygiene","Mental health challenges and therapeutic intervention are often stigmatized in the African American church. People were encouraged to pray more earnestly or draw closer to God to overcome mental struggles within this culture. If their symptoms persist, it is most likely due to sin or weakness. This misunderstanding stems from centuries of African American trauma dating back to 1619, and it remains pervasive through the pandemic due to Covid-19. It has done more harm than good by preventing people from confronting their issues. The School of Prophets' strategy is based on empowerment theology, which examines the church's role in dismantling strongholds and strengthening members of the African American church. When members face barriers to mental health care due to a lack of Black counselors or a general mistrust of these services, the church can provide it.A strategy of prophetic coaching has been proposed in which church members can receive one-on-one prophetic coaching and participate in mental health workshops. Prior to and following the program, members of Zoe Ministries church were surveyed to determine the effectiveness of these prophetic coaching programs on their mental health concerns. Additionally, the researcher surveyed prophetic coaches who led one-on-one prophetic coaching sessions to identify ways in which the program could be streamlined and improved.The findings of this study indicated a shift in participants' awareness of and capacity to address their mental health struggles. The prophetic coaches discussed the scheduling and technical difficulties they encountered. In general, the program enabled church members to seek mental health support they would not have sought otherwise.

"Covid-19 Lockdown Landslides: The Negative Impact of Subsequent Lockdowns on Loneliness, Wellbeing, and Mental Health of Australians","OBJECTIVE We previously reported on loneliness, depression, anxiety and stress of Australians living alone during the first COVID-19-related government enforced lockdown in Australia. At this time, those living alone were experiencing relatively low levels of emotional distress. Since then, one state, Victoria, underwent a second extended lockdown period and until now, it was unclear what impact this sequential lockdown might have had on the mental health and wellbeing of Victorian citizens. The current study aimed to add to the emerging literature on the lockdown experience in Australia by directly comparing the levels of anxiety, depression, stress, loneliness, and wellbeing between Victorians in the second extended lockdown and Australians in the first lockdown. DESIGN Data from our original study of 384 Australians was compared with cross-sectional surveys of 340 Victorians during the second lockdown period. SETTING An online survey was administered with people residing in Victoria self-selecting to complete the study. OUTCOME MEASURES Participants were asked to complete the Depression, Anxietyand Stress Scale (DASS-21), WHO-5 Wellbeing Scale, and the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale. They were also invited to offer their insights into how the second extended lockdown experience had differed from the first. RESULTS Independent samples t-tests revealed that Australians were significantly more depressed, anxious, stressed, and lonely, and experienced reduced psychological wellbeing in the second lockdown compared to the first however overall, the levels indicated mild psychological distress. Qualitative insights revealed impact on mental health and a feeling of increased restrictions during lockdown two. CONCLUSIONS Participants demonstrated adaptation to the lockdowns, providing support for the measures the Australian government have adopted to physically protect Australians from COVID-19. Management of the negative psychological impact through attention to wellbeing practices is however recommended in light of the increase in mental health concerns and likelyfurther lockdown periods.","Johnston, K.; Oliva, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Covid-19+Lockdown+Landslides:+The+Negative+Impact+of+Subsequent+Lockdowns+on+Loneliness,+Wellbeing,+and+Mental+Health+of+Australians","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asia Pacific Journal of Health Management; 16(4):125-133, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37729,""
"Investigation of Social and Emotional Life and Gender Differences of University Students in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia during the Covid-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic as accurately a historical and unique event causing a paradigm shift in ways how we live but also how business function. In addition to the health system, the education system was the first ""under treat"" since the beginning of the pandemic. Universities were forced to completely switch to remote teaching that was later characterized as ""emergency remote teaching"". Parallel to this, governments imposed severe measures of distancing among everyone, including both students and staff. This has brought numerous changes to students' lives. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the social and emotional life of university students in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia. For this purpose, the article uses data available from a comprehensive Global Student Survey ""Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Life of Higher Education Students"" which was carried out among 30 000 higher education students coming from 129 countries during the period May - June 2020 via the open-source web. The Survey was conducted through two waves however since data on BiH is available only from the first wave, the paper employs the dataset from the first one. Thus, Bill's sample includes 409 responses while Croatian sample includes 673 responses. Gender and field of study effect is significant in few segments i.e., female students tend to be more worried about certain issues. Students of natural and technical sciences tend to feel significantly more hopeful and ashamed compared to their colleagues who were studying arts and social sciences. This paper also provides recommendations for education authorities and other relevant stakeholders for improving student's engagement and their mental health and well-being.","Jahic, H.; Obadic, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Investigation+of+Social+and+Emotional+Life+and+Gender+Differences+of+University+Students+in+Bosnia+and+Herzegovina+and+Croatia+during+the+Covid-19+Pandemic","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: 11th International Scientific Symposium Region, Entrepreneurship, Development (Red 2022);: 313-326, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37730,""
"MOVEluencer: a project to promote physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in a rural community setting","Background An appropriate level of Physical Activity (PA) is important for both physical and mental health and has also been suggested as a protective element against COVID-19. However, even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already a high number of physically inactive people in Austria. Due to ongoing pandemic-related social restrictions, not only a further increase of inactivity is suspected, but also the promotion of PA is currently a major challenge. Therefore, the project â€œMOVEluencerâ€ which has been running since July 2021, follows a multidimensional PA promotion approach that is less affected by the presence of any social restrictions. Methods The project was realized in six rural communities in Styria (a province of Austria), which were selected based on inequality factors related to health and PA. The target groups are physically inactive residents, particularly families and elderly. Overall, the project measures are based on a participatory approach and are implemented in three sections (phase 1 -3). Results Phase 1 (July - December 2021) represented an analysis phase in which a photo-challenge was conducted. The aim of the challenge was to identify resources and opportunities for improving active mobility and PA in the communities based on photos taken by residents. Sixty-seven people (43% female) participated in the challenge and submitted a total of 268 photos which were disseminated via the project-specific social media channels. Moreover, in phase 1 working groups represented by members from the project target groups were established. Phase 2 is currently being implemented (since January 2022). One measure is to recruit and train walking buddies to provide regular walks and simple strength exercises along the walking-way. A further measure represents outdoor-educational events, following an interactive learning approach to improve the populations awareness of active mobility and PA in general. During these events, simple tests that assess components of health-related fitness are also offered. Phase 3 will implement target group-specific PA programs currently being developed in the working groups. Conclusion Promotion of PA remains significant, especially during a pandemic and in rural communities, as awareness of the benefits of PA in this setting is still low.","Holler, Peter, Tuttner, Silvia, Amort, Frank Michael","https://www.google.com/search?q=MOVEluencer:+a+project+to+promote+physical+activity+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+a+rural+community+setting","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37731,""
"Caring for the Patient with COVID-19 in a Rehabilitation Unit","Similar to many hospital systems throughout the United States, the acute rehabilitation (AR) unit at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) in Chi - cago, Illinois, was transformed into a COVID-19 rehabilitation unit during the spring 2020 surge. Because COVID-19 presented as a novel virus (Wang et al., 2020) with substantial acuity, an immediate interprofessional approach to rehabilitation was required in a context of a lack of evidence-based literature or best practices. Educational preparation provides a background in physical disability and mental health training, which positions OTs uniquely to collaborate with patients in identifying their priority goals, and ways to promote independence and success with these goals. [...]they worked closely with physicians to ensure patients with memory loss understood their treatment timeline. RUMC leaders initiated an innovative program to address this isolation while patients were in the AR unit, in which videoconferences facilitated communication between patients and their loved ones.","Hardin, Abigail S.; Ambutas, Shirley, Koesters, Kendra, Biggio, Elizabeth, Dunning, Megan, Gaines, Samuel, Ivanova, Maria, Pederson, Brian, Sitzes, Sean, Chiume, Tonera","https://www.google.com/search?q=Caring+for+the+Patient+with+COVID-19+in+a+Rehabilitation+Unit","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medsurg Nursing; 31(4):262-264, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37732,""
"Social and emotional learning: A qualitative study on supporting student mental health in middle school","Teachers who do not have access to a social and emotional learning (SEL) curriculum are often required to rely on their own background and experience to deliver social and emotional supports to students. This qualitative case study examined SEL strategies used by middle school teachers to support student mental health in the absence of formal SEL curriculum. The study examined teachers strategies for supporting SEL, their perceptions of preparedness, and their perceptions of how school leaders can assist with SEL implementation. The Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL) conceptual framework was used in this study (CASEL, 2020). Data was collected via a whole staff survey, semi-structured interviews, and artifacts. The study confirmed teachers use a variety of strategies to support students' social and emotional needs even when there is no curriculum in place. A supportive classroom environment was a primary strategy. Teachers felt that professional development focused on strategies could strengthen their existing practices, and administrators were seen as a vehicle for providing the training and resources for SEL. Though SEL programs are available, this study suggests that integrated programs may be more effective, and teachers may find them more beneficial. With the ongoing COVID pandemic, student wellness needs are paramount, (Lee, 2020) and a commitment to social justice means supporting students at all levels including social, emotional and academic.

"Depression and anxiety symptoms in workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused a health, economic and social crisis, with important repercussions on working conditions, jobs, domestic life, and people's mental health. This study aimed to identify symptoms of depression and anxiety experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of workers. For data collection, an online protocol was used, consisting of a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the DASS-21 screening scale (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Short Form) and the Mental and Occupational Health Battery (BSMO). The study was carried out with 503 professionals, 78.5% female, with a mean age of 41.38 years (SD 11.89). Most of the sample (92%) had attended higher education and resided in the southern region of Brazil. It was found that single females who reported contact with people infected with COVID-19 and who indicated that they were more concerned about the disease had higher scores in anxiety/or depression. It is concluded that the BSMO scale discriminates anxiety from depression well and presents good correlation indicators with the DASS-21 scale.

"Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)","Objective: To describe psychiatric symptoms in a sample of patients seeking treatment for â€œbrain fogâ€ due to Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Method: Patients were referred for a neuropsychological evaluation from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Post-COVID Treatment Program. Ninety-two patients completed a battery of self-report questionnaires to measure mood symptoms and behavior. Patients were on average 49 years of age (range: 18 to 74), female (77%), and White/Caucasian (73%)/Black/African American (25%), with 15.49 years of education (SD = 2.43). Results: On average, patients who sought treatment for PASC reported mild to moderate anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment [GAD-7];M = 9.83, SD = 6.07), moderate depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8];M = 13.23, SD = 5.81), moderate stress levels (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS];M = 22.97, SD = 7.99). They also reported overall functional impairment in activities of daily living (Functional Assessment Questionnaire [FAQ];M = 9.57, SD = 8.29) and perceived cognitive impairment (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire [CFQ];M = 55.22, SD = 18.66). Additionally, patients endorsed several somatic symptoms (PHQ-15;M = 13.90, SD = 5.16), mild insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI];M = 14.80, SD = 6.85), and severe fatigue (Chalderâ€™s Fatigue Scale [CFS];M = 25.53, SD = 5.72).

"Evaluation of the psychiatric diagnosis of children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A sample from a university hospital","Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric diagnoses of children and adolescents who refered to the psychiatry outpatient clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This study enrolled the patients who were presented to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry outpatient clinic between September 2019 and March 2020 and between September 2020 and March 2021. The patients were scanned retrospectively with the Nucleus outpatient clinic system. The data were analyzed with SSPS 21.0. Age, gender and psychiatric diagnosis of patients Results: were examined. This study enrolled 1157 patients with 10.8 mean age and 61.5% male participants. 53% (n = 622) of patients was diagnosed before pandemia and 46.2% (n = 535) of patients was diagnosed during pandemia. Before pandemia: patients were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 40%, Anxiety Disorder (AD) 16.1%, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 5.1%. During pandemia: patients were diagnosed with ADHD 27.3%, AD 19.3%, ASD 5.6%. During the pandemia the number of female patients increased (p = 0.017), mean age of patients decreased (p = 0.035), the diagnosed ADHD rates decreased (p &lt; 0.001) and the diagnosed AD (p = 0.024), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (p=0.001) rates increased. Conclusion: In our study the diagnosis of AD and MDD during pandemia increased and the diagnosis of ADHD decreased. Because of the online education during pandemia, number of ADHD patients decreased and increasing in diagnosis of AD and MDD might caused by phsycial and social limitations. In this period it is important to follow and treat the patients that already have psychiatric disorder like ADHD.

"""The Great Divide"": Isolation in Willa Cather's O Pioneers! and The Song of the Lark","Unlike some of Cather's other works, such as My Ãntonia, which focus more on the negative effects of physical isolation, Cather offers in these novels a more complicated portrait of isolation's value to women who need independence from their communities in order to explore the widely dissimilar fields of agriculture and opera. Stout discusses at some length the ""redefinition of women"" that Cather undertakes in writing the careers of Alexandra and Thea.5 She also notes the ""ambiguity"" of Cather's female characters in general, in their ability to step outside gender roles and to pursue their interests in spite of naysayers in their communities.6 In the context of Stout's broad study of Cather's life and career as a modernist, where isolation indirectly impacts the self-discovery of Cather's early heroines, I argue that isolation is in fact the key ingredient in their emotional development and in their successful careers. While this narrative highlights the importance of isolation in order to allow experimentation and self-discovery, Cather also pays close attention to the way that physical isolation, especially in combination with poverty, can discourage people from pursuing their interests and can damage their mental health. While isolation does take a serious toll on their mental health, it also plays a vital role in their success because it allows them to experiment with new ideas unhindered and because it gives them space to recharge away from the demands of difficult relationships.","Farthing, Sophie","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Great+Divide:+Isolation+in+Willa+Cather's+O+Pioneers!+and+The+Song+of+the+Lark","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Great Plains Quarterly; 42(1/2):49-59, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37739,""

"School leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic: A phenomenological study","This phenomenological study presented the lived experiences of eight high school principals who led through the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants represented eight different school from five school districts from across Colorado. Each participant's school implemented 1:1 devices, namely Chromebooks or iPads, for each student prior to the pandemic's onset. The research question that guided this study was: What are lived experiences of high school principals who led through the COVID-19 pandemic? Data were collected via one-hour, individual, semi-structured interviews in person or via Zoom, then transcribed and analyzed. A phenomenological approach to the data was employed while implementing bridling methods on the researcher's part. Three key themes emerged from the data. Theme 1 included hardships of the pandemic and contained five subthemes: (a) the pandemic was hard on leaders, (b) the pandemic was hard on teachers, (c) the pandemic was hard on students, (d) the pandemic was hard on the community, and (e) symbolic events helped ease hardships. Theme 2 was the pandemic as catalyst and presented four subthemes: (a) catalyst for shifts in grading practices, (b) catalyst for shifts in weekly schedules, (c) catalyst for shifts in meeting protocols, (d) catalyst for a renewed focus on the leaders' work. The final theme was support is critical. The third theme included five subthemes: (a) district support for leaders, (b) mental health support for the school community, (c) school leaders' support for teachers, (d) school leaders' support for self, and (e) school leaders creating connections as support. Significant statements directly from interviews with the participants were included to support the findings.

"Whose Concerns? It's Time to Adjust the Lens of Research on Police-Involved Overdose Response","(p. 1326) creatively use body-worn camera footage- a previously unused data source-to support the following findings of previous research: (1) police can administer naloxone during an overdose, (2) combativeness toward first responders by overdose survivors is rare, (3) drug exposure is nota risk to police officers, and (4) arrests do occur at the scene of overdose emergencies as the result of police presence.1,2 Although we recognize this article's contribution to the growing literature on law enforcement involvement in overdose response, we would caution policymakers about using the findings of this study to bolster (or worse, solely rely on) the role of police in overdose response. White et al. document that arrest- of both overdose victims and other bystanders-does indeed occur. [...]their conclusion that concerns about police-administered naloxone are ""overstated"" is dismissive of the most problematic and disruptive concern examined in the study. The disproportionate risk of violence at the hands of police is a powerful deterrent to inviting law enforcement interaction (specifically by calling 911)-one that cannot be resolved by the limited protections provided by most 911 Good Samaritan laws.10 Furthermore, druginduced homicide investigations not only directly undermine the protective mechanisms of 911 Good Samaritan laws5 but are also disproportionately used against non-White persons-and almost exclusively in response to the preventable overdose deaths of White persons.11 Disproportionate policing, police violence, and incarceration of Black and Indigenous persons affect these groups' access to overdose prevention interventions, broadly, and to naloxone, specifically, especially in cases when the nearest available naloxone rests in the hands of police. Black and Indigenous people have the highest fatal overdose rates and are least served by resource allocations that further support police involvement in overdose response. [...]methodologically sound and Black and Indigenous PWUD-informed research indicates otherwise, policymakers and resource allocation decision-makers should consider any life-saving gains via police-involved overdose response to be disproportionately unavailable and inaccessible to Black and Indigenous people.","Doe-Simkins, Maya M.

"#MeToo in South Korea: Public Health Meets a Global Movement","Eleven years later, in 2017, #MeToo went viral in response to sexual assault allegations against director Harvey Weinstein.1 Across the world, individuals shared their stories of experiencing gender-based violence and harassment;as of December 2019, the hashtag had more than 24 million impressions.1 Sexual violence is not regularly framed as a social determinant of health, even though the literature linking sexual violence to mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders is abundant.2 The momentum resulting from #MeToo prompted a larger question: could a global social movement potentially play a role in improving mental health outcomes for victims of gender-based violence? In 2018, the South Korean government increased both maximum sentence time and the statute of limitations for sexual harassment and sex crimes involving abuse of power.4 However, some of the discourse surrounding #MeToo in South Korea has received pushback and spurred support for men's rights groups.5 #MeToo AS A FAVORABLE HEALTH EXPOSURE The authors' findings suggest that the #MeToo movement had a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms among female survivors of gender-based violence. Social stigma remains a key driver in normalizing sexual violence, potentially lowering reporting rates;it has also been shown to worsen mental health disorders that result from gender-based violence.8 Encouraging discourse and acknowledging the issue's prevalence could have an impact on both the isolation and lack of support survivors typically experience.","Dilip, Deepika M.

"Managing expectations after expecting: A phenomenological study of anger and societal expectations in new motherhood","The literature on motherhood is dominated by topics on the roles of attachment, prenatal care, and childrearing. Research on the negative effects of motherhood is typically described in terms of postpartum depression (PPD) or postpartum mood disorder (PPMD). However, anger is a prominent component in motherhood, which may not be seen through the criteria of PPD or PPMD. Additionally, angry mothers conflict with the mythos of the Good Mother.In this phenomenological study, the thematic structure of mothers' experience within the first year of their newborns' life are examined. Data from interviews with seven women who were four to ten months postpartum were analyzed for thematic similarities and variance. In this study, the four themes emerged from the mothers' experiences within the context of expectation that was evident in both the mothers' own perception as well as the perception of others' expectations.The identified themes emerged from Merleau-Ponty's existential grounds as follows: The first was the visceral nature of motherhood, both physically and mentally. Four subthemes emerged, including the Intensive Labor of Motherhood, Motherhood is Hard, Loss of Control, and the Language of Anger. The second theme noted the Changes Surrounding Motherhood, where ideas emerged about the temporal nature of how women become mothers, such as the suddenness of that transition and when mothers begin to ""get their lives back."" Three subthemes emerged surrounding Identity, Transition into Motherhood, and Grief. An interesting secondary subtheme of Older Motherhood also arose around the theme of transition. The third theme emerged around the Connection to Others about the support systems and how those near and far supports undergird their experiences as mothers. A subtheme arose of Loneliness and Isolation with a secondary subtheme of Lack of Information, with a tertiary subtheme of Looking for Support, and Comparison. The final theme was about the Pressure and Expectation, which discussed the societal constructs that influence how they become mothers. Within this area, five subthemes emerged: Motherhood During Covid, Guilt, ""Shoulds"" and Supposed To, Judgment, and Societal Implications of Motherhood. The results from this study provide a unique contribution to how motherhood is conceptualized as well as how support is defined for mothers. The implications for this study are that there are a number of moments of distress often hidden in the ""joy of motherhood."" In their experiences, the mothers indicated that they felt episodes of anger. They directed their anger at themselves, their situation, their loved ones, caregivers, and sometimes society at large.This study is the first study of becoming a mother during COVID-19. Additionally, this is the first study to include substantial feelings of grief and loss during motherhood that does not relate to the loss of a child. In their experiences, the mothers indicated that they experienced episodes of anger. This anger emerged at themselves, their situation, their loved ones, caregivers, and sometimes society at large. Moreover, the mothers noted anger emerging when faced with the perception that discussing their struggles would ultimately mean that they would lose that support that was so necessary. This led them to censor themselves when discussing their struggles, exacerbating feelings of isolation, grief, guilt, and anger. Mothers noted an increase in isolation as they confronted a lack of information and support. The noted an increase in anger as they sought to navigate comparison, and the resulting guilt that emerged. Finally, the mothers expressed feelings of judgment, pressure from the ever present ""shoulds,"" and the overarching societal implications that accompany motherhood.

The collection offers excellent overviews of many critical approaches, identifies multiple avenues for advancing understandings of Hemingway's life and work, and ultimately marks 2000 as a turning point for Hemingway studies as well as the world. 2020 will be remembered (at least for a while) as a similarly significant moment thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and a retrospective in another two decades would hopefully reveal that year to also be the start of a prosperous period in Hemingway studies.","del Gizzo, Suzanne, Curnutt, Kirk","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+New+Hemingway+Studies","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Hemingway Review; 41(2):146-149, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37748,""

"""What happens in this house, does not stay in this house:"" Examining the relationship between cultural mistrust and mental health help seeking behaviors amongst African Americans","The history of African Americans within the United States is one that is deeply complex. Historical trauma both directly and/or vicariously experienced has fostered a sense of cultural mistrust amongst African Americans that have since become transgenerational and resulted in rigid attitudes, beliefs, and opinions for many. Due to these experiences, African Americans continue to be a race that is underrepresented in mental health services and treatment though they experience symptomology at the same rate as their White counterparts. The purpose of this study was to examine African Americans help seeking behaviors and levels of cultural mistrust amidst a global pandemic and heightened sociopolitical tensions across the United States. Two hundred twenty participants completed an online survey that assessed their attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help and their level of culture of mistrust. Linear regression analyses were used to analyze the data and it was founded that the older the participant, the higher levels of cultural mistrust they possessed. Additionally, participants who endorsed past and/or current therapy experiences had more favorable attitudes towards receiving treatment. Though demographic variables were held constant throughout the analysis of this study, both participant stigma and educational attainment were found to have a relationship with participants attitudes toward seeking help and cultural mistrust levels. The significance of this study was to highlight the ongoing need for the advancement of mental health services within African American communities and is one of the first to examine this phenomenon during a pandemic. Limitations, recommendations, and clinical and training implications are discussed.

"Relationship between Sleep, Digital Usage and Emotional States in Thai Occupational Therapy Students","INTRODUCTION: Occupational imbalance of overloaded online education and sleep deprivation has been complained by Thai occupational therapy students (OTS) during the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) e.g., feeling asleep in the classroom, inactive engagement in problem-based learning. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aims to survey the OTS (n = 52 out of 128) regarding many standardized tools: smartphone addiction, internet addiction, sleep quality, sleep hygiene, and emotional states. Data analysis includes Pearson's and Spearman's rank-order correlations, Chi-square tests, and calculation of point prevalence rates. RESULTS: A strong correlation of smartphone and internet addiction was found (r = 0.703, p &lt; 0.001). Moderate correlations were addressed including sleep quality and smartphone addiction (r = 0.566), sleep quality and stress (r = 0.574), sleep quality depression (r = 0.554), and anxiety and smartphone addiction (r = 0.512). This study has reported point prevalence rates, such as 23.44% poor sleep quality, 17.96% smartphone addiction, and 7.81% anxiety. CONCLUSION: The unwell sleep OTS are gaining comorbidities of smartphone and internet addiction and negative emotional states than those well sleep OTS. A restoration of occupational balance will be required for those poor sleep quality and anxiety.","Chatthong, W.; Khemthong, S.; Rueankam, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Relationship+between+Sleep,+Digital+Usage+and+Emotional+States+in+Thai+Occupational+Therapy+Students","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asia Pacific Journal of Health Management; 16(4):116-124, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37751,""
"Divergence Between Individual- and Neighborhood-Level Fatal Overdose Burden: A Population-Based Statewide Study","OBJECTIVES: To compare the characteristics of individual overdose decedents in Rhode Island, 2016-2020 to the neighborhoods where fatal overdoses occurred over the same time period. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of fatal overdoses occurring between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. Using individual- and neighborhood-level data, we conducted descriptive analyses to explore the characteristics of individuals and neighborhoods most affected by overdose. RESULTS: Most overdose decedents during the study period were non-Hispanic White. Across increasingly more White and non-Hispanic neighborhoods, rates of fatal overdose per 100,000 person-years decreased. An opposite pattern was observed across quintiles of average neighborhood poverty. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of fatal overdose were higher in less White, more Hispanic, and poorer neighborhoods, suggesting modest divergence between the characteristics of individuals and the neighborhoods most severely affected. These impacts may not be uniform across space and may accrue differentially to more disadvantaged and racially/ethnically diverse neighborhoods.","Cartus, Abigail R. M. P. H. PhD, Goedel, William C.

"Communication of health measures of distancing by COVID-19 in the media: A qualitative analysis","Physical and social distancing became a key measure in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic and required the mass media for its dissemination. This descriptive study, using qualitative methodology and content analysis had the purpose of interpreting messages about this measure as published at the beginning of the pandemic in Chilean mass media. It considered 63 news obtained in formal media sources on the Internet between April and May 2020.From the analysis, emerged the following thematic categories: social and physical distancing strategy, consequences on the population, messages and expert voices, importance of both social determinants and digital communication channels in a restricted physical environment. Findings indicate that formal media had a fundamental role in the dissemination of expert information based on reliable scientific evidence, in the civic interpellation of citizens, and denouncing health problems, among them, mental health declining of the population. The capacity of people to adapt to digital media for socializing was also exposed, and aspects of the sociocultural determinants affecting the population's perception of risk were incipiently highlighted.

"A quantitative study on the impact of adapted school instruction as a result of COVID-19 pandemic on student standardized math scores in a midwest public school district at the middle school level","The COVID-19 Pandemic has presented the educational system with challenges that have caused adaptive instruction techniques for all student populations in one way or another. The researcher chose to focus specifically on the impact of adaptive instruction as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the area of mathematics by evaluating student growth on STAR Math Assessments at the Middle School level for a Midwest Public School District. Through evaluating the data from pre-adaptive instruction to post-adaptive instruction as a result of COVID-19, the researcher aimed to identify possible declines in growth as a result of adaptive learning from the entire population, students who learned at-home versus students who learned in the classroom, students with 504 plans, students with IEPs, Asian students, Black students, Hispanic students, White students, and students who receive free or reduced meal plans. For this study, student growth was defined as the change (increase or decrease) from consecutive mathematic STAR Assessment scores. The researcher utilized left-tailed t-tests of dependent and independent means to determine statistical significance on student growth. By completing the quantitative analyses through utilizing populations derived from the total student population of 4,982 students, the researcher found there was not a statistically significant decline in growth for the entire population, students who learned at-home versus students who learned in the classroom, students with IEPs, Asian students, Black students, Hispanic students, White students and students who receive free or reduced meal plans. There was a statistically significant decline in student growth for students with 504 plans. The researcher suggests future studies to analyze the correlation between parent support and student success learning at home, and identify if there was a correlation between students with anxiety or other mental health illnesses and a decline in growth across all content areas.

"Modeling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic factors on global mobility and its effects on mental health","Prior research has discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's lifestyles and the reduced human development index. However, little is known about how the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic factors influence global mobility and, in turn, impact our mental health. Also, little is known about how computational models would predict global mobility under the influence of COVID-19 and socioeconomic variables. The primary objectives of this paper are to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic factors on people's mobility worldwide and to develop a regression model to predict the future impact on mobility due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The two datasets used for this study are the mobility and the COVID-19 dataset. The data taken into consideration was for 14Â months, i.e., from April 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. The mobility dataset contained retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas. In contrast, the COVID-19 and socioeconomic dataset contained total confirmed cases, total deaths, total tests, population density, human development index, and other variables. Multiple regression models were built to predict the pandemic's impact on different mobility variables around the world. Variables such as the total number of cases and total deaths per million were negatively correlated with people's mobility at retail and recreation centers, indicating fear and uncertainty. There was a significant negative correlation between reported cases of domestic violence and mobility to the workplace. This indicates the increased stress and anxiety level among individuals due to imposed lockdown during the pandemic. Implications of computational modeling are discussed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-91196-2.00012-0","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37761,""
"Ultra-low-cost carrier network volatility in Europe: unlocking and disconnecting regions","Using Official Airline Guide schedules analyzer data, this chapter sheds light on the pre-COVID-19 pandemic ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) network developments in Europe at the country and the airport level. It examines the existence of increased route churn (De Wit and Zuidberg, 2016) on both secondary and small airports in Europe as a result of recent moves of ULCCs to rather primary airports. The results show that, with some exceptions, secondary airports are losing traffic relatively to primary airports in the same multi-airport region. In particular, Ryanair is cutting back frequencies at small airports (less than two million passengers annually) in Western Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe, there is no remarkable difference between the development of ultra-low-cost carrier traffic at large and small airports. The findings imply that, in general, secondary and small airports are likely to face increasing ULCC route churn. This could have potential effects on the connectivity and accessibility of specific European regions and on the regions' local consumer welfare and social and economic development. Paradoxically, whereas ULCCs have been instrumental for the rise of several secondary and small airports throughout Europe, they may also cause the demise of some of them in the near future. This development will likely be further influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-820131-2.00010-2","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37762,""
"Mental health impact of COVID-19 and machine learning applications in combating mental disorders: a review","Mental disorders are a critical issue in modern society, yet it remains to be consistently neglected. The COVID19 pandemic has made it much more difficult to seek assistance when one needs it. People are feeling increasingly anxious and uncertain about their futures while being socially separated from their friends and relatives. As people continue to quarantine among the limitations imposed by governments, interaction between clinical therapists or social workers and those suffering from mental illness has gotten increasingly limited. Machine learning is a vital approach for allowing virtual analysis of many forms of textual, audio, and visual data for sentiment analysis and understanding the mental health of people utilizing numerous critical parameters in this situation. This chapter aims to provide a systematic review of the current literature investigating COVID-19's impact on mental well-being, as well as studies that explore machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to detect and treat mental illnesses when traditional therapies are unavailable due to lockdown and social distancing norms imposed. The different machine learning algorithms and deep learning approaches utilized in earlier studies are thoroughly discussed in this chapter. Detailed explanation of the data sources utilized and a review of the types of features investigated in mental disorder identification are included as well. The study's major findings are thoroughly discussed. The obstacles of employing machine learning techniques in biomedical applications are explored, as well as possibilities to enhance and progress the discipline.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-91196-2.00016-8","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","",37763,""
