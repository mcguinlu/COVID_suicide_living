"Longitudinal variability in mortality predicts Covid-19 deaths","Within Europe, death rates due to covid-19 vary greatly, with some countries being hardly hit while others to date are almost unaffected. It would be of interest to pinpoint the factors that determine a country's susceptibility to a pandemic such as covid-19. Here we present data demonstrating that mortality due to covid-19 in a given country could have been largely predicted even before the pandemic hit Europe, simply by looking at longitudinal variability of all-cause mortality rates in the years preceding the current outbreak. The variability in death rates during the influenza seasons of 2015-2019 correlate to excess mortality caused by covid-19 in 2020 (R2=0.48, p<0.0001). In contrast, we found no correlation between such excess mortality and age, population density, degree of urbanization, latitude, GNP, governmental health spendings or rates of influenza vaccinations. These data may be of some relevance when discussing the effectiveness of acute measures in order to limit the spread of the disease and ultimately deaths. They suggest that in some European countries there is an intrinsic susceptibility to fatal respiratory viral disease including covid-19; a susceptibility that was evident long before the arrival of the current pandemic.","Jon O Lundberg; Hugo Zeberg","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248853","20201230","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8643,""
"Using the Online Psychotherapy Tool to Address Mental Health Problems in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for an Electronically Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program","BACKGROUND: The considerable rise of mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental effects on the public health sector and economy. To meet the overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, innovative approaches must be employed to significantly expand mental health care delivery capacity. Although it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtually and digitally delivering psychotherapy, which has been shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good method for addressing this growing demand. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using an online, digital, asynchronous care model to treat mental health issues that are started or aggravated by stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program that is tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material that provides an overview of behavioral skills and weekly homework. Participants (N=80) will receive personalized feedback from and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, which are to be completed by participants at baseline, week 5, and posttreatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity to consent; a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, with symptoms that started or worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability to speak and read English; and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received in June 2020. The recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (intervention group: n=35; control group: n=23). Data collection is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. Analyses (ie, linear regression analysis for continuous outcomes and binomial regression analysis for categorical outcomes) are expected to be completed by February 2021. CONCLUSIONS: If proven feasible, this care delivery method could increase care capacity by up to fourfold. The findings from this study can potentially influence clinical practices and policies and increase accessibility to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, without sacrificing the quality of care.

"Attitudes Toward Using COVID-19 mHealth Tools Among Adults With Chronic Health Conditions: Secondary Data Analysis of the COVID-19 Impact Survey","BACKGROUND: Adults with chronic conditions are disproportionately burdened by COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Although COVID-19 mobile health (mHealth) apps have emerged, research on attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools among those with chronic conditions is scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine attitudes toward COVID-19, identify determinants of COVID-19 mHealth tool use across demographic and health-related characteristics, and evaluate associations between chronic health conditions and attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools (eg, mHealth or web-based methods for tracking COVID-19 exposures, symptoms, and recommendations). METHODS: We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 Impact Survey collected from April to June 2020 (n=10,760). Primary exposure was a history of chronic conditions, which were defined as self-reported diagnoses of cardiometabolic, respiratory, immune-related, and mental health conditions and overweight/obesity. Primary outcomes were attitudes toward COVID-19 mHealth tools, including the likelihood of using (1) a mobile phone app to track COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations; (2) a website to track COVID-19 symptoms, track location, and receive recommendations; and (3) an app using location data to track potential COVID-19 exposure. Outcome response options for COVID-19 mHealth tool use were extremely/very likely, moderately likely, or not too likely/not likely at all. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare the likelihood of COVID-19 mHealth tool use between people with different chronic health conditions, with not too likely/not likely at all responses used as the reference category for each outcome. We evaluated the determinants of each COVID-19 mHealth intervention using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 10,760 respondents, 21.8% of respondents were extremely/very likely to use a mobile phone app or a website to track their COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations. Additionally, 24.1% of respondents were extremely/very likely to use a mobile phone app to track their location and receive push notifications about whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, and residence, adults with mental health conditions were the most likely to report being extremely/very or moderately likely to use each mHealth intervention compared to those without such conditions. Adults with respiratory-related chronic diseases were extremely/very (conditional odds ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.35) and moderately likely (conditional odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.45) to use a mobile phone app to track their location and receive push notifications about whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools vary widely across modalities (eg, web-based method vs app) and chronic health conditions. These findings may inform the adoption of long-term engagement with COVID-19 apps, which is crucial for determining their potential in reducing disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic health conditions.","Camacho-Rivera, Marlene; Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Rivera, Argelis; Vidot, Denise Christina","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24693","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;8(12): e24693, 2020 12 17.; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;8(12): e24693, 2020 12 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8645,""
"Online and Recovery-Oriented Support Groups Facilitated by Peer Support Workers in Times of COVID-19: Protocol for a Feasibility Pre-Post Study","BACKGROUND: In times of pandemics, social distancing, isolation, and quarantine have precipitated depression, anxiety, and substance misuse. Scientific literature suggests that patients living with mental health problems or illnesses (MHPIs) who interact with peer support workers (PSWs) experience not only the empathy and connectedness that comes from similar life experiences but also feel hope in the possibility of recovery. So far, it is the effect of mental health teams or programs with PSWs that has been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a web-based intervention facilitated by PSWs. The five principal research questions are whether this intervention will have an impact in terms of (Q1) personal-civic recovery and (Q2) clinical recovery, (Q3) how these recovery potentials can be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, (Q4) how the lived experience of persons in recovery can be mobilized to cope with such a situation, and (Q5) how sex and gender considerations can be taken into account for the pairing of PSWs with service users beyond considerations based solely on psychiatric diagnoses or specific MHPIs. This will help us assess the impact of PSWs in this setting. METHODS: PSWs will lead a typical informal peer support group within the larger context of online peer support groups, focusing on personal-civic recovery. They will be scripted with a fixed, predetermined duration (a series of 10 weekly 90-minute online workshops). There will be 2 experimental subgroups-patients diagnosed with (1) psychotic disorders (n=10) and (2) anxiety or mood disorders (n=10)-compared to a control group (n=10). Random assignment to the intervention and control arms will be conducted using a 2:1 ratio. Several instruments will be used to assess clinical recovery (eg, the Recovery Assessment Scale, the Citizenship Measure questionnaire). The COVID-19 Stress Scales will be used to assess effects in terms of clinical recovery and stress- or anxiety-related responses to COVID-19. Changes will be compared between groups from baseline to endpoint in the intervention and control groups using the Student paired sample t test. RESULTS: This pilot study was funded in March 2020. The protocol was approved on June 16, 2020, by the Research Ethics Committees of the Montreal Mental Health University Institute. Recruitment took place during the months of July and August, and results are expected in December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Study results will provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of a web-based intervention provided by PSWs. The investigators, alongside key decision makers and patient partners, will ensure knowledge translation throughout, and our massive open online course (MOOC), The Fundamentals of Recovery, will be updated with the evidence and new knowledge generated by this feasibility study.

"Changes in Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels of Subscribers to a Daily Supportive Text Message Program (Text4Hope) During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: In addition to the obvious physical medical impact of COVID-19, the disease poses evident threats to people's mental health, psychological safety, and well-being. Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. Text4Hope, a daily supportive SMS text messaging program, was launched in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic among Canadians. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of subscribers to the Text4Hope program after 6 weeks of exposure to daily supportive SMS text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of Text4Hope subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely generalized anxiety disorder, and likely major depressive disorder were assessed using cutoff scores of &#8805;14 for the PSS-10, &#8805;10 for the GAD-7, and &#8805;10 for the PHQ-9, respectively. At 6 weeks into the program, 766 participants had completed the questionnaires at both time points. RESULTS: At the 6-week time point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales but not on the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates of moderate or high stress and likely generalized anxiety disorder but not likely major depressive disorder for the group that completed both the baseline and 6-week assessments. The largest reductions in mean scores and prevalence rates were for anxiety (18.7% and 13.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means of implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies.

"Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Analysis of Twitter Data","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the world's mental health and health care systems. Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19? (2) To what extent did social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? and (3) Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool. RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19-specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","Valdez, Danny; Ten Thij, Marijn; Bathina, Krishna; Rutter, Lauren A; Bollen, Johan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21418","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e21418, 2020 12 14.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e21418, 2020 12 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8648,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers at acute hospital settings in the South-East of Ireland: an observational cohort multicentre study","OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCWs) at acute hospital settings in the South-East of Ireland, as a crucial step in guiding policies and interventions to maintain their psychological well-being. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 472 HCWs participated from two distinct acute hospital settings, A and B, in the South-East of Ireland. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-as dictated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). An independent sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance of difference in continuous variables between groups. Categorical variables were assessed for significance with a &#967;2 test for independence. RESULTS: The DASS-21 provided independent measures of depression (mean 4.57, IQR 2-7), anxiety (mean 3.87, IQR 1-6) and stress (mean 7.41, IQR 4-10). Positive scores were reflected in 201 workers (42.6%) for depression and 213 (45.1%) for both anxiety and stress. The IES-R measured subjective distress on three subscales: intrusion (mean 1.085, IQR 0.375-1.72), avoidance (mean 1.008, IQR 0.375-1.5) and hyperarousal (mean 1.084, IQR 0.5-1.667). Overall, 195 cases (41.3%) were concerning for PTSD. Site B scored significantly higher across all parameters of depression (5.24 vs 4.08, p<0.01), anxiety (4.66 vs 3.3, p<0.01), stress (8.91 vs 6.33, p<0.01) and PTSD (0.058 vs 0.043, p<0.01). Worse outcomes were also noted in HCWs with underlying medical ailments. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress is prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic; screening for adverse mental and emotional outcomes and developing timely tailored preventative measures with effective feedback are vital to protect their psychological well-being, both in the immediate and long-term.","Ali, Saied; Maguire, Sinead; Marks, Eleanor; Doyle, Maeve; Sheehy, Claire","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042930","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e042930, 2020 Dec 18.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e042930, 2020 Dec 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8649,""

"Relationship between eHealth literacy and psychological status during COVID-19 pandemic: A survey of Chinese residents","AIMS: To investigate the eHealth literacy and the psychological status of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore their interrelationship. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has placed intense psychological pressure on community residents. Their psychological status may be affected by eHealth literacy due to home isolation during this rampant pandemic. METHODS: This is a Web-based cross-sectional survey conducted on the JD Health platform, which resulted in 15,000 respondents having participated in this survey. The eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (EHLQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used. The Pearson correlation was used to analyse the relationship between eHealth literacy and depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: The score of eHealth literacy was 48.88Â Â±Â 8.46, and 11.4%, 6.8% and 20.1% of respondents experienced moderate to severe depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. eHealth literacy negatively correlated with depression (rÂ =Â -0.331), insomnia (rÂ =Â -0.366) and post-traumatic stress disorder (rÂ =Â -0.320). CONCLUSION: eHealth literacy is closely related to psychological status. Improving eHealth literacy may contribute to maintaining good psychological well-being.

"""School of hard knocks"" - what can mental health researchers learn from the COVID-19 crisis?","Since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the first quarter of 2020, children and their families across the world have experienced extraordinary changes to the way they live their lives - creating enormous practical and psychological challenges for them at many levels. While some of these effects are directly linked to COVID-related morbidity and mortality, many are indirect - due rather to governmental public health responses designed to slow the spread of infection and minimise the numbers of deaths. These have often involved aggressive programmes of social distancing and quarantine, including extended periods of national social and economic lockdown, unprecedented in the modern age. Debates about the appropriateness of these measures have often referenced their potentially negative impact on people's mental health and well-being - impacts which both opponents and advocates appear to accept as being inevitable.","Sonuga-Barke, Edmund J S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13364","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Child Psychol Psychiatry;62(1): 1-4, 2021 Jan.; Publication details: J Child Psychol Psychiatry;62(1): 1-4, 2021 Jan.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8652,""
"""Safer at Home"": The effect of the Covid-19 Lockdown on Epidemiology, Resource Utilization and Outcomes at a Large Urban Trauma Center","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire global healthcare system. In California, due to a high burden of cases, a lockdown order was announced on March 19th, 2020. This study investigated the impact of the lockdown on the epidemiology and outcomes of trauma admissions at the largest trauma center in Los Angeles. METHODS: Retrospective study comparing epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of trauma admissions, during the lockdown period (03/20/2020 to 06/30/2020) to a similar period in the previous year (03/20/2019 to 06/30/2019). Data collection included demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital transportation, substance use, injury severity, resource utilization, and outcomes. FINDINGS: There were 1,202 admissions during the lockdown period in 2020 and 1,143 during the same calendar period in 2019. Following the lockdown, there was a reduction in the automobile versus pedestrian admissions by 42.5%, motorcycle injuries by 38.7%, and bicycle accidents by 28.4%, but no significant effect on the number of motor vehicle accident admissions. There was an increase in ground level falls by 32.5%, especially in the elderly group. The absolute number of gunshot wounds increased by 6.2% and knife injuries by 39.3%. Suicides increased by 38.5%. Positive testing for substance use increased by 20.9%. During the lockdown patients suffered less severe trauma, with ISS<9 (p<0.001), as well as less severe head (p=0.001) and severe chest trauma (p<0.001). Trauma deaths were reduced by 27.9% and the crude overall mortality was significantly lower during the lockdown period (4.1% vs 5.9%, p= 0.046). ICU admission rates, mechanical ventilation, and ICU LOS were all reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had a significant effect on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and critical care resource utilization of trauma admissions in a large academic trauma center. These findings may help in planning and optimization of hospital resources during the pandemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, level III.

"Race and Ethnic Group Disparities in Emotional Distress Among Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Framed within Conservation of Resources theory, this study addressed race-ethnic differences in the relationships between emotional distress and current and expected Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic stressors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study employed data from the Household Pulse Survey, a large national survey collecting weekly data to understand the experiences of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic (age 55 and above; N=94,550). Emotional distress included depression and anxiety symptoms. COVID-19 stressors included current and expected income, housing, healthcare, and food insecurities. RESULTS: Older persons of color reported higher rates of stressors and emotional distress than their White counterparts. In relation to current stressors, older Black persons responded with less emotional distress and older Latino persons responded with more emotional distress than older White persons. In addition, older persons of color were more likely to expect future resource losses related to COVID-19, and the association between these expectations and emotional distress varied by race-ethnic group.

The present study examined age differences in pandemic-related stress and social ties, and links with psychological well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants included 645 adults (43% women) ages 18 to 97 (M = 50.8; SD = 17.7) from the May 2020 nationally representative Survey of Consumers. Participants reported the extent to which they felt stress related to the pandemic in the last month, the extent to which their lives had changed due to the pandemic, as well as social isolation, negative relationship quality, positive relationship quality, and frequency of depression, anxiety and rumination in the past week. RESULTS: Results showed that older people reported less pandemic-related stress, less life change, less social isolation, and lower negative relationship quality than younger people. Greater pandemic-related stress, life change, social isolation, and negative relationship quality were associated with poorer psychological well-being. Poorer social ties (i.e., greater social isolation, and negative quality) exacerbated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (stress, life change) on psychological well-being. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Researchers have indicated that older adults may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and social isolation, but this study indicates that young adults may be relatively more vulnerable. Because isolation and negative relationship quality appear to exacerbate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, reducing social isolation and negative relations are potential targets for intervention.","Birditt, Kira S; Turkelson, Angela; Fingerman, Karen L; Polenick, Courtney A; Oya, Akari","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa204","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gerontologist;2020 Dec 21.; Publication details: Gerontologist;2020 Dec 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8655,""
"An International Survey of Clinicians' Experience Caring for Patients Receiving Home Parenteral Nutrition for Chronic Intestinal Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: This survey of centers caring for patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) was conducted to assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis on the management of these patients regarding provision of care, monitoring, regular follow-up, and any changes to service infrastructure. METHODS: A survey was devised and publically published on the Research Electronic Data Capture database management system, with individual centers responding to a public link. RESULTS: A total of 78 adult and pediatric centers worldwide contributed to the survey, representing &#8805;3500 patients' experiences. Centers reported infrastructure maintenance for Parenteral Nutrition (PN) bag deliveries to patients (60, 76.92%) or delivery of ancillary items (57, 73.08%), home delivery and HPN administration (65, 83.33%), and home care nurse shortages (25, 32.05%). Routine follow-up of HPN patients changed to either all telemed or mixed with emergency clinic review (70, 89.74%). In 26 centers (33.33%), HPN for newly discharged patients with benign conditions was reduced or stopped. Based on clinical history, the centers reported psychological distress for patients (52, 66.67%), with anxiety, worry, concern, and apprehension reported most frequently (37 of 52, 71.15%) but also fear (10 of 52, 19.23%), depression (5 of 52, 9.62%), and issues related to isolation/confinement (12 of 52, 23.08%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was reported by clinicians to have had a far-reaching adverse impact on patients receiving HPN, especially their safety in terms of provision of personal protective equipment, PN bags, available nursing staff, and psychological well-being. Healthcare systems responded to the challenge and presented new ways of working.","Allan, Philip J; Pironi, Loris; Joly, Francisca; Lal, Simon; Van Gossum, AndrÃ©","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpen.2050","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr;2020 Nov 25.; Publication details: JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr;2020 Nov 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8656,""

In view of this, in 2015 the Medicine course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) implemented a Mentoring Program, which aims to contribute to students' professional and personal development, focusing on integrative activities to strengthen bonds between the participants.  Method:  This program involves the participation of 25 professors from the UFRN Medicine course, who act as mentors, 25 monitors or mentors, who have the role of mediating communication between participants and assisting in the planning and development of activities; and about 317 students and various academic periods of the medical course. In addition to the regular monthly meetings, at the end of each semester, mentors and junior mentors organize the integrative activity that brings together all the students and teachers of the program and have stimulated a closer relationship between mentors and mentees, as well as contributing toward the structuring of a more welcoming and equitable university environment.  Result:  In an online assessment of the program, students highlighted the ""exchange of experiences, suggestions and help with the course on various topics"" and ""acquiring experience from an experienced professional"" as the main motivations for participating in the activity. On the other hand, they emphasized the lack of time to reconcile meetings with other academic activities as the main obstacle to participating in the program. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the program activities continued online and important engagement was achieved among the participants, thus constituting a strategy to face social isolation and promote the mental health of undergraduate medical students.  Conclusion:  From the engagement and the feedback received, it was observed that the program, despite presenting some challenges, represents an initiative capable of transforming interpersonal relationships between students and mentors, promoting integration between students from different academic periods of the course and creating a favourable environment for dialogue and knowledge construction.","Moreira, Simone da NÃ³brega Tomaz; Albuquerque, Iana Ciara Santos de; Pinto Junior, Francisco Edilson Leite; Gomes, Alexandre Henrique Bezerra","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0100-55022020000400405","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Rev. bras. educ. mÃ©d;44(4): e169, 2020. tab; Publication details: Rev. bras. educ. mÃ©d;44(4): e169, 2020. tab; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8657,""

"COVID-19: Implications for bipolar disorder clinical care and research","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to health care globally, and individuals with bipolar disorder are likely disproportionally affected  Based on review of literature and collective clinical experience, we discuss that without special intervention, individuals with bipolar disorder will experience poorer physical and mental health outcomes due to interplay of patient, provider and societal factors  Some risk factors associated with bipolar disorder, including irregular social rhythms, risk-taking behaviours, substantial medical comorbidities, and prevalent substance use, may be compounded by lockdowns, social isolation and decrease in preventive and maintenance care  We further discuss implications for clinical research of bipolar disorders during the pandemic  Finally, we propose mitigation strategies on working with individuals with bipolar disorder in a clinical and research context, focusing on digital medicine strategies to improve quality of and accessibility to service","Xue, S.; Husain, M.

"COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on thepsychological status of cancer patients and oncologists","On the 11th of March, the Word Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic  This unprecedentedemergency caused some unexpected effects on the health care system  During the pandemic, the attention focusedon keeping cancer patients safe from COVID-19  This infection could have a detrimental effect on the physical andmental health of cancer patients;patients who have a suspension of cancer care suffer more from anxiety and/ordepression  One of the worst side effects of COVID-19 is the fact that family members could not visit patients;socialsupport in cancer patients is an important factor for a healthy mental condition  With no social support, their normalcoping strategies have to adapt and the feeling of helplessness is overwhelming  These aspects are highlighted by acase report of a European Institute of Oncology patient  After a surgical intervention due to oral tongue cancer, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and this caused anxiety and depression symptoms  During the pandemic, health care professionals' (HCP) role has been pivotal: HCP had to cope with a stressful working environment, facing physical and psychological challenges  Oncologists, in particular, in their daily practice are at risk ofdeveloping burnout symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and this could be exacerbated by thepandemic  During pandemic phase 1, we evaluated emotional distress and mental health of oncologists all over theworld  Our results showed a low mental health status and distress regarding emotional status;oncologists revealedthat fear is one of the most diffuse emotions during pandemic  They are afraid for their patients during the hospitalhours, and, when they leave the hospital ward, they feel fear for their family members and cohabitants, in a never-ending feeling of dread  This condition, if prolonged, could be a stressor that could lead to burnout syndrome andpost-traumatic stress disorder  For these reasons, it is important to care for the oncologists who had cared for theirpatients, often prioritizing it over their own well-being  In these particular times, new technologies can help bothpatients and oncologists  In this complex scenario, the role of the oncologists becomes more and more important;new technologies' output must be interpreted and technologies have to be at the service of humans, not vice versa This should help oncologists to perform the integration of a big amount of diverse data otherwise impossible to puttogether meaningfully","Pravettoni, G.","https://doi.org/10.1158/1557-3265.COVID-19-IA16","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Clinical Cancer Research;26(18 SUPPL), 2020.; Publication details: Clinical Cancer Research;26(18 SUPPL), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8712,""

"There is no time like the present: Feasibility and effectiveness of a virtual cardiac rehabilitation program","Background: Cardiac rehabilitation increases healthy behaviours, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, and improves quality of life among people with cardiovascular disease (CVD)  Several barriers to traditional cardiac rehabilitation are removed through virtual care strategies, including: Parking, travel distance, scheduling, and caregiving responsibilities  The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for virtual care options  The University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) launched a virtual care program in 2017  We evaluated the feasibility and psychosocial, health behaviour, and clinical outcomes of a virtual cardiac rehabilitation program (VCRP)  Methods: A before-and-after study was conducted  Patients with CVD discharged from UOHI were recruited to participate in the VCRP that included 6 months of remote rehabilitation coaching (phone, video chat, email, or direct messaging) using a bi-directional, computer-based platform  The coaching was individually tailored and the platform provided patients and their providers access to a health library with resources on a variety of CVD risk factors (e g,  nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure), wellness trackers to monitor health behaviours and CVD risk factors (e g , blood pressure, physical activity, diet), integration with fitness devices, tailored worksheets (e g , SMART goal setting, problem solving), educational workbooks (e g  nutrition, physical activity, smoking), and access to forums to interact with others  Baseline characteristics and feasibility outcomes were summarized using descriptive statistics  Outcomes were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)  Results: A total of 223 patients were referred to VCRP during the evaluation period;23 (10 3%) were never reached/did not start, 31 (13 9%) dropped out, 19 (8 5%) were lost to follow up, and 150 (67 3%) completed the program  There was complete follow-up data for 127 (84 7%) program graduates  At six-month follow-up, significant improvements were observed for anxiety (p=0 001) and depression (p&lt;0 001), weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (+91 1 minutes/week;p&lt;0 001), daily sedentary time (-49 9 minutes;p=0 007), waist circumference (-2 5 cm for females, p=0 02;-1 6 cm for males, p&lt;0 001), HDL cholesterol (+0 06 mg/dL;p=0 001), and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (-0 19 mg/dL;p&lt;0 001)  Conclusion: Our results suggest that VCRP is feasible and leads to improvements in psychosocial, health behaviour, and clinical outcomes  Given the importance of social distancing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the VCRP appears to be an effective alternative to on-site programming  The results of this pilot informed a randomized controlled trial currently underway (clinicaltrials gov: NCT03696446)","Mullen, K.

"The Plausible Mechanisms of Tramadol for Treatment of COVID-19","Currently, no single medication has been approved for the management of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  Therefore, drug repositioningby investigating the use of existingdrugs for management of COVID-19 patients is considered a desperate need  Tramadol is a commonly prescribed analgesic drug for treatment of moderate to severe pain with less potential for dependence and respiratory depression  Multiple evidence support that tramadol is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients  Herein, we discuss the possible beneficial effects of using tramadol against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying mechanism of action  The anti-inflammatory effect of tramadol may help to suppress the COVID-19 related cytokine storm through decreasing interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and C-reactive protein (CRP)  Besides, tramadol activates natural killer (NK) and T-cells and enhances IL-2 secretion, which produce immune-enhancing effect against SARS-CoV-2  Recent studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure showed increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may lead to thrombosis  Tramadol owing to its hypocoagulable effect may protect against venous thromboembolism in these patients  Moreover, tramadol can exert a cardioprotective effect via decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level which is elevated in most of patients with COVID-19  Furthermore, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with old age patients, which may be due to the lack of antioxidant mechanisms and increased oxidative damage  Tramadol could protect COVID-19 patient from disease complications by increases the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase while diminished malondialdehyde  More interestingly, tramadol as an effective analgesicand antitussive may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients suffering from cough, headache, ache, and pain  The tramadol anti-psychotic effect may also protect against psychiatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection  Moreover, tramadol has bactericidal activity against a wide range of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is common in severe COVID-19 patients leading to pneumonia with worse clinical outcomes  Therefore, we hypothesize that tramadol might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 infection  Based on that, tramadol should be considered as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 clinical trials","El-Ashmawy, Nahla E.; Lashin, Abdel-Halim A.; Okasha, Kamal M.; Abo Kamer, Amal M.; Mostafa, Tarek M.; El-Aasr, Mona, Goda, Ahmed E.; Haggag, Yusuf A.; Tawfik, Haytham O.; Abo-Saif, Mariam A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Medical Hypotheses;: 110468, 2020.; Publication details: Medical Hypotheses;: 110468, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8740,""

"PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT CYSTIC FIBROSIS DURING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN","Background - Hundreds of papers have been published on the COVID-19 pandemic, and several of them on psychological themes connected with it, but very little is so far known on how adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCFs) are coping with this dramatic event  Methods â€“ An online questionnaire was developed according to the Italian validated COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and addressed to the general population (GP)  A similar questionnaire, augmented with CF specific questions, targeted pwCFs  The two web-based surveys were accessible for some weeks during the lockdown mandated by the Italian government  Results - The CF questionnaire was completed by 712 adult pwCFs (422 females), matched for sex and age with a 1/5 ratio to GP questionnaire respondents  Mild or medium distress affected 40 2% of pwCFs and 43 9% of GP controls, severe distress 5 3% of pwCFs and 6 2% of GP controls  The level of psychological distress was not correlated with the degree of pulmonary function impairment  When symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were independently analyzed, the control group featured a 55% higher level of mild-moderate anxiety symptoms  Signs of psychological distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were significantly more frequent in female pwCFs compared to males, similarly to GP  Conclusion - Adult pwCFs seem to have equal, and in some domains, lower levels of psychological distress than GP controls  This might be sustained by lifelong experiences in coping with the demands of their chronic disease  These results may orient future psychological interventions","Ciprandi, Riccardo, Bonati, Maurizio, Campi, Rita, Pescini, Rita, Castellani, Carlo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.12.016","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8756,""
"Preoperative Frailty Assessment, Operative Severity Score, and Early Postoperative Loss of Independence in Surgical Patients Age 65 Years or Older","Introduction Preoperative discussion around postoperative discharge planning have been amplified by the COVID pandemic  We wish to determine if our preoperative frailty screen would predict postoperative LOI  Methods This single-institutional study included demographical, procedural, and outcome data from patients =65 years who underwent frailty screening prior to a surgical procedure  Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frailty Score (EFS)  The Operative Severity Score was used to categorize procedures  The Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk-adjustment score as calculated by CMS was included  LOI was defined as an increase in support outside of the home following discharge  Univariable, multivariable logistic regressions, and adjusted post-estimation analyses for predictive probabilities of best fit were performed  Results 535 patients met inclusion and LOI was seen in 38 (7%) patients  Patients with LOI were older, had a lower BMI, a higher EFS score (7vs 3 0, p&lt;0 001), and a higher HCC score than patients without LOI  Being frail and undergoing a procedure with an OSS = 3 was independently associated with an increased risk of LOI  In addition, social dependency, depression, and limited mobility was associated with an increased risk for LOI  On multivariable modeling, frailty status, undergoing a surgery with an OSS = 3, and having an HCC score = 1 was the most predictive of LOI (OR 12 72, 95% CI: 12 04, 13 44, p&lt;0 001)  In addition, self-reported depression, weight loss, and limited mobility was associated with a nearly 11-fold increase risk in postoperative LOI  Conclusions This study is novel as it identifies clear, generalizable risk factors for LOI  In addition, our findings support the implementation of preoperative assessments to aid in care coordination and provide specific targets for intervention","Owodunni, Oluwafemi P.; Mostales, Joshua C.; Qin, Caroline Xu, Gabre-Kidan, Alodia, Magnuson, Thomas, Gearhart, Susan L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.11.026","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the American College of Surgeons;2020.; Publication details: Journal of the American College of Surgeons;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8757,""

â€œPromoting Treatment Access Following Pediatric Primary Care Depression Screening: Randomized Trial of Web-Based, Single-Session Interventions for Parents and Youthsâ€ We (J  Schleider, M  Dobias, J  Fassler, A  Shroff, S  Pati) have submitted a formal amendment to our recently-accepted Stage One Registered Report at Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (https://doi org/10 1016/j jaac 2020 01 025), â€œPromoting Treatment Access Following Pediatric Primary Care Depression Screening: Randomized Trial of Web-Based, Single-Session Interventions for Parents and Youths â€ The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected ongoing research endeavors, with especially large impacts falling on community-based studies  Our pediatric primary care-based RCT, outlined in this Registered Report, is no exception  The pandemic has substantially altered operations at our study recruitment sites (nine ambulatory pediatric primary care practices affiliated with Stony Brook University, located across Suffolk County, NY)  Due to these uncontrollable changes, it has become necessary to modify our originally-intended recruitment approach in order to achieve our pre-registered sample size  In this letter, we outline the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our original recruitment approach, along with changes we plan to incorporate to ensure its successful completion  Initially, and as written in our present Registered Report, we planned to recruit adolescents (ages 11-16) reporting elevated internalizing distress (per a youth-report Pediatric Symptom Checklist â€œInternalizingâ€ score of =5) from 9 pediatric primary care offices affiliated with Stony Brook University  However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused all of our study recruitment sites to close to children &gt;2 years old for 3 5 months, starting in March 2019â€”just 6 weeks after the trial was launched (we are located in New York, which was the nation's pandemic epicenter at that time, and these office closures were a public health necessity ) Thus, we paused recruitment during this 3 5 month emergency closure period  We recruited 23 families into our trial (of our target N of 246), using our original recruitment criteria, prior to COVID-related office closures  When the 9 pediatric primary care offices re-opened in late June 2020, 3 of these offices were converted to ""COVID-only and/or subspecialist-onlyâ€ centers, and only 6 are now open for general pediatric ""well visits"", which are the type of visit during which the Pediatric Symptom Checklist is routinely administered in Stony Brook-affiliated PC offices in accordance with Bright Futures guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics  Thus, the maximum number of offices we could recruit from, among those specified in our original recruitment strategy, is now sixâ€”not nine  To comply with new safety and social distancing requirements, these 6 offices can operate at a maximum of 75% patient capacity  Recruiting from just six offices operating substantially below-capacity will not allow us to achieve our target sample of N=246 within the time-period allotted by the grant that is funding this studyâ€”even after being granted a 12-month no cost extension (which we have already obtained from the Foundation supporting the project)  Unfortunately, it is impossible for us to predict when (and if) these 6 offices will return to 100% operating capacity, and/or when the remaining 3 offices will re-open to non-COVID patients  In order to increase our trial recruitment rate, while simultaneously ensuring that all youths who might benefit from our interventions receive the opportunity to participate, we now plan to expand our inclusion criteria for the trial  Specifically, we plan to broaden our definition of youths who qualify as â€œhigh-riskâ€ for depression, such that youths meeting one or more of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the trial: 1  Youths aged 11-16 who report a PSC-Y score of =5, reflecting self-reported clinical levations in youth internalizing problems;AND/OR2  Youths aged 11-16 whose parent reports a PSC score of &gt;5, reflecting parent-reported clinical elections in youth internalizing problems;AND/OR3  Youths aged 11-16 who have received or attempted to access treatment for depression in the previous year, given that depression is likely to recur There are at least three advantages to broadening our inclusion criteria in this way  First, our new criteria maximize the odds that youths at-risk for depression will be identified and offered access to trial participation, which includes access to free, evidence-based interventions for adolescents and their parents  That is, if an adolescent does not report their depressive symptoms during their PC visit (e g , due to privacy concerns or worries about the consequences of disclosing distress), youths may still be identified as â€œhigh-riskâ€ should their parent or caregiver identify such symptoms  Likewise, youths who are at substantially elevated risk for major depression due to a recent history of depression (indexed by receipt treatment-seeking or treatment-involvement) may experience symptom reductions following completion of the intervention tested in this trial, per results of a previous test of the same intervention in at-risk youth (where the definition of â€˜at-riskâ€™ included recent receipt of treatment;Schleider & Weisz, 2018)  Second, criteria (2) and (3) will allow us to assess whether, and how, SBU-affiliated PC offices should expand their standard screening for adolescent depression, with the goal of identifying all youths who may benefit from mental health support  Criterion (1) is presently incorporated into the existing pediatric PC mental health screener at SBU-affiliated clinics;however, prior treatment-seeking and parent-reports of adolescent internalizing problems are not routinely assessed in adolescent patients  For the purposes of this trial, Criterion (1) will be assessed via medical record review, whereas Criteria (2) and (3) will be assessed via a follow-up phone call to potentially eligible families  By assessing multiple indices of potential youth depression risk, this study will allow us to quantify how many adolescents who might want or need mental health support (indexed by their interest in participating in this present trial, which evaluates a treatment for youth depression) are being missed by SBU's current screening practices  Third, compared to our original inclusion criteria, our new inclusion criteria are more consistent with those utilized in current and past trials of the interventions tested in this trial [1-2]  This similarity will directly facilitate cross-trial comparison of intervention effects, facilitating a cumulative literature on the programsâ€™ effects in adolescents at-risk for and experiencing depressive symptoms  We propose no changes beyond these expanded recruitment criteria  We plan to use the same measurement battery at all study time-points, the same 1:1 randomization structure, the same approach to consenting prospective families to take part in the study, the same measurement battery at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up, the same target sample size, and the same analytic approach (accounting for the new number of clinics we are able to recruit from in the study)  We appreciate the chance to update our planned approach to ensure our study's feasibility  Likewise, in keeping with the goal of the Registered Report model, we are grateful for the opportunity to maintain full transparency as to precisely when, why, and how we now must alter specific elements of our approach  1  Schleider J, Weisz J  A single-session growth mindset intervention for adolescent anxiety and depression: 9-month outcomes of a randomized trial  J Child Psychol Psychiatry

"P859COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: do they have a specific psychological reaction?","Introduction: After the outbreak of a new coronavirus subtype SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019, a global pandemic developed, generating a health, economic, and social emergency [1]  In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis forced the government to declare a state of emergency on 14 March 2020 and to implement unprecedented lockdown restriction  In this context, patients with severe mental disorders (SMD) may be particularly exposed to stress and social distancing measures [2, 3] and thus disproportionately vulnerable to public health interventions to fight the COVID-19 [4]  However, the early psychological impact of the pandemic and the lockdown in this population is still mostly unknown  Aims of the study: Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) in a sample of people with SMD compared with two control groups: other mental disorders (OMD) and healthy controls (HC)  Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES)  A total of 21,279 people living in Spain answered the questionnaire, and 125 people with SMD were included in the analysis  Subjects in each of the two control groups (OMD, n = 250;HC, n = 250) were matched (ratio 1:2) for sex and age (Â± 1 year) with the SMD group  We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models  Results: People with SMD [mean age = 43 25 years (SD = 14 41);61 6% females] had statistically significantly higher scores on anxiety, stress, and depression subscales of the DASS-21 compared with the HC group, but lower scores than OMD in all domains (p &lt; 0 05)  Most people with SMD (87 2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages  After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (OR = 0 721;95% CI: 0 579 - 0 898)  In the SMD group, the multiple linear regression model (R2 = 0 580, F = 41 027, p &lt; 0 001) found that higher anxiety was associated with being single (<U+1E9E> = 0 144, t = 2 291, p = 0 024), having COVID-19 symptoms (<U+1E9E> = 0 146, t = 2 395, p = 0 018), and a higher score on the stress subscale (<U+1E9E> = 0 538, t = 7 635, p &lt; 0 001);whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (<U+1E9E> = -0 244, t = -3 692, p &lt; 0 001)  Conclusions: Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, suggesting that this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up  No conflict of interest","Santo, F.

"P751 Mood homeostasis before and during the COVID-19 lockdown: a cohort study","Introduction: Lockdowns implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are thought to impact mental health [1,2]  Understanding the mechanisms underlying this impact is critical to mitigating it [3]  We tested the hypothesis that one such mechanism involves impaired mood homeostasis (i e , failure to stabilize mood via mood-modifying activities) [4,5]  Methods: In this ecological momentary assessment cohort study, students in the Netherlands reported their mood and activities 4 times a day between March 16 and 29, 2020  New and immediate lockdown measures were announced on March 23  The average change in mood an individual experienced when engaging in an activity was recorded as its pleasantness  Mood homeostasis was defined as the extent to which participants preferentially engaged in pleasant activities at time t+1 when their mood was low at time t, thus stabilizing their mood  Participants' history of mental illness was screened at baseline  Using linear regressions we assessed (i) changes in mood homeostasis from before to during lockdown, (ii) their moderation by mental illness history, (iii) their association with changes in mood level, and (iv) their mediation by changes in range of activities undertaken  How changes in mood homeostasis might impact the risk of depression was estimated using computer simulations  Statistical significance was set at 2-sided P&lt; 05  Results: Seventy-eight students were included  Mood homeostasis was significantly higher before than during lockdown (0 37 vs 0 28;95% CI of the difference [0 03,0 15];P= 003)  For every 0 1 point drop in mood homeostasis, average mood decreased by 1 9 points (95% CI, [1 3,3 6], P&lt; 001)  This is enough to bring someone's average mood from the population's mean to its bottom quartile  The change in mood homeostasis from before to during lockdown was mediated by a reduction in the range of activities (proportion mediated: 11 9%, P&lt; 001)  Mood homeostasis dropped significantly more among people with (vs without) a history of mental illness (P&lt; 001): from similar values before lockdown (0 31 vs 0 36;P= 37) to significantly different values during lockdown (0 13 vs 0 35;95% CI of the difference [0 11,0 33];P&lt; 001)  In computer simulations, changes in mood homeostasis attributed to the lockdown led to a 3-fold increase in the the yearly incidence of depressed mood episodes: from 9 0% (95% CI [6 6%,11 4%]) before lockdown to 28 2% (95% CI [23 6%,32 6%]) during lockdown  Conclusions: Mood homeostasis appears to decrease during lockdown  Larger decreases correlate with larger decreases in mood level  The impact was larger for students with a history of mental illness  The lack of a control group (as the lockdown was implemented nationally) is the main limitation of our study  However, since the same participants were monitored before and during lockdown, the lockdown itself seems to be the most likely explanation for the observed difference  Identifying interventions that increase mood homeostasis might be a promising avenue to mitigate the impact of lockdowns on mental health Table 1  No conflict of interest","Taquet, M.; Quoidbach, J.; Fried, E.

"P737 Risk factors for depression vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the Oxford COSIE (COVID-19, Social Isolation and Emotion) Study","Introduction: The mental health consequences of COVID-19 will be significant  Restrictions to our everyday lives as a result of the pandemic mean that many people have experienced a constellation of psychosocial factors associated with increased risk of mental ill-health  Given that many people continue to face an extended period of physical distancing and social isolation, we urgently need to identify factors associated with mental health vulnerability or resilience within the current context  Developing such a mechanistic understanding is critical to the identification of targets for intervention [1]  The use of neurocognitive emotional processing tasks can provide objective markers of depression vulnerability  Our previous work suggests that negative bias, as measured by these tasks, precedes and predicts subsequent depression and remediation of negative bias is an early marker of treatment response [2]  In this large online study, we used measures of negative bias in order to identify those most at risk, as well as identify protective factors, within this high stress context  Method In April 2020, we recruited a diverse UK sample (n=2039, aged 18+) to an online longitudinal study assessing numerous risk/protective factors, self-reported depressive symptoms (CESD;Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), and performance on a neurocognitive emotional test battery  This included a Facial Expression Recognition Task (FERT), in which participants must identify the expression of ambiguous positive or negative faces  Four weeks later, participants repeated these questionnaires and tasks in a follow-up session (94% retention of original sample)  Data were analysed using multiple linear regression analyses (controlling for gender, age, household income and race/ethnicity) in R, with t values reported for individual predictors within the model  Results: At baseline, we identified risk factors independently associated with higher levels of self-reported depressive symptom cross-sectionally â€“ these included loneliness (t=34 888, p&lt; 0 0001), shielding (extreme form of social distancing) (t = 2 288, p = 0 022), and high vulnerability to COVID-19 (t=2 141, p=0 032)  We confirmed that a diagnosis of depression is significantly associated with negative bias during the FERT (t=2 286, p =0 02);moreover, controlling for a diagnosis of depression, we identified protective factors associated with reduced negative bias including statin use (t= -2 415, p= 0 015) and high levels of behavioural activation (t=-2 607, p= 0 009)  Finally, we identified baseline risk factors independently predictive of self-reported depressive symptoms at follow-up, in people without a diagnosis of depression at baseline, including negative bias (t= 3 002, p= 0 0027), loneliness (t= 25 694, p&lt; 0 0001) and lack of access to out-door space (t=3 113, p= 0 0019)  Conclusions: This study highlights core factors that are associated with increased vulnerability to depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as loneliness and restricted access to outside space  In addition, we identified factors with a protective effect, including statin use and high levels of behavioural activation  Importantly, by measuring depression vulnerability using an objective biomarker - negative bias during a facial expression recognition task â€“ we circumvented many of the limitations of self report measures and were able to investigate the manifestation of vulnerability across time and how this can be mitigated by lifestyle and medication  No conflict of interest","Gillespie, A.; Carson, J.; Van Assche, I.; Murphy, S.; Harmer, C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.09.542","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: European Neuropsychopharmacology;40:S417-S418, 2020.; Publication details: European Neuropsychopharmacology;40:S417-S418, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8770,""

"P660 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in a community-based population in Portugal: a case-control observational study","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis, affecting several nations, including Portugal  Such widespread outbreaks are associated with a significant mental health impact  Isolation, uncertainty, and fear of contagion are some of the factors responsible for this outcome  Aim: To survey the general public to better understand the level of psychological impact during the initial stage of COVID-19 outbreak  Methods: From 11th March to 11th May 2020 we conducted a telephonic survey on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n= 120) and compared them with a contemporaneous control group (n=120) not diagnosed with COVID-19  These data were collected from a community-based population in the centre region of Portugal, using convenience sampling techniques  Using a structured interview, we collected quantitative and qualitative information on demographic data, symptoms, psychological and social impact  Psychological impact was also assessed using Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Quality of life scale (QOLS)  Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26 0 Software  Descriptive statistics and the appropriate parametric and non-parametric methods were used  Summary: More than a half of the patients surveyed were in the age group between 31 and 50 years, with 79% being of female gender  None of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 needed treatment in hospital facilities and all of them spent 20-24h at home during the period surveyed  The COVID-19 group showed a significant increase in the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared with the control group  Most of the patients in the COVID-19 group reported feeling emotionally and physically exhausted (71%), fear of being infected (44,9%) and of infecting their family members (68,5%) during the period surveyed  The impact of the quarantine, routine modification, social isolation and the stigma surrounding the COVID-19 infection were reported as contributing factors to this psychological impact  More than a half of patients in the COVID-19 group showed high levels of â€œmoderate to severe depressionâ€ in the BDI-II, with significant differences regarding the control group  The BSI evidenced a higher level of symptoms reported when compared with the control group, namely anxiety, irritability, insomnia and tiredness  An overall reduction in the quality of life was perceived in the COVID-19 group  Conclusions: During the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal, more than a half of the responders in the COVID-19 group reported high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms  The emotional impact is associated with factors such as social isolation, uncertainty, lack of information, fear of infecting relatives and stigma  These data reveal a major mental health impact during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak  All the patients surveyed will be evaluated in a posterior follow-up  We're hopeful that these data can promote a shift to a greater concern with mental health in the future  No conflict of interest","Santos, G.; Jesus, M.; Silva, T.; Matos, J.; Miranda, I.; Fernandes, V.; Murta, F.; Almeida, G.; Murta, I.; Andrade, A.; Firmino, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.09.484","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: European Neuropsychopharmacology;40:S373-S374, 2020.; Publication details: European Neuropsychopharmacology;40:S373-S374, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8774,""
"P347 Role of HDAC5 and SIRT2 in depression and clinical efficacy of antidepressants","Background: Epigenetic mechanisms can play a key role in the pathogenesis of depression and its treatment  Specifically, changes in histone acetylation mediated by HDAC5 and SIRT2 can regulate the transcription of genes related to different functions such as brain plasticity [1]  Previous studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [2] and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in patients and murine models show that depressive phenotype is associated with an increase of HDAC5 and SIRT2  On the other hand, Sirt2 and Hdac5 RNAm are decreased by chronic antidepressant treatment [3]  Moreover, drugs that work by inducing an increase in norepinephrine in the synapse, are able to phosphorylate HDAC5 causing a migration from nucleus to cytoplasm and therefore, the enzyme would lose its deacetylase function [3,4,5]  Objectives: To evaluate if HDAC5 and SIRT2 in PBMCs could be peripheral markers for depressive state or antidepressant treatment  More specifically, we would like to discover if major depression illness has a determinant effect in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of HDAC5 and SIRT2, and also if these features can influence in the phosphorylation capacity of HDAC5 by duloxetine and some adrenergic and serotonergic agonists  Sex and age factors will be also studied  At transcriptional level, we would like to know how depressive state and antidepressant therapy could regulate the expression of genes that are related to HDAC5 and SIRT2 function, as those related to neuroplasticity, angiogenesis and inflammation (Bdnf, Vegf, eNOS, KLF-2, FOXP3, CTLA-3, PD-1)  Sex and age factors will be also studied  Methods: Depressive patients (Montgomery-Asberg&gt;=20) and healthy volunteers (MAsberg&lt;7) were recruited by psychiatrists from different hospitals and health care centres  20 ml of blood were extracted in order to obtain PBMCs (classic, intermediate and non-classic monocytes and T-cells) using Ficoll-paque followed by FACs  Isolated cells were used for culture and immunofluorescence and for RNAm extraction for PCR  Nucleocytoplasmic distribution of SIRT2 and HDAC5 was measured by confocal microscopy, and a ratio of mean intensities between cytoplasm and nucleus was calculated  However, the effect of in vitro treatments were analysed by fluorescence microscopy, looking at the intensity of HDAC5 phosphorylation  Results: Depressed patients showed a lower ratio (cytoplasm/nucleus) for SIRT2 in classic and intermediate monocytes as well as in T-cells, compared to healthy volunteers  In addition, looking at the HDAC5 phosphorylation in monocytes and T-cell cultures induced by the antidepressant duloxetine in vitro, it was observed that depressed patients showed a lower response compared to healthy volunteers  Regarding age and sex factors, female healthy volunteers between 40 and 50 years old showed a lower ratio (cytoplasm/nucleus) for HDAC5 compared to the young, between 20 and 30 years old, and old (between 65 and 80 years old) healthy volunteers  Gene expression studies are on course and hopefully they will be finished after Covid19 crisis and before the congress  Conclusion  It seems that HDAC5 and SIRT2 in monocytes and T-cells could be suitable peripheral biomarkers for depressive state or for evaluating treatment efficacy  These results might also suggest that age and sex are determinant factors  No conflict of interest","CortÃ©s, M.; FernÃ¡ndez, R.; Cuesta, M.; Aldaz, P.; OrtuÃ±o, F.; AubÃ¡, E.; LÃ³pez, J.; Barrado, L.; Tordera, R.

"Anxiety level and clinical course of patients with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 outbreak","Objectives: Besides infectious pneumonia and death risks, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted negative psychological impacts on communities, especially on people with chronic diseases  We aimed to evaluate COVID-19- and sickle cell disease (SCD)-related experiences, and the clinical course during the outbreak, to measure anxiety levels of adolescent and young adult patients with homozygous SCD, to analyze the correlations between their COVID-19 experiences and anxiety levels and painful episodes  Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 47 patients aged between 14 and 24 years responded to a descriptive instrument and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  Clinical features requiring hospitalization for the same period (between March 10 and May 10) of two sequential years were compared  Results: Sixty-six percent of the patients had at least one negative COVID-19 experience of dizziness, sleep disturbance, tonic immobility, appetite loss or nausea/abdominal distress  The number of negative COVID-19 experiences was correlated with the state anxiety score, the trait anxiety score, and the number of painful episodes (<U+03C1>=0 552, p&lt;0 001;<U+03C1>=0 529, p&lt;0 001;<U+03C1>=0 448, p=0 002, respectively)  Both median state anxiety and trait anxiety scores were below the cut-off scores, indicating significant clinical symptoms  The number of hospitalizations requiring vaso-occlusive crisis management and blood/exchange transfusion were similar for the same period of two sequential years, 2019 and 2020  Conclusion: These descriptive and correlation findings are the first reported on COVID-19-related anxiety in SCD patients  To develop screening and support strategies for mental health needs in pandemic times, further SCD studies should be conducted","Tezol, O.; Unal, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2020.12.004","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Archives de PÃ©diatrie;2020.; Publication details: Archives de PÃ©diatrie;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8786,""

"Impact of Unreliable Content on Social Media Users during COVID-19 and Stance Detection System","The abundant dissemination of misinformation regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents another unprecedented issue to the world, along with the health crisis  Online social network (OSN) platforms intensify this problem by allowing their users to easily distort and fabricate the information and disseminate it farther and rapidly  In this paper, we study the impact of misinformation associated with a religious inflection on the psychology and behavior of the OSN users  The article presents a detailed study to understand the reaction of social media users when exposed to unverified content related to the Islamic community during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India  The analysis was carried out on Twitter users where the data were collected using three scraping packages, Tweepy, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup, to cover more users affected by this misinformation  A labeled dataset is prepared where each tweet is assigned one of the four reaction polarities, namely, E (endorse), D (deny), Q (question), and N (neutral)  Analysis of collected data was carried out in five phases where we investigate the engagement of E, D, Q, and N users, tone of the tweets, and the consequence upon repeated exposure of such information  The evidence demonstrates that the circulation of such content during the pandemic and lockdown phase had made people more vulnerable in perceiving the unreliable tweets as fact  It was also observed that people absorbed the negativity of the online content, which induced a feeling of hatred, anger, distress, and fear among them  People with similar mindset form online groups and express their negative attitude to other groups based on their opinions, indicating the strong signals of social unrest and public tensions in society  The paper also presents a deep learning-based stance detection model as one of the automated mechanisms for tracking the news on Twitter as being potentially false  Stance classifier aims to predict the attitude of a tweet towards a news headline and thereby assists in determining the veracity of news by monitoring the distribution of different reactions of the users towards it  The proposed model, employing deep learning (convolutional neural network(CNN)) and sentence embedding (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers(BERT)) techniques, outperforms the existing systems  The performance is evaluated on the benchmark SemEval stance dataset  Furthermore, a newly annotated dataset is prepared and released with this study to help the research of this domain","Wani, Mudasir Ahmad, Agarwal, Nancy, Bours, Patrick","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Unreliable+Content+on+Social+Media+Users+during+COVID-19+and+Stance+Detection+System","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Electronics;10(1):5, 2021.; Publication details: Electronics;10(1):5, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8796,""

"Kidney involvement and outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted from a federal medical facility","Background: Correctional facilities face unique challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic  A COVID-19 outbreak was reported in the Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Lexington, Kentucky, a prison for inmates requiring medical and/or mental health care  We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and kidney related outcomes in inmates from this FMC to other COVID-19 hospitalized patients  Methods: A total of 86 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our hospital between March 1st and June 1st, 2020  Among those, 37 patients were from the same FMC  We examined demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics, along with the outcomes of this cohort and compared it to other COVID-19 non-prisoners  AKI was determined by KDIGO criteria  Results: All inmates were men and their mean age was 59 8Â±10 6 years  The majority of them were white (60%) and required ICU admission (54%), while 39% of patients required mechanical ventilation  The prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (81%), obesity (62%), diabetes (41%) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (38%)  Stage 3 CKD was present in 22% of inmates  The mean eGFR was 68Â±26 ml/min/1 73m2 at time of admission  Significant hematuria and proteinuria were found in 17% and 25% of patients, respectively  Hypertension, heart failure, CAD, COPD, hepatitis C infection, and AKI were more prevalent in the FMC cohort (P= 0 030, 0 001, 0 024, 0 001, 0 017, and 0 011, respectively)  The difference in mortality rates was not statistically significant between groups (12% for inmates vs 17% for non-inmates, p=0 520)  Incident AKI was higher in inmates vs  non-inmates (68% vs  38%, p=0 006) and there was no difference in acute dialysis need (14% vs 12%, respectively)  The overall mortality rates were higher in patients that required dialysis (80% vs  6% for those who did not, p&lt;0 001)  The need for acute dialysis was independently associated with mortality in multivariable models  Conclusions: Incidence of AKI was higher in hospitalized inmates with COVID-19 vs  non-inmates  The need for acute dialysis was strongly associated with mortality in overall COVID-19 hospitalized patients","Ahmad, Y.

"Impact of a Single School-Based Intervention for COVID-19 on Improving Mental Health","An underlying concern about the COVID-19 pandemic is that the mental health of children will decline. The present study aimed to investigate whether a single school-based intervention, including self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19, effectively achieved its aim to promote childrenâ€™s mental health. The study was conducted in a junior high school. We assigned the third grade as the intervention group, second grade as the announcement group, and first grade, the control group. We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience improved mental health and reduced fear of COVID-19, when compared to the announcement and control groups. Interaction effects were observed only for depression, indicating a significant intervention effect in the intervention group. These findings suggest that a single school-based intervention that includes self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19 can help to improve childrenâ€™s mental health. It is suggested that school-based interventions that intend to raise children's awareness of COVID-19 promote healthy development and adaptation within the school.","Takahiro Kubo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-657-288","20201231","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-31","",8825,""
