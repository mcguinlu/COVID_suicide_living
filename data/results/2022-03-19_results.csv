"Characteristics of mental health stability during COVID-19: An online survey with people residing in the Liverpool City Region","Background and aim : Despite the significant mental health challenges the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated government measures have presented, research have shown that the majority of people have adapted and coped well. The aim of this study was i) to determine the proportion of people with mental stability and volatility during the pandemic in a North West urban environment sample and ii) to establish group differences in psychosocial variables. Mental stability and volatility refer to the extent to which individuals reported change in levels of common mental health symptoms over the course of 12 weeks. Method : a two-wave-online survey (N = 163) was used to explore the psychological and social impact of the pandemic on relatively disadvantaged neighbourhoods within the Liverpool City Region over 12 weeks. Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc tests were used to determine how people with mental stability and volatility differed on factors categorised within an ecological framework of resilience (individual, community, societal, and COVID-19 specific). Results : Individuals categorised as  stable in terms of mental health symptoms (63.6%) had better mental and physical health; were more tolerant of uncertainty; reported higher levels of resilience and wellbeing compared to  very volatile people (19.8%). These individuals also reported feeling less socially isolated, experienced a greater sense of belonging to their community which was more likely to fulfil their needs, and were more likely to have access to green space nearby for their recommended daily exercise.  Stable individuals did not report worrying any more during the pandemic than usual and tolerated uncertainty better compared to those in the  volatile group. Implications : The majority of participants in this sample were mentally stable and coping well with the challenges presented by the pandemic. The resilience of these individuals was related to key place-based factors such as a strong sense of community and useable local assets. The data showcase the role of place-based social determinants in supporting resilience and thereby highlight key preventative measures for public mental health during times of international crisis.","Katalin Ujhelyi Gomez; Rhiannon Corcoran; Adele Ring; Shaima Hassan; Katherine Abba; Jennifer Downing; Mark Goodall; Mark Gabbay; Pam Clarke; Paul Moran; Dorcas  Akeju Obe; Kate  M Bennett","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.17.22272479","20220318","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28652,""
"Pride and adversity among nurses and physicians during the pandemic in two US healthcare systems: a mixed methods analysis","Our aims were to examine themes of the most difficult or distressing events reported by healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two US health care systems in order to identify common themes and to relate them to both behavioral theory and measures of anxiety and depression. We conducted a cross-sectional survey during the early phases of the COIVD-19 pandemic in the US. We measured symptoms of anxiety and depression separately, captured demographics, and asked two open-ended questions regarding events that were the most difficult or stressful, and reinforced pride. The open-end questions were independently coded into themes developed by the authors and mapped to factors related to fostering well-being according to the Self-Determination Theory. We recruited 874 nurses and 248 physicians. About a half shared their most distressing experiences as well as those experiences they were most proud of related to their professions. Themes that emerged from these narratives were congruent with prediction of Self-Determination theory that autonomy-supportive experiences will foster pride, while autonomy-thwarting experiences will cause distress. Those who reported distressful events were more anxious and depressed compared to those who did not. Among those who reported incidences that reinforced pride in the profession, depression was rarer compared to those who did not. These trends were evident after allowing for medical history and other covariates in logistic regressions. Causal claims from our analysis should be made with caution due to the research design, a cross-sectional study design. Understanding of perceptions of the pandemic by nurses and physicians may help identify sources of distress and means of reinforcing pride in the professions, thereby helping nurses and physicians cope with disasters, and shape workplace policies during disasters that foster well-being among first responders. No Patient or Public Contribution: We studied physicians and nurses themselves.","Igor Burstyn; Karyn Holt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.16.22272485","20220318","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28653,""
"Analysis of tweets regarding psychological disorders before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Turkey","This study aimed to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Turkish society in relation to obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorder, and depression via content mining of tweets. Tweets were obtained by searching selected keywords via Twitter application programming interface in Python. The tweets were then filtered for psychopathology-related keywords. The sample consisted of 65,031 publicly available tweets that cover the period between 2 December 2019 and 31 May 2021. Latent Dirichlet allocation, was performed to uncover the latent semantic structures in the tweets. Data transformation and analysis were performed by using open-source R (version 4.0.2). As a result of the analysis, there were statistically significant differences in the total number of tweets, mean number of comments, likes, and retweets per tweet between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. From the topic modeling, it was also found that semantic strings of the tweets differed in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period. Topic analysis of social media shares can provide information on the mental health conditions of individuals and the use of tweet content can contribute to the research of psychopathologies, especially during the pandemic.","Tankut, U.; Esen, M.

"The Perfect Storm? COVID-19 and Substance Use amongst Social Work Students in the USA","This study examined the associations between substance use and socio-demographic characteristics, mental health and preventive behaviours amongst US undergraduate and graduate social work students. Data were collected via an online survey from 457 social work students studying in various programmes, between July and August 2020. The survey was designed to elicit information on students' use of alcohol, cigarettes, vaping products and marijuana over the previous thirty days. Patterns of substance use and the associated behaviours were assessed using univariate and bivariate analyses. The outcomes revealed that a significant number of the students drank alcohol (71 per cent), engaged in binge drinking (35 per cent) and used marijuana (25 per cent). The outcomes also revealed significant associations amongst socio-demographic characteristics, substance use and mental health. This study's findings could inform the development of social work programmes that assist students in adopting positive coping strategies and mitigating health risk behaviours, both during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health risk behaviours related to substance use have been recognised as a significant public health concern amongst university students. Understanding the mechanisms of substance use behaviours, including those used to cope with COVID-19-related stressors, is imperative to curate targeted prevention efforts. To that end, we examined substance use prevalence and its associations with socio-demographic characteristics, preventive behaviours, and mental health amongst US social work students. We collected data from 457 students across all degree levels (BSW, MSW and PhD) from July to August 2020 through an online survey, to examine thirty-day patterns of substance use behaviours related to cigarettes, electronic vapour products, alcohol, binge drinking and marijuana. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed high rates of substance use behaviours, particularly alcohol use (71 per cent), binge drinking (35 per cent) and marijuana use (25 per cent). Findings also revealed significant associations amongst substance use, socio-demographic characteristics, and mental health. Amongst other implications, our study should encourage social work programmes to promote positive coping strategies amongst students and foster substance abuse prevention efforts, both to mitigate health risk behaviours and to enhance student well-being, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Y.

"Therapeutic landscapes during the COVID-19 pandemic: increased and intensified interactions with nature","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a drastic impact on the course of everyday life for much of the worldâ€™s population and many people have experienced an unprecedented increase in anxiety and depression while their access to a range of coping mechanisms has been reduced. For those privileged enough to have nearby and safe access to natural environments, green and blue spaces have become an important enabler of everyday wellbeing. In this paper we explore the role of everyday interactions with nature for the maintenance of wellbeing, during the first and second â€˜waveâ€™ of infections in the Netherlands. Based on qualitative interviews with 30 participants in spring/summer and autumn of 2020, we detail how relationships with nature in the local surroundings and in the home qualitatively and effectively changed in response to COVID-19 induced confinement, resulting in the becoming-therapeutic of everyday micro-geographies. Amongst our participants, the conditions of semi-lockdown gave rise to increased interactions with nature, both in their outdoor surroundings and in the home. These increased interactions also led to intensified emotional and sensory experiences with nature and a greater sense of familiarity with their surroundings, which strengthened place-attachments and contributed to an increased sense of wellbeing.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on health science students well-being in Lithuania: is there a difference according to gender","Background Methods Results Conclusion COVID-19 has spread globally, with 110,974,862 confirmed cases and 2,460,792 deaths worldwide. Many studies have demonstrated the impact of infectious disease outbreaks on psychological problems. It seems indispensable to understand the effects of pandemic situation especially in students population. We conducted this study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on health science students well-being.Students from two major health science universities of Lithuania were asked to fill out a form consisting of 19 questions aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and students emotional feelings (stress, anxiety, depression) related to this effect. Independent sample t-test was performed to evaluate the difference of means of scores between males and females.Total of 1545 students filled out the form, of which 84.9% (n = 1311) were female. Females experienced greater negative effect of pandemic situation on their family relationships (t = 2.16, p = 0.03), education process (t = 2.33, p = 0.02) and belief in future (t = 4.49, p &lt; 0.001). Female students also experienced more negative emotional feelings associated with stress, anxiety and depression on friendships (t = 2.92, p = 0.004), family relationship (t = 3.7, p &lt; 0.001), their health (t = 3.97, p &lt; 0.001), education process (t = 3.98, p &lt; 0.001) and belief in future (t = 5.7, p &lt; 0.001).Female health science students, differently than males, experience greater negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown and more negative emotional feelings, such as stress, anxiety and depression, related to it and their well-being.

"Eliciting emotional expressions in psychodynamic psychotherapies using telehealth: A clinical review and single case study using emotional awareness and expression therapy","The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social distancing requirements resulted in an abrupt transition in the provision of most mental healthcare to telehealth;yet it was, at first, unclear whether patients' emotional expressions - of great import to the success of many psychodynamic therapies - could be facilitated using teletherapy. This article first presents a targeted literature review focused on emotional expressions in psychotherapy and implementing psychodynamic therapy over telehealth and then describes our clinical experience transitioning a psychodynamically-informed, evidence-based, and experiential group treatment for chronic pain, emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET), to video telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. We discuss barriers we encountered in our implementation of EAET over video telehealth but also illustrate the ultimate success of the approach using verbatim excerpts from our therapeutic work, which aim to demonstrate the potential to facilitate powerful emotional expressions over video telehealth when conducting a psychodynamically-informed treatment. We examine the possible applications for video telehealth to maintain emotionally focused, psychodynamic psychotherapy administration and enhance its teaching and training. Although we describe limitations of our specific approach, ultimately, our experience supports the potential efficacy of experiential, emotion-focused psychodynamic therapies in a telehealth setting.

"Telemedicine and mental health care of young adults during COVID-19: A qualitative study","To examine barriers and facilitators to mental health care and use of telemedicine for university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key informant interviews of mental health clinicians in 1 university addressed the impact of COVID-19 on students' mental health, adoption of telemedicine, and general mental health care. Theoretical thematic analysis identified positive and negative effects on care. Interviews with 6 psychologists and 4 psychiatrists (50% of invitees;3 men and 7 women) highlighted social isolation and lifestyle restrictions as primary contributors to prevalent mood disorders. Telemedicine offered accessibility, safety, and efficiency but limitations included: technical problems;patient distraction;lack of confidentiality;compromised therapeutic alliance;and management of unstable patients. Lower-income students were described as commonly lacking peer support and an appropriate setting for telemedicine visits. Mental health clinicians described university students as commonly affected by mental health disorders. Telemedicine offered safer, accessible care but, for mental health care, was limited by lack of confidentiality, patient distraction, and care for unstable patients. Lower income patients were especially challenged by less peer support and privacy for telemedicine.

"Relationships between attitudes toward dreams, typical dreams, and emotions among chinese college students","This study aimed to investigate the attitudes, themes, and negative emotions associated with dreams in 1,242 Chinese college students (74.4% female, 25.6% male;aged 18-30 years, Mage = 19.29, SDage = 1.38) in the postpandemic period. Data were obtained using an online questionnaire survey. The results indicated that the attitude of Chinese college students toward dreams in the postepidemic period was generally positive, the number of dream memories increased, and many dreams focused on a relatively rare theme of ""having magical powers,"" which was prevalent in students who were also experiencing negative emotions. Students reported depression, anxiety, and stress more frequently after the pandemic than before and during the pandemic, and depression was found to be negatively related to dream attitudes. The findings of this study shed light on the typical dreams, emotions, and dream attitudes of Chinese college students during the postepidemic period. The study results will allow other researchers to further conduct such studies and use the epidemic as the node to understand research on the dreams of Chinese college students, and the changes in their dreams before, during, and post the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Effects of parenthood and gender on well-being and work productivity among Canadian academic research faculty amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about enormous changes to all aspects of academic life. In spring 2020, we recruited faculty from Canadian universities who were asked to complete a survey about the perceived impact of the pandemic on aspects of their well-being and work productivity. Eight hundred ninety-nine academics from across Canada responded, reporting that the pandemic had had a significant negative impact on their mental health, work satisfaction, first-author publications, grants, and data collection. Overall weekly work hours dropped by 22% compared to prepandemic levels, from 45 hr/week to 35 hr. Though parents of children under the age of 13 managed to maintain an average of 30 hr/week despite juggling childcare and work duties, they nonetheless fared worse compared to nonparents and parents of older children on nearly all indicators of work productivity and well-being. Furthermore, mothers of young children reported having fewer uninterrupted work hours and spending more time as primary caregiver compared to fathers. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable negative impact on the self-reported well-being and work productivity of Canadian academics, and even more so among parents of young children. Mothers of young children may be particularly in need of additional support. These findings highlight the importance of adopting policies at the federal and institutional levels aimed at ""leveling the playing field"" for these groups as well as instituting creative childcare solutions that maintain health and safety while not further disadvantaging young parents.

"The corona pandemic and its implications for the mental health and mental healthcare of older adults","For nearly 2 years now, the COVID-19 pandemic has kept the world in suspense. If anyone believed we were near the end of the pandemic when the vaccination rollout gained momentum, these hopes vanished as new virus variants and waves of infections surged - and continue to impact the lives of people around the globe today. While at the beginning of the pandemic the greatest effort was focused on implementing sanitary measures to contain the virus, it very soon became clear that the pandemic situation and the social or physical distancing measures adopted to thwart it can also have pronounced negative effects on the subjective well-being and mental health of individuals. The lives of older adults were particularly impacted by the pandemic. Age is one of the strongest risk factors for severe health outcomes of infection, and among older people mortality was particularly high. This special issue brings together experts from two continents who focus on different aspects of the pandemic concerning older people, both empirically by drawing theoretical implications from own data collected early in the pandemic and even before the pandemic as well as by reviewing available research. Overall, these contributions provide a snapshot of different contexts and areas where the pandemic has impacted the mental health and healthcare of older adults.

"Sociodemographic and psychological correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in the young adult population in Italy","Background Previous research has shown that young adults are more hesitant/resistant to COVID-19 vaccine uptake than older age groups, although the factors underlying this tendency are still under debate. The current study aimed to identify the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among young adults (18â€“40Â years) during the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy, the first country after China being hit by the pandemic and which suffered a large number of fatalities. Methods This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted in Italy using an ISO-certified international survey company (respondi.com). Data were collected on 1200 participants in June 2021. Results Vaccine hesitancy/resistance was found for 25% of the sample. In multinomial logistic regression (NÂ =Â 1159), being aged 30â€“40Â years, residing in northern Italy, having lower educational and income level, being unemployed, and not knowing any friends/relatives diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of hesitancy or resistance. In multivariate analysis of variance (NÂ =Â 1177), both vaccine hesitant and resistant young adults perceived significantly less social support from friends and family than vaccine accepting ones. Resistant individuals reported significantly higher levels of conspiracy theories and negative attitudes toward vaccines than their accepting and hesitant counterparts. Moreover, resistant individuals reported significantly lower levels of attachment to country and perceptions of a just government compared to accepting ones, with hesitant young adults scoring in between. Conclusions Our findings support the idea that young adults with a hesitant (vs. resistant) attitude show a more nuanced and less extreme psychological profile. Public health messaging should capitalize on social media to provide accessible, transparent, and age-appropriate information concerning COVID-19 vaccine safety. Moreover, policy efforts improving the availability of social support systems are warranted to strengthen connectedness and foster trust in institutions amongst this particular segment of the population.","Moscardino, Ughetta, Musso, Pasquale, Inguglia, Cristiano, Ceccon, Chiara, Miconi, Diana, Rousseau, CÃ©cile","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.03.018","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28664,""
"Association between total cell free DNA and SARS-CoV-2 in Kidney Transplant Patients: A Preliminary Study","Background : Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are at high-risk for developing severe COVID-19. Lowering immunosuppression levels in KT recipients with COVID-19 encourages native immune responses but can raise the risk of rejection. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), reported as a fraction of total cfDNA, is a proven biomarker for KT rejection. Total cfDNA levels are elevated in COVID-19 patients, which may depress dd-cfDNA fractions, potentially leading to missed rejections. Methods : A retrospective analysis of 29 KT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 between April and November 2020 examined total and dd-cfDNA levels. Blood samples were collected following onset of COVID-19, with follow-up samples collected from a subset of patients, when infection had likely subsided. Results : Following COVID-19 diagnosis, the median total cfDNA level was elevated [7.9 multiples of median (MoM)]. A significant decrease in total cfDNA levels was observed between the first and second time-points (6.2 MoM, 1.0 MoM;p=0.0009). A significant positive association was identified between total cfDNA levels and COVID-19 severity (p=0.02;R2=0.19). Two patients with biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection had dd-cfDNA fractions below the 1% cut-off for rejection (0.20% and 0.78%), with elevated total cfDNA levels of 7.9 MoM and 41.8 MoM, respectively. Conclusion : In this preliminary study,total cfDNA levels were elevated in KT patients with COVID-19, subsiding after resolution of infection. High total cfDNA levels may confound dd-cfDNA results, leading to failure to identify rejection. Considering total cfDNA levels is important in interpretation of dd-cfDNA tests for assessment of rejection in KT patients with COVID-19 or other infection.","Jr, Jose Otto Reusing, Yoo, Jongwon, Desai, Amishi, Brossart, Katya, McCormick, Sarah, Malashevich, Allyson Koyen, Bloom, Michelle S.; Fehringer, Gordon, White, Roseann, Billings, Paul R.; Tabriziani, Hossein, Demko, Zachary P.; Gauthier, Philippe, Akkina, Sanjeev K.; David-Neto, Elias","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2022.02.027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Transplantation Proceedings;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28665,""
"Cognitive underpinnings of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy","Rationale. Vaccines save lives. Despite the undisputed value of vaccination, vaccine hesitancy continues to be a major global challenge particularly throughout the COVID-19 global pandemic. Since vaccination decisions are counter-intuitive and cognitively demanding, we propose that vaccine hesitancy is associated with executive functionâ€”a group of high-level cognitive skills including attentional control, working memory, inhibition, self-regulation, cognitive flexibility, and strategic planning. Objective We set out to test (i) whether vaccine hesitancy is driven by individual differences in executive function beyond established socio-demographic factors (e.g., education, political orientation, gender, ethnicity, age, religiosity) and depressed mood, and (ii) whether this relationship is exacerbated by situational stress. Methods Two studies were conducted with U.S. residents. Using a cross-sectional design, Study 1 examined the associations between executive function, socio-demographic factors, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, trust in health authorities, and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Using an experimental design, Study 2 focused solely on unvaccinated individuals and tested the interactive effect of executive function and stress on willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We used ordinal logistic regressions to analyze the data. Results Individual differences in executive function predicted participantsâ€™ COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, trust in health authorities, and their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Importantly, the unique contribution of executive function to vaccine hesitancy could not be explained by socio-demographic factors or depressed mood. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that weaker executive function had detrimental effects on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and trust in health authorities mainly under heightened stress. Conclusions Individual differences in executive function and situational stress jointly impact COVID-19 vaccination decisions and need to be considered together when designing health communications aimed at reducing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Interventions that lower stress and promote trust have the potential to increase vaccine acceptance, especially for individuals with weaker executive functions.","Acar-Burkay, Sinem, Cristian, Daniela-Carmen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114911","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114911, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28666,""

"Utilization of the Youth Quitline as an opportunity for an undergraduate nursing students to deliver smoking cessation counseling as their clinical placement: An implementation of a service-learning model","Background Smoking is an important modifiable risk factor of morbidities and mortality. Although healthcare professionals play an important role in smoking cessation, their adoption of such practices is relatively low because of inadequate training. To address this issue, we incorporated a service-learning model to operate the Youth Quitline. Undergraduate nursing students were trained and received supervision while delivering smoking cessation counseling through the Youth Quitline as their clinical placement. Objectives We evaluated the effectiveness of the placement by assessing students' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding smoking cessation and tobacco control. Design One-group pretest-posttest design. Setting Youth Quitline. Participants A total of 61 third-year students in a mental health nursing program. Methods Students were required to complete 80Â h at the Youth Quitline. The 80Â h were divided into 20 sessions;students used four sessions to approach and recruit youth smokers in the community, then provided them with telephone counseling for the rest of the time. Prior to the placement, students attended a 2-day workshop. The outcomes were changes in students' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding smoking cessation and tobacco control 3Â months after the placement compared with baseline. Results From Januaryâ€“June 2021, students conducted 105 outreach activities to identify 3142 smokers in the community, and provided telephone counseling for 336 smokers via Youth Quitline. Compared with baseline, significant improvements were observed in students' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding smoking cessation and tobacco control at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions The clinical placement improved students' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding smoking cessation and tobacco control, enhancing their competency in providing support to assist smokers to quit in their future practice. Incorporating the service-learning model in existing community-based services can provide additional venues for nursing students to practice. This is particularly important because many venues have restricted access during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ho, K. Y.; Lam, Katherine K. W.; Wu, C. S. T.; Leung, D. Y. P.; Yeung, W. F.; Hung, T.

"Death in the time of COVID: A multifaceted challenge","The COVID pandemic brought forth a variety of unprecedented challenges, including palliative, hospice, and end-of-life planning. During the pandemic, patients were suddenly quarantined and unexpectedly fully isolated from family and friends, which prevented both the patient and the family from processing the gravity of the clinical situation and the very real possibility of death. Additionally, because of the nature of the illness, patient's were often destined to die alone and in an unfamiliar setting. The acuity of the patient's clinical presentation and the limited face-to-face time that family and friends had with the healthcare teams may have prevented them from having enough data to make fully informed decisions. Hospitals were not equipped to facilitate these sensitive conversations in person. Healthcare professionals were unable to discuss the cultural values of an individual that would help formulate a plan unique to the individual. These plans may frequently include nursing homes, hospice units, in-home or family care. The hardships faced during the pandemic, particularly concerning end-of-life care, highlighted the importance of advanced directives, close collaboration with next of kin, mental health in the critically ill and dying, and prioritization of comfort care wishes. Healthcare professionals were unable to discuss the cultural values of an individual that would help formulate a plan unique to the individual. In this presentation, we will discuss 1) Decision making processes during the end of life and how they were impacted during COVID 2) Detrimental effects of social isolation on the hospitalized individual's sense of well-being 3) Change in cultural processes surounding grieving and bereavement 4) Alternative ways to provide palliative care support as well as grief support to families. Most importantly how this care can be provided without compromising the the well being of healthcare providers.","Suryadevara, Uma, Velez, Lymaries, Nuthi, Meena","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.289","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S22-S23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28670,""

"Addressing Behavioral Health of the Diverse Older Adults in the Various Health Care Setting during COVID pandemia","During COVID-19 pandemia being in a â€œgolden ageâ€ group, having chronic health conditions make people more susceptible to the virus. The need to socially distance creates the sense of isolation, affects older adults routines, mass transportation, and some â€œnon-essentialâ€ social services. Those factors in addition to the uncertainty and fear COVID-19 creates, and the potential for older adults to be more vulnerable to the virus and higher mortality rates among older adults may exacerbate depression and anxiety for which effective and safe treatment interventions are required. Virtual partial hospitalization program offers affordable and convenient opportunity to address mental health needs of older adults. There were a number of challenges with transitioning to and utilizing a telehealth platform for psychiatric evaluation in the long term care setting during the COVID 19 pandemic. First, staffing of facilities was stretched during the pandemic, making facilitation of Tele visits difficult. Without staff present through the entire visit to sort out technical difficulties, repeat questions and instructions for patients with hearing difficulties, and help patients complete questionnaires, evaluation was significantly limited. Additionally, the restrictions in place to mitigate viral transmission to residents and staff played unique roles in the psychiatric population. Isolation, lack of intellectual stimulation though group activities/dining, and halted family visits contributed to depression, anxiety, and agitation. Compounded with limited access to staff for therapy and medical management, we certainly observed a decline in motivation and functioning in our patients. In sum, while telehealth was successfully used in many settings during the COVID 19 pandemic, unique challenges in the geriatric psychiatry population residing in long term care facilities made implementation difficult. Lack of in-person visits and staffing shortages may have also contributed to escalation of psychiatric symptoms. Offering tele-psychiatry to diverse VA older adult patient population appears to be a valuable option although especially in the rural areas may present some challenges including irregularities of the internet connection, limited equipment availability as well as limited proficiency of the patient's utilization of the various telehealth platforms. However with appropriate training and equipment supplies those challenges can be resolved.","Shteinlukht, Tatyana, Patel, Amita, Asghar-Ali, Ali Abbas, Ahmed, Iqbal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.284","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S20-S21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28673,""
"Ask The Expert Geriatric Psychiatry: VA program to support clinicians","This symposium addresses a critical need in geriatric psychiatry staffing shortages. The Department of Veterans Affairs is increasingly catering to aging veterans with complex medical and emotional problems. Unfortunately, there is a critical shortage of geriatric psychiatry expertise. The COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified the need for geriatric psychiatry services particularly in rural areas. In an effort to extend the valuable and too-often-scarce resource of geriatric psychiatry expertise, the National Telemental Health Center launched a new consultation service, Ask the Expert program in Geriatric Psychiatry, earlier this year. A team of VA Geriatric Psychiatrists were made available to answer general questions that VA clinicians may have about psychiatric care of older Veterans with potentially complex and interacting psychiatric, medical, neurocognitive, and behavioral care needs. The program aimed to provide a response within 7 days. Providers from the field were encouraged not share any Protected Health Information (PHI) in your questions. The service was not intended to make case-specific clinical recommendations, review patient health records, or respond to psychiatric emergencies. Speaker Prasad Padala will discuss the conceptualization, process of development and the National support needed for actualization of the program. He will also provide an overview of common themes in the questions received so far. Panelists: Dr. Ruchi Aggarwal will review the infrastructure, coverage and day to day operation of the program. She will further discuss the performance of the team. Dr. Donovan Maust will provide illustrative examples of polypharmacy, de-prescription and management of complex medical comorbidities. Dr. Gauri Khatkhate will provide illustrative example for management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Dr. Susan Schultz will serve as the discussant and will highlight the need for workforce development in geriatric psychiatry.

"Addressing Disparities in Geropsychiatry Education: Lessons Learned from 2020","With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, numerous disparities in both geriatric mental health care and geriatric mental health education emerged as challenges for medical educators. Many of these disparities were known prior to the onset of pandemic, including unequal access to geriatric psychiatry educators and clinical experts across the country, as well as limited opportunities for clinical experiences in geriatric psychiatry for medical students and residents. Indeed, the Institute of Medicine Report of 2012, â€œIn Whose Hands: The Mental Health and Substance Use Workforce for Older Adultsâ€, had identified the current and projected gaps in geriatric mental health training to meet the needs of an aging population. Since 2020, additional gaps and disparities have been recognized that adversely affect the ability to adequately develop and train the next generation of geriatric psychiatrists, as well as geriatrics-informed general psychiatrists and primary care physicians. The year 2020 also brought to the fore, issues of racism and ageism, both of which may not have been adequately addressed before in geropsychiatry education. Yet, racism and ageism are both now more clearly understood as key factors affecting the lives of elders and adding to disparities in geriatric mental health care. At the same time, the challenges of the pandemic led to new innovations in both the delivery of geropsychiatry education and the content of the education strategies that will help to mitigate disparities for patients and trainees. This symposium will address 3 key areas related to disparities in geropsychiatric education and will share important insights that should inform future approaches to geropsychiatry education. Dr. Susan W. Lehmann will present on: â€œâ€™In Whose Hands?â€™: Where are we today?â€ In her talk, Dr. Lehmann will discuss the 2012 Institute of Medicine Report that described the deficiencies and disparities in geriatric mental health education identified in 2012, and she will provide an update 10 years later about what has changed since the report, and what remains to be done. She will specifically talk about geographic disparities in opportunities for training and the impact of these disparities on the mental health care of older adults. Dr. Lehmann will discuss the need for professional organizations to focus on national approaches to advocacy and change. Dr. Kirsten Wilkins will present on: â€œChallenges and Opportunities: Preparing the Next Generation of Geropsychiatry Traineesâ€. In her talk, Dr. Wilkins will discuss disparities in health care that were exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and which negatively impact geropsychiatry education. She will address the clinical care training challenges presented by unequal access to telemedicine for elders, as well as the challenges of incorporating virtual care into the geropsychiatry curriculum for trainees. Dr. Wilkins will also address the national reckoning on race and racism that emerged during 2020 and its impact on older adults and the learning environment for geropsychiatry trainees. She will discuss the implications for geropsychiatry educators in preparing trainees to be leaders in eliminating the deleterious effects of racism and ageism for older adults. Dr. Michelle Conroy will present on: â€œInnovations and opportunities within geriatric psychiatry education: lessons learned from the COVID-19â€ pandemic. She will discuss innovations in geropsychiatry education that were developed during the Covid-19 pandemic in response to identified disparities, and lessons learned for educators that should continue into the future. In particular, she will describe a number of successful new outreach programs, didactics, and educational products developed by geropsychiatry educators in AAGP.","Lehmann, Susan, Wilkins, Kirsten, Conroy, Michelle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.277","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S16-S17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28675,""
"Connecting the Digital Dots: Engaging Diverse Older Adults Through Virtual Outreach","According to the Administration on Aging in 2018, 34% of older adults are racial and ethnic minorities. The median income of older adults was ~$25K, with 18.9% of older Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks, 11.7% of older Asians, and 19.5% of older Hispanics living below the poverty level (compared to 7.3% NH Whites). With a growing cohort of older adults =75 years old, 50% report difficulty in physical functioning. At the intersection of race/ethnicity, income inequality, age and frailty;many older adults face challenges to receiving high quality mental health care and access to clinical trials. 40% of homebound older adults have a psychiatric or cognitive disorder but have limited access to mental health services. Despite increased illness burden, both racial/ethnically diverse and homebound older adults are underrepresented in clinical trials. The Montefiore Home Care Geriatric Psychiatry Program (MHC-GPP) and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Center of Excellence for Alzheimer's Disease (CEAD) have extensive experience serving a culturally and economically diverse patient population since 2004 and 2014, respectively. Both programs have collaborated to provide older adults with comprehensive assessments of psychological symptoms, cognitive and psychosocial needs across varied cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. These assessments have connected patient/caregiver dyads with community supports and clinical trials. In 2016, the MHC-GPP and the CEAD secured two funding opportunities to provide problem based psychosocial interventions in the home. Over Â¾ of the patients served by these programs are NH Black or Hispanic older adults, most of which have less than 12 years of education. However, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic presented new barriers to reaching frail and cognitively impaired patients in this diverse community. In order to address these complex needs, the MHC-GPP social work team began proactively calling patients admitted to a Certified Home Health Agency (CHHA) during the first quarter of the pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to address the concrete and mental health needs of those most vulnerable to COVID-19. In addition, the MHC-GPP psychiatric team pivoted to telehealth evaluations that would still provide comprehensive assessment and management of psychological and cognitive symptoms. The MHC-GPP team also conducted virtual support groups for the CHHA staff. At the same time, the CEAD team converted the community engagement studio framework to a virtual format to engage a cohort of older predominately NH Black woman to discuss recruitment and retention of participants to a future clinical trial. During this session, the presenters will describe how telehealth interventions were implemented throughout the pandemic to engage diverse older adults in community. Presenters will describe how the MHC-GPP social work team developed a telephone assessment to proactively identify both concrete and mental health needs during the first quarter of the pandemic. Presenters will describe how the MHC-GPP in home psychiatric assessment was adapted to telehealth, while still continuing to provide behavioral and cognitive assessment in English and Spanish, to initiate treatment, to refer to clinical studies, and to provide a training site for fellows and residents. Finally, presenters will share results from a virtual community engagement studio, which was conducted to improve the recruitment and retention of under-resourced populations in a future clinical trial. The chair will also facilitate discussion of case examples and lessons learned.","Ceide, Mirnova E.; Korenblatt, Janice, Zwerling, Jessica, Kennedy, Gary","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.276","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28676,""
"Race/ethnicity and late-life depression: Disparities in symptom burden and severity, aging biomarker correlates of risk factors, and treatment","The COVID-19 pandemic provided a stark illustration of racial/ethnic disparities in overall health in the US, especially among older adults. There is growing awareness of the presence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in late-life mental health outcomes. For example, depression is one of the greatest sources of morbidity and disability in the US;yet, recent evidence suggests older racial/ethnic minorities may experience higher depression symptom severity and depression-related role dysfunction. At the same time, minority older adults experience disparities in diagnosis and treatment for late-life depression (LLD). Furthermore, under-treatment or suboptimal treatment may be drivers of further disparities in LLD outcomes, and both healthcare system factors and patient preferences may influence levels of engagement with treatment and overall outcomes. Moreover, racial/ethnic disparities in both the prevalence and major risk factors for LLD can have serious consequences for general health and biological aging. Thus, the goal of this session is to present current science on the prevalence and correlates of racial/ethnic disparities in late-life depression (LLD) as well as potential paths to solutions. Dr. Chirag Vyas will present data on disparities in LLD severity, item-level symptom burden and treatment from a large national cohort of racially/ethnically and geographically diverse older adults. Dr. Olivia Okereke (Chair) will present results from the same national cohort regarding racial/ethnic differences in biological aging markers, and significant racial/variations in the relationship of major depression risk factors to biological aging. Dr. Macarius Donneyong will present results from his investigation of racial/ethnic differences in antidepressant treatment among national survey participants, including Medicare beneficiaries, and the potential role of both patient preferences and healthcare system factors in treatment disparities. Dr. Jin Joo will present her study of a novel peer-delivered treatment to reduce depressive symptoms in older minority adults. Finally, Dr. Charles F.

"Vulnerable Elders, Social Determinants and COVID-19: A perfect storm","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to an even more glaring spotlight the impact of social determinants of health on the medical and psychiatric morbidity and mortality outcomes from the infection in individuals both in the US and globally. Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact health outcomes for both medical and psychiatric disorders (Compton and Shim 2015). . In this session, we will begin with a vignette presented by Dr. Ahmed that illustrates this phenomenon. Dr. Trinh will then facilitate group discussions of the case. We will transition to an overview of SDOH led by Emily Tan, in which she will discuss how social determinants implicated in poor medical and mental health outcomes include being part of a disadvantaged minority or immigrant group or other marginalized population, experiencing systemic and structural racism, poverty, living environment (including crowding, pollution, and climate change), and having limited access to healthcare. Dr. Trinh will then present on the ways SDOH can increase the likelihood of numerous mental health concerns, including dementia, depression, suicide, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorderâ€“ all of which themselves have been identified as risk factors in contracting and experiencing poorer outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Dr. Nix will discuss how the intersectionality of older age, SDOH, and COVID-19 has led to a perfect storm of widespread devastation from the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting medical comorbidity and mortality. Three groups in particular have disproportionately suffered this health burden: (1) ethnic/racial minorities;(2) the socio-economically disadvantaged;and (3) the elderly, especially those living in residential care homes and nursing homes (Ali, Asaria, and Stranges, 2020). We will wrap up the session with a presentation from Dr. Ahmed on lessons learned from the pandemic and future directions, with a focus on how we can support elders and those affected by SDOH.","Nix, Linda, Tan, Emily, Trinh, Nhi-Ha, Ahmed, Iqbal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.266","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28678,""
"Pandemics: Historical Perspective and Vulnerabilities Among Minority Elderly","While infectious organisms surround us, critical circumstances need to occur for a pandemic to develop, such as that of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Prior pandemics had many feautres in common with COVID-19. Pandemics can expose weaknesses in public health response systems, as well as vulnerabilities in the populations who are most susceptible to adverse outcomes, and can lead to scapegoating of specific groups and attempts to conceal the disease. COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted the mental and physical health of minority seniors, and caused significant economic hardships. Long-standing social determinants of mental and physical health have led to health disparities highlighted by COVID-19, and demonstrate the complex intersection of health, medical comorbidities, and barriers to access to culturally competent physical and mental healthcare. The pandemic has caused significant mental health problems even among those who were spared the infection, primarily manifested as social isolation, depression, anxiety and opioid use disorders. Public health measures, including screening, vaccinations, and access to quality healthcare can all mitigate adverse outcomes. Similarly, best practices that include collaborations between social service agencies and faith-based groups are effective strategies to bring these mitigating strategies nearer to the minority seniors who are most in need. Addressing vaccine hesitancy is a critical component of ending this pandemic. Future research should bring together practitioners, public health agencies, and community-based organizations for the collaborative design and implementation of effective, culturally competent interventions to address the medical, psychosocial, and behavioral health needs of ethnic/racial minority older adult communities in the face of COVID-19 and other chronic health conditions. Using the Social Determinants Of Health framework as a guide, clinicians and researchers can work to address structural and systemic racism and poverty and create targeted interventions to COVID-19 and to prevent future pandemics.","Hargrave, Rita, Ahmed, Iqbal, Llorente, Maria","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.264","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28679,""
"â€œWe have no Black patientsâ€¦and we decided to fix itâ€: Lessons from a diversity initiative","Over the year 2020, two seminal events have brought the issue of healthcare inequities among communities of color, particularly African-Americans, into the forefront. The first of these is the COVID-19 pandemic which has laid bare disparities in health outcomes among communities of color. The second is the social justice movement triggered by police brutality against unarmed Black citizens, which has shone a spotlight on how structural racism impacts societies and creates disadvantages. The impact of these 2 factors on geriatric mental health merits further attention. In this session, we will present an initiative to increase outreach to underserved communities undertaken at McLean Hospital â€“ a tertiary level psychiatric hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School. The goal of this outreach was to make the geropsychiatry outpatient clinic's services available to clinicians and patients in African-American communities. It was also intended to address the problem that the clinic serves very few patients from these communities, possibly because of challenges related to accessing the clinic and more broadly, lack of awareness of available services. The first presentation will provide historical context around underrepresentation of persons of color within the geropsychiatry clinic. It will also outline how clinicians conducted a comprehensive needs assessment and developed a strategic plan for outreach into African-American communities in collaboration with experts in clinical operations and process improvement. This presentation will also discuss how clinic staff aimed to incorporate cultural humility into this process. The second presentation will outline the process of determining resources that may be required to provide a high level of care to patients of color. This includes a discussion on how the clinic's processes and systems were reorganized to optimize access to interpretation, social work and case management services and care coordination with PCPs who may not be part of the healthcare. This presentation will discuss how we performed outreach and the outcomes of this initiative. The third presentation/discussion will dissect the outcome of this initiative and focus more broadly on understanding the deep-rooted historical, cultural, social and economic factors underlying inequities in healthcare, especially among African-Americans. The session will conclude with a dialogue between the presenters on how to internalize the lessons learned, and then open up for audience participation.","Vahia, Ipsit, Bader, Caroline, Clouqueur, Marie, Black, Carmen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.262","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S7-S8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28680,""
"Research Innovations on Mechanistic Targets to Improve Social Connection in the Aging Population","Social isolation and loneliness have health consequences that rival those of smoking and obesity. Older adults are at particularly high risk for the negative consequences of loneliness and social disconnection due to compounding effects of age-related declines in functioning, cognition, and sensory function. Up to 29% of adults age 60 and older experience loneliness. The Covid-19 pandemic led to increased social isolation and depression among older adults, as a result of prolonged quarantine and the heightened risk of severe illness and death. While the negative consequences of loneliness and social isolation are clear, strategies to intervene and the underlying mechanisms of interventions are poorly understood, thus hindering prevention and intervention efforts. In this session, Nili Solomonov, Ph.D. will present preliminary findings from a novel neuroimaging-based social reward paradigm she developed examine the relationship between processing of social rewards and depression severity. Ellen Lee, M.D. will present work on the role of compassion and self-compassion in loneliness and development of a positive affect-driven intervention for underserved community-dwelling older adults. Kimberly Van Orden, Ph.D. will present results from a randomized trial of a social volunteering program for lonely older adults;specifically, predictors of engagement in the program (versus discontinuing the program). Bret Rutherford, M.D. will moderate and lead a discussion of mechanisms and treatment targets to reduce social isolation in the aging population.

"Innovative Interventions Augmented with Technology to Reduce Risk for Depression and Suicide in Aging Adults","This symposium will focus on innovative technological interventions that assist with remote treatment. Specifically, it will address late life depression in older adults and the ways in which technology can be adapted to meet their needs. Virtual tools, such as the ones that will be presented today, are particularly significant in the current COVID-19 pandemic when access to face-to-face interactions is limited and symptoms of distress and anxiety are likely to be exacerbated. First, Dr. Sara Czaja will focus on the PRISM trial to discuss the role of technology in providing support for aging adults suffering from depression. Second, Dr. Samprit Banerjee will speak about the feasibility of predicting homework (HW) adherence to psychotherapy of depression in middle-aged and older adults using passively collected data by mHealth apps. Third, Dr. Jo Anne Sirey will present the PROTECT program and its goal of reducing depression severity in elder abuse victims in a remote setting.

"Evaluating Social Connection and Well-being in an Intergenerational Telephone Visit Program during the COVID pandemic: A Pilot Study","Introduction Public health recommendations during COVID-19 have resulted in greater objective social isolation among older adults, putting them at risk for loneliness, depression and worsening of age-related morbidities such as cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disease. During the pandemic, volunteer organizations, such as the Concordium Program at Harvard College, have offered friendly telephone visits to older adults in the community to relieve feelings of loneliness and to promote emotional well-being, though the acceptability and Â efficacy of these interventions have not been well-established. This study evaluated the methods and participant experience of a remotely-delivered intergenerational, telephone intervention for older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed measures of socioemotional well-being before, during, and after the intervention. Methods We recruited nine community-dwelling adults who lived alone and endorsed loneliness through a research registry and clinic referrals. Individuals with hearing impairment were excluded. Nine undergraduates were recruited from the Harvard Concordium Program and were paired with an older adult participant based on mutual interests. Each dyad engaged in 8 weekly, 30 minute, unscripted telephone conversations. Each member of the pair answered online questionnaires at weeks 0 (pre), 4 (mid), and 8 (post) designed to assess loneliness (PROMIS Social Isolation Scale [PROMS]) and other aspects of psychological well-being (San Diego Wisdom Scale [SDW], Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale [BADS], Positive Affect and Well-Being Scale [PAWB], Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]). After completing all visits, older and younger adult participants responded to qualitative questions to evaluate the experience of the friendly visits through content analysis. Results From March to August 2021, 18 participants were enrolled, 9 of whom were older adults (mean age 74.53 [70-84], 88% women), 13 completed the study, and five dropped out. Among older adults who completed, numerical scores for loneliness, stress, and behavioral activation changed in an improved direction. Pre- and post-study mean scores and baseline standard deviation for older adults who completed are reported: PROMS (xÂ¯=31.7, 27.7;sd=5.06), BADS (xÂ¯=27.6, 35.1;sd=13.11) PAWB (xÂ¯=33.4, 33.0;sd=5.51), PSS (xÂ¯=14.4, 13.9;sd=4.35), SDW (xÂ¯=83.6, 81.9;sd=4.72). Conclusions Preliminary quantitative results point to possible improvements in loneliness, behavioral activation and perceived stress, though limited by low statistical power. Findings from this study will inform methods to optimize recruitment, improve implementation, and assess the effectiveness of friendly telephone visits to enhance social connection between younger and older adults in clinical and community settings.

"A Personalized, Telehealth Music Therapy Intervention for Lonely Older Adults: A Feasibility Study","Introduction Music listening interventions, facilitated by a qualified music therapist, have been shown to reduce late-life depression and anxiety but their impact on loneliness has not been well-studied. Risks associated with loneliness in older adults include depression, cognitive decline, poorer disease outcomes and premature mortality. This study evaluated the feasibility of a remotely-delivered, personalized music therapy intervention for older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic, and assessed measures of socioemotional well-being before, during, and after the intervention. Methods We recruited community-dwelling cognitively unimpaired older adults who lived alone, endorsed loneliness and were able to use Zoom video conferencing. Individuals with cognitive impairment (TICS &lt; 31), moderate-severe depression (GDS &gt; 10), or hearing impairment were excluded. Eight weekly, individual music therapy sessions were conducted with a board-certified music therapist via Zoom to develop personalized music playlists and to learn specific music listening techniques. Participants listened to playlists for one hour daily, completed a daily journal, and answered online questionnaires at weeks 0 (pre), 4 (mid), and 8 (post). The primary outcome was the PROMIS Social Isolation Scale [PROMS] score. Other questionnaires included the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale [BADS], Positive Affect and Well-Being Scale [PAWB], Perceived Stress Scale [PSS], Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI], and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale [SHAPS]). Qualitative data were collected at week 8 for thematic analysis. Results From March to August 2021, 11 participants were enrolled (mean age 74.82 [66-85], 88% women), eight completed the study, and one dropped out, leaving two actively enrolled. Among those who completed, numerical scores for loneliness and all other outcomes changed in an improved direction. Pre- and post-study mean scores and baseline standard deviation for those who completed are reported: PROMS (xÂ¯=20.0, 16.8;sd=5.88), BADS (xÂ¯=36.3, 40.8;sd=10.48), PAWB (xÂ¯=33.5, 37.1;sd=6.61), PSS (xÂ¯=14.5, 11.6;sd=7.89), BSI (xÂ¯=33.3, 23.5;sd=17.1), SHAPS (xÂ¯=47.0, 50.62;sd=6.74). Qualitative interviews were notable for themes of joy and improvements in sleep, health, focus, and physical pain. Participants also reported increased connectedness to culture, country of origin, loved ones, and the music therapist. Conclusions Recruitment and participant acceptability of a virtual, personalized music therapy intervention have been positive. Interim data analysis points to a possible improvement in loneliness and other outcome measures, though limited by low statistical power. Music therapy appears to be a novel and feasible approach to address loneliness and emotional wellbeing in at-risk community-dwelling older adults.","Kher, Hema, Haddad, Nichola, Zide, Benjamin, Hernandez, Maria, Hanser, Suzanne, Donovan, Nancy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.240","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry; 30(4, Supplement):S105-S106, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28684,""
"Developing a New Suicide Risk Assessment for Virtual Encounters with Non-Clinicians","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated that many research encounters be conducted virtually. Non clinician staff (e.g. research assistants (RAs), study coordinators, or research trainees) with varying levels of clinical training and experience are typically the primary point of contact for research participants. Consequently, they are often the first to encounter suicidality. This highlights the need for robust virtual suicide risk assessment procedures that are at an appropriate level for research staffÂ andÂ optimized for remote clinical research visits. The current procedures for in-person visits conducted by the Geriatric Psychiatry Program at McLean Hospital require non-clinician staff to complete the full Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) in situations of active suicidal ideation (SI) before requiring clinician notification and intervention. However, staff and clinicians both reported that the virtual visit format limited the quality of the assessment and the ability to respond rapidly in situations of passive suicidal ideation, especially when this ideation did not meet the threshold for clinician notification specified in the in-person protocol. Â Thus, we established the need for a specific virtual suicide risk assessment protocol. Here we present our process for needs assessment and its findings, which in turn have shaped our revised protocol. Methods We surveyed clinicians and social workers affiliated with the Geriatric Psychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital. The first goal of this survey was to collect information on how clinicians respond to situations of suicidality during telehealth assessments, and how clinicians recommend that staff navigate these situations in a virtual research setting. The second goal was to gather qualitative data that would guide preparatory safety planning (PSP) that non-clinician staff could complete prior to research visits. Because there are no standardized instruments for the information we wanted to collect, we developed a survey based on consensus among research staff. Results Of the 19 clinicians surveyed, 11 completed the brief survey. Nine (81.8%) of the eleven clinicians that responded had needed to deal with a patient at imminent risk of suicide in any setting. Only three (27.27%) clinicians were fully comfortable using the in-person SI protocol for virtual encounters. All 11 (100%) of responding clinicians conveyed that PSP should include information on (a) the exact location of the patient's home, Â (b) contact information for friends and family, and (c) an assessment of firearm access. The PSP should be completed as early as feasible in the research process, prior to formal enrollment, even if there was no reason to suspect SI at the time. Additional qualitative feedback included recommendations for lowering the threshold for enacting the SOP from subjects expressing active SI to passive SI to facilitate earlier intervention. Â Clinicians also recommended training staff on formal assessment measures such as the combined SAFE-T (Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage) and CSSRS protocol in a structured interview so that they could conduct a more systematic assessment if passive SI was reported. Conclusions As more research encounters are conducted virtually, protocols designed for in-person assessment of suicide risk must be adapted. We found that the most useful addition to a virtual SI protocolÂ  may be to lower the threshold for action from active to passive SI and inclusion of PSP. Our findings also indicate that staff should be trained in standardized suicide assessment and that there should be a low threshold for conducting these assessments (i.e. passive ideation) and notifying clinicians. Our findings may be broadly generalizable to all mental health research settings that involve virtual assessment by non-clinician staff.

"Addressing Access to Care in Geriatric Psychiatry through Outpatient Consultation","Introduction Article 31 clinics, under the regulation of the Office of Mental Health, have limitations in the patients that are able to be seen. In particular, patients with a primary diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder are considered ineligible for admission to such a clinic. Furthermore, many of the patients that would seek treatment at Montefiore Medical Center's Outpatient Psychiatry clinic, an Article 31 clinic, would not be able to afford private practice psychiatrists. Nevertheless, older adults with neurocognitive disorder experience symptoms that are typically managed by psychiatrists. In response to this gap in care, the Outpatient Geriatric Psychiatry team at Montefiore Medical Center developed an outpatient psychiatric consultation service to increase access to care and meet the mental health care needs of older adults living in the community. This service is provided under an Article 28 clinic, which is regulated by the Department of Health like any other medical specialty clinic. In this study, we aimed to identify which patients benefited from this service, what types of interventions were made and the impact on referring providers. This was done by collecting demographic data on patients referred for consultation and the format, frequency, and outcomes of these consultations. We also plan to collect feedback from referring providers. Methods The Geriatric Psychiatry outpatient consultation service started in December 2019 and conducted visits in person for 3 months, stopped during the 3 months of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020), restarted with virtual visits in July 2020 and then resumed with in person visits. Patients are referred by other providers in the Montefiore Health System or through self-referral. Patients are then screened for appropriateness for outpatient consultation. Patients who are =65 years old or have an underlying medical condition that contributes to their frailty, and who have a psychiatric concern are scheduled for an appointment. Efforts are made to direct those who are not appropriate for the service to more appropriate resources. In a retrospective chart review, data was gathered on patient age, referral source and reason for referral, diagnosis, format and number of visits, and outcomes of interest including medication changes, supportive services, and higher level of care. Results From December 2019 through September 2021, 38 patients were scheduled, 32 of whom presented to clinic for psychiatric evaluation. Patients ranged from 61 to 93 years old with a mean age of 79 years. A majority of patients were from ethnically diverse backgrounds with 59% Hispanic, 12.5% Black, 3% Asian and 3% American Indian. 50% of patients were Spanish speaking. About half the visits were conducted in person, with the remaining visits about evenly split between phone and video. Patients on average were seen for about 2 visits with a range from 1 to 11 visits. Most of the referrals came from primary care providers and among the reasons for referral were decline in function or cognition, behavioral concerns, depressed or anxious mood and psychosis. About 87.5% of patients had a diagnosis of major or minor neurocognitive disorder diagnosis. The most common interventions included medication changes, referral to support services, behavioral interventions, transfer to the outpatient department or sending for evaluation in the emergency department. Conclusions The Geriatric Psychiatry consultation service provided through an Article 28 clinic was primarily used by patients with neurocognitive disorders who would otherwise not be seen in Article 31 outpatient psychiatry clinics and would not be able to afford private practice. Through this service we were able to address a gap in care for a diverse and underserved patient population. In order to further assess the impact of this service, we plan to ask referring providers for feedback about the process of referral, the evaluations conducted and the recommendations received for their patients. Future studies would be helpful to collect prospective data on patients being followed by consultation service and additionally obtain patient and caregiver feedback.

"Psychiatric Resident Perceptions of Competency in the Management of Social Isolation and Grief in Geriatric Patients","Introduction The proposed research is an examination of resident experiences and preparedness in providing psychiatric care to geriatric patients in an adult outpatient clinic setting. During the SARS COV-2 pandemic, psychiatry residents were called upon to help older patients cope with increased social isolation, loss of loved ones, and fears about their own safety. Â The goal of the study is to assess the educational needs of residents in caring for this population, to provide a brief educational intervention targeting relevant clinical skills and knowledge, and to evaluate resident attitudes and feelings of competence before and after the intervention. The geriatric population presents with distinct clinical challenges and needs when it comes to psychiatric management. Although this population might be best served by subspecialty services, there is a relative shortage of geriatric psychiatrists, and most older psychiatric patients receive care from general psychiatrists or primary care physicians. While one month of training in geriatric psychiatry is a requirement of ACGME-accredited psychiatry residency programs, there is very little research examining general psychiatry residentsâ€™ perceptions of their ability to address the specific needs and psychosocial challenges of this population. Minimal research exists that examines the geriatric curricula in adult psychiatry residency programs. Furthermore, there is no research that addresses psychiatry resident competence in managing key psychosocial factors affecting geriatric psychiatric patients, including social isolation, loneliness, and bereavement. Experiences of loneliness and loss are fundamental lifecycle concerns, with social isolation being a particular issue among aging urban populations (1). The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated issues of social isolation and bereavement among geriatric patients, bringing attention to their role as key social determinants of physical and mental health (2). The psychological impact of the pandemic on older adults is an area of active study. However, little attention has been paid to how psychiatric trainees are engaging with these issues in their care of older patients. Methods Study participants were drawn from all four class years of the psychiatry residency program at LAC+USC Medical Center between March and June of 2021. Participants completed a 15-question survey to evaluate their subjective feelings of preparedness and competency in caring for elderly patients. The survey also evaluated residentsâ€™ perspectives about the relative importance of addressing different psychosocial issues when caring for elderly patients. Results A total of 34 respondents across four levels of training completed the pre-intervention survey. Among first- and second-year residents, 84% did not feel prepared to address issues of loneliness and 76% did not feel prepared to address issues of grief in older patients. Among third- and fourth-year residents, 31% of respondents did not feel prepared to address either of these two issues, despite having completed a 1-month geriatric psychiatry rotation. Very few senior residents felt â€œvery well preparedâ€ to address issues of grief or loneliness in their patients (13% and 6% respectively), with the majority feeling â€œsomewhat prepared.â€ Respondents across all four class years indicated a strong level of interest in additional training in the management of grief and social isolation/loneliness. Conclusions The results of the survey suggest that although, self-perceived competence in the management of geriatric psychosocial issues increases over the course of training, many residents do not feel adequately prepared to meet certain needs in the geriatric population.Â  These results will be used to create an educational intervention. The educational intervention will be provided to the current 3rdÂ year class as part of the outpatient didactic curriculum. A post-intervention survey will be used to assess residentsâ€™ feelings of preparedness and comfort in providing care for elderly patients and to evaluate the perceived value of the educational intervention. A final survey will be given to the 3rdÂ year class at the end of the 2022 academic year and will be compared to the survey results of the 2022 and 2021 graduating classes.Â  Study data will be primarily qualitative, with a limited amount of quantitative date derived from pre- and post-intervention surveys. A paired t-test will be used to compare the results of the pre- and post-intervention surveys. Citations: 1.Courtin, E., & Knapp, M. (2017).

"Living with Heart Failure during the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Introduction Heart Failure (HF) affects 6.2 million adults in the United States and its incidence increases with age. HF is the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults, with the highest readmission rates when compared to other chronic conditions representing significant economic and health impact. Psychological distress including depression is prevalent in HF patients and has been shown to contribute to negative outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had important implications for HF patients by heightening the risk of infection and HF acute exacerbations, as well as distancing patients from their support network impacting their wellbeing and quality of life. This study aimed to explore psychosocial experiences of those living with HF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Qualitative research study that collected information with semi-structured interviews delivered by phone and a demographics and mental health history survey mailed to patients. 30 Patients were recruited from February to May 2021. All interviews were transcribed and coded using NVivo. Results Mean age was 72.6, 73% male, and 27% female. 27% reported previous or current depression diagnosis and 23% considered symptoms to be somewhat related to HF;17% reported anxiety diagnosis that occurred either in the past or presently with 10% considering symptoms somewhat related to HF. There were 4 major categories identified.Â 1.Â Access to Medical Services, included themes about ability to connect with providers throughout the pandemic and adjustment to novel care models;challenges with hospitalizations that lacked family support and presence;and delay in emergency care.Â 2. Social Life and Routines,Â included the most common themes described by patients and the difficulties experienced within this category. Themes about the pivotal role of socialization and social support that were lost during the pandemic commonly emerged. Additionally, the resulting changes to family structures and routines, as well as themes related to the challenges of accessing public services like restrooms.Â 3. Fears and Health Consequences, included themes about the fear of COVID-19 infection, the potential health consequences, and the importance of prioritizing health and follow medical advice. Most participants described a sense of relief and hope once the vaccine became available.Â 4. Emotional Response, included themes related to mood decline and experiences of fear and frustration. Positive themes emerged related to masking which was normalized and helpful to those immunocompromised. Moreover, some described the benefits of connecting with others either using technology or spending more physical time at home because of the quarantine.

"Landscape of Isolation: Covid-19 and Geriatric Mental Health","Introduction The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the forums, methods, and content of our human communication, with the efforts towards reducing viral transmission and protecting vulnerable groups. The elderly population, particularly the population in long term care, have been especially exposed to both the risk of viral transmission, due to the communal housing aspect of long term care facilities, and the mental and physical aspects of quarantine, due to the policy of physical isolation. This review aims to examine current research on how the impact of age and physical environment during the pandemic has formed disparities in mental health and healthcare delivery. Methods A focused literature search was carried out using PubMed. The following search terms were used: (Covid isolation geriatric psychiatry) and (Loneliness geriatric psychiatry COVID) and (COVID geriatric mental health), results were by two independent reviewers for high-quality reviews, meta-analyses, and descriptive studies. Results Literature robustly suggests that the isolation caused by national lockdowns has increased loneliness, depressive feelings, anxiety levels, and suicide rates in the geriatric population. These psychological symptoms can also have an impact on physical health. Studies have shown an association between isolation and high blood pressure, cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, diminished immune system functioning, coronary heart disease, obesity, anxiety, and depression. Prevention methods that have been considered include increasing virtual social interaction and engaging in more physical activity to reduce depressive symptoms. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of mental health in the geriatric population. Isolation and lockdown measures have been implemented to protect physical health, but there are major consequences including increased depression and suicide rates. It is important to raise awareness of this ongoing public health issue so that solutions can be implemented to restore social interaction and prevent these psychological symptoms.

"Virtual Chair Yoga for Stress in Older Adults with Dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairments and Caregivers during COVID-19","Introduction Over 700,000 Canadians are affected by dementia, costing the health care system approximately $10 billion/year. Due to COVID-19, the government has urged individuals over the age of 70 to stay home, putting this population at risk of becoming socially isolated. Those with dementia or mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) and their caregivers are at an even higher risk of becoming stressed, anxious, and agitated while in lockdown. Unsurprisingly, caregiver burden is extremely common, and often precedes institutionalization of the patient, as the demands of the illness begin to exceed that which the caregiver can sustainably provide. Since social distancing measures have shut down activities and support groups for these individuals, there is an urgent need for scalable, cost-effective, non-pharmacological interventions that can be delivered remotely to improve stress and loneliness. There are positive preliminary results examining the effects of yoga on stress suggesting it may be suitable for individuals with dementia and their caregivers. For this reason, we are conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of an 8-week virtual chair yoga program. This would be the first virtual chair yoga study to engage both older adults with dementia/MCI and caregivers during COVID-19, which is consistent with the need for decreasing costs and increasing accessibility of novel health interventions during and beyond the pandemic. This study may be one viable solution to address the stress associated with the growing prevalence of dementia and the physical distancing measured associated with the COVID-19 health crisis. Methods A mixed-methods randomized controlled trial was used to assess the efficacy of an 8-week group Chair Yoga program on Zoom for older adults (60+) with dementia/MCI and their caregivers. Participants were assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control group and completed assessments at baseline and week 8. Quantitative assessments were measured at baseline and week 8, and qualitative assessments will be measured post-intervention. The primary and secondary outcomes are changes in stress and loneliness after the 8-week program, respectively. We also explored changes in anxiety, depression, caregiver burnout, fear of COVID-19, mindfulness, and self-compassion. Changes in all continuous variables from pre- to post-program will be evaluated by a Two-Way Mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with the within-subjects factor of time (baseline and week 8) and between-subjects factor of condition (chair yoga treatment or control). For the qualitative component, a descriptive phenomenological approach will be used to code data into themes based on key words and on frequency/importance of these words. Results We are in the final stages of data collection. Results will be ready by December 2021. Preliminary observations suggest that this program is feasible and acceptable based on positive feedback from older adults and caregivers. Some difficulties encountered were lack of internet access, lack of devices, and scheduling conflicts, which led to individuals not participating in the study. Surprisingly, many older adults were aware and knowledgeable of the Zoom software;we experienced very minor difficulties in using this software for this population. Conclusions We expect this study to validate our hypotheses that the severity of stress, loneliness, caregiver burden, and other self-reported outcomes will significantly decrease in the treatment group compared to the waitlist control group. As such, this intervention may decrease the economic burden on the healthcare system, as it can be delivered to large groups online and is easily scalable and cost-effective. It may also be a benefit to society by potentially decreasing the number of Canadians suffering from chronic stress. Additionally, it will potentially reduce caregiver burden and delay institutionalization of individuals with dementia, the latter of which may be particularly impactful given the rapid spread of COVID-19 through long-term care facilities in Canada. Regardless of the outcome, this study will provide essential pilot data for future large RCTs to improve stress and mental health in both older adults with dementia/MCI and caregivers.

"Loneliness in Older Adults with Major Depression Across the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction Loneliness has emerged as a distinct clinical construct with detrimental physical and mental health effects. During the COVID-19 outbreak and aftermath, studies examining loneliness in older adults reported mixed results with increased, decreased, and static levels of loneliness. These inconsistent findings likely relate to pandemic-related phenomena of amplified social isolation (e.g., quarantines, social distancing, remote work) for some, and anÂ increasedÂ sense of social connectedness (e.g., shared interests, challenges and experiences, greater media engagement) for others.Â  To our knowledge, only one study has examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults with pre-existing major depression.Â  Most were resilient, with no overall change in depression, anxiety, and suicidality scores, however loneliness was not explicitly considered.Â  As such, since loneliness and depression are interrelated in older adults, we sought to examine whether loneliness in non-remitted older depressed patients was impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A brief survey instrument was developed that included relevant socio-demographic information, a modified Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) scale for assessing perceived health status, a question on communication during the pandemic adapted from the Questionnaire for Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults (QAICPOA), a question on consumption of COVID-19 related news coverage, and the UCLA 3-item Loneliness Scale for three different time points:Â  prior to the pandemic (retrospective self-rating), during the height of the pandemic (defined as between the declaration of a formal pandemic in March 2020 until vaccinations began in December 2020) (retrospective self-rating), and currently at the time of survey administration in Fall 2021 (contemporaneous rating). To ensure a homogeneous patient population, eligibility criteria included a primary diagnosis of a major depressive disorder without psychosis, cognitive impairment, secondary psychiatric disorders, or a remitted state.Â  All patients were active registrants in the Zucker Hillside Hospital (ZHH) Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic. A list of eligible patient names and contacts were generated through the IT department by ing information from the electronic health record.Â  As per Northwell's IRB review, this survey project met the criteria outlined in 45 CFR 46.101 for IRB exemption. Eligible patients were called and asked to complete the survey over the phone. Data for the current pilot sample were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test with a threshold of significance of pÂ =0.05. Results 106 patients met eligibility criteria.Â  To date, 30 patients completed telephone surveys. The mean age of these respondents was 73.5 (SD Â± 6.39) years. 73.3% (nÂ =Â 22) were female and 26.1% (nÂ =Â 8) were male.Â  63.3% of patients were white, 16.6% were Black, 13.3% were Hispanic, and 6.6% were Asian. 50% of patients were married, 26.6% were divorced, and 23.3% were widowed. 10% of patients were still working, while the remaining 90% were retired.Â  33.3% of patients had an associate, bachelor's, or graduate/advanced degree, 63.3% of patients completed high school, and 3.3% had not.Â  73% lived with at least one other person and 27% lived alone.Â  86.7% had one or more children and 13.3% were childless.Â  The mean OARS score was 3.16 (SD Â± 1.88) (range 0-6, worse to best perceived health).Â  Compared to prior to the pandemic, 46.6 % of patients reported less communication with friends and family, 46.6 % reported they communicated the same, and 6.7% said they communicated more. Mean COVID-related news consumption rating (range 1-5, 5Â =Â most) was 3.8 (SD Â± 1.3). Â Mean UCLA 3-item loneliness scale (range 3-9) scores were 4.97 (SD Â± 1.85) prior to the pandemic, 6.47 (SD Â± 1.89) during the height of the pandemic, and 5.37 (SD Â± 2.11) in the Fall 2021 vaccination period.Â  A significant difference existed between loneliness scores prior to the pandemic and worsening loneliness during the height of the pandemic (p&lt;0.0001). A significant difference also was found between loneliness scores during the height of the pandemic and improving loneliness during the less acute pandemic vaccination period (p &lt; 0.005).Â  There was no significant difference between loneliness prior to and after the height of the pandemic. Conclusions In a representative pilot sample (expansion ongoing) of older depressed adults, loneliness increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.Â  In the context of prior findings of largely stable mental health parameters and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak in a similar population, this suggests that loneliness is a unique human experience not necessarily alleviated by effective coping strategies.Â  That loneliness significantly improved with a likely sense of incipient normalization reenforces that it is a dynamic psychological state subject to intervention.

"Adverse Childhood Experiences and (New Onset) Late-Life Depression, A Case Report","Introduction Childhood abuse has been strongly related to late-life depression and its comorbidities. About one-third of later-onset disorders have been linked to childhood abuse. Individuals who experienced childhood abuse may be able to maintain psychological wellbeing throughout middle age but may be disturbed in later life. Older adults may recall old traumas when reflecting on their lives, and memory of their past traumas may function as new stressors. We report the case of a 72-year-old Black male who presented with suicidal ideation and other symptoms of a depressive episode. His history was significant for extensive childhood trauma. HisÂ depressive symptoms ensued after reflecting and ruminating on traumatic childhood experiences. Methods We reviewed current literature describing relationship between adverse childhood experiences and depression in late life.Â No written consent was obtained from the patient as there is no patient identifiable data included in this case report. Case summary:Â Patient is a 72-year-old black male with no known past psychiatric history, and past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Two weeks before presentation, he became irritable, and occasionally expressed suicidal ideation. He presented because ofÂ changes in behavior, outbursts, and aggression. He reportedÂ â€œmiserableâ€ and depressed mood, poor appetite, and fatigue in context of ruminating on traumatic childhood experiences. He endorsed reduced concentration, sleep problems, andÂ anhedonia. He described frequent emotional and physical abuses by his father, from childhood until adolescence. He didÂ most of the house chores while his younger siblings ate, and he ateÂ what was left over. HeÂ also reported being treated unequally and unfairly byÂ his paternal aunts. He believed this was due to his darker skin colorÂ compared to his siblings. He copedÂ with the psychological effects of the childhood abuse most of his life until few weeks before presentation. He found himself ruminating more on these past experiences which made him depressed. He refusedÂ meals for 2-3 days and expressed suicidal thoughts prior to presentation.Â On examination, he exhibited psychomotor retardation. His affect was flat and constricted. Mini-mental State Exam score was 28 out of 30.Â Blood glucose was 33 mg/dL. CT head showed mild cerebral atrophy and mild periventricular white matter disease. Patient was admitted to telemetry for treatmentÂ of hypoglycemia. Psychiatry was consulted for evaluation of depressed mood, and aggression. Once medically stable, heÂ continued to endorse depressive symptoms in context of rumination on childhood experiences. HeÂ met DSM-5 criteria for Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe. He was commenced on Mirtazapine 7.5 mg po at bedtime andÂ wasÂ to follow-up in our clinic. However, heÂ was lost to follow-up. When contacted, he declined further care. Results Our patient had significant childhood trauma. Major depressive disorder due to another medical condition was plausible on account of his past medical history. We also considered delirium, however patient continued to ruminate on childhood experiences after he wasÂ medically stable. It is unclear if our patient had undiagnosed chronic subclinical depression, hence it would be helpful to explore his core cultural beliefs and attitudeÂ toward mental health treatment. Our patient wasÂ going through life transitions like retirement and isolation related to the covid-19 pandemic. These psychosocial stressors may have precipitated a depressive episode or compoundedÂ his ruminations on his adverse childhood experiences. We also considered the possibility of prodromal neurocognitive disorder given findings on his brain imaging. Although his MMSE was noncontributory, continuous follow-up and further workup was needed. Despite the limitations and complexity of our case report, we postulate a strong link between our patient's major depressive episode and his adverse childhood experiences. While it is important to consider other differential diagnoses when assessing older adults with depression, it isÂ helpful to screen for adverse childhood experiences. The ACE questionnaire is a reliable and valid measure of childhood adversity. Our case report corroborates findings shown in studies relating adverse childhood experience with new onset late-life depression andÂ other disorders. Conclusions Our case report corroborates findings shown in studies relating adverse childhood experience with new onset late-life depression. We hope this article will increase awareness of the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and late-life depression and the need to screen older adults with depression for this important stressor.

"Telehealth Intervention Program for Older Adults (TIP-OA) for Stress and Mental Health Symptoms: Predictors of treatment response","Introduction Prior to COVID-19, psychiatric disorders affected over 10â€“15% of older adults (&gt;1,000,000 Canadians aged 60+) with estimated costs of $15 billion/year. The pandemic has increased social isolation and limited resources for this vulnerable population, potentiallyÂ increasing the risk ofÂ stress, anxiety, and depression, thusÂ creating an urgent need for support for isolated older adults. To help prevent the development or worsening of mental illness and improve mental health in older adults, we developed an innovative volunteer-based Telehealth Intervention Program for Older Adults (TIP-OA), where volunteers provide weekly friendly phone calls to older adults (clients). TIP-OA has already served 500+ clients in 10+ languages. Although volunteer-based phoning programs may be affordable, scalable, and accessible, there is limited data about their real-world effectiveness and predictors of response. Seeing as TIP-OA is a novel and ongoing intervention program, we aim to identify predictors of treatment response based on client baseline risk ratings and demographic characteristics to help maximize the program's efficacy and benefits, and to detect vulnerable sub-groups of clients who need additional or alternate support. Methods To identify predictors of treatment response, we conducted a longitudinal study. Participants (n=114) were TIP-OA program users (age = 60) who were screened and assigned a risk rating, were living in Montreal, and consented to take part in research. Clients with no/mild ratings were coded as green (low risk), 2+ moderate ratings as orange (medium risk) and 1+ severe rating as red (high risk). Demographic information and the outcome measure responses were collected via phone at baseline,Â 4- and 8-weeks after receiving their first call. Our primary objective is to identify whether baseline risk level (green: low risk, orange: medium risk, red: high risk) is associated with improved mental health outcomes at 8-week follow-up for stress (primary outcome), depression, anxiety, and COVID fear (secondary outcomes). Our secondary objective is to identify whether baseline demographic characteristics (age, gender, living environment, ethnicity, neighbourhood, languages spoken) are associated with improvement in primary and secondary outcomes.Â We will compare outcome scores between groups with different baseline risk levels using two-way ANOVA. Additional analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) will control for variables that differ between groups at baseline. Additional linear mixed-effect regression models, adjusting for covariates such as age, sex, etc., will analyze the effect of TIP-OA in all outcomes collected at baseline and 8-week follow-up. Results We are currently in the process of analyzing the data, and anticipate results by December 2021. Conclusions We anticipate that TIP-OA will be particularly beneficial for improving stress, depression and anxiety symptoms, and fear of COVID-19 over 8-weeks in participants with higher baseline risk levels. If this study is successful, our potential scientific findings will allow us to further refine the intervention and focus future related interventions to patient populations who could benefit most.Â High-quality, real-time evidence about the predictors of response to this novel intervention for older adults will be generated, allowing for the translation of these findings to the application and further development of TIP-OA or related interventions on a larger scale. Another benefit is that our findings can contribute to aÂ next step in this line of research: as older adults are becoming more familiar/comfortable with technology, there is possibility for future high-impact research examining other telehealth and digital health interventions for older adults.

"Evaluating the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Depression and Resilience in Older Adults","Introduction Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical and mental health of older adults. We know how social isolation and loneliness may adversely affect one's health, mood, and cognition, specifically in adults over 65. However, when faced with adversity, studies have shown older adults to be at least, if not more, resilient than their younger counterparts. This study aimed to understand the extent of psychosocial impact the pandemic had on older adults with and without depression currently enrolled in the Neurobiology of Late-Life Depression (NBOLD) Study. In conjunction with the Brief Carroll Depression and Brief Resilience Scales, we used a novel measure of pandemic-related experiences across several life domains in older adults, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory-Geriatrics Adaptation (EPII-G). Based on prior knowledge of how detrimental social isolation can be on mental health and how resilient older people can be, we hypothesized that depression scores would increase during the pandemic. We also suspected that resilience scores at least remain constant or possibly improve. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adults 65 and older account for 14.3% of cases and 80% of COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. Between â€œstay at homeâ€ guidelines and visitation restrictions along the continuum of aging services, there is concern over the lasting effects of social isolation. Therefore there is a need to examine and map the ways by which one's physical and social environments impact loneliness. Although loneliness is considered to be a subjective feeling related to a person's experience, it is one of three main factors leading to depression and a factor in cause of suicide. Despite this, one characteristic has shown to be protective against these stressors. Resilient individuals exhibit internal qualities like self-reliance and optimism and have external support systems in place allowing them to adapt more readily in the face of change. There is still little research available regarding outcomes and factors from COVID-19 impacting older adultsâ€™ depression and resilience, which this study aims to address, while strengthening the validity of the EPII-G. Methods The study population included older adults previously diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and non-depressed controls, enrolled in the N-BOLD study at University of Connecticut Health Center. Inclusion criteria for participants included: age of 60 or greater, ability to read and write English, and Mini-Mental State Examination score of 25 or greater. Depressed subjects met the criteria for MDD, either episodic or recurrent. Participants provided additional informed consent for the study. Baseline data was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with second interviews taking place mid-2020, and additional follow-up summer 2021. The study utilized the EPII-G, Brief Carroll Depression Scale (BC), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The surveys were verbally administered by the research staff both in-person and via phone interviews. Results From mid-2020 to summer 2021, both depressed and emotional control groups saw an increase in total BC depression score. Older adults with a history of depression showed BC scores increase from 2.47 to 3.12, and older controls experienced increases from 0.5 to 1.11. Despite an increase in depression score, both cohorts also saw an increase in BRS resilience score, with the depressed group and control group showing increases in BRS from 18.18 to 19.75 and 20.93 to 23.33 respectively. We found a negative correlation between positive home life of person in the home on EPII-G and BC scores, with a correlation coefficient of -0.3645 and p-value of 0.0616. There was also a positive correlation with positive home life of person in the home and social activities for self and BRS scores, with correlation coefficients of 0.26304 and 0.29869 and p-values of 0.0845 and 0.0489 respectively. Conclusions Individuals who didn't see disruption to their normal routine and had the means to communicate with loved ones had strong psycho-social supports in place, but were still vulnerable to the detrimental effects of isolation. Through their years of experience, older adults have had the time needed to develop protective factors such as self-reliance. They have also lived through poignant events such as war and economic depression, putting suffering into perspective. As many no longer work or attend school like their younger counterparts, they experienced less disruption to daily routine. This strong foundation has contributed to the resilience needed to overcome the stressors that surfaced during the pandemic. By continuing to follow these groups, we can evaluate changes in depressive symptoms, how long they persist, and if individuals return to baseline over time, as well as to continue to strengthen the EPII-G's validity.

"Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for People with Parkinson's Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction Anxiety and depression are among the most common non-motor PD symptoms. People with PD have experienced additional stress and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers of people with PD may experience significant caregiver burden. MBCT can prevent the relapse of depression and improve anxiety symptoms. Few studies have explored its benefits for people with PD;none have included caregivers. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention in reducing anxiety and/or depression in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their caregivers. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04469049) and it was conducted entirely online. Methods Peoplewith PD or parkinsonism and mild-to-moderate anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and caregivers of people with PD were recruited from neurology clinics, support groups, and online. 3 MBCT groups were conducted in Zoom from November 2020 to June 2021, using a previously adapted MBCT protocol, further modified for online delivery during the pandemic. Caregivers could also enter MBCT groups or complete pre- and post- surveys without joining groups. Data collected included demographic and clinical variables, pre- and post-MBCT behavioral measures (GAD-7, PHQ-9, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire: FFMQ-15), home practice time, and satisfaction surveys. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant characteristics, home practice time, and satisfaction survey responses. Pre- and post-MBCT behavioral measure scores were compared using mixed-effect models. Results See attached tables. All 27 participants who entered MBCT groups completed the intervention, except for one man with PD (nÂ =Â 22 people with PD/parkinsonism, nÂ =Â 4 caregivers). Attendance and participant satisfaction were high. MBCT completers had significant anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) score reductions and FFMQ-15 total and Observing and Non-reactivity subscale score increases (all pâ€™s &lt; 0.05). Completers with PD/parkinsonism and anxiety (nÂ =Â 14) had a significant GAD-7 score reduction;those with PD/parkinsonism and depression (nÂ =Â 13) had a significant PHQ-9 score reduction (both pâ€™s &lt; 0.05). Completers with PD/parkinsonism also had a significant FFMQ-15 Observing subscale score increase (p &lt; 0.05). The caregiver sample was too small to be analyzed. Conclusions Online MBCT is feasible and may be effective in reducing anxiety and/or depression in people with PD. Results should be replicated in studies with larger samples and control groups.

"Remote assessment of cognitive aging and mental health in older Black Americans","Introduction Older Black Americans (BAs) are more likely than white Americans to develop depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).1-7 They are also more likely to encounter disparities in ADRD diagnosis and care8-10 and to experience digital divides in mobile health (mHealth) care that may have been amplified by the social-distancing precautions of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for individuals who are at risk for cognitive impairment or ADRD.11 To address these disparities, we have designed a study to learn about the preferences of BAs in the effective assessment of COVID-19, cognition, and mental health. Methods In this pilot study, we will conduct satisfaction interviews with BAs who are age 65+, who agree to use mHealth devices (see Table 1 for device list) to monitor potential COVID-19 symptoms, and who participate in three remote modalities (pen-and-paper, telephone, and online) of cognitive and mental health assessments (see Figure 1 for within-person study design and Table 2 for assessment questionnaires). Participants will be randomly assigned modality orders upon enrollment, and each modality will last two weeks and will be followed by a two-week washout period. Participants will complete weekly subjective reports of their experiences using the mHealth devices and completing the mental and cognitive health assessments, and study companions will be asked about the amount of assistance participants need to complete each assessment modality. Results To date, we have screened 16 BAs, but 2 BAs were ineligible due to existing dementia diagnosis, and 1 opted not to participate. We have enrolled 7 participants (M=72, SD=4.95;1 out of 7 female), who have not received clinical diagnosis of dementia but expressed concerns about their memory. These concerns were reflected in an average MOCA score of 22.8 (range=20-25) at enrollment, which is in the range for mild cognitive impairment. For the participants who have included at least two assessment modalities of the study (n=4), all preferred the pen-and-paper modality to the telephone modality due to its faster administration time (i.e., ~15 minutes vs. ~45 minutes). Note that no preference data is available for the online modality, as only 1 participant has completed it at this time. Furthermore, all 4 participants expressed surprise at their own willingness and comfort with the mHealth devices, with 2 noting that they have begun using the devices to self-monitor daily vitals, and 2 noting that wearing the actigraphy wristwatch serves as a reminder to increase their physical activity and make health-conscious choices. All 4 participants also reported that they appreciate the focus on social and mental well-being in the weekly questionnaires and look forward to check-in calls from research team members. These qualitative findings are reinforced by the results of the anxiety/depression scales, which show decreased feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and anxiety in participants over the initial 6 weeks. Conclusions Our preliminary findings suggest that older BAs with mild cognitive impairment are able to complete in-home assessments of cognitive and mental health assessments. They have also reported that mHealth devices are easy to use in their everyday lives. We will continue to enroll participants in order to evaluate the feasibility of in-home assessments and to identify statistically significant trends in modality preferences among these vulnerable older adults.

"Prevalence of mental health outcomes and effects of sex and mood or cognitive comorbidity in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Older adults are at greater risk for developing severe illness from SARS-COV2 infection and may be more vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes as a result of public health guidelines that increase social isolation. In the current study, we assessed mental health outcomes in a cohort of older adults with normal cognition (NC), past history of major depressive disorder (i.e., remitted;rMDD), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to determine the prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, general stress, and post-traumatic stress. Additionally, we assessed the effects of mood or cognitive diagnosis and sex on symptom severity. Based on the pre-pandemic literature, we predicted that the presence of rMDD or MCI diagnosis would be associated with increased severity of psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also predicted that women would experience greater severity of psychiatric symptoms compared to men. Methods The study included 108 older adults (37 males, mean age=72.1 years) who were participating in existing longitudinal studies. The sample included 71 older adults with normal cognition (NC) based on normal neuropsychological test performance and who were free of lifetime history of psychiatric illness, 21 rMDD participants based on DSM5 criteria, and 16 MCI participants based on the presence of memory concerns, impaired performance on neuropsychological assessments, and intact functional independence. Participants completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and stress through video- or teleconferencing with a research assistant. Measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to measure anxiety, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure stress, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) to assess post-traumatic stress symptoms. Prevalence rates of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms were expressed as the percentage of participants with total scores that exceed the normal cut-offs for each respective measure. Separate MANOVAs were used to examine the effects of diagnosis and sex. Non-normally distributed data (PHQ-9 and PROMIS total scores) were rank-transformed and entered into MANOVA. Results Within the sample of 108 participants, 33.7% exceeded the normal cut-off on the PHQ-9, 31.3% had clinically significant anxiety symptoms on the PROMIS-Anxiety, 35.5% had clinically significant stress scores on the PSS, and 38.3% had clinically significant post-traumatic stress scores on the IES-R. MANOVA showed statistically significant effects of diagnosis on all measures: PHQ-9 [F(2,90)=5.380, p=.006], PROMIS-Anxiety [F(2,90)=11.687, p&lt;.001], PSS [F(2,90)=8.480, p&lt;.001], and IES-R [F(2,90)=5.027, p=.009]. MDD participants scored higher on all measures compared to NC participants: PHQ-9 (p=.005), PROMIS-Anxiety (p&lt;.001), PSS (p&lt;.001), and IES-R (p=.004). In addition, MCI participants scored higher on the PSS compared to NC participants (p=.035). MANOVA showed significant effects of sex on all measures: PHQ-9 [F(1,91)=7.046, p=.009], PROMIS-Anxiety [F(1,91)=8.623, p=.004], PSS [F(1,91)=12.553, p&lt;.001], and IES-R [F(1,91)=10.529, p=.002] such that women scored higher on all measures compared to men. Conclusions Overall, over one-third of study participants reported clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, general stress, and post-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. These rates are higher than those described in population studies of older adults based on anonymous online surveys, which are reported to be 24.9% for depression, 19.4% for anxiety, 10.3% for stress, and 28.3% for post-traumatic stress;but are comparable to the prevalence rates of psychiatric symptoms in the general adult population. As predicted, presence of rMDD increased the severity of all psychiatric symptoms. However, MCI was also associated with increased stress compared to those with normal cognition, despite absence of current or past psychiatric illness. These findings suggest that older adults with previous depression or current MCI, as well as women overall, are particularly vulnerable to developing clinically significant psychiatric symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations of the current study are the inclusion of participants in existing studies, as opposed to sampling from the general population and the relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, the current findings suggest that some clinical populations, including those with rMDD and MCI, as well as women overall, may benefit from receiving interventions for mental health during the current and future pandemics.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Older Adults","Introduction Older adults are at an increased risk of contracting illnesses during outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, they have greater vulnerability to negative mental health outcomes as a consequence of public health restrictions that contribute to social isolation. Recent reviews have focused on the mental health effects of the pandemic on patients with COVID-19, healthcare workers (HCW), and the general population. Data on mental health outcomes in geriatric populations have emerged over the last 12-18 months, but no reviews regarding the prevalences of psychiatric symptoms have yet been published. We reviewed population-based studies that focused on the development of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms in the older adult general population aged 50+ years, to yield overall prevalence rates of post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia/sleep disturbances, and psychological distress symptoms in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Methods Our review was conducted based on the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist. We searched PubMed and preprint servers (https://www.medrxiv.org/) from January 1, 2020 to November 5, 2021, and conducted secondary searches using Web of Science from January 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021 and by reviewing the reference list of relevant studies. Studies were included in the review if they (i) focused on mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic;(ii) used validated measures of psychological or psychiatric symptomatology;(iii) comprised mainly of the general older adult population (aged 50 years+);and (iv) reported quantitative outcomes of prevalence (expressed as the percentage of participants exceeding the normal cut off for that measure). Excluded were (i) opinion papers or commentaries;(ii) studies that reported qualitative data;(iii) studies with samples mainly consisting of HCW, participants with confirmed or probable COVID-19 infection, hospitalized patients, or patients with a disease or condition;and (iv) clinical trials or intervention studies. To yield summary statistics, prevalence rates and sample sizes were pooled across studies. Results Thirty-eight full-text published articles met inclusion criteria. Across all studies, 41% of the participants were male, and all participants were above 50 years old. All studies employed cross-sectional designs and the majority used on-line survey tools. Specifically, 23 were on-line, 12 used telephone, 1 in-person, 1 through mail, and 1 used both on-line and telephone. 6 studies were based in North America while the remaining studies originated from across the globe (1 from Africa, 1 from Australia, 22 from Europe, 3 from Asia, 3 from South America, and 2 from a global sample). In a pooled sample size of 57,933 across all 38 studies, 28.3% experienced post-traumatic stress, 24.9% experienced depression, 19.4% experienced anxiety, 10.3% experienced stress, 44.1% experienced insomnia/sleep disturbances, and 17.0% experienced psychological distress, exceeding the normal cut-off. Conclusions Overall, nearly one-quarter, or 24%, of older adults have experienced clinically significant psychiatric symptoms in the form of post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia/sleep disturbances, or psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. These rates appear lower than those of the general non-geriatric adult population based on existing studies. However, it should be noted that rates of psychiatric symptoms were established to be lower in older adults compared to their younger counterparts, even pre-pandemic. A limitation of the current literature is that the cross-sectional design of available studies does not allow us to determine whether the prevalence rates reported in older adults are increased from pre-pandemic baseline rates. Further, the reliance on online survey tools in the majority of studies may have resulted in under-reporting of psychiatric symptoms, since older adults without access to the internet may be more socially isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic than those who are able to remain in contact with family and friends using social media and video conferencing tools. Third, it should be noted that the measures employed in population studies were originally intended for screening purposes, rather than to establish a psychiatric diagnosis. Future studies comparing baseline pre-pandemic rates of psychiatric symptomatology with those following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are needed to determine the effect of the pandemic on mental health in older adults.

"Mental health of adolescents amidst preparation for university entrance exams during the second pandemic-related lockdown in Greece","This study investigated the mental health among 187 final-year-senior-high-school students during the six-months pandemic-related lockdown. Above the thresholds on GAD-7 for severe anxiety (=17) and PHQ-9 for severe depressive symptoms (=20) scored 20.3% and 20.7% respectively. Higher levels of experienced lockdown distress and increased conflicts with parents were associated with higher anxiety and depression levels;COVID-related worry was associated only with anxiety, whereas having any family health problem with depression only. Thematic analysis of the open-ended survey item provided a means of gaining studentsâ€™ perspective regarding the challenges aggravated by the pandemic during the process of preparing for the exams. The findings call to action aiming at mitigating mental health risks of the on-going pandemic on youth's mental health.","Giannopoulou, Ioanna, Efstathiou, Vasiliki, Korkoliakou, Panagiota, Triantafyllou, Georgia, Smyrnis, Nikolaos, Douzenis, Athanassios","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100339","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100339, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28699,""
"The role of alexithymia and perceived stress in mental health responses to COVID-19: A conditional process model","Background Little is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying the mental health problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothetically, perceived stress and alexithymia may be factors involved in the mental distress response to the pandemic;however, this remains largely unstudied. This study aims to explore the moderating role of alexithymia and the moderated mediation effects of perceived stress on the mental health change due to the pandemic. Methods The conditional process model was used to examine the moderated mediation. The sample consists of 659 parents from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study who completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) at 6Â months after delivery, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) at 2 or 4Â years postpartum between 2014 and 2019;and a questionnaire for pandemic events, a brief 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) and the follow-up EPDS/SCL-90 in 2020 after 3Â months from the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. Results Alexithymia moderated the perceived stress-mediated relations between the pandemic events and the changes of depressive and anxiety symptoms through enhancing the detrimental effect of perceived stress on mental health. Limitations This study was mainly limited by the causality and generalizability of the findings. Conclusions Our findings indicate the moderated mediation effects of alexithymia and perceived stress on the psychological symptoms, which has implications for understanding how and when stressful situations translate to mental health problems, identifying vulnerable individuals, and tailoring preventive and psychotherapeutic interventions.","Li, Ru, Kajanoja, Jani, Lindblom, Jallu, Korja, Riikka, Karlsson, Linnea, Karlsson, Hasse, Nolvi, Saara, Karukivi, Max","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.03.024","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders; 306:9-18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28700,""
"Follow-up of Practiced Treatment Regimens & Health Conditions of Recovered Patients of COVID-19 Residing in Dhaka City: A Survey-based Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","Objective This survey-based cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to observe the prognosis of COVID-19 cases, focusing on the symptoms, treatment, and post-recovery health conditions. Methodology The respondents were Dhaka city (Bangladesh) residents, with a RT-PCR confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus-19 from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) from October to December 2020. They were followed up 1 to 3 months after diagnosis, data were collected via Google forms directly sent through emails and were analyzed using SPSS. Participation was consensual, and confidentiality of the respondents was strictly maintained. Results Out of 3,148 recovered patients, 522 patients responded to the survey. The mean age and BMI of the respondents was 39.8Â±13 years and 26.4Â±6.5 kg/m2 respectively. Males (70.3%) were found more affected. Around 39.3% had various comorbidities. About 88.5% of the respondents suffered from various symptoms, including fever, fatigue, anosmia and aguesia, body pain, headache, dry cough, etc. for minimum 1 to 5 days. The respondents were treated with antibiotics (72.4%), antiparasitic (47.9%), antivirals (15.9%) etc. A mean of 19.7Â±7.6 days was required for respondents to become RT-PCR negative. Various symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, depression, uneasiness, body pain, dry cough, etc., persisted in 76.3% of the respondents. Conclusion For most, becoming symptom-free took longer than RT-PCR negativity.

"The Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Canadian Critical Care Nurses","Objective Focusing on Canadian critical care nurses (CCNs), the study objectives were to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on: mental health, quality of work life, and intent to stay in their current positions. Research Design Mixed-methods study using an online cross-sectional survey and integration of closed- and open-ended survey data. Setting Canadian CCNs working in an intensive care unit, high acuity unit, or intensive care step-down unit during the COVID-19 pandemic between May 2021 to June 2021. Main Outcome Measures The survey consisted of four instruments: (1) the impact of event scale â€“ revised, (2) the depression, anxiety, and stress scale, (3) the professional quality of life scale, and (4) intent to turnover tool, as well as one optional open-ended question. Results From across Canada, 425 CCNs responded. The large majority reported symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (74%), depression (70%), anxiety (57%), and stress (61%). All (100%) reported moderate to high burnout, 87% were suffering from signs of secondary traumatic stress, and 22% intended to quit their current employment. Qualitative analysis of written comments submitted by 147 (34.5%) of the respondents depicted an immense mental health toll on CCNs that stemmed from 1) failed leadership and 2) the traumatic nature of the work environment, that led to 3) a sense of disillusionment, defeat, and an intent to leave. Conclusion The mental health toll of the pandemic has been significant for Canadian CCNs and highlights the urgent need for individual supports and systems level changes.","Crowe, Sarah, Fuchsia Howard, A.; Vanderspank, Brandi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2022.103241","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Intensive and Critical Care Nursing;: 103241, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28702,""

Design/methodology/approach In the study, a deductive reasoning approach was employed, together with a self-administered questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were sent to the respondents via different social media and by email by creating a Google form link. We finally received 387 responses students aged over 18 years who had internet access in order to complete the survey. To analyze the data, structural equation modeling via AMOS was used. Findings The results showed that employment anxiety, financial worry, and knowledge on COVID-19 positively influence depression, and finally depression negatively influences the mental health of the students. Thus, our findings supported all of the proposed hypotheses. Originality/value The research enriches the existing literature pool by contributing empirical substantiation on the role of employment anxiety, financial worries and knowledge of COVID-19 in depression, and the impact of depression on mental health.","Alam, Md Ashraful, Uddin, Ahmed Ishmum, Uddin, Md Aftab, Begum, Salma, Nahar, Habibun, Raihan, Tarik, Khan, Abdul Gaffar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09111","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09111, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28703,""
"Parent time investments in their children's learning during a policy-mandated shutdown: parent, child, and household influences","State-level policies in Ohio during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States involved physical school closures and work-from-home requirements when possible. Presumably, these policies and resulting impacts on homes with children would alter parent time investments in their children with respect to home-learning activities. In this study, we assessed parent time investments specific to home-learning activities with their children, and key predictors of these investments. Using data from a comprehensive survey completed by 559 caregivers of children (aged birth to 9 years) during a state-mandated stay-at-home order and widespread school closure, we assessed whether parent time investments in children's learning were associated with: (1) parentsâ€™ mental health and social connectedness, (2) children's level of emotional distress, and (3) household characteristics including chaos, social needs, and structure. Results indicate significant negative associations between each of parent loneliness, children's emotional distress, and household chaos with parent time investments in children's learning, controlling for parentsâ€™ socio-demographic and economic status. This suggests that parent time investments during the early stages of the pandemic were limited by a number of factors outside of socioeconomic resources. Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of home environments, including parent time investments in children's learning, on child development during this unprecedented time in world history.","Singletary, Britt, Justice, Laura, Baker, Sugene C.; Lin, Tzu-Jung, Purtell, Kelly M.; Schmeer, Kammi K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2021.12.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Early Childhood Research Quarterly; 60:250-261, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28704,""
"Covid-19, pelvic health, and womenâ€™s voices: A descriptive study","Objective: To examine how the pandemic affected women with pelvic dysfunction. Methods: A Survey Monkeyâ„¢ online questionnaire on how the pandemic and Covid-19 infection affected womenâ€™s pelvic problems, exercise, and weight. A free text box captured their comments. Results: Six hundred and forty-seven women took part. Bladder control 265 (41%), prolapse 240 (37%), pelvic pain 40 (6%), sexual dysfunction 27 (4%), faecal incontinence 19 (3%) and other symptoms 56 (9%) were womenâ€™s main pelvic problems. Symptoms were unchanged for 331 (51%), worse for 243 (38%), and improved for 60 (10%). Weight was gained by 290 (45%), unchanged by 243 (38%), and lost by 114 (17%). Exercise levels were unchanged, worse, or better in 33% each. Access to medical appointments and date for surgery were difficult for 235 (36.5%) and 38 (6%) women respectively. Sixty-six (10.3%) women reported covid-19 infection: the distribution of pelvic problems and changes through the pandemic, weight and exercise patterns, and difficulty accessing a date for surgery or healthcare were similar to those not contracting infection. Sexual dysfunction was the main new or worsening problem, featuring 13 women (18%). Seventy women - 16 postnatal, and 54 with a pre-existing pelvic problem commented. Five core themes were identified. Difficulty accessing healthcare review, mental health impact and physiotherapy services especially affected delivered women: lifestyle alterations and conservative treatment tools were prominent in women with a pre-existing problem. Conclusions: Pelvic floor dysfunction adversely affected womenâ€™s mental health in the pandemic through limiting their ability to exercise. Furthermore, the pandemic exposed the fact that female pelvic health services are not readily available to those in need: many women particularly postnatally received no care. Sexual dysfunction was a feature of recovery from Covid infection in this study.","Milner, MÃ¡ire, Gamble, Miriam, Barry-Kinsella, Carole","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cont.2022.100012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Continence;: 100012, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28705,""
"Community Health Needs Assessment Data and Community Recovery From COVID-19","Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant impacts beyond physical morbidity and mortality. A mid-cycle Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) survey was administered in 1 community to generate data to evaluate change in community well-being since the beginning of the pandemic. Methods Surveys were mailed to 2,000 randomly selected Olmsted County residents. The surveys included the WHO Well-being Index (previously included in the 2018 CHNA) and new subjective questions regarding behavior change. Changes in well-being were calculated using a propensity-matched cohort and behavior change was reported as proportions of the whole. Data analysis was completed in 2021. Results Total survey respondents were 569 people in 2018 and 723 people in 2021. Well-being scores from the WHO Well-being Index showed a statistically significant decrease (effect size= â€“8.44) from 2018 to 2021. All 5 questions from the WHO Well-being Index also had an individual significant effect size decrease;the question regarding interest in life showed the greatest decrease. Individuals reported decreased subjective physical and mental well-being and increased substance use (alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco). Households also reported decreased household incomes and worse household finances since the start of the pandemic. Conclusions Using the CHNA infrastructure, 1 community was able to compare pre-pandemic to post-pandemic data, which showed decreased well-being and increased substance use and financial stress. Other public health planners can similarly conduct interval surveys based on their CHNA questionnaires in order to tailor ongoing Community Health Improvement Plan programming to post-pandemic needs and track community mental health and well-being recovery.","Molella, Robin G.; Murad, Angela L.; Sherden, Meaghan, Fritz, Derrick J.; Sadecki, Emily N.; Briggs, Graham, Wang, Zhen, Murad, M.

"Psychological symptoms and related risk factors among healthcare workers and medical students during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the mental health status of healthcare workers and medical students during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online questionnaire was administered to 637 students and 3189 healthcare workers from May to July, 2020. The patient healthcare questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and state anxiety (A-State) of the state?trait anxiety inventory-form (STAI) were used to assess depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Individuals were categorized into severe (15 or higher) depression and severe (50?51 or higher) anxiety groups. Results Healthcare workers and those taking care of COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of severe depression (PHQ-9 scores &gt;15) than other comparison groups. Students and men also had a higher risk of severe anxiety (STAI?&gt;?50?51). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that healthcare workers had a fivefold higher risk of developing severe depression symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?4.99, confidence interval [CI] 2.24?5.97, P-value?&lt;?0.001) and those taking care of COVID-19 patients had 2.8-fold higher risk of developing severe depression symptoms (OR 2.75, CI 1.36?5.53, P-value?=?0.005). Conclusion Both medical students and healthcare workers have been experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms during the first wave of the pandemic. Our findings showed a high rate of severe anxiety symptoms in medical students and a high rate of severe depression symptoms in healthcare workers. Those who treated COVID-19 patients were at greater risk of developing major depressive disorder than those who treated non-COVID-19 patients.","Tanifuji, Takaki, Aoyama, Shinsuke, Shinko, Yutaka, Mouri, Kentaro, Kim, Saehyeon, Satomi-Kobayashi, Seimi, Shinohara, Masakazu, Kawano, Seiji, Sora, Ichiro","https://doi.org/10.1002/pcn5.5","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences Reports; 1(1):e5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28707,""

"Health anxiety model of cyberchondria, fears, obsessions, sleep quality, and negative affect during COVID-19","The aim of the study was to explore the relationships among cyberchondria, fear of COVID-19, health anxiety, obsessions, sleep quality, and negative affect in a national community sample of Turkish participants. A sample of 8,276 volunteers, aged between 18 and 65, were recruited via an online platform. The Perceived Vulnerability about Diseases Questionnaire, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Cyberchondria Severity Scale, Short Health Anxiety Inventory, Depression Stress Anxiety Scale-21, Obsessiveâ€“Compulsive Inventoryâ€“Revised, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were completed by participants. Data were analyzed using mixture structural equation modelling approach. Results revealed that perceived vulnerability to disease was found to be positively related with cyberchondria, poor sleep quality, health anxiety, and obsessiveâ€“compulsive symptoms. Negative affect was positively associated with obsessiveâ€“compulsive symptoms, fears of COVID-19, cyberchondria severity, and poor sleep quality. Additionally, fear of COVID-19 was positively related to health anxiety. Also, cyberchondria severity was found to be positively associated with poor sleep quality and obsessiveâ€“compulsive symptoms. Mixture analysis classified participants into six latent classes: 1) Risk-Aversive Healthy Group, 2) Incautious Healthy Group, 3) Infection Obsessions Group, 4) Health Anxiety Group, 5) Negative Affect Group, and 6) General Psychopathology Group. The national survey data showed that perceived vulnerability to diseases, negative affect, fear of COVID-19, cyberchondria, health anxiety, obsessiveâ€“compulsive symptoms, and sleep quality appeared to be at the center of pandemic health anxiety.","YalÃ§in, &Iacute;lhan, Boysan, Murat, Eskisu, Mustafa, Ã‡am, Zekeriya","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+anxiety+model+of+cyberchondria,+fears,+obsessions,+sleep+quality,+and+negative+affect+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Current psychology (New Brunswick, N.J.);: 1-18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28712,""
"Treatment of COVID-19 anxiety by auricular points : A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: In December 2019, a series of acute, atypical respiratory diseases was identified in Wuhan, China. The source of the illnesses was attributed to a novel coronavirus, named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent disease it causes was named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Methods: According to the retrieval strategies, randomized controlled trials on auricular points for anxiety in patients with coronavirus 2019 will be obtained from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, regardless of publication date or language. Studies will be screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the literature. The network meta-analysis will be performed with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and carried out with Stata 14.2 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 software. Ultimately, the quality of the evidence obtained from the results will be evaluated. Results: This study will evaluate whether auricular points can effectively treat anxiety in patients with COVID-19.

"Hope and uncertainty The subjective experience of the body during COVID-19 pandemic","The paper is about Marica, a patient diagnosed with a severe form of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This condition necessitated a sequel of surgical procedures on her face that led to a real transformation of her face's sensory balance and to sensory changes in other parts of her body. The impairment of affective regulation and of her subjective experience of her body followed and generated in her a depressive withdrawal and a deep psychic pain. Moreover, Mrs. M. was forced to cover her face with a mask. This condition, especially her use of a face mask and her social withdrawal, intersected with the month of March 2020 and the explosion of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy and in the world. During our sessions, we explored the change in her feelings of shame and mortification in being seen in the hopes of helping her gain more positive regulation. The emotional derailment in being seen that had so far damaged her subjective feeling of ""inhabiting her own body"" found an emotional holding in the experience of mandatory face mask wearing and the lockdown. These requirements favored our on-line remote sessions and gave rise to new and generative narratives.

"Pediatric bullying and victimization: Quality improvement project in a primary care setting","Bullying is a form of aggression characterized by repeated psychological or physical oppression, which negatively impacts children. More recently, the phenomenon of cyberbullying, or electronic bullying, has become prevalent. Despite efforts by schools to address forms of bullying, young people continue to be victimized. Primary care settings are well placed to address these issues with patients and their families to improve care and outcomes. Screenings and mental health referrals by physicians have been shown to reduce future involvement in bullying and increase access to treatment. When thinking about healthcare improvements in primary care settings, screening has been shown to be useful for addressing concerns that might not have otherwise come up. Prior to the current study, young adolescent patients were going to be screened for bullying during well-child visits and invited for follow-up. Due to the changes in primary care practice caused by the response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, well-child visits were canceled, requiring that the focus of the study be to explore physicians' perspectives. The current study aimed to explore physicians' attitudes and beliefs regarding bullying through a qualitative approach with the use of semi-structured individual interviews with primary care providers from one practice. Thematic analysis was conducted. The results yielded providers' impressions and beliefs about screening for bullying, indicating the utility of screening as a successful tool to gather more information on adolescent victimization to help patients and families address these concerns. Implications, limitations, and future research ideas are also explored.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare leaders: a cross-sectional survey in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy","Introduction Although several studies highlighted the psychological burden of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, no data are available regarding professionals leading healthcare organisations. This study aims to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare leaders (HeLs), along with the leadership skills and coping strategies needed for successful leadership. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy) between October and November 2020. We assessed the presence of depressive symptoms (DS), anxiety symptoms (AS), perceived stress (PS) and insomnia using internationally validated tools. Coping strategies and skills needed to overcome the crisis were examined, along with the most challenging phases. Results A total of 48 HeLs participated. The prevalence of DS and AS was 14.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Moderate and severe insomnia was found in 12.5% and 6.3% of them, respectively. Leaders showed moderate (45.8%) and high 4,2%) level of PS. The two most challenging phases were recognised in early recognition (45.2%) and peak phase (31.0%). Concerning healthcare leadersâ€™ skills required to manage with pandemic, the most reported were communication (35.1%) and decision-making (25.5%). Conclusion The high level of PS, insomnia, DS and AS experienced by healthcare leaders shows the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s psychological impact. The two most challenging phases identified enhances the importance of public health surveillance and monitoring systems, and communication appeared a critical success skill for healthcare leaders. Given the key role these professional play in addressing the current crisis in healthcare organisations, their mental health and well-being deserve greater attention.","Scarpis, Enrico, Bravo, Giulia, Cocconi, Roberto, Brunelli, Laura","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+impact+of+COVID-19+on+healthcare+leaders:+a+cross-sectional+survey+in+Friuli-Venezia+Giulia,+Italy","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Leader;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28716,""
"Psychological problems and post-traumatic stress disorders in Italian university students during the first lockdown from Covid-19 and online EMDR therapy","The literature has highlighted psychological disorders during the Covid-19 lockdown. A research was conducted with 49 students who contacted the Psychological Counseling Center of the University of Salerno between March and May 2020. The objectives were: a) to investigate the psychological disorders and in particular of PTSD;b) evaluate the effectiveness of a short course with online EMDR protocol for those students with PTSD linked to the reactivation of previous trauma following pandemic stress and lockdown. The data collected in the pre and post treatment phase (with psychological interview and the SCL-90-R Scale scoring) show: PTSD (25%), anxiety and stress (100%), depression (88%). In post-EMDR treatment, a reduction in cut-offs from clinical to regulatory range was highlighted on the IES-R Scale and at SCL-90-R scale a shift from clinically significant scores on the syndromic scale to normative scores. In particular, on the SCL-90-R Scale, the score on the Global Severity Index-GSI, a global indicator of the current intensity of psychic distress perceived by the subject, confirms, in the post-test, the achievement of a regulatory clinical framework.

Objective: identify negative emotional experiences in students from three vulnerable communes of the Metropolitan Region of Chile during this period. Methods: 3,570 students between 10 and 18 years of age from 50 public educational establishments completed an evaluation instrument of socioemotional conditions through an online platform. The average age was 12.65 (D.S=1.90) and 52.5% identified with the male gender. Data were analyzed through the chi(2) test and Latent Class Analysis. Results: the most experienced emotions were loneliness and fear, the least frequent was boredom. Four types of negative emotional experiences were found: (1) the experience of loneliness (7%);(2) the combined experience of worry, fear, and loneliness (35.4%);(3) the generalized experience of negative emotions (9.6%) and (4) the experience low frequency of negative emotions (48.1%).

"Income assistance, marriage, and child poverty: An assessment of the Family Security Act<U+2606>","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about changes in key income support programs, reigniting a debate about the design of financial aid to low-income households with children. This study assesses the Family Security Actâ€”a proposal presented by Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) on February 4, 2021 to reform the tax/transfer systemâ€”in terms of its efficacy to achieve the stated objectives of increasing marriage rates and cutting child poverty at no cost to the government. The assessment is carried out through a structural microsimulation approach, using a dynamic model of savings, labor supply, household formation, and marital status. We find that while the plan would be highly effective at increasing marriage rates, it would reduce child poverty at the expense of increasing poverty among single-mother families and deep child poverty. Furthermore, the plan would entail a substantial cost to taxpayers.

"Qualitative impact assessment of COVID-19 on the pedagogical, technological and social experiences of higher education students in Taiwan","COVID-19 has imposed a rippling effect on educational institutions globally, substantially impacting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries. Recognizing Taiwan as an atypicality during this crisis for suffering from a relatively moderate mortality/morbidity compared with the rest of the world, the present paper qualitatively explores the pedagogical, technological and social impact of COVID-19 on higher education students in Taiwan. Employing the focus group discussion methodology, we recruited a cohort of 23 students, comprising of 15 local and 8 international students. Findings show diverse pedagogical experiences in studentsâ€™ instructional modalities. Trending by either discipline of study, students from Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines expressed a greater preference for face-to-face instruction compared to their humanities counterparts. Distance learners reported a decrease in study efficacy and a lack of sense of belongingness to their university. All students demonstrated a high sense of perceived safety and reported minimal changes in their socializing norms during the pandemic. In terms of career planning, local students expressed minimal concerns about potential changes in their careers, versus international students who expressed high degrees of uncertainty, fear and pessimism in the same regard.","Morgan, Cyleen, Tsai, Meng-Che, Hsu, Chiehwen Ed, Chow, Hsueh-Wen, Guo, How-Ran, Lee, Meng-Hsueh","https://www.google.com/search?q=Qualitative+impact+assessment+of+COVID-19+on+the+pedagogical,+technological+and+social+experiences+of+higher+education+students+in+Taiwan","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education and information technologies;: 1-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28721,""

[...]hope significantly increased in 2020. According to Riley et al., even before the pandemic levels of hope varied across the country, with some parts of the country experiencing declines in hope. In the past few years, the phrase ""deaths of despair"" has been used to describe the declines in US life expectancy and increases in deaths from suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol use.7 Despair-the absence of hope-has been linked to numerous poor health outcomes and increased mortality.

"An Immunologic Storm: A Case of Encephalitis and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura With Underlying Likely Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome Induced by a COVID-19 Immune Response","Introduction There are rare cases of Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome presenting with manifestations of encephalitis. There are also rare patients with Sjogrenâ€™s presenting with acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). There are no cases of both occurring together as the only symptoms of the syndrome. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more cases of autoimmunity are being described given its robust immune response. It is important to keep a wide differential about these varying clinical presentations. Case Presentation Our patient is a 19-year-old female with a history of menorrhagia, recent COVID-19 infection, and remote suicidal ideation. She presented with headaches, vomiting, and psychosis. Her labs found platelets of 12,000 and she was soon discovered to have TTP. She was found to have contrast enhancing lesions scattered in her left hemisphere on magnetic resonance imaging as well as seizures. Her workup was negative for infection, but labs revealed a positive antinuclear antibody, elevated anti-Ro antibody (anti-SSA) and anti-La antibody (anti-SSB), and elevated COVID-19 antibodies. She was treated with antiepileptics, pulse dose steroids for 5Â days, plasmapheresis, and weekly rituximab for 4Â weeks. She had significant clinical improvement. Conclusion Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome can have varying presentations including TTP with or without encephalitis as a presenting feature. Autoimmunity can also be triggered from COVID-19 infection.","Kasturiarachi, Brittany M.; Alsbrook, Diana L.; Crook, Jennifer, Shah, Namrata","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+Immunologic+Storm:+A+Case+of+Encephalitis+and+Thrombotic+Thrombocytopenic+Purpura+With+Underlying+Likely+Sjogrenâ€™s+Syndrome+Induced+by+a+COVID-19+Immune+Response","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Neurohospitalist;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28723,""

"Pregnancy during a pandemic: How stress affects pregnant women and the development of their babies during COVID-19","Prenatal maternal distress has a negative impact on the course of pregnancy, fetal development, offspring development, and later psychopathologies. The study aimed to understand the guidelines and recommendations related to the prevention and management of the prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology of pregnant women during COVID-19 Pandemic. This paper is a review based on information found in specialty literature. The analysis was limited to English language articles and guidelines published between January 1, 2003 and October 14, 2020 on PubMed using the next keywords: perinatal mental health, anxiety, coronavirus disease 2019, depression, mental health, pregnancy, prenatal, post-traumatic stress disorder. In this review we discuss about the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and an uptrend in psychological distress and psychiatric symptomatology in pregnant women. Pregnant women are experiencing substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic that are in a close relationship to COVID-19 specific problems about threats to their own lives, their baby's health, not getting enough prenatal care, and social isolation. A significant number of studies correlate maternal stress during pregnancy with atypical fetal development, in a way that increases susceptibility to disease and maladaptation in children. Several research groups have used elevated prenatal anxiety as an indicator to suggest prenatal stress, relating to the correlation with cognitive, behavioral, and neurological disorders in children. Protective resilience factors can be social support and physical activity. There is an urgent need to support pregnant women during this critical time to mitigate long-term negative outcomes, given the known effects of stress in pregnancy, infant and child outcomes.

Studiul a urmarit sa inteleaga liniile directoare si recomandarile legate de prevenirea si gestionarea stresului prenatal si a simptomatologiei psihiatrice a femeilor insarcinate in timpul pandemiei COVID-19. Aceasta lucrare este o recenzie bazata pe informatiile din literatura de specialitate. Analiza s-a limitat la articolele si ghidurile in limba engleza publicate in perioada 1 ianuarie 2003 - 14 octombrie 2020 pe PubMed folosind urmatoarele cuvinte-cheie: sanatate mintala perinatala, anxietate, boala coronavirus 2019, depresie, sanatate mintala, sarcina, prenatal, tulburare de stres posttraumatica. In aceasta revizuire, discutam despre asocierea dintre pandemia COVID-19 si o tendinta ascendenta a stresului psihologic si a simptomatologiei psihiatrice la femeile gravide. Femeile gravide se confrunta cu simptome crescute de anxietate si depresie in timpul pandemiei COVID-19, care sunt intr-o relatie stransa cu problemele specifice COVID-19 legate de amenintarile la adresa vietii lor, sanatatea bebelusului lor, neacordarea unei ingrijiri prenatale suficiente si izolarea sociala. Un numar insemnat de studii coreleaza stresul matern din timpul sarcinii cu dezvoltarea atipica fetala, intr-o maniera in care creste sensibilitatea la boli si inadaptarea, la copii. Mai multe grupuri de cercetare au folosit nivelul crescut de anxietate prenatala ca indicator pentru a sugera stresul prenatal, raportandu-se la corelatia cu tulburarile cognitive, comportamentale si neurologice la copii. Factorii protectivi, de rezilienta pot fi sprijinul social si activitatea fizica. Exista o nevoie urgenta de a sprijini femeile insarcinate in acest moment critic, pentru a atenua rezultatele negative pe termen lung, avand in vedere efectele cunoscute ale stresului in sarcina, pentru fat si, ulterior, pentru copil.

"Income and social support related with mental health during COVID-19 outbreak in China","To investigate psychological response of Chinese public during the regular prevention and control of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and explore the relationship among income loss, social support and mental health. Five hundred twenty-six participants were randomly selected by snowball sampling method. Chinese version of Perceived Psychological Stress Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, self-rating anxiety scale, and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 were used to measure the levels of psychological stress, social support, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Demographic variables, income loss and income satisfaction during the outbreak period were also collected. The prevalence rate of anxiety, PTSD symptoms and stress problems were 19.8%, 23.8%, and 24.7% respectively. Multiple Regression Analysis illustrated that social support associated with stress, anxiety and PTSD after controlling demographic variables;for non-student samples, stress, anxiety, and PTSD were corelated with change in income and social support. During the regular prevention and control of COVID-19, social support might help reducing stress, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. In addition to social support, change of income level was also an important factor for mental health. This study suggested the importance of maintaining a steady income after acute outbreak of COVID-19.","Huang, Chenwei, Feng, Qiyun, Zhang, Borui, Ren, Huiguang, Liu, Zihao, Kang, Yuwei, Zhang, Fan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Income+and+social+support+related+with+mental+health+during+COVID-19+outbreak+in+China","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicine; 101(10), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28726,""

"BLACK MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS: BRIDGING THE MENTAL HEALTH GAP IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY","De Freitas et al discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism are impacting Black mental health. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, more data regarding testing, infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates are becoming available, shedding light on the disparate ways the crisis is affecting specific demographic groups. The move to online learning because of COVID-19 revealed a digital divide that has led to unequal educational access for poor and minoritized students. Despite the assumption that such overt racist practices would be socially unacceptable nowadays, the impacts of harmful attitudes or behaviors toward Black students continue to lead to disastrous health outcomes. Awareness about mental health access disparities is a foundational step for achieving healthcare equity, and it must be addressed. Meanwhile, a lesson plan is presented which aims to help increase student awareness regarding these important issues.","de Freitas, Erika Lourenco, Franco, Ashley, Teasdell, Annette","https://www.google.com/search?q=BLACK+MENTAL+HEALTH+MATTERS:+BRIDGING+THE+MENTAL+HEALTH+GAP+IN+THE+BLACK+COMMUNITY","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Black History Bulletin; 84(2):18, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28728,""
"Relationship between room acoustics with voice symptoms and voice-related quality of life among Colombian school and college teachers during online classes in times of COVID-19 pandemic","Aim : To determine the relationship between working conditions, especially room acoustics, with voice symptoms and voice-related quality of life among Colombian school and college teachers during online classes in times of COVID-19 pandemic. Method : Exploratory cross-sectional study. Participants were thirty-two primary, secondary and university Colombian teachers, who were invited to fill in an online survey about working conditions and voice symptoms during online classes in times of COVID-19 pandemic. In the statistical analysis, four dependent variables and eight independent variables were defined. We used Generalized Linear Model with a Gamma distribution and Binary Logistic Regression to determine the association between voice with working conditions. Results : High reverberation time and stress during online classes in times of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced slightly the VRQOL scores. For Factor 3 of the VFI, high reverberation time and months teaching online classes were associated at the multivariate analysis. Stress and years of experience were statistically associated with an increased odds of reporting hoarseness. Conclusion : Similar to pre-COVID-19, teachers with online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic are affected by two work-related factors namely high reverberation time and stress. These two factors are increasing their likelihood of reporting hoarseness and having lower voice-related quality of life, which may confirm the relationship between reverberation, stress, and voice also during online classes. This highlights the need of implementing workplace vocal and mental health programs to decrease the occurrence of voice problems among teachers in times of and post-COVID-19 pandemic.","Catherine, Cantor-Cutiva Lady","https://www.google.com/search?q=Relationship+between+room+acoustics+with+voice+symptoms+and+voice-related+quality+of+life+among+Colombian+school+and+college+teachers+during+online+classes+in+times+of+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28729,""
"The impact of the fear of COVID-19 on stress levels and anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents","The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to the adolescents' mental health and psychological well-being because of the impact of social distancing measures. The study aimed to analyze the levels of fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as the impact of depression on psychological well-being during the first Italian national lockdown among a sample of Italian adolescents. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 345 adolescents (aged 15-19 years). The results confirm that fear of COVID-19 was positively associated with stress and anxiety symptoms. Anxiety mediated the relationship between depression and stress.

"Digging deeper: Investigating the emotional impact of online learning on university students during COVID19 in Greece","The paper investigates the emotional impact online learning had on university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. For this purpose, a quantitative research was conducted in which 83 university students answered a questionnaire. The results indicated that, although the students feel confident with their technological skills and the support they have received in online learning and trust their professors, they are not satisfied with this kind of instruction. Dissatisfaction is associated with long hours spent attending online classes. Students who had not been used to face-to-face instruction prior to the pandemic are more overwhelmed by their professors' expectations in online learning as opposed to their peers who had some familiarization with the latter. A connection was found between stress and deteriorated academic performance, while the participants reported struggling to balance their personal and university life and feeling frustrated that they cannot see their classmates due to turned-off cameras. This led to feelings of loneliness, which was associated with low motivation. Anxiety, exam- and workload-related stress, isolation, and compromised mental health were among the recurring issues. Nevertheless, bonding with the professors and enjoying the flexibility of online learning were highlighted, while the study gave voice to socially anxious students who embraced online learning.","Alexiou, Thomai, Michalopoulou, Theologia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Digging+deeper:+Investigating+the+emotional+impact+of+online+learning+on+university+students+during+COVID19+in+Greece","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research Papers in Language Teaching and Learning; 12(1):44-55, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28731,""

"COVID-19 and its impact on the brain and Mind- A conceptual model and supporting evidence","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that is causing the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, was first reported in late 2019. Since then, an unprecedented amount of new knowledge has emerged about this virus and its treatment. Although the reported symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily respiratory with acute respiratory distress syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to affect other organs, including brain, and there are growing reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms due to COVID-19. There are two suggested pathways for how COVID-19 can affect the brain and mind: the direct impact on the brain and impact mediated via stress. Direct impact on the brain is manifested as encephalitis/encephalopathy with altered mental status (AMS) and delirium. In this paper, we summarize evidence from studies of previous outbreaks and current data from the COVID-19 pandemic that describe how COVID-19 is associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression among the general population during the pandemic. In addition, we summarize the current evidence that supports how COVID-19 can also impact the CNS directly and result in delirium, cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, unspecified encephalopathy, AMS, or peripheral neurologic disorders.","Saeed, Pastis, Santos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09980-9","20220318","COVID-19; Cerebrovascular events; Mental health; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Psychiatric disorder; SARS-CoV-2; Stress response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28734,""
"Using nominal group technique among resident physicians to identify key attributes of a burnout prevention program","To identify preferred burnout interventions within a resident physician population, utilizing the Nominal Group Technique. The results will be used to design a discrete choice experiment study to inform the development of resident burnout prevention programs. Three resident focus groups met (10-14 participants/group) to prioritize a list of 23 factors for burnout prevention programs. The Nominal Group Technique consisted of three steps: an individual, confidential ranking of the 23 factors by importance from 1 to 23, a group discussion of each attribute, including a group review of the rankings, and an opportunity to alter the original ranking across participants. The total number of residents (36) were a representative sample of specialty, year of residency, and sex. There was strong agreement about the most highly rated attributes which grouped naturally into themes of autonomy, meaning, competency and relatedness. There was also disagreement on several of the attributes that is likely due to the differences in residency specialty and subsequently rotation requirements. This study identified the need to address multiple organizational factors that may lead to physician burnout. There is a clear need for complex interventions that target systemic and program level factors rather than focus on individual interventions. These results may help residency program directors understand the specific attributes of a burnout prevention program valued by residents. Aligning burnout interventions with resident preferences could improve the efficacy of burnout prevention programs by improving adoption of, and satisfaction with, these programs. Physician burnout is a work-related syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment [1]. Burnout is present in epidemic proportions and was estimated to occur in over 50 percent of practicing physicians and in up to 89 percent of resident physicians pre-COVID 19. The burnout epidemic is growing; a recent national survey of US physicians reported an 8.9 percent increase in burnout between 2011 and 2014 [2]. Rates of physician burnout have also increased [3] during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new classification of ""pandemic burnout"" experienced by over 52 percent of healthcare workers as early as June of 2020 [4]. Physician burnout can lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and relationship problems that may progress to substance abuse, increased interpersonal conflicts, broken relationships, low quality of life, major depression, and suicide [5-7]. The estimated rate of physician suicide is 300-400 annually [8-10].","Nelson, Dubov, Morton, Fraenkel","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264921","20220318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28735,""
"Internalizing symptoms and family functioning predict adolescent depressive symptoms during COVID-19: A longitudinal study in a community sample","The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown pose a threat for adolescents' mental health, especially for those with an earlier vulnerability. Accordingly, these adolescents may need increased support from family and friends. This study investigated whether family functioning and peer connectedness protects adolescents with earlier internalizing or externalizing symptoms from increased depressive symptoms during the first Dutch COVID-19 lockdown in a low-risk community sample. This sample comprised 115 adolescents (Mage = 13.06; 44% girls) and their parents (N = 111) and is part of an ongoing prospective study on child development. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were self-reported a year before the COVID-19 lockdown. In an online survey during the first Dutch lockdown (April-May 2020), adolescents reported depressive symptoms and perceived peer connectedness, and parents reported family functioning. Twenty-four percent of adolescents reported clinically relevant symptoms of depression during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Depressive symptoms were significantly predicted by earlier internalizing, but not externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, higher quality of family functioning, but not peer connectedness, predicted fewer adolescent depressive symptoms. Family functioning and peer connectedness did not moderate the link between pre-existing internalizing symptoms and later depressive symptoms. In a low-risk community sample, one-in-four adolescents reported clinically relevant depressive symptoms at the first COVID-19 lockdown. Higher earlier internalizing symptoms and lower quality of family functioning increased risks.

"Effects of COVID-19 on Physical Activity and Its Relationship to Mental Health in a US Community Sample","COVID-19 restrictions may make it difficult for people to engage in the recommended amounts of physical activity (PA). The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA, as well as the links between PA and mental health, were investigated in this study. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling and responded to an online survey between April 15 and July 1, 2021, with ages ranging from 18-24 (40.9% of the sample) to Ã¢â€°Â¥55 (7.4%). To assess general psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and pandemic anxiety, a battery of mental health assessments was used. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form was used to collect PA data from participants, who were then classified as inactive, minimally active, or highly active. Participants also indicated the locations where they performed PA before and during COVID-19. A sample of 381 individuals was included in this research. The logistic regression analysis results were interpreted as odds ratios (ORs), where an OR higher than one indicated a greater chance of an event occurring, and an OR less than one implied a lower likelihood of an event occurring. Logistic regression results revealed that inactive individuals were more likely to develop psychological distress (OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.27-3.69, P=.004), depression (OR=3.81, 95% CI 1.92-7.57, P&lt;.001) and anxiety (OR=1.86, 95% CI 0.99-3.47, P=.052), as compared to highly active individuals. Furthermore, when compared to highly active people, those who were only minimally active had a higher risk of depression (OR=2.14, 95% CI 0.99-3.47, P=.04). Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests revealed that COVID-19 had a greater impact on reducing the chances of less active individuals engaging in PA outside and in public spaces. Highly active people's physical exercise locations had changed less, and their exercise frequency at home increased. Programmatic and policy interventions geared particularly towards enhancing PA among those less active may be a helpful strategy for addressing the worldwide pandemic's mental health crisis.","Zhang, Velez","https://doi.org/10.2196/32387","20220318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28737,""
"Mask Mandate's Effect on Job Loss Expectation and Mental Health in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Uncertainty around economic recovery from a pandemic, in addition to restrictions on mobility and socializing, can be isolating and stressful. While preventive measures, such as mask mandates, are expected to mitigate spread of the disease and lower concerns of future job loss, state- and local-level mandates could signal that infection rates are worse in the mandated areas and decrease consumer confidence and mobility. Thus, the association between mask mandates and psychological well-being is unclear. Twenty-five states in the United States implemented statewide mask mandates early in the pandemic. This study seeks to examine the effect of mask mandates on self-reported job loss expectation and mental health. This study analyzes U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey data, collected between April 23rd and July 21st, 2020. Using a panel subset of the data, fixed effects models are estimated to understand statewide mask mandate's effect on psychological well-being over a twelve-week period while controlling for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. All data are then state-aggregated, and fixed effects models are estimated to examine average differences in job loss expectation and mental health between mandate and non-mandate states. In the individual-level panel data, job loss expectation was lower by 1.1 percentage point by the second week of a statewide mask mandate and by 1.6 percentage point by the third week, compared to average job loss expectation in states without a mask mandate and to the mandate states before the policy implementation. Average job loss expectation was 6.5 percentage point lower by the twelfth week in the five states that were the first to implement statewide mask mandates. Mental health status improved steadily from the fourth week on in states with a mask mandate. Analysis of state-aggregated data indicates considerable variability and lack of uniformity in mask mandates' impact on job loss expectation and mental health status. Local-level mandates, such as those at the county-level, could not be identified in these data. The impact of a mask mandate could be underestimated when only state-level mandates are considered, and local regulations are excluded. This is a limitation of this study. The staggered state-by-state approach to implementing mask mandates and the considerable variability in enforcement of mask rules has possibly contributed to lack of uniformity and consistency in how mask mandates impact subjective psychological well-being. The lack of statistically significant impact of statewide mask mandates on the two outcome variables in the state-aggregated data, and on long-run job loss expectation in the individual-level panel data, could be indicative of the complexities of effective science communication regarding behavioral recommendations to promote overall well-being. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has emerged around the world. Further research could more clearly assess the degree to which communicating public health implications of these variants has evolved, and whether it has elicited behavior change and affected psychological well-being.","Mandal","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mask+Mandate's+Effect+on+Job+Loss+Expectation+and+Mental+Health+in+the+United+States+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20220318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28738,""
"Digital health to support primary care provision during a global pandemic","The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia has seen the implementation of digital health technologies to support continuity of high-quality primary care provision. Digital health innovation has been used to operationalise the nation's pandemic preparedness principles by reducing risk of infection to both healthcare workers and at-risk patients, sustaining care for chronic and acute health conditions, and supporting the mental health of the population. In this perspective piece, we document the Australian Federal government's digital health response to ensure the ongoing delivery of high-quality primary care. This includes the implementation of telehealth, point-of-care testing, electronic records and e-prescriptions, national primary care data collection and analysis, and digital communication. Digital health has been a critical element of the pandemic response and paves the way for future primary care provision during disasters and emergencies. Further research is needed to capture the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of these innovations for both patients and primary care practitioners.","Sturgiss, Desborough, Hall Dykgraaf, Matenge, Dut, Davis, de Toca, Kelly, Kidd","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH21263","20220318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28739,""
"Coping with COVID: risk and resilience factors for mental health in a German representative panel study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic might affect mental health. Data from population-representative panel surveys with multiple waves including pre-COVID data investigating risk and protective factors are still rare. In a stratified random sample of the German household population (n = 6684), we conducted survey-weighted multiple linear regressions to determine the association of various psychological risk and protective factors assessed between 2015 and 2020 with changes in psychological distress [(PD; measured via Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4)] from pre-pandemic (average of 2016 and 2019) to peri-pandemic (both 2020 and 2021) time points. Control analyses on PD change between two pre-pandemic time points (2016 and 2019) were conducted. Regularized regressions were computed to inform on which factors were statistically most influential in the multicollinear setting. PHQ-4 scores in 2020 (M = 2.45) and 2021 (M = 2.21) were elevated compared to 2019 (M = 1.79). Several risk factors (catastrophizing, neuroticism, and asking for instrumental support) and protective factors (perceived stress recovery, positive reappraisal, and optimism) were identified for the peri-pandemic outcomes. Control analyses revealed that in pre-pandemic times, neuroticism and optimism were predominantly related to PD changes. Regularized regression mostly confirmed the results and highlighted perceived stress recovery as most consistent influential protective factor across peri-pandemic outcomes. We identified several psychological risk and protective factors related to PD outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparison of pre-pandemic data stresses the relevance of longitudinal assessments to potentially reconcile contradictory findings. Implications and suggestions for targeted prevention and intervention programs during highly stressful times such as pandemics are discussed.","Riepenhausen, Veer, Wackerhagen, Reppmann, KÃƒÂ¶ber, Ayuso-Mateos, BÃƒÂ¶gemann, Corrao, Felez-Nobrega, Abad, Hermans, van Leeuwen, Lieb, Lorant, Mary-Krause, Mediavilla, Melchior, Mittendorfer-Rutz, Compagnoni, Pan, Puhlmann, Roelofs, Sijbrandij, Smith, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Witteveen, Zerban, Kalisch, KrÃƒÂ¶ger, Walter","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722000563","20220318","COVID-19; mental health; psychological distress; resilience; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28740,""
"Electrocardiogram-based mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 using machine learning","The electrocardiogram (ECG) is frequently obtained in the work-up of COVID-19 patients. So far, no study has evaluated whether ECG-based machine learning models have added value to predict in-hospital mortality specifically in COVID-19 patients. Using data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry, we studied 882 patients admitted with COVID-19 across seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Raw format 12-lead ECGs recorded within 72Ã¢â‚¬Â¯h of admission were studied. With data from five hospitals (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°634), three models were developed: (a)Ã‚Â aÃ‚Â logistic regression baseline model using age and sex, (b)Ã‚Â aÃ‚Â least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model using age, sex and human annotated ECG features, and (c)Ã‚Â aÃ‚Â pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) using age, sex and the raw ECG waveforms. Data from two hospitals (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°248) was used for external validation. Performances for modelsÃ‚Â a, b andÃ‚Â c were comparable with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.79), 0.76 (95% CI 0.68-0.82) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.83) respectively. Predictors of mortality in the LASSO model were age, low QRS voltage, ST depression, premature atrial complexes, sex, increased ventricular rate, and right bundle branch block. This study shows that the ECG-based prediction models could be helpful for the initial risk stratification of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and that several ECG abnormalities are associated with in-hospital all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, this proof-of-principle study shows that the use of pre-trained DNNs for ECG analysis does not underperform compared with time-consuming manual annotation of ECG features.","van de Leur, Bleijendaal, Taha, Mast, Gho, Linschoten, van Rees, Henkens, Heymans, Sturkenboom, Tio, Offerhaus, Bor, Maarse, Haerkens-Arends, Kolk, van der Lingen, Selder, Wierda, van Bergen, Winter, Zwinderman, Doevendans, van der Harst, Pinto, Asselbergs, van Es, Tjong","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-022-01670-2","20220318","Arrhythmia; COVID-19; Deep learning; Electrocardiogram; Machine learning; Mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28741,""

"Towards a better understanding of disparities in overdose mortality","The United States has been in the grip of an epidemic of drug overdose mortality for the past few decades; deaths from drug overdose increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Townsend et al. (Am J Epidemiol. XXXX;XXX(XX):XXXX-XXXX) add to the growing literature highlighting the steep rise of drug overdose mortality among racial and ethnic minorities in the country. Using data from National Center for Health Statistics death certificates and employing principles of small area estimation and a Bayesian hierarchical model to stabilize the estimates of smaller racial/ethnic groups and states, the authors found that combinations of opioid/stimulant drug overdose deaths saw a steep increase among racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black Americans between 2007 and 2019. The results from their analysis highlight the need to change the narrative around opioid deaths, to invest in targeted policies that address the growing burden of drug overdose faced by racial/ethnic minorities, and the importance of using innovative methods to address limitations to data disaggregation. The paper also demonstrates the importance of a holistic view of the challenges to the health of the American public.","Abdalla, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwac053","20220318","health disparities; opioids; overdose; stimulants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28743,""

Methods We carried out a multi-center cross-sectional study via snowball sampling and convenience sampling of the college students in different areas of China.The rates of self-reported depression,anxiety,and stress and post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD)were assessed via the 21-item Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale(DASS-21)and the 6-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised(IES-6),respectively.Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics,health-related data,and information of the social environment.Data pertaining to mental health service seeking were also collected.Multivariate Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors. Results A total of 3641 valid questionnaires were collected from college students.At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak,535(14.69%)students had negative emotions,among which 402(11.04%),381(10.49%),and 171(4.90%)students had the symptoms of depression,anxiety,and stress,respectively.Meanwhile,1245(34.19%)college students had PTSD.Among the risk factors identified,male gender was associated with a lower likelihood of reporting depression symptoms(<i>AOR</i>=0.755,<i>P</i>=0.037],and medical students were at higher risk of depression and stress symptoms than liberal arts students(<i>AOR</i>=1.497,<i>P</i>=0.003;<i>AOR</i>=1.494,<i>P</i>=0.045).Family support was associated with lower risks of negative emotions and PTSD in college students(<i>AOR</i>=0.918,<i>P</i>&lt;0.001;<i>AOR</i>=0.913,<i>P</i>&lt;0.001;<i>AOR</i>=0.899,<i>P</i>&lt;0.001;<i>AOR</i>=0.971,<i>P</i>=0.021). Conclusions College students were more sensitive to public health emergencies,and the incidence of negative emotions and PTSD was significantly higher than that before the outbreak of COVID-19.More attention should be paid to female college students who were more likely to develop negative emotions.We should strengthen positive and proper propaganda via mass media and help college students understand the situation and impact of COVID-19.Furthermore,we should enhance family support for college students.The government and relevant agencies need to provide appropriate mental health services to the students under similar circumstances to avoid the deterioration of their mental well-being.","Wang, Si, Su, Huang, Xiao, Wang, Gu, Ma, Li, Zhang, Ren, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.14144","20220318","associated factors; coronavirus disease 2019; negative emotion; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28744,""
"Feeling the burn in the era of COVID-19: cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Arabic version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory among community pharmacists","Community pharmacists (CPs) are one of the frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) working diligently to provide much-needed services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout was one of the detrimental outcomes of the pandemic on the mental health of Lebanese CPs. To assess the extent of this syndrome among Lebanese CPs, a psychometrically reliable and valid tool is needed. This study aimed to validate the Arabic version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI-A) for use in the assessment of burnout among CPs. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Lebanese CPs over February 2021. Data were collected using an anonymous Arabic self-administered questionnaire that includes information on socio-demographic characteristics, work-related variables, in addition to the measurements: the CBI which includes personal, work-related, and patient-related dimensions of burnout, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Amos software. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed to explore the factorial structure and to measure model fit. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency. The criterion validity of the CBI was assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between different aspects of burnout and mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety. The CBI-A showed high internal consistency with Cronbach's alphas varied from 0.774 to 0.902 and a low floor and ceiling effect (1-9%). As for the CBI-A construct validity, the exploratory factor analysis showed three factors with good factor loadings and explained 72.17% of the variance. The confirmatory analysis supported the three-factorial structure of the CBI that presented a good overall fit based on the goodness-of-fit indices. Ad hoc modifications to the model were introduced based on the modification indices to achieve a satisfactory fit by allowing one covariate error between one pair of items within the personal burnout domain. All of the 19 items were kept in the construct since they showed a good factorial weight. The CBI-A is associated with burnout-related factors in expected directions, including extensive working hours, sleeping hours, and job satisfaction, indicating, therefore, the criterion validity of the tool. CBI subscales were also found positively associated with mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety demonstrating, in turn, a predictive validity. This study provides evidence for the validity and reliability of the Arabic version of CBI as an adequate tool for assessing burnout among CPs. Such an instrument could be useful for assessing such syndrome among other healthcare workers.","Youssef, Abou-Abbas, Youssef","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-022-00419-x","20220318","Arabic version; Community pharmacists; Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; Psychometric; Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28745,""
"Study protocol for the online adaptation and evaluation of the 'Reboot' (Recovery-boosting) coaching programme, to prepare critical care nurses for, and aid recovery after, stressful clinical events","Critical care nurses (CCNs) are routinely exposed to highly stressful events, exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting resilience and wellbeing of CCNs is therefore crucial to prevent burnout. One approach for delivering this support is by preparing critical care nurses for situations they may encounter, drawing on evidence-based techniques to strengthen relevant psychological coping strategies. As such, the current study seeks to tailor a Resilience-boosting psychological coachingÃ‚Â programme [Reboot] for CCNs, based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles and the Bi-Dimensional Resilience Framework (BDF), and (1) to assess the feasibility of delivering Reboot via online, remote delivery to CCNs, and (2) to provide a preliminary assessment of whether Reboot could increase resilience and confidence in coping with adverse events. Eighty CCNs (n=80) will be recruited to the 8-week Reboot programme, comprised of two group workshops and two individual coaching calls. The study uses a single-arm before-after feasibility study design and will be evaluated with a mixed-methods approach, using online questionnaires (all participants) and telephone interviews (25% of participants). Primary outcomes will be confidence in coping with adverse events (the Confidence scale) and resilience (the Brief Resilience Scale) measured at four time points. Results will determine whether it is feasible to deliver and evaluate a remote version of the Reboot coaching programme to CCNs, and will indicate whether participating in the programme is associated with increases in confidence in coping with adverse events, resilience and wellbeing (as indicated by levels of depression).","Vogt, Grange, Johnson, Marran, Budworth, Coleman, Simms-Ellis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-022-01014-2","20220318","Burnout; COVID-19; Coaching; Critical care; Healthcare staff; Nurses; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28746,""
"Young parents' experiences of pregnancy and parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study in the United Kingdom","Young parents (aged 16-24Ã‚Â years) in the perinatal period are at an increased risk of poor mental health especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to multiple risk factors including social and economic instability. COVID-19 related restrictions had profound implications for the delivery of perinatal care services and other support structures for young parents. Investigating young parents' experiences during the pandemic, including their perceived challenges and needs, is important to inform good practice and provide appropriate support for young parents.Qualitative interviews were conducted with young parents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom from February - May 2021. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Three key themes were identified to describe parents' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents reported specific COVID-19 related anxieties and stressors, including worries around contracting the virus and increased feelings of distress due to uncertainty created by the implications of the pandemic. Parents described feeling alone both at home and during antenatal appointments and highlighted the absence of social support as a major area of concern. Parents alsoÃ‚Â felt their perinatal care had been disrupted by the pandemic and experienced difficulties accessing care online or over the phone.This study highlights the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young parents, including their mental wellbeing and the perinatal support they were able to access. Insights from this study can inform the support and services offered to families going forward. Specifically, the findings emphasise the importance of (a) supporting both parents during perinatal appointments, (b) providing parents with mental health support early on and (c) finding ways to facilitate communication pathways between professionals and parents.","Moltrecht, Dalton, Hanna, Law, Rapa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12892-9","20220318","COVID-19; Mental health; Perinatal; Remote care; Young parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28747,""

"Detecting changes in help seeker conversations on a suicide prevention helpline during the COVID-Ã¢â‚¬â€°19 pandemic: in-depth analysis using encoder representations from transformers","Preventatives measures to combat the spread of COVID-Ã¢â‚¬â€°19 have introduced social isolation, loneliness and financial stress. This study aims to identify whether the COVID-19 pandemic is related to changes in suicide-related problems for help seekers on a suicide prevention helpline. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using chat data from a suicide prevention helpline in the Netherlands. The natural language processing method BERTopic was used to detect common topics in messages from December 1, 2019 until June 1, 2020 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8589). Relative topic occurrence was compared before and during the lock down starting on March 23, 2020. The observed changes in topic usage were likewise analyzed for male and female, younger and older help seekers and help seekers living alone. The topic of the COVID-19 pandemic saw an 808% increase in relative occurrence after the lockdown. Furthermore, the results show that help seeker increased mention of thanking the counsellor (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°15%), and male and young help seekers were grateful for the conversation (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°45% andÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°32% respectively). Coping methods such as watching TV (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°21%) or listening to music (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°15%) saw a decreased mention. Plans for suicide (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°9%) and plans for suicide at a specific location (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°15%) also saw a decreased mention. However, plans for suicide were mentioned more frequently by help seekers over 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°11%) or who live alone and (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°52%). Furthermore, male help seekers talked about contact with emergency care (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°43%) and panic and anxiety (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°24%) more often. Negative emotions (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°22%) and lack of self-confidence (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°15%) were mentioned more often by help seekers under 30, and help seekers over 30 saw an increased mention of substance abuse (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°9%). While mentions of distraction, social interaction and plans for suicide decreased, expressions of gratefulness for the helpline increased, highlighting the importance of contact to help seekers during the lockdown. Help seekers under 30, male or who live alone, showed changes that negatively related to suicidality and should be monitored closely.","Salmi, MÃƒÂ©relle, Gilissen, van der Mei, Bhulai","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12926-2","20220318","BERT; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Suicide chat counseling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28749,""
"The Use of Telehealth in Depression Treatment during the Crisis Caused by COVID-19","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased interest in telehealth as a means of providing care for depression. In this article, we provide an overview of telehealth utilization for the treatment of depression and provide some insight into the rapid shift made to quickly implement these telehealth services into our everyday practices due to COVID-19 personal distancing requirements. We review the application of telehealth in the treatment of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multiple advantages and disadvantages of telehealth in treatment of depression are summarized through the literature, and we analyze the methods to improve the effect and quality of telehealth in depression treatment. It has been highlighted in the current research that against its proven capacity for convenience, its relative cheapness, and its ability to overcome geographic barriers, telehealth has its own shortfalls, including disparities in rural-urban infrastructure and an alleged inability to be exhaustive when intensive interventions are needed. Recommendations for the improvement of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic also presuppose that it is infrastructure and human resource intensive and that short-term improvements in its efficiency are largely dependent on the creativity and resourcefulness of physicians to provide custom solutions for patients.","Lin, Yue","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2022.2053631","20220318","COVID-19; Telehealth; depression; interventions; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28750,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on college student diet quality and physical activity","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic can cause in increase in stress experienced by college students and consequently, potentially adversely affect their health behaviours. <b>Aims:</b> The aim of this study was to investigate how COVID-19 impacted college-attending young adults diet quality and physical activity. <b>Methods:</b> Students attending an Appalachian university in spring 2020 participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants were surveyed on their eating habits, diet quality, and physical activity before and since COVID-19. Frequencies of responses were analyzed and Bowker's test was used to determine differences in responses before and since COVID-19. Alpha was set at 0.05. <b>Results:</b> Almost one third (32.6%) of students reported eating somewhat more since COVID-19 and 67.9% of these students stated it was due to boredom. Students showed a significant increase in frequency of eating and in consumption of almost every food group. The number of students engaging in low physical activity increased from 27.8% to 51.9% and the number of students engaging in high physical activity decreased from 59.5% to 34.0% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001) and many switched to the use of at-home workouts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Results indicate the effects of campus closure on college student's lifestyles and the risk of developing health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially inhibiting their academic progress and well-being.","Olfert, Wattick, Saurborn, Hagedorn","https://doi.org/10.1177/02601060221086772","20220318","Diet; behaviour; coronavirus; eating; exercise; healthy lifestyle; public health; stress; students; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28751,""
"Psychosocial Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers: A cross-sectional survey from Pakistan","This study aimed to assess the anxiety and depression symptoms in healthcare professionals in Pakistan as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2020 and included six different hospitals in Pakistan. An English-language demographics questionnaire, a validated COVID-19 fear scale, depression scale PHQ-9 and anxiety scale GAD-7 were sent to doctors, nurses and paramedical staff via WhatsApp. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and Student's t-test. A total of 400 participants were included in this study (response rate: 80.0%); 263 (65.8%) were doctors and 137 (34.3%) were nurses and paramedical staff. Of the participants, 57.0% were less than 40 years old and 18.3% were aged above 50. Most of the participants (n = 262; 65.5 %) experienced moderate levels of fear and 16.5% (n = 66) experienced a high level of fear. Moreover, 19.5% feared death and 56.5% reported social media to be responsible for increasing their fears. On the depression PHQ-9 and anxiety GAD-7 scales, 21.8% (n = 87) reported moderate to severe depression and anxiety symptoms. A significant relationship was demonstrated between the depression level and age, education and profession (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001 each). Similarly, anxiety and depression scores were strongly related to the availability of personal protective equipment (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001). It was found that 21.8% of healthcare professionals are suffering from moderate to severe depression symptoms, 15.5% had moderate to severe anxiety, whereas 65.5% had moderate symptoms of fear. The predictors are age, education level and co-morbidities. These moderate to high levels of fear and anxiety and depression raise concerns about the psychological well-being of healthcare staff and should be addressed through different programmes.","Ali, Nausheen","https://doi.org/10.18295/squmj.4.2021.067","20220318","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Healthcare workers; Pakistan; Patient Health Questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28752,""
"Fear of COVID-19 Among College Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Mental health issue among college students is routinely a major public health concern, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have exacerbated the students' mental health issues which include psychological distress, panic disorder, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. However, few studies reached a consensus on the impact of COVID-19 fear on mental health among college students. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that quantitatively synthesized the fear among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO electronic databases were systematically searched to identify cross-sectional study reporting the state of COVID-19 fear examined by the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) published up until November 20, 2021. Methodological quality was complied with the evaluation criteria of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The random effects model was employed to estimate the pooled mean of FCV-19S score. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were also conducted. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's test and funnel plot. A total of 16 studies with a sample size of 11,872 were included. A pooled mean of FCV-19S score was 17.60 [95% confidence interval (CI): 16.41-18.78]. The mean of COVID-19 fear in women (17.11, 95% CI: 16.59-17.64) was higher than that in men (15.21, 95% CI: 14.33-16.08). The highest and lowest pooled means of FCV-19S score were observed in the studies conducted in multiple countries that include Israel, Russian, and Belarus (21.55, 95% CI: 20.77-22.33) and in Europe (16.52, 95% CI: 15.26-17.77), respectively. No significant publication bias was detected by Begg's test. College students experienced a moderate level of fear caused by COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to design and implement prevention programs that target the mental health of college students. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021287017, identifier: CRD42021287017.","Wang, Zhang, Ding, Wang, Deng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.846894","20220318","COVID-19; college students; fear; mental health; meta-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28753,""
"Genetic Programming-Based Feature Selection for Emotion Classification Using EEG Signal","The COVID-19 has resulted in one of the world's most significant worldwide lock-downs, affecting human mental health. Therefore, emotion recognition is becoming one of the essential research areas among various world researchers. Treatment that is efficacious and diagnosed early for negative emotions is the only way to save people from mental health problems. Genetic programming, a very important research area of artificial intelligence, proves its potential in almost every field. Therefore, in this study, a genetic program-based feature selection (FSGP) technique is proposed. A fourteen-channel EEG device gives 70 features for the input brain signal; with the help of GP, all the irrelevant and redundant features are separated, and 32 relevant features are selected. The proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 85% that outmatches other prior works.","Sakalle, Tomar, Bhardwaj, Iqbal, Sakalle, Bhardwaj, Ibrahim","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8362091","20220318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28754,""
"Previous functional social and behavioral rhythms affect resilience to COVID-19-related stress among old adults","Functioning of Social Behavioral Rhythms (SBRs) may affect resilience toward stressful events across different age groups. However, the impact of SBRs on the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in elder people is yet to ascertain, representing the aim of the present report. Follow-up of a peer-reviewed randomized controlled trial on exercise on old adults (Ã‚Â³65 years), concurrent to the onset of the pandemic-related lockdown. Post-RCT evaluations occurred after further 12 and 36 weeks since the beginning of the lockdown phase. People with Major Depressive Episode (MDE) at week-48 (follow-up endpoint) were deemed as cases, people without such condition were considered controls. MDE was ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); SBRs functioning at week 12 onward, through the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS). Seventy-nine individuals (53.2%, females) entered the RCT-follow-up phase. The frequency of MDE did not significantly change before versus during lockdown (OR 2.60, CI95%=0.87-9.13). People with BSRS&gt;1 standard deviation of the whole sample score at week-12 had an inflated risk of DE during lockdown (OR=5.6, 95%CI: 1.5-21.4) compared to those with lower BSRS scores. Such odd hold after excluding individuals with MDD at week-12. The post-hoc analysis could be potentially affected by selection bias. Overall, older adults were resilient during the first phase of the pandemic when functioning of pre-lockdown was still preserved, in contrast to the subsequent evaluations when the impairment of daily rhythms was associated with impaired reliance.","Carta, Fornaro, Minerba, Pau, Velluzzi, Atzori, Aviles Gonzalez, Romano, Littera, Chessa, Firinu, Del Giacco, Restivo, Deidda, OrrÃƒÂ¹, Scano, Onali, Coghe, Kalcev, Cossu","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2022.2768","20220318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28755,""
"Loneliness and social isolation among the older person in a Swiss secure institution: a qualitative study","A pandemic of loneliness is hitting the aging population. As COVID19 forced us to isolate ourselves, we are in a better position to understand consequences of social distancing. The recent literature showed that older incarcerated adults are particularly at risk of health-related complications due to isolation in the prison environment, reducing their social capital. Mental and physical health can be severely affected by loneliness and social isolation, especially in prison. Our qualitative study investigates the view of older persons deprieved of their liberty on loneliness and social isolation pertaining to their mental health. We interviewed 57 older participants, including imprisoned individuals and forensic patients, following a semi-structured interview guide. During the data management and data analysis process, we excluded 7 interviews which were of poorer quality. Thereafter, we analyzed the remainders following a thematic approach. Most interviewees experience loneliness following lack of significant human relationships in prison. Making friends appears to be a challenge for all the participants, because, for one thing, they do not find people with similar interests. Also, secure institution setting aggravates isolation due to the restrictions of movement placed such as rules concerning movement between floors, hindering intimate relationship, and separation between friends. Moreover, contact with prison personnel is limited and lack social capital (e.g. trust). To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to present incarcerated persons' perspective on loneliness, social isolation and poor social capital in the Swiss prison setting. These has been reported to cause health problems both somatic and psychological. Our participants experience these deleterious factors in detention. As prisons have the possibility to become a health-promoting environment through connectedness, friendship, and trust promotion, stakeholders need to better their social capital.","Pageau, Seaward, Habermeyer, Elger, Wangmo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-02764-7","20220318","Forensic psychiatry5; Loneliness1; Older adult6; Prisoners3; Social Capital2; Trust4; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Social Isolation; Switzerland","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28756,""
"TikTok's Sick-Role Subculture and What to Do About It","TikTok is a social media platform that allows users to incorporate music, text, and other special effects into short videos. The app has approximately 30 million monthly users in the United States alone, and was the most downloaded app globally in 2020, with 850 million downloads.<sup>1</sup> Like many popular social media platforms, use is heavily skewed toward youth, with one estimate reporting 62% of all users being between the ages of 10 and 29 years.<sup>2</sup> TikTok has carved out a niche where youth can virtually congregate to poke fun at shared experiences from within their own homes, with ordinary backgrounds such as their living rooms, rather than heavily idealized lifestyles seen on other social media platforms. As such, youth are more relatable when they produce personal performances from their homes, ranging from lip syncing and complex dance routines, to videos discussing more serious topics, such as personal struggles with mental health conditions.","Harness, Getzen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.09.312","20220318","Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Child; Humans; Mental Disorders; Social Media; Videotape Recording; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-19","",28757,""
