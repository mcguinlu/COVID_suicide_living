"Neurocognitive and Psychological Profile of a 57-Year-Old Long-COVID Patient After 42 Days an a Ventilator","Objective: The neuropsychological impact of COVID-19 is a budding area of research. Studies suggest greater neurological abnormalities in patients presenting with a severe illness course, particularly those with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The purpose of this case study was to characterize the neurocognitive and psychological profile of a 57-year-old male following prolonged hospitalization for COVID-19 in March 2020, including 42 days on mechanical ventilation. Method: Relevant data were collected via clinical interview, neuropsychological testing, and medical record review. Hospital course was notable for hypertension, acute kidney failure, and pressure ulcers. Computerized tomography and electroencephalogram revealed mild cortical atrophy and mild to moderate generalized slowing, respectively. Approximately 15 months post-discharge, subjective complaints during the evaluation included cognitive ""fogginess,"" increased impulsivity, decreased frustration tolerance, forgetfulness, fatigue, mobility difficulties, and dyspnea upon exertion. Results: Neuropsychological testing, within the context of likely average premorbid functioning, revealed declines in motor functioning, confrontation naming, phonemic fluency, planning/organization, visual memory, and aspects of verbal memory. Poor performance on select memory tasks was likely driven by executive dysfunction. Behaviorally, the patient presented as disinhibited, impulsive and labile. Emotionally, he endorsed symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. These post-COVID-19 sequelae have impacted functioning across multiple domains including ability to work, medication and finance management, and complex decision-making. Conclusions: Results suggest bilateral frontal and temporal dysfunction rather than subcortical deficits from hypoxia. Similar to post-intensive care syndrome, the etiology of functional impairment in severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients appears multifactorial. Likely mediating factors include COVID-19 itself, associated complications, intervention methods, and psychological distress.

"Cognitive Sequelae of ""Long COVID-19"" in Older Adults with Cerebrovascular Risk Factors: A Case Series","Objective: Cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms among older adults (CDC, 2021). Severe symptoms increase the likelihood of persistent symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection (i.e. ""Long-COVID-19"") (Garg et al. 2021). Preliminary research has associated Long COVID-19 with psychological disorders and decline in multiple cognitive domains (Pyne & Brickman 2021). Provided the novelty of COVID-19, further research is required to substantiate findings and inform clinical application. Methods: This case series includes three Caucasian geriatric patients with cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes and hypertension) and unremarkable psychiatric histories. Each was referred for neuropsychological evaluation due to residual cognitive symptoms 6-10 months post-recovery from severe COVID-19 infection. Only Patient A was hospitalized. Results: Patient A's (82, M) neuropsychological profile reflected deficits in executive functioning, variable processing speed, and mild depression. Patient B (86, F) demonstrated deficits in verbal learning and recall and variable attention, language, and visuospatial abilities. Patient C's (70, F) results revealed deficits in verbal learning and recall, variable processing speed, and severe depression. All patients reported intact instrumental activities of daily living and were diagnosed with Mild Neurocognitive Disorder. Conclusion: Older adults with cardiovascular risk factors may be at higher risk for persistent changes in cognitive and psychological functioning following COVID-19 infection. Consistent with previous research, the cognitive presentation of Long COVID-19 was heterogeneous among these patients. Future studies should examine the influence of cardiovascular risk factors or neuroimaging-based cerebrovascular burden on long-term recovery from COVID-19 infection among older adults.

"Editorial: Community Engagement Is Key to Promoting Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Health","Islam et al analyzed data from the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey and identified disparities in food insecurity and financial hardship among AA adults, in particular among Filipino and Vietnamese communities, and increased self-reported anxiety and hopelessness.19 Camacho and coauthors analyzed data from the Current Population Survey and found that Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the state of Washington had a higher incidence rate of unemployment claims compared with other racial groups statewide.20 Using data from the Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic (HEAP) Survey, Su et al conducted a mixed method study to examine the perceived racisms among minority populations.21 They estimated about 19% of non-Hispanic Asian and Black people reported experiencing racial discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded that a host of factors at the individual, household, and neighborhood levels affect the odds of perceived racism.21 Tiwari and Zhang identified differences in mental health status among Asian American subgroups, with South Asian Americans having significantly higher odds of experiencing psychological distress than non-Hispanic White Americans after controlling for confounders.22 COVID-19 vaccines are a powerful tool to contain and control the COVID-19 pandemic, but disparities in access and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines exist. Using data from the Household Pulse Survey collected in 2021, Zhang et al found that Asian Americans have the highest rate of COVID-19 vaccination, but age, gender, and education gradients exist.23 The authors also cautioned on the vaccination hesitation among subgroups of Asian Americans.23 Nguyen et al conducted a community-based qualitative study using focus groups and key informant interviews among a Vietnamese American community in Houston, Texas and concluded that promoting science-based information through trusted messengers, improving awareness and access, and showcasing benefits to the community could increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among Vietnamese Americans.24 Samoa et al used data from the AA and NH/PI COVID-19 Needs Assessment Project and found that vaccine hesitancy ranged from 23% among NH/PIs to 57% among Tongans, with consistent associations between socioeconomic status and vaccine hesitancy among Native Hawaiians, Samoans, and Multi-ethnic NH/PIs.25 The collection of articles has contributed to our understanding of the health disparities experienced by AAs and NH/PIs and pointed to the urgent need to address the disparities, as Ka'ai et al noted.14 First, anti-Asian hate crimes have surged after the emergence of COVID-19 and exacerbated the physical and mental suffering among AAs.14,21 The works highlighted by the Biden Administration in addressing anti-Asian bias, xenophobia, and harassment need to be applauded and sustained.26 Second, LEP among AAs has been a barrier to accessing prevention and health care services,18 including mental health and genetic testing.27â€“29 Language assistance will help AAs to overcome barriers that are pervasive in their encounters with the health care systems.

"Accountants in Africa and the evolving fourth industrial revolution (4IR): Towards a competency framework","This paper sought to establish the competency skills required by accountants to utilise 4IR technologies at their work places. The following specific questions guided the study: What constitutes an accountant who is fit for purpose in the 4IR era? What needs to be done for accountants in Africa to remain relevant? To answer these questions the research adopted a qualitative research approach. A structured interview guide and document review was used to gather qualitative data. Telephone interviews were conducted with the selected members for the interview due to the covid-19 epidemic. Secondary data was gathered through desk research, which included analyzing various academic curricula of various institutions and syllabi of Professional Accounting Organisations. The results from the study on the first objective show that an African accountant needs mostly computer skills and critical thinking skills to effectively navigate in the technology driven era. Other skills identified were emotional intelligence, technical and analytical skills. The second research question indicated that African accountants are expected to have data management skills to effectively execute their duties in this digital era. These skills include information technology skills, data analytics, complex problem solving, specialised software, and business intelligence. These skills need to be fused in the curricula of training institutions. Professional Accounting Organizations, universities, and employers should structure their training curricula in such a way that they impart cutting-edge technology such as block chain and robotics as part of digital accounting so as to eliminate manual accounting and enhance quality financial reporting.","Mbizi, R.; Sifile, O.; Gasheja, F.; Twesige, D.; Gwangava, E.; Makurumidize, S.; Matowanyika, K.; Chinofunga, S.; Sunday, K.","https://doi.org/10.1080/23311975.2022.2117153","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cogent Business & Management; 9(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37769,""
"Lockdown experience, beliefs in and practice of spirituality: Implications for health and self-protective behaviours","The research aims to understand the relationship between spiritual beliefs and practices with perceived general health and adherence to recommended self-protective behaviour during lockdown period of COVID 19 pandemic. Additionally, the study intends to find out the differences among socio-demographic segments of the Indian society across these variables. Online survey was carried out with 1,416 willing adult participants from different socio-demographic segments. Findings suggest that irrespective of age and faith, participants used spirituality as a method of coping. Various socio-demographic segments of the population differed in their self-protective behaviors, perceived general mental health, and practice of spirituality. Regular practice of spirituality was positively correlated with self-protective behaviors and perception of better general mental health. Findings suggest that improved understanding of behavioral responses of different socio-demographic segments under conditions of uncertainty would enhance the cultural competence of the intervention design and aid personalized care under uncertain and crisis situations like COVID-19.","Biswas, Urmi Nanda, Jijina, Parisha","https://doi.org/10.1080/13674676.2022.2027354","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health, Religion & Culture;: 1-18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37770,""
"Reaching hard-to-reach communities: Using whatsapp to give conflict-affected audiences a voice","This article provides an original and timely contribution to current cutting-edge methodological debates by discussing the ongoing need to ensure communities in zones which are inaccessible through war, conflict or disease still have a voice and are not side-lined. As seen during Covid-19, traditional methods of gaining opinions from these communities, such as face-to-face interviews and focus groups, may be restricted and even impossible. Instead, remote methods using WhatsApp provide many additional benefits, providing qualitative and quantitative data (not always simultaneously provided by surveys or interviews), and allowing voice and text messages to be used. This article draws out the generic implications for the methodology using the substantive findings of a study conducted in the Sahel in 2019-20. Whilst also providing 'how to' discussions on this novel approach, the article critically reflects on the advantages and disadvantages of using WhatsApp as it relates to conducting social research in general.

"Can beekeeping improve mental wellbeing during times of crisis?","This paper examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected those interested in honey bees and the outdoors. It was investigated whether being outdoors and/or beekeeping has been a benefit to mental health using personal stories, examples from research, beekeeping groups, communities and the health service. The increase in online beekeeping teaching resources has helped bring knowledge about bees to perhaps a wider audience than previously, but training to become a beekeeper does need a certain hands-on element with beehives in an apiary setting. This is not just in order to gain confidence in handling bees, but also to learn from other beekeepers, and to bond in a social context. Although it is clear from the personal contributions to this article that beekeeping has helped immensely during the time of the COVID-19 crisis, more scientific research is needed to quantify the actual wellbeing effects. However, watching bees feeding on the flowers in gardens and parks is without doubt a pleasurable activity, and can be done by everyone.","Alton, K.; Ratnieks, F.","https://doi.org/10.1080/0005772X.2021.1988233","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bee World; 99(2):40-43, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37772,""
"COVID-19 health certification reduces outgroup bias: evidence from a conjoint experiment in Japan","The psychological theory argues that serious threats cause negative attitudes from ingroups to outgroups. However, the factors that can reduce such outgroup bias caused by the health threats of a pandemic are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that health certifications to prove immunity or negative test result for COVID-19 reduce outgroup bias. Using a discrete choice experiment with a randomized conjoint design in Japan, we investigated public attitudes towards inbound travelers entering the country, including foreigners, immigrants, and tourists. We found that travelers carrying a vaccination certificate or a negative test result for COVID-19 have a higher probability or rating of being admitted to the country. These effects are the same size as those for travelers undergoing self-isolation. Thus, our results demonstrate that health certification can mitigate outgroup bias among ingroup members experiencing threats to health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate that the findings would support the combined usage of vaccine passports and negative certificates to reopen the international borders.","Kubo, Yoshiaki, Okada, Isamu","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01324-z","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 9(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37773,""
"The mediating role of controllability appraisals and coping strategies on adaptive functioning after job loss: a path model","Job loss is a stressful event that increases the risk of experiencing depression and anxiety, especially during the initial months of unemployment. This study examined differences in psychological symptoms and resilient functioning accounted by employment status. The results pointed out that recently unemployed compared to currently employed individuals had lower levels of perceived controllability and resilience as well as higher levels of depression and anxiety. Path analyses showed that lower controllability appraisals at wave 1 of recently unemployed compared to employed individuals, in turn, predicted a lower use of active coping and reappraisal at wave 2, with the latter further accounting for lower levels in resilience. Higher use of distraction further mediated the relation between employment status and higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. Our findings demonstrate the importance of controllability appraisals and coping strategies used to promote adaptive psychological functioning following job loss.","Socastro, Angela, Contreras, Alba, Peinado, Vanesa, Trucharte, Almudena, Valiente, Carmen, Vazquez, Carmelo, Sanchez-Lopez, Alvaro","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-19186-5","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group); 12(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37774,""

At the round-table discussion, Hannah Wachira, a farmer from Kenya, explained how cutting back on increasingly expensive agrochemicals and fuel for farm machinery meant lower yields as a result of more labour-intensive practices, including a rise in back-breaking manual weeding and watering, mostly done by women and girls. Whether programmes reach and benefit women is also not regularly monitored, but it is important to know whether, for instance, subsidized fertilizer is spread on fields farmed by men or women, or whether extension agents reach women. At that point, grassroots organizations - such as the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), the largest women workers' trade union in the country - started to provide the government with data on the number of women who had returned by district, as well as other information on these overlooked workers.","Bryan, Elizabeth, Ringler, Claudia, Lefore, Nicole","https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-02312-8","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nature; 609(7925):28-31, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37776,""

"Disparities in mental health access before and after transitioning to telehealth","Telehealth implementation has potential to reduce disparities in access to mental health care. We examined the number of mental health visits accessed and the visit format used (office, phone, or virtual) by patient demographics before and after a large health system's shift to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients ages 6-17 accessed relatively fewer and female patients accessed relatively more mental health visits after the telehealth transition. Demographic variables were associated with visit format used, with rural residents, older adults, females, and White and Black/African American patients using a higher proportion of phone visits. Implications are discussed for the future implementation of telehealth.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological service provision, mental health practitioners, and patients in long-term care settings: Results from a rapid response survey","Public Significance Statement The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the provision of mental health services in long-term care (LTC) settings, resulting in negative impacts not only for LTC residents who had previously been receiving mental health services but also the clinicians providing the services. This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health providers' ability to provide mental health services in LTC settings, patient functioning, and providers' personal well-being and professional functioning. The authors hope that information within this article will assist in elucidating critical insights that can serve as a guide for policymakers, administrators, employers, and mental health clinicians regarding the provision of mental health services to residents in LTC settings during future pandemics. Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 in long-term care (LTC) settings and the subsequent mandatory visitor restrictions that were put in place, the provision of behavioral health services in LTC settings was impacted. To examine the pandemic's effect on the provision of psychological services in this setting and its impact on clinicians and their patients, we surveyed 126 licensed mental health clinicians working in LTC settings during the pandemic. The sample consisted of psychologists, social workers, and psychiatry mid-level practitioners from 31 states who had provided mental health care services in LTC settings during the initial 7 months after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a national emergency. This exploratory study revealed that the pandemic significantly impacted the availability and use of mental health services in LTC settings. Although there was a reported increase in the use of telehealth services compared to prepandemic frequency, it was noted that LTC residents went long periods of time without access to mental health services. Government-imposed visitor restrictions and pandemic-related restrictions were perceived as negatively impacting the emotional well-being, loneliness, and quality of life of LTC residents. Perceived factors contributing to the financial and emotional impact of COVID-19 on clinicians were explored, and it was noted that more than half of the sample reported experiencing burnout and nearly one third of surveyed clinicians believed they had experienced trauma by providing mental health services in LTC settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding this impact has implications for providing mental health services during the current and future pandemics.","Lind, Lisa M.; Ward, Rachel N.; Rose, Savannah G.; Brown, Lisa M.","https://doi.org/10.1037/pro0000486","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Professional Psychology: Research and Practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37780,""
"Status loss due to COVID-19, traditional masculinity, and their association with recent suicide attempts and suicidal ideation","The COVID-19 pandemic is causing extensive job loss leading to a loss of social status in many men. Endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology may render some men particularly sensitive to status loss and thereby to an increased risk for suicidality. In this anonymous online survey conducted in German-speaking European countries, 490 men completed questionnaires regarding loss of social status due to the COVID-19 pandemic, past-month and lifetime suicide attempt and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology and prototypical and male-typical externalizing depression symptoms were measured. Out of a total of 490 men, 14.7% of men reported experiencing status loss due to the pandemic. These men were more than four times as likely to have attempted suicide in the past month (OR = 4.48, 95% CI [1.72, 11.67]) and more than twice as likely to report suicidal ideation during the past 2 weeks (OR = 2.47, 95% CI [1.42, 4.28]), than men not reporting status loss. Status loss, but not endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology, was associated with suicide outcomes. However, when male-typical externalizing depression symptoms and prototypical depression symptoms were included in the models, they exhibited the only direct associations with suicide outcomes (e.g., for past-month suicide attempt: male-typical externalizing depression symptoms OR = 2.18, 95% CI [1.31, 3.62], prototypical depression symptoms OR = 2.41, 95% CI [1.13, 5.12]). A significant interaction between status loss and endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology further suggests an enhancing moderating effect of traditional masculinity on the relationship between status loss and past-month suicide attempts (OR = 3.27, 95% CI [1.16, 9.27]). Status loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic emerges as risk factor for suicide in men. Men who experience status loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic while concomitantly exhibiting strong endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology have an additional increased risk of suicide. Public Significance Statement Status loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among men with strong endorsement of traditional masculinity ideologies, may play a critical role in understanding the elevated suicide rates in the aftermath of the most acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care policy should specifically target men with experienced status loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic in suicide prevention programs and swiftly design mental health care campaigns tailored to the group of men with strong endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology.","Walther, Andreas, Grub, Jessica, Tsar, Sarah, Ehlert, Ulrike, Heald, Adrian, Perrin, Raymond, Ogrodniczuk, John S.; Seidler, Zac E.; Rice, Simon M.; Kealy, David, Oliffe, John L.; Eggenberger, Lukas","https://doi.org/10.1037/men0000408","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology of Men & Masculinities;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37781,""
"Psychologistsâ€™ Experiences Who Managed Waitlists in Mental-Health Services During the COVID-19 Lockdown","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for mental-health services worldwide. Consequently, it also increased the length of the waitlists for mental-health services, putting a strain on adult mental-health services (AMHS) and the healthcare professionals dealing with these lists. There is little research about how psychologists managed waitlist practices, e.g., scheduling screening appointments, determining clients' availability in an offered appointment, providing evidence-based bibliotherapy, or using priority waiting scales. It remains unclear what their experiences were with these practices and how effective these practices were during the pandemic. Method: The current convergent, concurrent mixed-method study investigated waitlist-management practices, synthesizing quantitative and qualitative data from an online survey (n = 20 participants) applied in two local AMHS in Ireland. Results: The most common practices used by psychologists were opt-in systems, maintaining regular contact with clients, informing them about the waiting time, and providing evidence-based bibliotherapy. Screening was the least-used practice. The qualitative analysis highlights the emotional burden psychologists experienced from the use of waitlist practices, particularly when they had to inform the client of the waiting time or put a client back onto a waitlist. Discussion: Psychologists reported a lack of resources and increases in administrative workload as barriers to implementing practices. Managerial, organizational, and policy-based recommendations are proposed.","McDonnell, Darren, Vasiliou, Vasilis S.; Lonergan, Edgar, Moore, Philip","https://doi.org/10.1024/2673-8627/a000024","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Psychology Open;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37782,""
"A qualitative examination of the implementation of a perinatal collaborative care program","Aim:To identify implementation strategies for collaborative care (CC) that are successful in the context of perinatal care.Background:Perinatal depression is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes. Although treating depressive symptoms reduces risks to mom and baby, barriers to accessing psychiatric treatment remain. CC has demonstrated benefit in primary care, expanding access, yet few studies have examined the implementation of CC in perinatal care which presents unique characteristics and challenges.Methods:We conducted qualitative interviews with 20 patients and 10 stakeholders from Collaborative Care Model for Perinatal Depression Support Services (COMPASS), a perinatal collaborative care (pCC) program implemented since 2017. We analyzed interview data by employing the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework to organize empirically selected implementation strategies from Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) to create a guide for the development of pCC programs.Findings:We identified 14 implementation strategies used in the implementation of COMPASS. Strategies were varied, cutting across ERIC domains (eg, plan, educate, finance) and across EPIS contexts (eg, inner context â€“ characteristics of the pCC program). The majority of strategies were identified by patients and staff as facilitators of pCC implementation. In addition, findings show opportunities for improving the implementation strategies used, such as optimal dissemination of educational materials for obstetric clinicians. The implementation of COMPASS can serve as a model for the process of building a pCC program. The identified strategies can support the implementation of this evidence-based practice for addressing postpartum depression.","Taple, Bayley J.; Haldar, Shefali, Tandon, S.

"Pseudonymous academics: Authentic tales from the Twitter trenches","Academics' use of social media platforms is widely recognized and often understood as an extension of traditional academic practice. However, this understanding does not account for academics' use of pseudonymous Twitter accounts. We used a combination of computational and human-driven methods to examine the activity of 59 anonymized, self-identified academics on Twitter. Our computational analysis identified five broad topics: discussing academic life, discussing British news and affairs, discussing everyday life, surviving lockdown, and engaging with academic Twitter. Within these broad topics, we identified 24 more specific codes, most of which were concentrated in individual topics, with some cross-cutting codes. These codes demonstrate how the pseudonymous accounts considered in this study can be considered ""authentically academic"" even if they do not conform with widespread expectations of academic social media use. â€¢ We described pseudonymous academic Twitter activity with 24 codes (within 5 topics). â€¢ Machine-generated topics touched on academia, news, life, COVID-19, and hashtags. â€¢ Human-identified codes were often concentrated in topics, with some cross-cutting. â€¢ Accounts were authentically academic despite not serving professional advancement.

"Meta-analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of hypochondriasis: Implications for trial design","BackgroundClassification of hypochondriasis as an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) has generated new heuristics for treatment of this common, chronic and disabling disorder. Standard treatment involves cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but no meta-analysis has so far considered hypochondriasis as a structured diagnosis or assessed the role of medication. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of these interventions and identification of clinically relevant factors moderating the treatment response is needed for clinical guideline development.MethodsThe current systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions for hypochondriasis was preregistered on PROSPERO (CRD42020185768) and follows PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases until July 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for patients diagnosed with hypochondriasis (or historical diagnostic equivalents). We assessed aspects of study quality using: the CONSORT Checklist for evaluation of RCTs, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, researcher allegiance and treatment fidelity. The primary outcome was improvement in hypochondriasis symptoms, comparing intervention and control groups at trial endpoint. Moderator variables were assessed using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.ResultsSearches identified 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (NÂ =Â 1405);12 included CBT (NÂ =Â 1212) and three included SSRI (NÂ =Â 193) arms as the experimental intervention. Random effects meta-analysis yielded a moderate-to-large effect size for CBT versus all controls (gÂ =Â -0.70 [95% CI -0.99 to -0.41], kÂ =Â 18, I2Â =Â 81.1%). Funnel plot asymmetry indicated possible publication bias and two potentially missing trials, reducing the effect size (gÂ =Â -0.60 [95% CI -0.88 to -0.32]). Subgroup analysis showed that choice of control significantly moderated effect size, with those in CBT vs. wait-list (gÂ =Â -1.32 [95% CI -1.75 to -0.90], kÂ =Â 7, I2Â =Â 0%) being double those of CBT vs. psychological or pharmacological placebo controls (gÂ =Â -0.58 [95% CI -0.95 to -0.22], kÂ =Â 7, I2Â =Â 82%). Analysis of studies directly comparing CBT and SSRIs found a numerical, but not statistical advantage for SSRIs (gÂ =Â 0.21 [95% CI -0.46 to 0.87], kÂ =Â 2, I2Â =Â 58.34%) and a modest effect size emerged for SSRIs vs. pill placebo (gÂ =Â -0.29 [95% CI -0.57 to -0.01], kÂ =Â 3, I2Â =Â 0%). Most studies (11/13) were rated as high on potential researcher allegiance bias in favour of CBT. Meta-regressions revealed that effect sizes were larger in younger participants, and smaller in better quality and more recent RCTs and those with greater CBT fidelity.ConclusionCBT and SSRIs are effective in the acute treatment of hypochondriasis, with some indication that intervention at a younger age produces better outcomes for CBT. In the case of CBT, effect sizes appear to have been significantly inflated by the use of wait list controls, and researcher allegiance bias. We recommend that a definitive, adequately controlled trial, designed with respect to the methodological issues raised in this meta-analysis, is needed to determine the magnitude effects for CBT and SSRIs with confidence and the long-term effect of treatments, to inform mental health service provision for this overlooked patient group.","Fineberg, Naomi A.; Pellegrini, Luca, Clarke, Aaron, Perera, Uday, Drummond, Lynne M.; Albert, Umberto, Laws, Keith R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2022.152334","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Comprehensive Psychiatry; 118, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37788,""
"Spatiotemporal changes in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide hotspot due to emission switch-off condition in the view of lockdown emergency in India","The COVID-19 outbreak has elicited forced lockdown conditions for all anthropogenic emissions across the globe. It has brought an opportunity for the researchers to sort out the relative contribution of the environmental pollutants which are emerged from the coal-based thermal power plants and other industrial sectors. In countries like India, some industrial sectors and thermal power plants coexist;henceforth, they mutually produce NO2 concentration canopy in the upper atmosphere in raised form. Focusing on this issue, the present work intends to explore the NO2 emission hot-spots' foci using switch-off conditions in consequence of emergency lockdown. Our results indicate that stable ( C V low and NO 2 max ) and large NO2 concentration canopy is noticeable in the inter-state border areas among Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand (around ""Govind Ballabh Part Sagar"" reservoir) where a cluster of thermal power plant is located. The ""OFF"" situation also proposes a close correspondence between the NO2 richness column and installed capacity (R (2) value &gt; 0.7 with 0.0002 p value). States that are situated in the eastern part of the country and megacities like Delhi and Kolkata represent a crucial role in NO2 emission while in certain regions of south India are more or less safe from NO2 emission. As a consequence, the lockdown has created a temporary pollution baseline for tropospheric NO2 that offers research prospects to think of alternate sources of energy that can maintain environmental health as well as human well-being.","Sarkar, S.; Mondal, D.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-022-01240-w","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Air Qual Atmos Health;: 1-13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37789,""

Our findings have revealed that Turkish higher education students have faced multiple challenges in accessing and benefiting from online education due to the swift transformation from face-to-face to online format. These challenges included universities' poor technical infrastructure, pedagogical and assessment issues, digital inequality in accessing online education, and general negative attitude towards online education. Further, students have expressed issues about financial, health, and social consequences of online education during Covid-19 pandemic. With regards to such challenges and issues, higher education students have criticized government authorities for ignoring their views when making decisions about how online learning is organized during Covid-19 pandemic. Further, students have offered some alternative solutions (e.g. summer courses) to online education.","Dindar, Muhterem, Ã‡elik, Ismail, Muukkonen, Hanni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10758-022-09621-x","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Technology, Knowledge and Learning;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37790,""
"When should researchers cite study differences in response to a failure to replicate?","Scientists often respond to failures to replicate by citing differences between the experimental components of an original study and those of its attempted replication. In this paper, we investigate these purported mismatch explanations. We assess a body of failures to replicate in neuroscience studies on spinal cord injury. We argue that a defensible mismatch explanation is one where (1) a mismatch of components is a difference maker for a mismatch of outcomes, and (2) the components are relevantly different in the follow-up study, given the scope of the original study. With this account, we argue that not all differences between studies are meaningful, even if they are difference makers. As our examples show, focusing only on these differences results in disregarding the representativeness of the original experimentâ€™s components and the scope of its outcomes, undercutting other epistemic aims, such as translation, in the process.","ColaÃ§o, David, Bickle, John, Walters, Bradley","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-022-09873-y","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biology & Philosophy; 37(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37791,""
"Psychology in Puerto Rico","In this chapter, we review the psychological issues of relevance to the lives of Puerto Ricans. To do so, we first describe the history and political status of the island, and explain how the negative effects of colonialism have shaped the lives of Puerto Ricans living in Puerto Rico, and by extension, the lives of Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States. We review research on the health and mental health of Puerto Ricans, and explain how context and culture shape social suffering. Additionally, we review current challenges faced on the island, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the recent waves of gender-based violence, and natural disasters. Guided by the tenets of liberation psychology, we hold that psychological suffering often results from societal suffering, and believe that treatment should be focused on emphasizing the protective factors in one's culture. To this end, we provide an overview of future directions in the field and describe some of the training opportunities available in Puerto Rico.

"Vulnerabilities experienced by trans couples in times of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic, characterized as one of the greatest international public health problems in recent decades, has had different impacts on the lives of LGBTQ+ couples. More vulnerable populations, such as transgender people, are even more exposed to a series of social, health, and economic disparities during this pandemic. Therefore, this chapter aims to understand the vulnerabilities experienced by trans couples during the COVID-19 pandemic. When we refer to trans couples, we mean marital relationships where at least one spouse declares themself as a trans person. In view of the scarcity of literature on the effects of the pandemic on trans conjugalities, two narratives of trans couples who had lived together for at least 6 months during the COVID-19 pandemic were used. The main vulnerabilities experienced by couples in the pandemic were related to (1) transphobia, family rejection, and the weakening of the couple's social support network;(2) disparities in mental health and conflicts in the division of household chores;(3) the economic limitations, unemployment, and challenges the couple face in the gender transition process;(4) obstacles to accessing health services and gender dysphoria;and (5) intersectional transphobia. This study can provide evidence for the development and implementation of affirmative and inclusive public policies, as well as interventions that will support the well-being of trans couples in pandemic and post-pandemic times.

"Enhancing resilience for young children facing toxic stress","When a child is confronted with severe, long-lasting stressors and is not buffered from these negative circumstances by a caring and capable adult, their body's stress response system is compromised, leading to what is referred to as ""toxic stress."" These negative experiences early in a child's life lead to difficulties in learning, behavior, and overall physical and mental health. These challenges can be both short and long term, with potentially devastating effects on the child's ability to develop relationships, perform well in school and in the workplace, and choose healthy lifestyle habits that support physical and mental well-being. Millions of children in America, with children of color disproportionately represented, were battling toxic stress before the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is still unknown the extent to which the pandemic will exacerbate these risk factors. While it is difficult to maintain hope and optimism in the face of such overwhelming adversity, the science of resilience does help justify this position. Decades of resilience research demonstrate that key protective factors can be cultivated to support children and families to successfully confront adversity and achieve positive outcomes. These protective factors are found externally within the environment and the family as well as within the individual. This chapter will focus on those protective factors that are drawn from within children, including skills and behaviors that are strengthened through healthy relationships with parents and other important adult caregivers. Practical applications for strengthening children's within-child protective factors will be discussed.

"Retention and success in the midst of a pandemic","The COVID-19 crisis has been a salutary stress test of our retention and success ecosystems in higher education. In particular, it has shone a light on the urgency to reimagine our conceptualisations of these core concepts for greater nuancing to reflect the uniqueness and diversity of individual students, their communities and institutions. In this chapter, we revisit the themes set out in Chap. 1 and canvass the meta impact of the pandemic on the book's foci. We examine disruption-driven, whole-of-institution and curricular good practice, with specific attention directed to COVID-19's acceleration of issues around mental health and wellbeing, assessment design, learning analytics and engaging with students as partners. Throughout, further success opportunities are highlighted for attention in the next wave of cross-institutional and cross-sectoral action.

"Lacan and the environment","In this exciting new collection, leading and emerging Lacanian scholars seek to understand what psychoanalysis brings to debates about the environment and the climate crisis. They argue that we cannot understand climate change and all of its multifarious ramifications without first understanding how our terrifying proximity to the real undergirds our relation to the environment, how we mistake lack for loss and mourning for melancholy, and how we seek to destroy the same world we seek to protect. The book traces Lacan's contribution through a consideration of topics including doomsday preppers, forest suicides, Indigenous resistance, post-apocalyptic films, the mathematics of climate science, and the relevance of Kant. They ask: What can you do if your neighbour is a climate change denier? What would Bartleby do? Does the animal desire? Who is cleaning up all the garbage on the internet?

"Responding to the COVID-19 public health emergency: The usefulness of an online brief psychological intervention with Italian university students","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new stressors on university students, with a negative impact on their mental health and well-being. The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of a brief psychodynamically oriented intervention on general functioning by investigating changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and burnout. The sample was comprised of 67 university students (22.4% males), with a mean age of 23.27 (standard deviationÂ (SD) = 3.27), who asked for psychological help at a psychological university service. Pre- and posttreatment data showed a significant improvement in general functioning and symptom reduction due to the psychological intervention. The mean change was very high for depression (d = 1.11) and high for general functioning (d = 0.70) and anxiety (d = 0.69). Our findings showed the importance of considering university students a vulnerable population that requires specific services within the university context and underlined the fact that mental-health-promotion policies should be extensively implemented.

"Daily stressors and mental health following disaster: A school-based assessment of adolescent disaster survivors in China and Nepal","Postdisaster daily stressors, the economic and social challenges caused or exacerbated by disasters, have significant consequences for mental health but are rarely investigated in child and adolescent populations. We assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety among adolescents affected by disasters in China and Nepal and examined the specific contributions of disaster-related trauma exposure and daily stressors across mental health outcomes. A school-based, cross-sectional study was conducted with a stratified random sampling design. Adolescents living in disaster-affected areas of southern China and Nepal (N = 4,215, 52.7% female, age range: 15-19 years) completed translated, validated measures. Mixed effects logistic regression analyses were conducted using a priori risk factors. PTSS were reported by 22.7% of participants and were higher among Nepali adolescents but did not differ between genders. Depressive symptoms were reported by 45.2% of the sample and were higher among Nepali adolescents and girls in both countries. Across all settings, disaster-related trauma exposure was a significant risk factor for PTSS, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, China: odds ratios (ORs) = 1.44-2.06, Nepal, ORs = 1.21-2.53. High levels of household and interpersonal daily stressors further improved the models and contributed significantly to all mental health difficulties, China: ORs = 1.77-1.98, Nepal: ORs = 1.49-1.90. Postdisaster economic insecurity and interpersonal stressors are thus, likely to worsen adolescent mental health outcomes. Programs that identify and address structural inequalities for adolescents in disaster-affected settings will have cascading effects for mental health.","Newnham, E.

"A Long-Lasting Skin Protectant Based on CG-101, a Deep Eutectic Solvent Comprising Choline and Geranic Acid","The COVID-19 public health crisis has spotlighted the need to improve global hygiene and sanitization. In addition to causing staggering rates of transmission and fatality, COVID-19 has severely impacted the quality of life and mental health of global citizens. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourage hand hygiene as the first defense against the spread of infection, yet frequent handwashing is often impractical. Widely used ethanol-based hand sanitizers provide immediate protection against pathogens on the skin, albeit short-lived, due to their rapid evaporation. Herein, a novel, long-lasting skin protectant formulated with biocompatible ionic liquid/deep eutectic solvents prepared using generally recognized as safe materials - choline and geranic acid (CG-101, 5% w/w) - is described. In vitro studies demonstrated that CG-101 inactivates bacteria and the human coronavirus, hCoV229E, for 4 h after application. Two human clinical studies demonstrate that CC-101 does not cause skin irritation or sensitization, and a single application of CG-101 gel imparts skin protection against microbes for significantly longer than conventional 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizers. These data are the first to indicate that CG-101 may be a better alternative to alcohol-based hand sanitizers for long-term skin protection against infectious diseases.","Shevachman, Marina, Mandal, Abhirup, Gelston, Kevin, Mitragotri, Samir, Joshi, Nitin","https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202200064","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Global Challenges;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37799,""
"Returning to the nest: Emerging adults living with parents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Changes in the working, study and social lives of emerging adults due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to greater need for external supports. Many who lived independently may have sought that support by returning to live with parents. This study identifies factors associated with returns made between 2019 and 2020. It describes supports needed and obtained, relationships between parents and their resident emerging adults and identifies correlates of poor coping and high psychological distress. Data from the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth and the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children were used and showed half of the emerging adults who moved did so due to COVID-19 restrictions. Loss of work and increased need for emotional and financial support were key drivers of moves. Nineteen per cent who returned found spending more time with family difficult and over half did not have their support needs fully met, increasing their odds of poor coping at that time (ORÂ =Â 2.9, 4.3, respectively) and subsequent psychological distress (ORÂ =Â 6.0). Families were an important source of support but could not necessarily mitigate all challenges;for some emerging adults, returning to live with parents gave rise to additional difficulties which negatively affected mental health.

"Testing the effects of an affectionate communication intervention to bolster mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study tested the efficacy of an affectionate communication intervention to help adults living in the United States bolster their mental health during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-eight married and cohabitating adults were randomly assigned to one of three groups: increased affectionate communication (treatment), increased thankfulness (comparison), or no change in behavior (control). The final sample contained 73 adults (etatreatment = 26, etacomparison = 24, etacontrol = 23) who completed the four-week intervention that started in September and concluded in October 2020. Although post-hoc analyses revealed that participants in the treatment group were, on average, less affection deprived, less depressed, less lonely, and less stressed than those in the comparison and the control groups halfway through the intervention and at the end of the intervention, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to a successful comparison manipulation, but a statistically nonsignificant treatment manipulation. Speculation as to why the intervention failed to reject the null hypotheses is presented in the discussion before providing methodological recommendations for future interventions in this area of research.

"Debunking Myths of Standards-Based Grading","Within the typical science classroom, if a student does not do well on a test, the score is permanently recorded in the grade book.

Ultimately, our aim as science teachers is to help students learn at a high level. Students are summatively assessed when the teacher feels confident in students' ability to meaningfully engage with the science and engineering practices and their understanding of core ideas and crosscutting concepts.

"Predictors of mental health help-seeking in Alaska native communities","American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons have been identified as a group with greater risk for transgenerational trauma;furthermore, they experience environmental, systemic, and pragmatic barriers to treatment for mental and social issues. Researchers have called for more studies of groups like AI/AN to better understand the complex social, interpersonal, and intrapersonal problems involved in accessing and using mental health services. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive relationships of demographics, transgenerational trauma, locus of control, and stigma on help-seeking and use of mental health services in the AI/AN population in a quantitative study. The developmentally based trauma framework was chosen as the conceptual framework and theory of planned behavior was chosen as the theoretical framework for this study. A correlational survey research design using a quota sampling strategy was employed. The predictors included demographics, transgenerational trauma, stigma, and locus of control. The criterion variables included attitude towards help-seeking, intention to seek help, and use of mental health services. A hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis plan was implemented. Findings were nonsignificant for all predictors except the measure of transgenerational trauma. Limitations regarding the challenges of working with the AI/AN population and conducting survey research during extraordinary external circumstances (the COVID-19 pandemic) are discussed. Although the findings were non-significant, the results point to research methods that are innovative and culturally relevant to support better response rates and integrate with positive social change for vulnerable populations like AI/AN.

"Considerations for an ethic of one health: Towards a socially responsible zoonotic disease control","The COVID-19 pandemic once again confirmed that zoonotic diseases are a serious threat to humanity. These infectious diseases, which are transmitted from animals to humans, have the power to cause a global health crisis. Besides all the physical suffering, such a health crisis is also disruptive to our social lives and our economy, inter alia due to disease control measures. Zoonotic diseases are probably as old as humanity itself. However, over time the risk on zoonotic disease outbreaks has increased. Since the beginning of this century we have experienced outbreaks of SARS (2002), H1N1 influenza (2009), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014), Zika (2015) and now COVID-19 (2019). Some of the main drivers for the (re)emergence of these diseases are global population growth, urbanization, worldwide transport, increased demand for animal protein, unsustainable agriculture, and climate change.In chapter 1, the introduction of my thesis, I explain that this development has fueled a renewed interest in the relation between human, animal and environmental health. The awareness that human health is inextricably connected with the health of animals and ecosystems, led to the understanding that interdisciplinary cooperation is indispensable to combat (re)emerging zoonotic diseases. Around 2008, this way of thinking was framed in the concept of One Health, which can be defined as the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. At present, the One Health approach is the worldwide standard to combat zoonotic diseases. In an ideal world such a strategy should lead to a better health for humans, animals and our environment.However, in practice it is not self-evident that a One Health approach in zoonotic disease control is actually in the interest of animals or the environment. As we have seen during the Q-fever outbreak in the Netherlands (2007-2012) zoonotic disease control can lead to ethical questions. Not only because conflicts of interest can arise between human centered values like public health and economy. If we really understand One Health as a call to promote the health of humans as well as the health of animals and the environment, the current practice of zoonotic disease control is often morally problematic. From a holistic One Health perspective it is, for example, difficult to accept economically driven nonvaccination policies, that lead to culling of healthy animals. The same goes for long term confinement of free range poultry, whose housing systems are often not suitable for this purpose, to prevent avian influenza outbreaks. Or antimicrobial reduction policies that lead to higher disease incidence and mortality in animals. These ethical considerations formed the start of this thesis.The aim of my research is to clarify the ethical assumptions of a One Health approach in zoonotic disease control, to explore how these can be coherently understood and ethically justified and to indicate what this implies for policymaking. This has led to my overall research question: how should a One Health approach in zoonotic disease control be conceived and justified from an ethical perspective?

"COVID-19 distress in NCAA Division III student-athletes","The aim of this study was to conduct a survey-based assessment of mental health symptoms among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III student-athletes at a university during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to identify the severity of psychological distress during the fall academic semester, including a comparison of distress among gender and sport types, at a school who resumed in-person learning and preserved competition and practice sessions. A longitudinal, repeated measures design was implemented. Results indicated a significant increase in distress as the semester progressed (t(170) = 9.188, p &lt; .001). Moreover, there was a significant difference in distress between genders at both time points (p &lt; .001, p = .001, respectively), but only between sport types at the first data collection (p = .001). A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) determined a significant effect of time (p &lt; .001), gender (p &lt; .001), and sport (p = .008) on COVID distress as well as the interaction of gender and sport to significantly influence symptoms (p = .032). The results of this study suggest COVID-19 induced psychological distress is not stagnant and women student-athletes may be more susceptible.

"Well being and mental health among COVID-19 recovered patients","Backgrounds: Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. Covid-19 virus is spread mainly through saliva droplets or runny nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 has changed the lives of people all over the world in amazing ways. Coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was originally named acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Mental health denotes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Positive mental health and positive psychology have an imminent role to play during this unprecedented public health crisis. Although there is enough evidence-based literature on the application of positive mental health techniques at individual level for stress reduction or life fulfilment, its application in a pandemic scenario is minimally explored. Happiness strategies classically outlined in Lyubomirsky's book ""The How of Happiness"" revolve around (a) living in the present, (b) managing stress (which is outlined later in this article), and (c) investing in social connections. Mindfulness meditation practice daily helps in quieting one's mind and prevents the constant internal mental chatter.

"Burnout and Turnover Intention in Critical Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: A Cross-sectional Survey","The prevalence of burnout among critical care professionals during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic varies in different countries. To investigate the prevalence of burnout and turnover intention in Japanese critical care professionals in March 2021. This cross-sectional study used a web-based survey of Japanese critical care professionals working in 15 intensive care units in 15 prefectures. Burnout was measured using the Mini Z 2.0 Survey. Intention to leave (turnover intention) was assessed by survey. Resilience was measured using the Brief Resilience Scale (Japanese version). Demographics and personal and workplace characteristics were also collected. Of 1,205 critical care professionals approached, 936 (77.6%) completed the survey. Among these, 24.3%, 20.6%, and 14.2%, reported symptoms of burnout, depression, and anxiety, respectively. A total of 157 respondents (16.8%) reported turnover intention. On multivariate analysis, higher resilience scores (odds ratio [OR]: 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.95; and OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.96) and perceived support from the hospital (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44-0.93; and OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.40-0.73) were associated with a lower odds of burnout and turnover intention, respectively. Approximately 24% and 17% of the Japanese critical care professionals surveyed had symptoms of burnout and turnover intention from critical care, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such professionals require organizational level support to cultivate both individual and organizational resilience to reduce burnout and turnover intention.","Kuriyama, Sakuraya, Kinjo, Santanda, Yoshino, Ouchi, Suyama, Yoshino, Saito, Yokoyama, Beppu, Iwanaga, Takei, Kataoka, Egawa, Muramatsu, Jackson, Onodera","https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202201-029OC","20220919","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37809,""
"The Impacts of Social Media Use and Online Racial Discrimination on Asian American Mental Health: Cross-sectional Survey in the United States During COVID-19","During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased social media usage has led to worsened mental health outcomes for many people. Moreover, due to the sociopolitical climate during the pandemic, the prevalence of online racial discrimination has contributed to worsening psychological well-being. With increases in anti-Asian hate, Asian and Asian American social media users may experience the negative effects of online racial discrimination in addition to the reduced psychological well-being resulting from exposure to online COVID-19 content. This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related social media use and exposure to online racial discrimination during the pandemic on the mental health outcomes (ie, anxiety, depression, and secondary traumatic stress [STS]) of Asian Americans compared with those of non-Asian Americans. In addition, this study explores the mediating role of negative affect and the moderating role of racial/ethnic identification. An online survey was conducted through Amazon Mechanical Turk and a university-wide research portal from March 3 to March 15, 2021. A total of 1147 participants took the survey. Participants' social media usage related to COVID-19 and exposure to 2 online forms of racial discrimination (individual and vicarious), mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and STS), racial/ethnic identification, negative affect, and demographics were assessed. Our results showed that COVID-19-related social media use, individual discrimination, and vicarious discrimination were predictors of negative mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and STS). Asian Americans reported higher vicarious discrimination than Latinx and White Americans, but Asian Americans' mental health outcomes did not differ substantially from those of the other racial/ethnic groups. Racial/ethnic identification moderated the relationship between both types of discrimination and STS, and negative affect served as a mediator between both types of discrimination and all 3 mental health outcomes. These results suggest that social media exposure continues to have a dire effect on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study helps to contextualize the rise of anti-Asian American hate and its impact on mental health outcomes in the United States.","Layug, Krishnamurthy, McKenzie, Feng","https://doi.org/10.2196/38589","20220919","Asian Americans; COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; mental health; negative affect; racial discrimination; racial/ethnic identification; secondary traumatic stress; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37810,""
"Proposal of guidelines to assist managers to face pressing challenges confronting Latin American universities: a complexity theory perspective","The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing problems in Latin America and posed unprecedented challenges for Latin American universities (LAU). These challenges can be characterised as complex problems that cannot be understood through reductionist approaches. This paper aims (i) to provide a complex system perspective of the challenges confronting LAUs and (ii) to propose guidelines for managers of LAUs to address them in practice. A multidisciplinary group was formed and conducted an iterative process of research, brainstorming and debate of potential solutions to the following problems considered particularly important by their universities: mental health issues in the university environment, student learning gaps, brain drain, and anti-science movements. Complexity theory and E/HF concepts are integrated to demonstrate that understanding what LAUs are experiencing in a fragmented manner is impossible, and that the interactions between the challenges should be at the center of the managers' actions plans. Managers of LAUs can benefit from the guidelines proposed to understand the pressing challenges confronting universities and develop systemic approaches to address them.","Sigahi, Sznelwar, Rampasso, Salati Marcondes de Moraes, Girotto JÃƒÂºnior, Pinto JÃƒÂºnior, Anholon","https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2022.2126895","20220919","Complex systems; Complexity theory; Current challenges; Guidelines; Latin American universities; Wicked problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37811,""
"Sociodemographic Changes and Oral Health Inequities: Dental Workforce Considerations","By midcentury, the US population will be remarkably more racially and ethnically diverse, with a dramatic increase in the proportion of older adults. This report addresses ongoing oral health disparities and inequitable access to care related to these changes, with emphasis on implications for the workforce, taking note of effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that social determinants shape health behaviors, reflection on the most effective type of dental workforce should take into account population characteristics and the relationship of oral health with overall health and general well-being. The dental workforce composition will need to mirror changing demographics, and effective dental health teams will be characterized by cultural competence, humility, readiness, and capacity to adapt to changes. In addition, the influence of social histories and the pandemic on health and dental care utilization is important. Equally important are the inclusion of oral health literacy in treatment planning and disease prevention, as well as oral health-related quality of life in considering outcomes of care. Providing patient-centered care for a diverse population requires tailored treatment modalities, as well as intra- and interprofessional approaches. In this way, the whole person can be cared for, including those with special health care needs, whether related to chronic disease, mental health conditions, or behavioral, physical, and social differences. Changing demographics will affect the delivery of oral health care, including who can best provide care and how, what the needs are, and in what ways prevention and treatment can most effectively be accomplished. The education of dentists must address unmet population needs, including for those with special health care concerns and older adults. These population groups are influenced by a variety of social determinants, and provision of services may need to occur in alternative care delivery settings. Identifying and addressing the needs of every patient within this broad array of new requirements will challenge dental professionals to redefine what it means to be a health care practitioner. This article describes how sociodemographic changes in the United States will challenge the dental workforce in new ways and points to research and practice needs to address these challenges. Oral health disparities and the changing oral health care needs of patients from diverse and underserved groups are discussed, with a focus on the implications for delivery of care and policies that are needed to improve oral health outcomes for all.","Inglehart, Albino, Feine, Okunseri","https://doi.org/10.1177/23800844221116832","20220919","access to care; dental education; dental workforce; health care quality; healthcare delivery; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37812,""
"The First COVID-19 Pandemic Wave and the Effect on Health Care Trainees: A National Survey Study","This study observes the trends and patterns among trainees during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and their response to resident education and hospital/program support. An anonymous online 31-question survey was distributed to medical students and postgraduate year residents. Topics included were demographics, clinical responsibilities, educational/curricula changes, and trainee wellness. Descriptive analysis was performed for each set of demographic groupings as well as 2 and 3 group comparisons. Total 1051 surveys collected, 930 used for analysis: 373 (40.1%) male, 434 (46.6%) aged 30-34 years, 588 (63.2%) white, 417 (44.8%) married, 168 (18%) with children, and 323 (34.7%) from the Northeast region. The Northeast experienced difficulty sleeping, feelings of guilt, hopelessness, and changes in appetite (<i>P</i> = .0077). The pandemic interfered significantly with relationships and living situations (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001). Trainees 18-34Ã‚Â years believed the pandemic affected residency training (<i>P</i> &lt; .0001).

"PTSD Coverage in <i>the New York Times</i>: Implications for the State of Mental Health in the US","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been portrayed in media in a skewed way such that the coverage overrepresents combat-precipitated trauma and neglects to communicate treatment options, which has direct implications for people with PTSD. Given the traumatic nature of contemporary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of social movements concerning traumatic violence such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, this study examines if media coverage of PTSD has evolved to account for these changes. We specifically examined sourcing and framing in PTSD news coverage published by <i>The New York Times</i> from 1999 to 2020 using quantitative content analysis. The findings indicate that the coverage overrepresents combat trauma and neglects to communicate treatment options; favors men over women in sourcing of the news stories; and uses more thematic, compared to episodic framing. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","Long, Jain, Roark","https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2022.2121881","20220919","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37814,""
"The relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms in adolescents during high stress: The moderating role of emotion regulation","This study examined the moderating role of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation in the relationship between general perceived stress and depressive symptoms during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in March-April 2020 in Belgium, while controlling for past depressive symptoms in 2016. Participants were 110 adolescents (55% female; MageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16, SDageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.80) who filled out different questionnaires assessing maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies (ERS), perceived stress, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed that only maladaptive ERS statistically significantly moderated the relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms. More specifically, the amount of perceived stress is positively associated with the level of depressive symptoms, especially in adolescents who use more maladaptive ERS. The repertoire of adaptive ERS might not be sufficient for adolescents to flexibly cope with a highly stressful situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Study findings highlight the need to support youth, particularly those who use more maladaptive ERS, in adaptively coping with intense stressful life events.","Braet, Giletta, Wante, Van Beveren, Verbeken, Goossens, Lomeo, Anslot, Braet","https://doi.org/10.1002/jad.12091","20220919","COVID-19; depression; emotion regulation; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37815,""
"A Systematic Review of COVID-19 and Pericarditis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then, the disease has spread globally, leading to the ongoing pandemic. It can cause severe respiratory illness; however, many cases of pericarditis have also been reported. This systematic review aims to recognize the clinical features of pericarditis and myopericarditis in COVID-19 patients. Google Scholar, Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies reporting ""Coronavirus"" or ""COVID"" and ""Peri-myocarditis,"" ""heart,"" or ""retrospective."" Case reports and retrospective studies published from May 2020 to February 2021 were reviewed. In total, 33 studies on pericarditis, myopericarditis, and pericardial infusion were included in this review. COVID-19 pericarditis affected adult patients at any age. The incidence is more common in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Chest pain (60%), fever (51%), and shortness of breath (51%) were the most reported symptoms, followed by cough (39%), fatigue (15%), myalgia (12%), and diarrhea (12%). Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, elevated D-dimer, erythrocyte rate, and C-reactive protein. Cardiac markers including troponin-1, troponin-T, and brain natriuretic peptide were elevated in most cases. Radiographic imaging of the chest were mostly normal, and only 31% of chest X-rays showed cardiomegaly and or bilateral infiltration. Electrocardiography (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with around 59% ST elevation and rarely PR depression or T wave inversion, while the predominant echocardiographic feature was pericardial effusion. Management with colchicine was favored in most cases, followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and interventional therapy was only needed when patient developed cardiac tamponade. The majority of the reviewed studies reported either recovery or no continued clinical deterioration. The prevalence of COVID-19-related cardiac diseases is high, and pericarditis is a known extrapulmonary manifestation. However, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are less prevalent and may require urgent intervention to prevent mortality. Pericarditis should be considered in patients with chest pain, ST elevation on ECG, a normal coronary angiogram, and COVID-19. We emphasize the importance of clinical examination, ECG, and echocardiogram for decision-making, and NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids are considered to be safe in the treatment of pericarditis/myopericarditis associated with COVID-19.","Theetha Kariyanna, Sabih, Sutarjono, Shah, Vargas PelÃƒÂ¡ez, Lewis, Yu, Grewal, Jayarangaiah, Das, Jayarangaiah","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.27948","20220919","brain natriuretic peptide; c-reactive protein; chest x-ray; covid-19; echocardiogram; electrocardiography (ecg); erythrocyte sedimentation rate; myopericarditis; pericarditis; sars-cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37816,""
"Adapting pediatric health care responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A clinical perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic required our pediatric health care staff to adjust to many irregularities and solve serious issues in our routine clinical practice.

Cluster infections were entirely avoided by following systematic, everyday precautions. Patientsquality of life has been difficult to maintain during the pandemic, due to social and staffing restrictions. Other unexpected repercussions - such as an unexpected lack of seasonal virus infections, then a respiratory syncytial (RS) virus outbreak - required agile management of hospital resources.

"COVID-19 and family violence: A rapid review of literature published up to 1 year after the pandemic declaration","After the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, public health restrictions were introduced to slow COVID-19 transmission and prevent health systems overload globally. Work-from-home requirements, online schooling, and social isolation measures required adaptations that may have exposed parents and children to family violence, including intimate partner violence and child abuse and neglect, especially in the early days of the pandemic. Thus, we sought to: (1) examine the occurrence of family violence; (2) identify factors associated with family violence; and (3) identify relevant recommendations, from COVID-19 literature published up to 1 year after the pandemic declaration. This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021241622), employed rapid review methods, and extracted data from eligible papers in medical and health databases published between December 1, 2019 and March 11, 2021 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Embase. 28 articles including 29 studies were included in the rapid review. While many studies of families/households revealed rises in family violence incidence, official justice, police, and emergency department records noted declines during the pandemic. Parental stress, burnout, mental distress (i.e. depression), difficulty managing COVID-19 measures, social isolation, and financial and occupational losses were related to increases in family violence. Health services should adopt approaches to prevent family violence, treat victims in the context of public health restrictions, and increase training for digital service usage by health and educational professionals. Globally, restrictions aimed to limit the spread of COVID-19 may have increased the risk factors and incidence of family violence in communities. Official records of family violence may be biased toward under-reporting in the context of pandemics and should be interpreted with caution.

"Serum soluble Fas ligand is a severity and mortality prognostic marker for COVID-19 patients","Finding cytokine storm initiator factors associated with uncontrolled inflammatory immune response is necessary in COVID-19 patients. The aim was the identification of Fas/Fas Ligand (FasL) role in lung involvement and mortality of COVID-19 patients. In this case-control study, mild (outpatient), moderate (hospitalized), and severe (ICU) COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects were investigated. RNA isolated from PBMCs for cDNA synthesis and expression of mFas/mFasL mRNA was evaluated by RT-PCR. Serum sFas/sFasL protein by ELISA and severity of lung involvement by CT-scan were evaluated. Also, we docked Fas and FasL <i>via</i> Bioinformatics software (<i>in silico</i>) to predict the best-fit Fas/FasL complex and performed molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) in hyponatremia and fever (COVID-19 patients), and healthy conditions. mFasL expression was increased in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. Moreover, mFas expression showed an inverse correlation with myalgia symptom in COVID-19 patients. Elevation of sFasL protein in serum was associated with reduced lung injury and mortality. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that blood profile alterations of COVID-19 patients, such as fever and hyponatremia could affect Fas/FasL complex interactions. Our translational findings showed that decreased sFasL is associated with lung involvement; severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. We think that sFasL is a mediator of neutrophilia and lymphopenia in COVID-19. However, additional investigation is suggested. This is the first report describing that the serum sFasL protein is a severity and mortality prognostic marker for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients.","Saleki, Shirzad, Javanian, Mohammadkhani, Alijani, Miri, Oladnabi, Azadmehr","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.947401","20220919","COVID-19; Fas; hyperinflammation; immunoinformatics; viral Immunology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37822,""
"The development of positive education combined with online learning: Based on theories and practices","In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the all-around development and mental health of students in education.

"Designing pandemic resilient cities: Exploring the impacts of the built environment on infection risk perception and subjective well-being","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities around the world explored ways to slowdown the spread of the disease while maintaining the physical and mental health of individuals. They redistributed the street space to promote physical activity and non-motorized travel while meeting the social distancing requirements. Although the statistics showed significant increases in walking and bicycling trips during the pandemic, we have limited knowledge about the associations between built environment characteristics, COVID-19 infection risk perception while traveling, and subjective well-being. This study assesses the impacts of the built environment on subjective well-being and infection risk perception while traveling during the pandemic. It uses data collected from the residents of Columbus, Ohio, through a multi-wave survey conducted at different time points during the COVID-19 outbreak. By employing a structural equation modeling approach, it explores the associations between residential neighborhood characteristics, individuals' subjective well-being, and perceived infection risk while using non-motorized modes and shared micromobility. The findings show that those living in more compact, accessible, and walkable neighborhoods are less likely to perceive active travel and shared micromobility as risky in terms of COVID-19 infection. Our results also show that built environment characteristics have an indirect positive effect on the subjective well-being of individuals. The findings of our study demonstrate that built environment interventions can help promote physical activity and support mental health of individuals at this critical time. Our study also indicates that designing compact neighborhoods will be a crucial element of pandemic resilient cities in the post-COVID-19 era.","Ozbilen, Akar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2022.08.013","20220919","Built environment; COVID-19; Risk perception; Structural equation modeling; Subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37824,""

The most important opportunities were a perception of increased productivity compared to on-site working and improvements in quality of life and mental health. In counterpoint, barriers observed included worsening of mental health symptoms in the majority of workers who already had some type of mental disorder before the pandemic, work overload, difficulties with reconciling work routines with domestic activities, and a lack of the conditions and training needed to work from home. It should be emphasized that the various characteristics observed are related to the initial stages of adaptation to pandemic conditions and the new working routine.

"Business support and effects derived from COVID-19: implications on labor productivity","The COVID-19 pandemic shows contagion and mortality rates that exceed the initial forecast and has caused a series of effects in different spheres of individuals, including the labor sphere. To examine the relationship between business support and effects derived from COVID-19 in Mexican and Colombian workers and to identify the factors that can predict productivity. The sample included 482 people from both countries, 381 women (79%) and 101 men (21%). Two instruments were used: one scale to measure business support and the other to measure COVID-19 effects. A multivariate design was used to understand the factorial structure of the instruments through confirmatory factor analysis, and a predictive design was used based on structural equation modeling. Statistical analysis was conducted through the confirmatory factor analysis and found a factorial solution that fitted the theoretical approach to the data in both instruments, and the structural equation model showed an adequate goodness-of-fit (<i>X</i> <sup>2</sup> = 320.110, p = 0.000; comparative fit index = 0.90; root mean square error of approximation = 0.07). According to the results, it was observed that both instruments presented an adequate goodness-of-fit to the data. The structural equation showed that leadership (0,420) and daily disturbance (-0.558) are predictors of labor productivity. Specifically, a positive leadership style facilitated group performance and therefore the achievement of results. Daily disturbance, such as effects derived from COVID-19, negatively affects productivity; therefore, all actions taken by organizations to provide support will promote mental health and will thereby help to achieve the expected productivity.","Villavicencio-Ayub, Quiroz-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Meraz, SantamarÃƒÂ­a-Plascencia","https://doi.org/10.47626/1679-4435-2022-719","20220919","coronavirus 2019-nCov infection; leadership; organizational productivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37827,""
"Burnout syndrome in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","There is evidence that harm to the mental health of healthcare workers has occurred during the pandemic caused by COVID-19. The burnout syndrome is a form of exhaustion that occurs in occupational settings and is a condition caused by long-term stress in the workplace. The objectives of this systematic review of observational studies were to present data from research into the prevalence of burnout syndrome in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and observe its prevalence among frontline workers. The search was conducted on the MEDLINE, LILACS, and Embase databases from 2019 to May of 2021 and returned 538 publications, which underwent a two-stage process of selection by independent peers, resulting in selection of a sample of 29 articles. Data were then extracted and synthesized for presentation in narrative form. Cross-sectional designs were more prevalent (n = 26) than longitudinal studies (n = 3). The sample included research from 19 different countries, with one Brazilian study. A wide range of different instruments were administered by study authors to assess burnout syndrome, the most common of which was the Maslach Burnout Inventory (n = 13). The prevalence of burnout syndrome in the studies varied from 76 to 14.7%. Data on the relationship between development of burnout syndrome and working on the frontline were controversial. The lack of standardization of burnout syndrome assessment was a source of considerable difficulty, compromising comparability of the results, and should therefore be targeted for improvement by researchers. We suggest that more investigations should be conducted into prevalence and the associated factors of risk and protection.","Meira-Silva, Freire, Zinezzi, Ribeiro, Coutinho, Lima, Crispi, Porto, Silva, Miranda, Zurita, Belerique, Bandoli","https://doi.org/10.47626/1679-4435-2022-849","20220919","COVID-19; healthcare personnel; occupational health; pandemics; professional burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37828,""
"Impact on health and well-being of working at home during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","After the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, many workers were forced to start working from home, creating a new dynamic that could potentially affect their health in several ways. To study the impact of working at home during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on a sample of Brazilian workers. This study used a cross-sectional methodology with an online survey conducted by a Brazilian human resources website from June 1 to August 15, 2020, with a sample of employees working at home during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The sample of 653 valid responses revealed that 87.7% of the survey respondents reported that the change to home working started because of the situation caused by the pandemic. However, 550 (84.2%) people from this group stated that their employer did not conduct any health and safety evaluation of their workstation in the domestic environment. Regarding physical symptoms, there were high prevalence rates of symptoms related to musculoskeletal conditions, sleeping problems, feelings of fatigue, headaches, and migraines. The study also used the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index instrument and there were statistically significant associations between low scores and physical symptoms of musculoskeletal conditions, feelings of fatigue, headache or migraine, heartburn and indigestion, and leg pain. The findings of this research confirm the importance of developing strategies and programs to preserve the health and well-being of workers who start working at home, with participation of and supervision by companies' occupational physicians. Future investigations should continue to capture data about health, well-being, and productivity and share best practices to plan support for the occupational health of those working from home.","Ogata, Malik, LourenÃƒÂ§o, Savia, Pinto, Rodrigues","https://doi.org/10.47626/1679-4435-2022-791","20220919","coronavirus infections; mental health; occupational health; working environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37829,""
"COVID-19 distress affects healthcare and administrative workers equally at a tertiary hospital center in Brazil","The COVID-19 outbreak exposes healthcare workers to an increased risk of distress and psychiatric symptoms. To evaluate psychological suffering and mental disorders among healthcare workers at a tertiary hospital, a referral center for COVID-19 treatment. An observational, cross-sectional, quantitative study with descriptive methodology. Fifty-eight healthcare workers who attended consultations at the hospital's Mental Health Outpatient Clinic were included. The study was carried out after approval by the research ethics committee at the Faculdade de Medicina de SÃƒÂ£o JosÃƒÂ© do Rio Preto (32665020.3.0000.5415). 81% were women, mean age was 38.98Ã‚Â±10.6 years, 20 (34.5%) were administrative staff, 24 (41.4%) were attending a first consultation, and 28 had had previous psychiatric attention at other services. Sixteen (28%) reported new symptoms during the pandemic, with anxious (10), irritable (3), and depressive (2) symptoms being the most frequent. Anxiety (26) and depressive disorders (19) were the most prevalent. As for exposure to news, the most common feelings were fear (19) and anguish or concern (9). The most common feelings associated with the pandemic were fear and recurrent thoughts of social and economic impact (27). The main reflections were about the meaning of life (17), human vulnerability (11), and the importance of the family (7). Regarding prospects for the future, 70.7% (41) reported hope for improvement. Initial data suggest a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances, regardless of work team. Fear of death and uncertainty about the future are also prevalent.

"Online Mindfulness-Based Logotherapy Program: A Pilot Study Targeting Depressive Symptoms of Cyberbullied Adolescents During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the intensive use of the internet for educational and recreational purposes, leading adolescents to be more exposed to cyberbullying. Empirical studies indicate that cyberbullying has become a pervasive problem among adolescents causing negative consequences like depression. Moreover, the global pandemic lockdown and quarantine measures gave rise to the demand for telepsychology and teletherapy to virtually address the psychological needs of netizens. Thus, utilizing Conklin's program development model, we created and experimentally tested an online intervention program to target the depressive symptoms experienced by cyberbullied adolescents. We integrated logotherapy and mindfulness to develop an eight-modular, Online Mindfulness-based Logotherapy Program (OnlineMLP). After being validated by experts in various disciplines, we experimentally pilot tested the efficacy of the OnlineMLP in a 3-h session per module in four weeks to a group (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) of cyberbullied adolescents in Tamilnadu, India. The pilot study showed significantly that the OnlineMLP had a positive effect on the participants reducing their depressive symptoms. Furthermore, it confirmed that the online program's concepts and structure are reliable, feasible, and efficacious for testing a more extensive base of cyberbullied adolescents experiencing depressive symptoms.","Maria Michael, Reyes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-022-00279-x","20220919","Covid-19; Cyberbullying; Depression; Logotherapy; Mindfulness; Online therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37831,""
"Pathways from self-disclosure to medical coping strategy among adolescents with moderate and major depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mediation of self-efficacy","The prevalence of adolescent depression in China during the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing. Self-disclosing depressive emotions could help release stress. Self-disclosure, which is a prerequisite for self-efficacy, can directly contribute to people's psychological health, and depression and the choice of coping strategy are determined by the level of self-efficacy perceived. We aimed to discuss the relationship between self-efficacy, self-disclosure, and medical coping strategy. Further, we explore the mediation effect of self-efficacy on the influence of self-disclosure on medical coping strategies in adolescents with depression. A total of 585 patients aged 11-24 years with moderate and major depression were recruited. All the assessments were completed on the second day after admission, including the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), Distress Disclosure Index (DDI), and Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ). Pearson correlation was performed to explore the relationships of these variables. The bootstrap analysis was used to conduct to assess the mediation effects. Both direct and indirect effects of self-disclosure on medical coping strategy were found. As predicted, self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between self-disclosure and medical coping strategy (<i>b</i> = 0.0385, 95% CI: 0.0244-0.0538 for <i>Confrontation</i>; <i>b</i> = -0.0466, 95%CI: -0.0651 to -0.0296 for <i>Resignation</i>), respectively. The effect size for <i>Confrontation</i> and <i>Resignation</i> was 0.2659 and 0.2485, respectively. Self-efficacy played a partial mediating role in the effect of self-disclosure on medical coping strategies for adolescent depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the use of a positive self-disclosure mechanism may be anticipated to promote improved self-efficacy and the use of active coping strategies.","Wu, Shao, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Qu, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.976386","20220919","adolescent depression; mediation; medical coping mode; self-disclosure; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37832,""

"Determinants of mental and financial health during COVID-19: Evidence from data of a developing country","Mental and emotional issues are the top-level concerns of public health worldwide. These issues surged during Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic due to varied medical, social, and personal reasons. The social determinants highlighted in the literature mainly focus on household solutions rather than on increasing the financial wellbeing of individuals, especially for the most vulnerable groups where the psychological distress coming from the social inequalities cannot be entirely treated. Hence, this study attempts to familiarize the financial capability (the financial literacy, attitude, skills and behavior required for effective financial management) construct into public health domain in the times of COVID-19 as a determinant of psychological distress, and also explores the role of gender in it. The study uses Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis and employs mental distress questions and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2018 financial capability toolkit to collect data from a large sample of households from all over Pakistan. It is inferred that the higher the financial capability, the lower the financial and mental distress during COVID-19. Additionally, females are less financially knowledgeable, depict poor financial behaviors, and face more psychological issues than their counterparts. Age and education are also linked to mental stress during COVID-19. Finally, gender plays a moderating role in financial behavior, and financial and mental stress of households. As evident, COVID-19 is not going away soon hence the findings are relevant for policymakers to proactively plan for the pandemic's upcoming waves and help people be better financially equipped to fight against this or any upcoming crisis, and achieve better mental and physical health.","Khan, Siddiqui, Imtiaz, Shaikh, Chen, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.888741","20220919","COVID 19; developing countries; financial capability; financial health; financial literacy; mental health; socioeconomic and demographic factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37834,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with Spinal Cord Injury: Mental health and use of telehealth","Limited access to healthcare services and the self-isolation measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have had additional unintended negative effects, affecting the health of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). We aimed to examine the perceived influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with SCI. First, this study looked to understand how the pandemic affected the use and perception of telehealth services for these individuals. Second, it investigated the effect of COVID-19 on mental health. Cross-sectional online survey. Individuals with SCI living in the community in British Columbia, Canada PATIENTS: This survey was offered to individuals with spinal cord injury and had 71 respondents, with 34% living in a rural setting and 66% in an urban setting. Not applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Telehealth utility, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale (PVD). Telehealth use in the SCI population has increased from 9.9% to 25.4% over the pandemic, with rates of telehealth use in urban centers nearing those of rural participants. 31.0% of respondents had probable depression and 7.0% had probable generalized anxiety disorder as measured by a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥10 on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively. The mean scores on FCV-19S and PVD were 17.0 (6.6 SD) and 4.29 (1.02 SD) respectively. Telehealth use during COVID-19 has more than doubled. It is generally well regarded by respondents, though only a quarter of the SCI population have reported its use. With this in mind, it is important to understand what barriers there are to further adoption. In addition, higher rates of probable depression were seen than those estimated by pre-pandemic studies in other countries. This article is protected by copyright.

"Postpartum depression, social support and maternal self-efficacy between adolescent and adult mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative cross-sectional study","To determine the rate and level of postpartum depression (PPD), as well as to examine and compare PPD, social support and maternal self-efficacy between adolescent and adult mothers at 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks postpartum during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy measures to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 have disrupted many aspects of life and decreased social connections, which negatively impacts psychological well-being of the general population. However, studies focused on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and maternal self-efficacy in postpartum mothers, particularly adolescent mothers, are limited. A comparative cross-sectional study was carried out following the STROBE guidelines. An online questionnaire was administered from February to March 2021. Data were collected by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Postpartum Support Questionnaire (PSQ) and the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) at 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks postpartum. One-way MANOVA was used to analyse the data. Data from 63 adolescent mothers and 63 adult mothers were analysed. There were significant correlations between PPD, social support and maternal self-efficacy of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both adolescent and adult mothers had significantly negative impacts from the pandemic on mental health, social support and maternal self-efficacy. However, the adolescent mothers had higher rates of depressive symptoms (36.5% and 23.8%, respectively) as well as lower PSQ score (121.25 and 130.52, respectively) and PSOC scores (62.54 and 70.94, respectively) compared with adult mothers in the first 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks postpartum during the pandemic. Adolescent mothers had a significantly higher rate of depressive symptoms and significantly lower social support and maternal self-efficacy scores compared to adult mothers at 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks postpartum during the COVID-19 pandemic. Midwives or nurses should emphasize the negative mental health impacts during the COVID-19 situation and routinely screen for depressive symptoms, especially in adolescent mothers, which could help identify the at-risk mothers for developing PPD.

The decision to vaccinate teenagers was motivated by the global public health need: to decrease transmission to other age groups. Among adolescents, the efficacy (better immunity than in young adults) and safety of vaccines was clearly demonstrated. Among 5-to-12-year-olds, due to lower contamination the collective benefit is less clear, and when the m-RNA vaccines were available for this age group, the Omicron variant was predominant and their effect on non-severe infections and transmission had yet to be determined. Individual benefit is based both on somatic criteria and on the child's schooling and mental health.

"Depressive Symptoms Predict Antibody Titers after a Second Dose of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 Vaccine among Hospital Workers in Japan","Although factors associated with the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine have been reported, psychological factors have not been examined. Depression or anxiety may affect vaccine reactions because these factors influence immune responses. This study aimed to determine whether psychological status at the time of vaccination predicts antibody responses. A prospective observational study of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine response was carried out among individuals attending for an annual health check-up. Participants included 78 volunteers out of 80 hospital workers in Nagoya, Japan. No participants had been infected with COVID-19 and all gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Blood samples were obtained approximately 28 days after the second dose of the vaccine, and antibody titers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay. Participants completed the Japanese version of the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) questionnaire, one day before both vaccinations. Participants also recorded any adverse reactions, such as body temperature and other side effects, every day for two weeks after each dose. The relationships between antibody titers and the predictive factors were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis, with the antibody titers as the dependent variables, followed by univariate analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that no or excessive alcohol intake (p = 0.039), poor results from a health check-up (p = 0.011), a longer duration between the second dose and blood collection (p = 0.039), and degree of depressive symptoms (p = 0.041) were significant negative predictors of antibody titers, while body temperature one day after the second dose as a significant positive predictor (p &lt; 0.0005). We identified that depressive symptoms just before the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 were an independent negative predictor of antibody responses, in addition to other factors. Our results highlight the importance of mental health at the time of vaccination to achieve the higher antibody responses necessary to acquire humoral immunity.","Kaneko, Tsuboi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.09.004","20220918","Antibody response; Anxiety; BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; COVID-19; Depression; Health care worker; Japan; Psychological factor; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37841,""

Employees with SP showed higher association with depressive symptoms than employers or self-employed individuals (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.18, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.85, 2.56 among employees vs. ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.76, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.29, 2.40 among employers or self-employed individuals). SP has become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic. A protective strategy against SP among vulnerable workers is necessary for a healthier and safer society.","Lee, Lee, Park, Kim, Yun, Hong, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.029","20220918","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Sick leave; Sickness presenteeism; Worker","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37842,""
"[Post-traumatic stress and quality of life of post-COVID-19 patients in primary care]","To determine the association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of post-COVID-19 patients in primary care. Cross-sectional, multicenter, random probability sampling study. Primary care centers in Ica-Peru. Six hundred and thirty-six patients with previous diagnosis of COVID-19. The variable PTSD symptoms was measured with the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire and HRQOL with the EuroQol scale (EQ-5D). Sociodemographic and health factors including post-COVID-19 syndrome were analyzed. A descriptive analysis was performed and crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated using generalized linear models of the Poisson family to search for associations between variables. Of the participants, 21.4% presented symptoms of PTSD; 33.6% symptoms of dysphoric and anxious arousal; 22.3% intrusion, avoidance and negative affect; 22.6% anhedonia; and 23.6% externalizing behavior. 50.3% revealed at least one component of HRQoL affected; 35.5% problems linked to anxiety/depression; 34.9% pain/discomfort; 11% daily activity; 10.7% mobility and 6.6% self-care. The presence of PTSD symptoms was associated with the HRQoL affected (PR=2.46: 95% CI: 2.19-2.78). Also, certain sociodemographic and health variables were associated with PTSD symptoms and affected HRQoL. PTSD symptoms, increase the probability of affecting the patient's HRQoL post COVID-19. There are potentially modifiable sociodemographic and health variables that could decrease PTSD symptoms and improve HRQoL.","Becerra-Canales, Campos-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Campos-Sobrino, Aquije-CÃƒÂ¡rdenas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aprim.2022.102460","20220918","AtenciÃƒÂ³n Primaria; COVID-19; Calidad de vida; PTSD; Pacientes; Patients; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Primary care; Quality of life; TEPT; Trastornos por estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37843,""
"What are the mental health changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in people with medical conditions? An international survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health worldwide but there is paucity of knowledge regarding the level of change in mental health in people with a medical condition (physical/psychiatric). The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the change in mental health in people with and without medical conditions, (2) to assess the change in various types of medical conditions, (3) to evaluate the association between change in mental health and number of comorbidities, and (4) to investigate the influence of receiving treatment and activity limitation imposed by the medical condition(s). Cross-sectional. Online international survey. English-speaking adults (age Ã¢â€°Â¥18) were included in the study, with no exclusions based on sex/gender or location. 1276 participants (mean age 30.4, 77.7% female) were included. Pre and during COVID-19 pandemic symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were assessed. The Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire was used to collect data regarding medical conditions.Repeated-measures analysis of covariance (objectives 1, 2 and 4) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (objective 3). 50.1% of participants had a medical condition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with people with no medical condition, people with both psychiatric and physical conditions experienced significantly higher symptoms of anxiety (12%, p=0.009) and depression (9.4%, p&lt;0.001). Although not statistically significant, the increase in anxiety and depression occurred across seven major categories of conditions. An association was found between having a higher number of medical conditions with higher anxiety and depression symptoms (r=0.16 anxiety, r=0.14 depression, p&lt;0.001). Receiving treatment and being functionally limited by the disease did not have a significant impact on the amount of change (p&gt;0.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people who had a combination of psychiatric and physical conditions experienced greater symptoms of anxiety and depression.

"Anxiety and depression symptoms among children before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: COVID Mental Health 2019-2020","The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to children's daily lives due in part to stay-at-home orders and school closures, reducing interactions with both peers and extended family. Yet, few studies with nationally representative data have explored the potential association of the COVID-19 pandemic and children's mental health. The current study analyzed data from the 2019 and 2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe changes in the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression before and during the first year of the pandemic among children aged 5-17 years. Changes in prevalence by child- and family-level characteristics were also examined. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly one in six children aged 5-17 years had daily or weekly symptoms of anxiety or depression, a significant increase from before the COVID-pandemic (16.7% (95% CI:15.0-18.6) vs. 14.4% (95% CI:13.4-15.3)). Males, children 5-11 years, non-Hispanic children, children living in families in large metropolitan areas, incomes at or below the federal poverty level, and whose highest educated parent had more than a HS education, also showed statistically significant increases in anxiety and depression symptoms. NHIS data may be used to monitor this increase in mental health symptomatology and assist in identifying children at risk.","Zablotsky, Black, Terlizzi, Vahratian, Blumberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.09.003","20220917","anxiety; children; depression; mental health; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37845,""
"Trajectories of common mental disorders symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the ELSA-Brasil COVID-19 Mental Health Cohort","Evidence indicates most people were resilient to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. However, evidence also suggests the pandemic effect on mental health may be heterogeneous. Therefore, we aimed to identify groups of trajectories of common mental disorders' (CMD) symptoms assessed before (2017-19) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), and to investigate predictors of trajectories. We assessed 2,705 participants of the ELSA-Brasil COVID-19 Mental Health Cohort study who reported Clinical Interview Scheduled-Revised (CIS-R) data in 2017-19 and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) data in May-July 2020, July-September 2020, October-December 2020, and April-June 2021. We used an equi-percentile approach to link the CIS-R total score in 2017-19 with the DASS-21 total score. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify CMD trajectories and adjusted multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate predictors of trajectories. Six groups of CMD symptoms trajectories were identified: low symptoms (17.6%), low-decreasing symptoms (13.7%), low-increasing symptoms (23.9%), moderate-decreasing symptoms (16.8%), low-increasing symptoms (23.3%), severe-decreasing symptoms (4.7%). The severe-decreasing trajectory was characterized by ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â years, female sex, low family income, sedentary behavior, previous mental disorders, and the experience of adverse events in life. Pre-pandemic characteristics were associated with lack of response to assessments. Our occupational cohort sample is not representative. More than half of the sample presented low levels of CMD symptoms. Predictors of trajectories could be used to detect individuals at-risk for presenting CMD symptoms in the context of global adverse events.","Fatori, Suen, Bacchi, Afonso, Klein, Cavendish, Lee, Liu, Bauermeister, Moreno, Viana, Goulart, Santos, Bauermeister, Smoller, Lotufo, BenseÃƒÂ±or, Brunoni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02365-0","20220917","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Cohort study; Depression; Trajectories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37846,""
"Stronger association of perceived health with socio-economic inequality during COVID-19 pandemic than pre-pandemic era","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed peoples' routine of daily living and posed major risks to global health and economy. Few studies have examined differential impacts of economic factors on health during pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. We aimed to compare the strength of associations between perceived health and socioeconomic position (household income, educational attainment, and employment) estimated before and during the pandemic. Two waves of nationwide survey [on 2018(T1;nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°1200) and 2021(T2;nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°1000)] were done for 2200 community adults. A balanced distribution of confounders (demographics and socioeconomic position) were achieved across the T2 and T1 by use of the inverse probability of treatment weighting. Distributions of perceived health [= (excellent or very good)/(bad, fair, or good)] for physical-mental-social-spiritual subdomains were compared between T1 and T2. Odds of bad/fair/good health for demographics and socioeconomic position were obtained by univariate logistic regression. Adjusted odds (aOR) of bad/fair/good health in lower household income(&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°3000Ã¢â‚¬â€°U.S. dollars/month) were retrieved using the multiple hierarchical logistic regression models of T1 and T2. Perceived health of excellent/very good at T2 was higher than T1 for physical(T1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36.05%, T2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.13%; PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04), but were lower for mental(T1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38.71%, T2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.17%; PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and social(T1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42.48%, T2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.17%; PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) subdomains.

"Worries about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection: the role of social inequalities, COVID-19 prevalence and healthcare infrastructure","This study investigates individual and regional determinants of worries about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection, an important indicator of mental wellbeing in pandemic times as it potentially affects the compliance with mitigation measures and the willingness to get vaccinated. The analyses shed light on the following questions: Are there social inequalities in worries about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection? What is the role of the regional spread of COVID-19 infections and regional healthcare capacities? Based on data derived from the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP), a representative sample of the German population aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and over, we estimated multilevel logistic regression models with individual-level (level 1) and regional-level (level 2) variables. The regional variables of interest were (a) the number of COVID-19 infections, (b) the number of hospital beds as an overall measure of the regional healthcare capacities, and (c) the number of free intensive care units as a measure of the actual capacities for treating patients with severe courses of COVID-19. Women, older respondents, persons with migrant background and those with a lower socioeconomic status were more likely to report worries about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection. Moreover, respondents with chronic illness, lower subjective health and those who consider COVID-19 as a threat for their own health were more likely to report worries. In addition, also regional characteristics were relevant. Worries were more common in poorer regions with higher COVID-19 infections and worse health infrastructure as indicated by the number of hospital beds. The analysis not only indicates that several social groups are more concerned about inadequate medical treatment in case of a COVID-19 infection, but also highlights the need for considering regional-level influences, such as the spread of the virus, poverty rates and healthcare infrastructure, when analyzing the social and health-related consequences of the pandemic.","Schmitz, Garten, KÃƒÂ¼hne, Brandt","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14024-9","20220919","Health service research; Mental health; Population survey; Social and political issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37848,""
"Maternal and infant NR3C1 and SLC6A4 epigenetic signatures of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: when timing matters","Stress exposure during pregnancy is critically linked with maternal mental health and child development. The effects might involve altered patterns of DNA methylation in specific stress-related genes (i.e., glucocorticoid receptor gene, NR3C1, and serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4) and might be moderated by the gestational timing of stress exposure. In this study, we report on NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation status in Italian mothers and infants who were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown during different trimesters of pregnancy. From May 2020 to February 2021, 283 mother-infant dyads were enrolled at delivery. Within 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°h from delivery, buccal cells were collected to assess NR3C1 (44 CpG sites) and SLC6A4 (13 CpG sites) methylation status. Principal component (PC) analyses were used to reduce methylation data dimension to one PC per maternal and infant gene methylation. Mother-infant dyads were split into three groups based on the pregnancy trimester (first, second, third), during which they were exposed to the COVID-19 lockdown. Mothers and infants who were exposed to the lockdown during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation when compared to counterparts exposed during the second or third trimesters. The effect remained significant after controlling for confounders. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic and their infants might present altered epigenetic biomarkers of stress-related genes. As these epigenetic marks have been previously linked with a heightened risk of maternal psychiatric problems and less-than-optimal child development, mothers and infants should be adequately monitored for psychological health during and after the pandemic.","Nazzari, Grumi, Mambretti, Villa, Giorda, Provenzi, Borgatti, Biasucci, Decembrino, Giacchero, Magnani, Nacinovich, Prefumo, Spinillo, Veggiotti","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02160-0","20220919","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37849,""
"The Australian Temperament Project Generation 3 study: a population-based multigenerational prospective cohort study of socioemotional health and development","The Australian Temperament Project Generation 3 Study (ATPG3) was established to examine the extent to which offspring social and emotional development is shaped in the decades prior to conception, in parent and grandparent histories of psychosocial adjustment (eg, emotional regulation, relationship quality and prosociality) and maladjustment (eg, depressive symptoms, substance use and antisociality). The Australian Temperament Project (ATP) commenced in 1983 as a population representative survey of the social and emotional health of 2443 young Australians (Generation 2: 4-8 months old) and their parents (Generation 1). Since then, families have been followed from infancy to young adulthood (16 waves). Between 2012 and 2018, the cohort was screened biannually for pregnancies (Generation 3), with assessments conducted in the third trimester of pregnancy, and at 8 weeks and 1 year postpartum. A total of 1167 offspring (607 female) born to 703 Generation 2 parents (400 mothers) were recruited into the ATPG3 Study. Findings to date highlight: (1) strong continuities in depressive symptoms and substance use from adolescence through to becoming a parent; (2) a role for persistent preconception mental health problems in risk for parent-child bonding difficulties, as well as infant emotional reactivity and behaviour problems; (3) the importance of secure attachments in adolescence in reducing long-term risk for postpartum mental health problems; and (4) the protective nature of perceived social support, both preconception and postpartum, in strengthening relationship quality and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Assessments of ATPG3 families in preschool and middle childhood are currently funded and underway. We intend to maintain the offspring cohort through childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and into parenthood. Data will be used to map preconception determinants of emotional health, and enhance approaches to population monitoring and targeted intervention over the life course and across generations.","Olsson, Letcher, Greenwood, McIntosh, Barker, Olsson, Macdonald, Spry, Hutchinson, Ryan, Edwards, McGee, Patton, Sanson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061854","20220919","epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37850,""

Participants were recruited online from 16 April to 23 April 2020. 1043 healthcare workers, predominantly Brazilians, aged 18 years or older. Depression was the primary outcome, measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide attempts in a rural region in Germany, a 5-year observational study","The COVID-19 pandemic and public life restrictions may have a negative impact on people's mental health. Therefore, we analyzed whether this condition affected the occurrence of suicide attempts (SA) over 20Ã‚Â months during the pandemic period. We included patient records according to DSM-5 criteria for suicidal behavior disorders (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 825) between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2021. We applied interrupted time-series Poisson regression models to investigate the effect of the pandemic on SA occurrence, time trends, and seasonal patterns in the whole group of patients as well as stratified by age and gender. There was no significant effect of the pandemic on the occurrence of SA in the overall group. However, we observed a significant impact of the pandemic on the seasonal pattern of SA, also the variance differed significantly (pre-pandemic meanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â variance: 13.33Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 15.75, pandemic: meanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â variance: 13.86Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 7.26), indicating less periodic variation in SA during the pandemic. Male patients and young adults mainly contributed to this overall effect. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference in SA trends during the pandemic in older adults (&gt;55Ã‚Â years) compared with younger adults (18-35Ã‚Â years); SA numbers increased in older adults and decreased in younger adults as the pandemic progressed. A few patients may have received initial care in an emergency department after SA without being referred to psychiatry. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures did not significantly affect the occurrence of SA but did significantly affect the dynamics. In addition, the pandemic appeared to affect suicidal behavior differently across age groups as it progressed. Particularly for the older adult group, negative long-term effects of the pandemic on suicidal behavior can be derived from the present results, indicating the need to strengthen suicide prevention for the elderly.","Kastner, Javaheripour, Arand, SchÃƒÂ¶nherr, Sobanski, Fehler, Walter, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.022","20220919","Covid-19 pandemic; Interrupted time-series analysis; Suicidal behavior; Suicidal ideations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37852,""

"Assessment of Mental Health and Coping Disparities Among Racial and Ethnic Groups Amid COVID-19 From the ""How Right Now"" Campaign","How Right Now (HRN) is an evidence-based, culturally responsive communication campaign developed to facilitate coping and resilience among US groups disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To inform the development of this campaign, we examined patterns in emotional health, stress, and coping strategies among HRN's audiences, focusing on differences among racial and ethnic groups. We used a national probability panel, AmeriSpeak, to collect survey data from HRN's priority audience members in English and Spanish at 2 time points (May 2020 and May 2021). We conducted statistical testing to examine differences between time points for each subgroup (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White) and differences among subgroups at each time point. We found disparities in COVID-19-related mental health challenges and differences in coping strategies. Non-Hispanic Black respondents were more likely than non-Hispanic White respondents to report challenges related to the social determinants of health, such as affording food and housing (26.4% vs 9.4% in May 2020) and experiencing personal financial loss (46.6% vs 29.2% in May 2020). In May 2021, 30.6% of Hispanic respondents reported being unable to meet basic food or housing needs versus 8.2% of non-Hispanic White respondents, and 51.6% reported personal financial loss versus 26.5% of non-Hispanic White respondents. Our study further illuminates what is needed to build emotional well-being pathways for people who historically have been economically and socially marginalized. Our findings underscore the need for public health interventions to provide culturally responsive mental health support to populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19 during the pandemic and into the future, with a focus on racial and ethnic disparities.","Burke-Garcia, Berktold, Rabinowitz, Wagstaff, W Thomas, Crick, Walsh, Mitchell, Verlenden, Puddy, Mercado, Xia, Aina, Caicedo, Nelson Ba","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549221121667","20220916","COVID-19 pandemic; coping; disproportionately affected populations; emotional well-being; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37854,""
"The different impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of distinct health care worker categories","The present study sought to explore the factors associated with the odds of having probable depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to traumatic COVID-19 experiences and their impact on health care workers in distinct categories. In this cross-sectional study, 1843 health care workers (nurses, nurse technicians, physicians, physical therapists, and other healthcare workers) were recruited via convenience sampling. A survey was administered to obtain information regarding sociodemographic, occupational, and mental health status. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used for the analyses. Being a nurse technician was associated with an odds ratio of 1.76 for probable PTSD. No relation was observed between health care worker categories and the odds of probable depression. Additionally, being female and not receiving adequate PPE were related to greater odds of having probable PTSD and depression.","Machado, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Gama, Vilete, Berger, Passos, Mendlowicz, Souza, Pereira, Mocaiber, de Oliveira","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053221120968","20220916","COVID-19; depression; health care workers; mental health; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37855,""

"The moderating role of sociodemographic and work-related variables in burnout and mental health levels of Mexican medical residents","To explore the moderating effects of sociodemographic and work-related variables on levels of burnout and mental health among medical residents. A cross-sectional online survey was administered at the beginning of the second wave of COVID-19 at different public teaching hospitals where medical residents practiced in Mexico City. A total of 201 medical residents of different years completed the survey. Different univariate inferential analyses on the level of burnout and mental health indices showed significant differences between sex, marital status, previous reports of physical illness or psychological conditions, and residency ranking. However, the effect sizes of those differences were of low to medium size. A predictive path analysis revealed that the three stages of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and achievement dissatisfaction) negatively affect psychological wellbeing and positively affect psychological distress. Finally, even though sociodemographic variables showed some significant variation, the effect sizes were small and did not moderate the direct effect of burnout on mental health indices. Medical residents deling with every day medical situations, will be exposed to stressors that might increase the probability to experience emotional exhaustion. This would negatively affect levels of wellbeing and positively affect distress, despite their sociodemographic characteristics.","Dominguez-Espinosa, Montes de Oca-Mayagoitia, SÃƒÂ¡ez-JimÃƒÂ©nez, de la Fuente-Zepeda, Monroy RamÃƒÂ­rez de Arellano","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274322","20220919","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37857,""
"Emotional discourse analysis of COVID-19 patients and their mental health: A text mining study","COVID-19 has caused negative emotional responses in patients, with significant mental health consequences for the infected population. The need for an in-depth analysis of the emotional state of COVID-19 patients is imperative. This study employed semi-structured interviews and the text mining method to investigate features in lived experience narratives of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls with respect to five basic emotions. The aim was to identify differences in emotional status between the two matched groups of participants. The results indicate generally higher complexity and more expressive emotional language in healthy controls than in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, narratives of fear, happiness, and sadness by COVID-19 patients were significantly shorter as compared to healthy controls. Regarding lexical features, COVID-19 patients used more emotional words, in particular words of fear, disgust, and happiness, as opposed to those used by healthy controls. Emotional disorder symptoms of COVID-19 patients at the lexical level tended to focus on the emotions of fear and disgust. They narrated more in relation to self or family while healthy controls mainly talked about others. Our automatic emotional discourse analysis potentially distinguishes clinical status of COVID-19 patients versus healthy controls, and can thus be used to predict mental health disorder symptoms in COVID-19 patients.","Deng, Park, Chen, Yang, Xie, Li, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274247","20220919","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37858,""
"Changes in Emergency Department Visits for Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome Following Recreational Cannabis Legalization and Subsequent Commercialization in Ontario, Canada","Prior research suggests that the legalization of recreational cannabis is associated with increases in cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), but it is unclear how cannabis commercialization (ie, greater retail store access as well as increased variety and potency of cannabis products) may be associated with these changes. To examine changes in the number and characteristics of CHS emergency department (ED) visits from before to after legalization of cannabis in Ontario, Canada. This repeated cross-sectional study used interrupted time-series analyses to examine immediate and gradual changes in ED visits for CHS in Ontario, Canada, during 3 time periods: prelegalization (January 2014-September 2018), legalization with product and retail store restrictions (October 2018-February 2020), and commercialization with new products and expanded stores, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-June 2021). Data were obtained from routinely collected and linked health administrative databases. All individuals aged at least 15 years and who were eligible for Ontario's Universal Health Coverage were included. Data were analyzed between March and July 2022. Monthly counts of ED visits for CHS per capita. There were 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯866 ED visits for CHS from 8140 individuals during the study. Overall, the mean (SD) age was 27.4 (10.5) years, with 2834 individuals (34.8%) aged 19 to 24 years, 4163 (51.5%) females, and 1353 individuals (16.6%) with a mental health ED visit or hospitalization in the 2 years before their first CHS ED visit. Nearly 10% of visits (1135 visits [8.8%]) led to hospital admissions. Monthly rates of CHS ED visits increased 13-fold during the 7.5-year study period, from 0.26 visits per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population in January 2014 to 3.43 visits per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population in June 2021. Legalization was not associated with an immediate or gradual change in rates of ED visits for CHS; however, commercialization during the COVID-19 pandemic period was associated with an immediate increase in rates of CHS ED visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.31-1.70). During commercialization, rates of CHS ED visits increased more in women (IRR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.16-1.92) and individuals older than the legal age of cannabis purchase (eg, age 19-24 years: IRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.19-2.16) than men (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85-1.37) and individuals younger than the legal age of purchase (IRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.42-1.45). This cross-sectional study found large increases in CHS ED visits during the period of time when the market commercialized and the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. Greater awareness of CHS symptoms by ED staff in regions where legal commercialized cannabis markets exist is indicated.","Myran, Roberts, Pugliese, Taljaard, Tanuseputro, Pacula","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.31937","20220919","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37859,""

"Integrating Ambulatory Addiction Consultation Service Into a Community Mental Health Center","Despite the escalation in substance related overdose mortality-culminating in more than 100,000 deaths in each of the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic-healthcare systems have not kept up with the demands for care among people who use drugs. There remains a significant gap in access to evidence-based treatment. The addiction consult services has served to address this gap, as a critical intervention that engages mostly hospitalized patients and initiate addiction treatment in acute settings, but little is known about addiction consult services in ambulatory settings. This model of care could potentially serve to scale up the care for people who use drugs in the community by embedding the limited number of addiction professionals within existing ambulatory systems, thus extending their reach. We describe here an innovative, yet simple and potentially replicable model for an ambulatory addiction consultation service in a large, advanced community mental health center.","Jegede, Muvvala, Cahill, Wade, Jordan","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000001081","20220916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37861,""
"Mental health in pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparative study using symptom checklist-90-R","The aim of this study is to search the psychopathological effects of the Coronavirus disease on the patients with psychiatric symptoms on the COVID-19 pandemic process. The study was designed according to the data obtained from 323 patients (171 women and 152 men) who participated in the study pre-COVID-19 period and 423 patients (205 women and 218 men) who participated in the study during COVID-19 period. All participants underwent the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) examination. The SCL-90-R is a psychiatric screening tool that measures the level of reactions elicited by the compulsion or negative stress of individuals. The SCL-90-R was utilized to define psychiatric symptoms and evaluate psychological problems, statistically compared to patient groups with similar demographic and sociocultural characteristics (education level, marital status). There were no statistically significant differences in participants' characteristics for the mean age distribution, marital status, education level, and smoking habits between the groups of pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 period (p&gt;0.05). When comparing the scores of the participants' SCL-90-R Psychological Symptom Screening Scale and its sub-dimensions before and during the COVID-19 period, no statistically significant difference was found between the scores of the participants in both groups (p&gt;0.05). 187 patients (52.97%) had the disease, and 166 patients (47.03%) did not have the disease during COVID-19 period.

Caregivers (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 124) completed online surveys at pre and post evaluation points (average 7Ã‚Â months apart) to assess loneliness, subjective well-being (affect), supportive program usage, and tablet experiences. Family caregivers had positive perceptions of the tablets for both themselves and their family members. Tablets had positive effects on caregiver well-being, including giving them an additional caregiver tool, alleviating stress, increasing satisfaction with quiet time, and improving access to supportive programs. Caregiver positive affect decreased, but no changes were observed for negative affect or loneliness. Family caregivers found value in the tablets and showed improvements in some aspects of well-being. Randomized trials are needed to more fully assess the benefits of the intervention.

"Destigmatising mental health treatment and increasing openness to seeking treatment: randomised controlled trial of brief video interventions","Despite an elevated risk of psychopathology stemming from COVID-19-related stress, many essential workers stigmatise and avoid psychiatric care. This randomised controlled trial was designed to compare five versions of a social-contact-based brief video intervention for essential workers, differing by protagonist gender and race/ethnicity. We examined intervention efficacy on treatment-related stigma ('stigma') and openness to seeking treatment ('openness'), especially among workers who had not received prior mental healthcare. We assessed effectiveness and whether viewer/protagonist demographic concordance heightened effectiveness. Essential workers (<i>N</i> = 2734) randomly viewed a control video or brief video of an actor portraying an essential worker describing hardships, COVID-related anxiety and depression, and psychotherapy benefits. Five video versions (Black/Latinx/White and male/female) followed an identical 3 min script. Half the intervention group participants rewatched their video 14 days later. Stigma and openness were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. Trial registration: NCT04964570. All video intervention groups reported immediately decreased stigma (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001; Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.10) and increased openness (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001; <i>d</i> = 0.23). The initial increase in openness was largely maintained in the repeated-video group at day 14 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001; <i>d</i> = 0.18), particularly among viewers without history of psychiatric treatment (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001; <i>d</i> = 0.32). Increases were not sustained at follow-up. Female participants viewing a female protagonist and Black participants viewing a Black protagonist demonstrated greater openness than other demographic pairings. Brief video-based interventions improved immediate stigma and openness. Greater effects among female and Black individuals viewing demographically matched protagonists emphasise the value of tailored interventions, especially for socially oppressed groups. This easily disseminated intervention may proactively increase care-seeking, encouraging treatment among workers in need. Future studies should examine intervention mechanisms and whether linking referrals to psychiatric services generates treatment-seeking.","Amsalem, Wall, Lazarov, Markowitz, Fisch, LeBeau, Hinds, Liu, Fisher, Smith, Hankerson, Lewis-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Neria, Dixon","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.575","20220916","COVID-19; Essential workers; intervention; openness to seeking treatment; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37864,""
"The Changing Job of School Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Media Content Analysis of Contributions to Stress","School nurses and unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs) are essential to the health and wellness of school children. However, most US schools do not have a full-time licensed nurse. During the COVID-19 pandemic, school nurses and UAPs have been integral in ensuring that the health needs of students were met. They have seen a marked increase in their responsibilities included implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies, screening for symptoms, testing students and staff, conducting contact tracing and data collection, and ensuring the implementation of rapidly changing COVID-19 guidelines and protocols for schools. The objective of this study was to explore COVID-19 occupational changes and their contributions to stress among school nurses and UAPs through a content analysis of local and national media articles. A Google search of articles published between February 2020 and September 2021 was conducted using the following search terms: 'school nurse', 'COVID-19', 'health aide', 'stress', and 'experiences'. A search was also conducted in Nexis Uni. Articles were included if the topic discussed school nurses or UAPs and COVID-19. All articles that examined nurses in other settings were excluded from the review. We examined topics and themes temporally (from February 2020 to September 2021) and spatially (i.e. the frequency by US state). Overall, 496 media articles discussing school nurses and COVID-19 were included in our review. The highest volume of articles was from September 2021 (22%, 111/496). Other months with relatively high volume of articles included August 2020 (9%, 43/496), January 2021 (10%, 47/496), February 2021 (9%, 44/496), and August 2021 (8%, 39/496). These larger article volumes coincided with notable COVID-19 events, including returning to school in the fall (August 2020 and August 2021), school nurses assisting with vaccine rollouts among adults in the USA (January/February 2021), concerns regarding the delta variant (August/September 2021), and vaccine rollouts for children ages 12-15 (September 2021). The representation of articles spatially (national, state, regional, or local) was 66 (13%) articles at national level, 217 (44%) state level, 25 (5%) regional level, and 188 (38%) local news at the city and/or village level. Pennsylvania had the highest frequency of articles, but when standardized to the state population, Alaska had the highest rate of media per 100 000 people. Three major themes were identified in our analysis: (i) safety; (ii) pandemic-related fatigue/stress; and (iii) nursing shortage/budget. The most represented theme for articles before September 2021 was that of safety. Over time, the themes of pandemic-related fatigue/stress and nursing shortage/budget increased with the most notable increase being in September 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new occupational risks, burdens, and stressors experienced by school nurses and UAPs. School nurses play a critical role in disease surveillance, disaster preparedness, wellness and chronic disease prevention interventions, immunizations, mental health screening, and chronic disease education. Furthermore, they provide a safety net for our most vulnerable children. Given that school nurses were already over-burdened and under-resourced prior to the pandemic, characterization of these new burdens and stressors will inform emergency preparedness resources for school health personnel during future pandemics or outbreaks.","Lowe, Ravi, Gerald, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxac053","20220916","content analysis; emergency preparedness; pandemic; school nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37865,""
"Loneliness and social support as key contributors to burnout among Canadians workers in the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has dramatically affected Western Society's relationship with work and contributed to increased worker burnout. Existing studies on burnout have mostly emphasized workplace culture, leadership, and employee engagement as key contributors to burnout. In this cross-sectional study, we examine the associations between Malach-Pines Short Burnout Measure (MPSBM) scores and participant's self reported personal characteristics, financial strain, workplace conditions, work-life balance, and social inclusion among Canadians living during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To identify the most salient correlates of burnout, Canadian residents, aged 16+, were recruited using paid social media advertisements in French and English to complete a cross-sectional study. Multivariable linear regression and dominance analysis identified the most salient correlates of MPSBM scores. Exposure variables included demographic factors, financial strain, workplace conditions, work-life balance, social support, and loneliness. Among 486 participants, family social support (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.14, 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.23, -0.05), emotional loneliness (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.26, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.18, 0.35), insufficient sleep (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.38, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.16, 0.60) and ""me time"" (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.22, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03, 0.42), and indicators of financial security (e.g., owning vs renting; adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.36, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.54, -0.17; insufficient pay: adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.36, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.54, -0.17) were key burnout indicators.

Our findings suggest that broader, holistic multicomponent approaches that address multiple upstream dimensions of health-including mental health-are likely necessary to prevent and reduce burnout.","Card, Bodner, Li, Lail, Aran, Grewal, Skakoon-Sparling","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12360","20220919","burnout; financial security; loneliness; sleep; social support; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Canada; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37866,""
"Rehabilitation for post-COVID-19 condition through a supervised exercise intervention: a randomized controlled trial","The aim of the study was to compare the outcomes of patients with post-COVID-19 condition undergoing supervised therapeutic exercise intervention or following the self-management WHO (World Health Organization) rehabilitation leaflet. A randomized controlled trial that included 39 participants with post-COVID-19 condition who had a chronic symptomatic phase lasting &gt;12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. Comprehensive medical screening, patient-reported symptoms and cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength were assessed. Patients were randomly assigned to a tailored multicomponent exercise program based on concurrent training for eight weeks (2 supervised sessions per week comprised of resistance training combined with aerobic training (Moderate Intensity Variable Training), plus a third day of monitored Light Intensity Continuous Training), or to a control group which followed the WHO guidelines for rehabilitation after COVID-19. After follow-up, there were changes in physical outcomes in both groups, however, the magnitude of the change pre-post intervention favored the exercise group in cardiovascular and strength markers: VO2max + 5.7%, sit to stand -22.7% and load-velocity profiles in bench press + 6.3%, and half squat + 16.9%, (p&lt;0.05). In addition, exercise intervention resulted in a significantly better quality of life, less fatigue, less depression, and improved functional status, as well as in superior cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength compared to controls (p&lt;0.05). No adverse events were observed during the training sessions.

"Perception of COVID-19 threat, low self-efficacy, and external locus of control lead to psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","While it is well documented that the COVID-19 pandemic has had critical consequences for individuals' mental health, few studies to date have investigated the influence of psychological factors on psychological distress in the context of COVID-19. This study explores the influences of self-efficacy, health locus of control and COVID-19 threat perception on psychological distress (DASS-21). 180 adults completed an online set of standardized questionnaires. Results indicated that self-efficacy had a significant relationship with all three sub-scales of psychological distress. However, COVID-19 threat perception was significantly associated with stress. External health locus of control was significantly associated with depression by the chance externality sub-scale, and stress by the powerful others externality sub-scale. Additionally, external health locus of control was found to moderate the relationship between COVID-19 threat perception and depression.","Haywood, Mason","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2124290","20220916","COVID-19 threat perception; Self-efficacy; anxiety; depression; health locus of control; psychological distress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37868,""
"Prevalence of depression and its associated factors among patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Makkah, Saudi Arabia","In early December 2019, a cluster of acute pneumonia of viral etiology had been identified in Wuhan, China. Later on, it has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing a worldwide pandemic. This pandemic triggered unprecedented health-related psychiatric sequalae. We aim in this study to evaluate the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among confirmed patients with COVID-19. This is a cross-sectional study, we included adult patients more than 18 years old who have been diagnosed with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and managed in a hospital, home, or hotel. A self-administered online questionnaire based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Quick Depression Assessment questionnaire was used. A total of 143 subjects completed the PHQ-9 questionnaire. The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 34%. Prevalence of depression was positively associated with the female gender (<i>p-</i>value = 0.013). Location of COVID-19 management and financial status did not affect the prevalence of depression. The prevalence of depression among patients with COVID-19 is high, which underscores the importance of active screening and management of depression in this population.","Alqurashi, Aldobyany, Touman, Alqahtani, Alsaggaf, Alnashiwaaty, Ghaleb, Mabar, Albanna","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.863215","20220917","COVID-19; PHQ-9; SARS-CoV-2; depression; psychiatric sequalae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37869,""
"COVID-19 related innovation in Aotearoa/New Zealand mental health helplines and telehealth providers - mapping solutions and discussing sustainability from the perspective of service providers","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated interventions resulted in changes in both the demand and supply of mental health services and necessitated agile adaptation and innovation from service providers. The aim of this study was to explore what innovative solutions were adopted in response to COVID-19 and the pandemic control measures, what opportunities and challenges were associated with these innovations, as well as to critically reflect on the longer-term sustainability of the innovations in the context of Aotearoa/New Zealand mental healthcare. We used thematic analysis to analyse the data from the 23 in-depth interviews with helpline employees and general practitioners from 18 service providers that regularly engage in mental healthcare. Two key themes related to COVID-19 and the pandemic control measures were identified from respondents' accounts. These were ""Technological innovations"" and ""Process innovations"" where providers noted types of innovative solutions, and opportunities and challenges associated with those. The themes culminated in a meta theme ""Sustainability of changes to service delivery"" that appeared consistently in each theme and asks to consider how sustainable these innovative solutions might be in the long-term. Namely, sustainability of innovation was questioned in respect to the (a) innovative solutions being the emergency solutions with little or no impact analysis, (b) ""returning back to normal"" due to limited future funding and innovation as a sunk cost, and (c) sporadic and inconsistent innovation between service providers that does not contribute to quality and continuity of care from the systems perspective. COVID-19 and the measures of pandemic control were associated with an increase in innovative solutions from service providers. There were both opportunities and challenges associated with these innovative efforts and the sustainability of innovation was questioned. Future research about COVID-19 related innovation of service provision should focus on service user experiences and empirically measure the innovation safety and efficacy.","Pavlova, Scarth, Witt, Hetrick, Fortune","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.973261","20220917","COVID-19; helplines; innovation; mental health; sustainability; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37870,""
"A mental health survey among young front-line clinicians in high-risk areas during the COVID-19 sporadic epidemic in China","The sporadic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has placed enormous psychological stress on people, especially clinicians. The objective of this study was to examine depression, anxiety, quality of life (QOL), and related social psychological factors among young front-line clinicians in high-risk areas during the COVID-19 sporadic epidemic in China and to provide a reference for formulating reasonable countermeasures. In this cross-sectional study, demographic information, COVID-19-related questions, anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10, PSS-10), and QOL (World Health Organization Quality of Life-brief version, WHOQOL-BREF) were collected. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to test the relationships between anxiety and/or depression and other related problems. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test the relationships among factors influencing QOL. A total of 146 young front-line clinicians were included. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and anxiety-depression comorbidity were 37.7% (95% CI = 29.7-45.6%), 26.0% (95% CI = 18.8-33.2%), and 24.0% (95% CI = 17.0-31.0%), respectively. Severe stress (OR = 1.258, 95% CI = 1.098-1.442, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and insomnia (OR = 1.282, 95% CI = 1.135-1.447, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) were positively correlated with depression. Severe stress (OR = 1.487, 95% CI = 1.213-1.823, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and insomnia (OR = 1.131, 95% CI = 1.003-1.274, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) were positively correlated with anxiety. Severe stress (OR = 1.532, 95% CI = 1.228-1.912, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) was positively correlated with anxiety-depression comorbidity. However, insomnia (OR = 1.081, 95% CI = 0.963-1.214, <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) was not correlated with anxiety-depression comorbidity. The belief that the vaccine will stop the COVID-19 pandemic (OR = 0.099, 95% CI = 0.014-0.715, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) was negatively correlated with anxiety and anxiety-depression comorbidity (OR = 0.101, 95% CI = 0.014-0.744, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Severe stress (B = -0.068, 95% CI = -0.129 to -0.007, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and insomnia (B = -0.127, 95% CI = -0.188 to -0.067, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) were negatively correlated with QOL. The belief that the vaccine could provide protection (B = 1.442, 95% CI = 0.253-2.631, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) was positively correlated with QOL. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and even anxiety-depression comorbidity was high among young front-line clinicians in high-risk areas during the COVID-19 sporadic epidemic in China. Various biological and psychological factors as well as COVID-19-related factors were associated with mental health issues and QOL.

"The Influence of Stress in Modulating the Relationship between Coronavirus Disease-2019 Disease and Sleep Quality","The emotional well-being of health-care employees is critical to the quality of patient care and the efficient operation of health services. Not only has the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) virus caused significant rates of morbidity and mortality around the world but it has also caused sleep disruption, stress, and pandemic-related anxiety among health-care workers. The current study examines associations among COVID-related fear, stress, and sleep quality in health professionals. From January to June 2021, a cross-sectional survey was done in Kerala among doctors, nurses, paramedical workers, and housekeeping employees. About 822 health-care providers from various districts took part in the study by completing a Google forms-based semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire. The data were coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS 20.0. Descriptive statistical analysis, percentages, and ratios were employed to summarize the data. The majority of participants were between the ages of 46 and 55 (35%). Forty-four percent and 46% of respondents, respectively, were concerned about contracting COVID-19 and spreading the virus to others. COVID-19 restrictions were the primary concern of psychological distress among respondents (90%). Approximately one-fourth of the subjects reported using sleep medication, 42% took 30 min or longer to fall asleep, and 39% slept for 6 h or less. Poor sleep quality was reported to be prevalent in 62% of the population. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause significant levels of fear, stress, and sleep disruption in health-care professionals. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic represented a significant threat to their psychological health, and public health strategies should focus on improving it.","Jacob, Thomas, Jo, Mathew, Reshmi","https://doi.org/10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_738_21","20220917","Fear of coronavirus disease-19; health-care workers; mental health; sleep quality; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37872,""
"The presence of psychological distress in healthcare workers across different care settings in Windsor, Ontario, during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Few studies have examined psychological distress in healthcare workers (HCWs) across the care continuum. This study describes distress levels reported by HCWs across care settings and factors associated with distress. A cross-sectional survey of HCWs from Windsor, Ontario, was conducted between May 30th, 2020, and June 30th, 2020. The survey included the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), sociodemographic, frontline status, perceptions of training, protection, support, respect among teams, and professional and personal stressors. Univariate analyses were used to compare across settings and multivariate logistic regression assessed factors associated with distress. Four hundred and three HCWs from the hospital (49.4%), community health and social service (18.4%), first responder (14.7%), primary care (7.9%), home (6.0%), and long-term care (LTC; 4.0%) participated in the survey. Common concerns included fear of transmitting COVID-19 to family, safety on the job, and balancing personal care with work demands. LTC and home-care HCWs reported greater concern about workload and staffing levels, whereas community health workers were more anxious about their financial security. Overall, 228 (74.2%) HCWs who completed the K10 reported high distress, with greater rates among hospital and LTC HCWs. Distress was more likely in HCWs who identified as female, younger than 55, perceived lower respect among team, and experienced greater worry about physical and mental health and managing high workloads. Results showed a high degree of distress experienced by HCWs across care settings and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and work-related stress. Promoting self-care and supportive and collaborative healthcare teams are promising avenues for mitigating symptoms of distress.","Voth, Jaber, MacDougall, Ward, Cordeiro, Miklas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.960900","20220917","COVID-19; healthcare; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological distress; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37873,""
"COVID-19 Courtesy Stigma among Healthcare Providers in India: A Study of Stigma Management Communication and its Impact","In early 2020, the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit India, generating one of the highest rates of infection and death in the world. Meanwhile, healthcare workers experienced stigma and discrimination due to their association with COVID-19 patients. This study analyzed healthcare workers' experience of courtesy stigma in India, the communication strategies they used to manage stigma, and the impact on their mental health. A cross-sectional survey of 150 healthcare workers in India showed that almost 50% experienced discrimination due to their association with COVID-19 patients. Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling, this study found that experience of discrimination was associated with perceived courtesy stigma. Two stigma management strategies (reducing offensiveness and passive acceptance) mediated the relationship between perceived courtesy stigma and perceived stress and depression. Participants also reported engaging in stigma management strategies of bonding with other healthcare professionals and passive acceptance of the stigma more than reducing stigma and displaying/disclosing stigma. We conclude that perhaps due to depletion of cognitive and emotional resources, healthcare workers engaged more in social support (bonding) and passive stigma acceptance strategies to alleviate the stress associated with providing COVID-19 patient care. Practical and theoretical implications are further discussed.","Ranjit, Das, Meisenbach","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2122279","20220916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37874,""
"Effect of an online resourcefulness training in improving psychological well-being of front-line medical staff: a quasi-experimental study","The global COVID-19 pandemic is still not under effective control, and strong workplace supports with comprehensive mental health interventions are urgently needed to help medical staff effectively respond to the pandemic. This study aimed to verify the effect of an online resourcefulness training program on the resourcefulness, and psychological variables of front-line medical staff working in the COVID-19 isolation ward. A pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design with control group was employed. A total of 60 participants working in two isolation wards were recruited via convenience sampling. The two isolation wards were randomly assigned to the control group (isolation ward 1, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30) and the intervention group (isolation ward 2, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30). The participants were trained online by video conferences and WeChat. The control group received conventional training (e.g.,Ã‚Â psychological training, psychological counseling), while the intervention group received a 4-h online resourcefulness training. Both groups learned updated guidelines of COVID-19 simultaneously via video conference. The primary outcomes (resourcefulness, anxiety, depression and coping styles) and the secondary outcome (psychological resilience) were measured before intervention and three time points after intervention. After the intervention and one week after the intervention, the resourcefulness, resilience, and positive response scores of the participants in the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The anxiety and negative response scores in the intervention group were significantly lower than those of the control group (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). One month after the intervention, the scores of resourcefulness, tenacity, and positive response of the intervention group were higher than those of the control group (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that the two groups of participants had statistically significant changes in the time-based effect and group-based effect in resourcefulness, resilience, anxiety scores and coping styles (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The results showed that our online resourcefulness training can significantly improve the resourcefulness, resilience, and positive response scores and effectively reduce anxiety and depression scores of front-line medical staff. This demonstrates that online resourcefulness training would be an effective tool for the psychological adjustment of front-line medical staff in fighting against COVID-19.","Zhang, Jia, Chen, Meng, Zhuang, Chen, Wang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00920-7","20220919","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemics; Psychology; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; COVID-19; Humans; Medical Staff; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37875,""
"Personality traits and hardiness as risk- and protective factors for mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Norwegian two-wave study","Several risk factors for anxious-depressive symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic have been established. However, few studies have examined the relationship between personality traits, hardiness, and such symptomatology during the pandemic. These constructs might serve as risk- and/or protective factors for such mental distress through the pandemic. A sample of 5783 Norwegians responded to a survey at two time points within the first year of the pandemic. The first data collection was in April 2020 (T1) and the second in December 2020 (T2). Measures included the Ten-Item Personality-Inventory, the Revised Norwegian Dispositional Resilience Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. Analyses were performed using Pearson's correlations, multiple linear regression, and a moderation analysis. Anxious-depressive symptomatology in early phases (T1) of the pandemic was the strongest predictor for the presence of such symptomatology 9 months after the outbreak (T2). Personality and hardiness correlated significantly with mental distress at T1 and T2. Personality traits explained 5% variance in symptoms when controlling for age, gender, solitary living, negative economic impact, and mental distress at baseline. Higher neuroticism predicted higher mental distress, whereas higher conscientiousness and extraversion predicted less mental distress. Hardiness did not explain variance in outcome beyond personality traits. Hardiness did not significantly moderate the relationship between neuroticism and mental distress. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism had greater difficulties adapting to the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and were more prone to mental distress. Contrastingly, higher conscientiousness and extraversion may have served as protective factors for mental distress during the pandemic. The current findings might aid identification of vulnerable individuals and groups. Consequently, preventive interventions could be offered to those who need it the most.","Lassen, Hagen, Kvale, Eid, Le Hellard, Solem","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04237-y","20220919","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Hardiness; Personality traits; COVID-19; Humans; Norway; Pandemics; Personality; Protective Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37876,""
"The psychosocial health, experiences and needs of older adults and care partners during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods study","Minimal research has leveraged qualitative data methods to gain a better understanding of the experiences and needs of older adults (OAs) and care partners of OAs with and without Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we: 1) quantitatively evaluated the psychosocial health of community-dwelling OAs; 2) quantitatively evaluated the perceived stress of care partners for OAs; 3) qualitatively characterized the experiences and needs of community-dwelling OAs and their care partners; and 4) explored differences in the experiences of care partners of OAs with and without AD/ADRD during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the New York metropolitan area. In this mixed-methods study, telephone interviews were conducted with 26 OAs and 29 care partners (16 of whom cared for OAs with AD/ADRD) from April to July 2020. Quantitative data included: demographics; clinical characteristics (Katz Index of independence in activities of daily living (Katz ADL) and the Lawton-Brody instrumental activities of daily living scale (Lawton-Brody)); and psychosocial health: stress was assessed via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), social isolation via the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS), loneliness via the DeJong Loneliness Scale (DeJong), and depression and anxiety via the Patient Health Questionnaire-Anxiety and Depression (PHQ). Qualitative questions focused on uncovering the experiences and needs of OAs and their care partners. OAs (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26) were mostly female (57.7%), and White (76.9%), average age of 81.42Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. While OAs were independent (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.60, Katz ADL) and highly functional (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.92, Lawton-Brody), and expressed low levels of loneliness, stress, depression and anxiety (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.95 on DeJong; MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.67 on PSS; MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.05 on PHQ depression; and MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.09 on PHQ anxiety), open-ended questions elicited themes of fear and worry. Care partners (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29) were mostly female (75.9%), White (72.4%), and married (72.4%), and reported moderate stress (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.52 on the PSS), as well as a psychological impact of the pandemic. Early in the pandemic, OAs reported minimal stress and loneliness; this may have been related to their reports of frequent interaction with family, even if only virtually. By contrast, care partners were moderately stressed and worried, potentially more than usual due to the additional challenges they face when trying to meet their loved ones' needs during a pandemic.","Marziliano, Burns, Pampanini, Tom, Ardito, Ilyas, Carney, Diefenbach, Makhnevich, Sinvani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03427-3","20220919","AD/ADRD; COVID-19; Care partner; Older adult; Psychosocial health; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; COVID-19; Caregivers; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37877,""
"Guidelines for the prevention and management of children and adolescents with COVID-19","Children are the future of the world, but their health and future are facing great uncertainty because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In order to improve the management of children with COVID-19, an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts developed a rapid advice guideline at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. After publishing the first version of the rapid advice guideline, the panel has updated the guideline by including additional stakeholders in the panel and a comprehensive search of the latest evidence. All recommendations were supported by systematic reviews and graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Expert judgment was used to develop good practice statements supplementary to the graded evidence-based recommendations. The updated guideline comprises nine recommendations and one good practice statement. It focuses on the key recommendations pertinent to the following issues: identification of prognostic factors for death or pediatric intensive care unit admission; the use of remdesivir, systemic glucocorticoids and antipyretics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; breastfeeding; vaccination; and the management of pediatric mental health. This updated evidence-based guideline intends to provide clinicians, pediatricians, patients and other stakeholders with evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Larger studies with longer follow-up to determine the effectiveness and safety of systemic glucocorticoids, IVIG, noninvasive ventilation, and the vaccines for COVID-19 in children and adolescents are encouraged. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Several clinical practice guidelines for children with COVID-19 have been developed, but only few of them have been recently updated.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for people living with obesity to manage their weight even after undergoing bariatric surgery, which combined with pandemic-related increases in mental health distress, has the potential to adversely impact obesity outcomes such as weight loss and quality of life. Reviews of virtual mental health interventions during COVID-19 have not identified any interventions that specifically address psychological distress or disordered eating in patients with obesity, including those who have had bariatric surgery. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 140 patients across four Ontario Bariatric Centres of Excellence to examine the efficacy of a telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy intervention versus a control intervention (online COVID-19 self-help resources) in postoperative bariatric patients experiencing disordered eating and/or psychological distress. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either group. Changes in the Binge Eating Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale will be examined between groups across time (primary outcomes). Qualitative exit interviews will be conducted, and data will be used to inform future adaptations of the intervention to meet patients' diverse needs during and post-pandemic. This study has received ethics approvals from the following: Clinical Trials Ontario (3957) and the University Health Network Research Ethics Committee (22-5145), the Board of Record. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to enrolling in the study. Results will be made available to patients with bariatric surgery, the funders, the supporting organisations and other researchers via publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

"Understanding the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on railway workers: risks and protective factors","Railway workers have provided an essential service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored the effects of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of railway workers (n = 906) in the UK during the third lockdown period. The online survey included measures of COVID-19 related risk factors (perceived risk, stress, burnout, trauma) and protective factors (resilience coping, team resilience, general help-seeking) associated with mental wellbeing. Responses were analysed using multiple regression and content analysis. COVID-19 related risk factors negatively predicted wellbeing. Higher scores on adaptive resilience, intentions to seek help and team resilience significantly predicted higher mental wellbeing scores. Mental health decline throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns for the future were reported. Building a resilient railway workforce requires attention to staff mental wellbeing and to ensuring that support systems are robust and accessible.","Cogan, McGibbon, Gardiner, Morton","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002711","20220915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37881,""
"Memory alterations after COVID-19 infection: a systematic review","SARS-CoV-2 infection has a wide range of both acute and long-term symptoms. Memory alterations have been frequently reported in studies that explore cognition. The main objective of the systematic review is to update and further analyze the existing evidence of objective memory impairments in long-COVID-19 considering sample and study design characteristics, as well as to explore associations between memory performance and their epidemiological, clinical, and pathological features. A total of 13 studies were identified by searching in PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases up to May 6, 2022. Most studies evaluated verbal component of memory in the short-term and long-term recall up to 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°min and mainly performed a single assessment completed at 4-6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the infection. The samples mainly consisted of middle-aged adults that required hospitalization. Samples were not stratified by sex, age, and severity. Poor verbal learning was reported in most cases (6-58%), followed by deficits in long-term (4-58%) and short-term (4-37%) verbal memory. Visuospatial component of memory was studied less than verbal component, showing impairment of long-term retention of visual items (10-49%). COVID-19 severity in the acute stage was not systematically associated with poor memory performance. Verbal memory deficits were associated with anxiety and depression. The existing literature on objective memory assessment in long-COVID suggests further research is warranted to confirm memory dysfunction in association with epidemiological, pathological, and clinical factors, using both verbal and visuospatial tests, and exploring in deep long-term memory deficits.","Llana, Zorzo, Mendez-Lopez, Mendez","https://doi.org/10.1080/23279095.2022.2123739","20220915","Long-COVID; cognition; memory; neuropsychology; post-acute COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37882,""

"Experiencing Stress During COVID-19: A Computational Analysis of Stressors and Emotional Responses to Stress","This study aims to unveil how COVID-19 affected the experience of stress by focusing on the stressors. Using computational analysis based on a newly developed stressor identification model, we compared the experience of stress expressed by Korean Twitter users before and during the pandemic in terms of (1) the stressors as the source of stress and (2) emotion as the manifestation of stress. Both tweet-level (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°202,556) and user-level (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24,803) analyses revealed that social factors are prevalent sources of stress both before and during the pandemic. Moreover, social stressors increased the most during the pandemic. While stress from social stressors was manifested mainly as sadness before the pandemic, anger became the predominant emotional manifestation during the pandemic. Public health policies and educators should consider social stressors as the predominant source of stress during the pandemic and seek ways to prepare the public better for such threats.","Kang, Kim, Kim, Song, Han","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2022.0052","20220919","sentiment analysis; social media; stress; stressor; Anger; COVID-19; Emotions; Humans; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37884,""
"Effects of home-based intervention of respiratory physiotherapy and telephone-based psychological support for COVID-19 survivors: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Both pulmonary and mental health are affected following hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. Pulmonary rehabilitation therapy has demonstrated benefits in improving mental health, but no validated combined programs that include mental health have been proposed. This article presents the design of a trial that aimed to assess whether the participation in a combined rehabilitation program that include home-based respiratory physiotherapy and telephone-based psychological support is associate with a greater improvement of pulmonary and mental health outcomes 7-12 weeks after COVID-19 hospitalization discharge compared with post hospital usual care provided by a public Peruvian hospital. WAYRA (air in Quechua) was an open-label, unblinded, two-arm randomized controlled trial. We recruited 108 participants aged 18-75 years who were discharged from the hospital after COVID-19 pneumonia that required &gt;6 L/min of supplemental oxygen during treatment. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive the combine rehabilitation program or usual post hospital care provided by a public Peruvian hospital. The intervention consisted of twelve at-home respiratory rehabilitation sessions and six telephone-based psychological sessions. The primary outcome was the six-minute walk distance. Secondary outcomes included lung function, mental health status (depression, anxiety, and trauma) and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (before randomization) and at 7 and 12 weeks after hospital discharge to assess the difference between arms. This study was funded by the Peruvian National Council of Science Technology and Technology Innovation in July 2020. Ethics approval was obtained on September 02, 2020. Recruitment and data collection occurred between October 2020 and June 2021. Results are expected to be published by the end of 2022. WAYRA was the first randomized controlled trial evaluating combined pulmonary-mental health rehabilitation for hospitalized COVID-19 survivors in resource-limited settings, potentially providing a foundation for the cost-effective scaling-up of similar multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs.

All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2022-45143-001). As an international public health emergency panic, Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused substantial impacts on economic and daily life. The public were at high risk of mental health problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This study aimed to evaluate the association between objective/subjective severity of COVID-19 pandemic and PTSS, and explore the moderating role of mindfulness. Using longitudinal and 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) designs, we gathered data from 109 college students who were home-quarantined to examined study hypotheses. In the EMA phase, participants completed questionnaires measuring subjective severity, mindfulness and PTSS three times per day. Objective severity was indicated using the daily new confirmed cases. Then participants completed a follow-up measure of PTSS 2 months later, when the epidemic initially became stable. The results of structural equation modeling showed that state mindfulness moderated the relationship between subjectivity severity of COVID-19 and PTSS. Specifically, the association between subjective severity of COVID-19 and PTSS was positive at the low level of state mindfulness, and negative at the high level of state mindfulness. Trait mindfulness did not moderate the relationship between objectivity severity of COVID-19 and PTSS. Mindfulness-based interventions can be used as preventive mental health education to the daily lives of the general public, and to deal with unpredictable crisis events. Implications of this study are drawn for theory, practice, and research.

"Mental health in Chilean higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic has required important changes in the lifestyles and quality of life of higher education students, generating emotional distress. This study sought to evaluate a predictive model of emotional distress and positive mental health through measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) in Chilean higher education students during the pandemic. To this end, 502 students (67.8% female), aged 18-44 years, were surveyed at two time points during the pandemic, separated by 6 months. Potential predictors included emotional regulation strategies, perceived social support, sociodemographic characteristics, factors related to the pandemic, and students' experiences related to online classes. Findings indicated that PTSS levels were generally stable across the two time points, but PTG levels increased. In addition, emotional regulation strategies (suppression, cognitive reappraisal), perceived social support, and female gender predicted both PTSS and PTG 6 months later; students' number of hours of screen time for school also influenced PTG. Findings enhance understanding of the processes contributing to PTSS and PTG in higher education students. The need to improve quality of life and mental health in higher education students, including individual- and institutional-level strategies, is discussed.

"Self-care behaviors and affect during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","Self-care behaviors aimed at maintaining physical and mental health are often recommended during stressful contexts. We tested emotional predictors of self-care behaviors (healthy eating, exercise, engaging in a hobby, relaxation/meditation, time spent with a supportive person, talking online with friends/family) during the COVID-19 pandemic and their emotional consequences. We hypothesized a reciprocal within-person process whereby positive affect increases self-care behaviors (Hypothesis 1) and self-care behaviors increase positive affect while decreasing negative affect (Hypothesis 2). A 10-day daily diary was completed by 289 adult participants in the United States during spring 2020 when counties in 40 out of 50 states had some form of stay-at-home orders. Lagged analyses for Hypothesis 1 suggested that positive affect did not significantly predict residualized change in self-care behaviors; however, more intense negative affect predicted increased self-care behaviors from one day to the next. Concurrent analyses for Hypothesis 2 indicated most self-care behaviors were associated with more positive affect and some with less negative affect on the same day. Lagged analyses for Hypothesis 2 indicated that self-care behaviors largely did not predict residualized change in positive or negative affect from one day to the next. At the between-person level, people who experienced more positive affect engaged in more self-care behaviors across the sampling period. Self-care behaviors continue to have mental health benefits during stressful environments such as the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. Negative affect can play an adaptive role during times of stress by facilitating self-care.

"Age differences in hedonic adaptation to societal restrictions? Positive and negative affect trajectories during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 33 nations","We examined age group differences in hedonic adaptation trajectories of positive and negative affect (PA/NA) at different arousal levels during the severe societal restrictions that governments implemented to contain the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). Data from 10,509 participants from 33 countries and 12 weekly assessments were used (67% women, aged 18 to 85 +, on average 318 participants per country (<i>SD</i> = 434) and 5.6 assessments (SD = 2.5) per participant). Multilevel models (level 1: assessments, level 2: participants, level 3: countries) were fit to examine trajectories of low to high arousal PA and NA during the phase of tightening societal restrictions, the phase of stable peak restrictions, and the phase of easing restrictions separately. During the entire study period mean levels of PA were lower in emerging and young adults (aged 18-44) than older adults, whereas mean NA levels were higher. During peak societal restrictions, participants reported increasingly more PA, especially high-arousal emotions (<i>d</i> = .36 per month vs. .19 unaroused). NA levels decreased over time, especially high-arousal emotions (<i>d</i> = .35 vs. .14 p/month). These hedonic adaptation trajectories were largely similar across age groups. Nevertheless, up to 30% of the participants increased in NA and up to 6% decreased in PA, against the general trend, demonstrating substantial individual differences in emotional adaptation. Finally, heterogeneity in the effects of time on affect was larger on the individual level than the country level. Emotional recovery trajectories during the first lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic were virtually similar across age groups in 33 countries, across valence and arousal levels, suggesting age advantages in emotional well-being remain restricted to mean-level differences rather than emotion dynamics.

"Child Media Use During COVID-19: Associations with Contextual and Social-Emotional Factors","The aim of this study was to test associations between (1) contextual factors and types of digital media use and (2) types of digital media use and children's social-emotional and sleep outcomes during COVID-19. In February to March 2021, 303 parents of elementary schoolers participated in this cross-sectional survey gathering information on demographics, child school format, contextual factors, duration of types of digital media use, social-emotional outcomes, and sleep. Multivariable regressions examined associations outlined in the objective, adjusting for school format, only child, race/ethnicity, and parental stress, depressive symptoms, education, and material hardship. Children were aged 5 years to younger than 11 years and spent approximately 4 hours on screen media daily. In multivariable analyses, remote school format; greater material hardship; Black, Indigenous, and people of color child race/ethnicity; lower parenting stress; and parent depressive symptoms were associated with longer duration of various digital media. Longer daily duration of streaming video and video chat were associated with higher prosocial scores, while console games, mobile apps/games, and video-sharing platforms were associated with greater problematic media use (PMU) (defined as interfering with adaptive functioning). More time on mobile apps/games, video-sharing platforms, and video streaming was linked with shorter sleep. Lower parenting stress predicted greater digital media use. Greater digital media use during the pandemic may have enabled parents to focus on other needs. Use of media for social connection predicted greater prosocial behaviors. Engagement-prolonging digital media predicted PMU. Pediatric providers may wish to consider family context when addressing digital media use and encourage socially oriented digital media.","Munzer, Torres, Domoff, Levitt, McCaffery, Schaller, Radesky","https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000001125","20220915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37890,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Treatment Adherence Among Children With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","This study determined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adherence to medication among children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Data were collected from April 2020 to April 2022 through face-to-face or telephonic interviews at a virtual paediatric endocrine clinic in Jeddah, KSA. A total of 55 children, with a mean age of 12.9 Ã‚Â± 5.8 years, participated in the study. Most children (32/55, 58%) were administered treatment by their mother. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 51 patients (93%) reported adhering to their CAH treatment. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this number decreased to 49 (89%, p = 0.516). The most common reasons for non-adherence before and after the pandemic included restricted access to medication (supply and financial problems) and challenges in obtaining new prescriptions and refills. These challenges increased after the onset of the pandemic. Before and after the onset of the pandemic, mothers with a university degree were significantly more likely to administer medication than mothers without a university degree, but fathers' education level did not affect their role in medication administration, before or after the onset of the pandemic. This study confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant effect on medication adherence in children with CAH in Jeddah.","Alsulaimani, Mazi, Bawazier, Bahabri, Eibani, Batarfi, Al-Agha","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.27762","20220917","cah treatment compliance; covid-19 and cah; covid-19 pandemic and cah treatment; effect of covid-19 on cah; impact of covid-19 on treatment; lockdown and cah treatment compliance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37891,""

While we have lived in an infodemic environment for more than 2 years, we are more prone to feel overwhelmed by the information and suffer from long-term mental health problems. However, limited research has concentrated on the cause of these threats, particularly in terms of information processing and the context of infodemic. This study proposed and tested moderated mediation pathways from two types of health information behaviors (social media engagement and interpersonal communication) on information overload and mental health symptoms-long-term stress. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between May and June of 2021 among the Malaysian public. The final sample size was 676 (<i>N</i> = 676). A conceptual model was built to guide the data analysis. We conducted structural equation modeling (SEM), moderation and mediation analyses to examine each direct pathway, moderating and mediating effects. According to the pathway analysis, we found that, during the infodemic period, engaging COVID-19 information on social media positively associated with information overload, but interpersonal communication was negatively related to it. As the proximal outcome, there was also a positive association between information overload and the final outcome, perceived stress. The moderation analysis only reported one significant interaction: risk perception weakened the association between social media engagement and information overload. A conditional indirect effect was demonstrated and the indirect associated between social media engagement and perceived stress mediated through information overload was further moderated by COVID-19 risk perception. This research offers new grounds for understanding health information behaviors and their consequences in the COVID-19 infodemic. We particularly highlighted the distinct functions of health information behaviors in causing information overload, as well as the importance of personal health belief in this process. Our proposed model contributes to the strategies of developing health messaging strategies that may be utilized by public health researchers and health educators in the future.","Zhang, Tham, Waheed, Kim, Jeong, Chang, Ahmad","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.924331","20220916","COVID-19 infodemic; Malaysia; health information behaviors; information overload; mental health condition; risk perception; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Infodemic; Mediation Analysis; Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37894,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle among the Saudi population","During COVID-19, major change occurred in the governmental regulations to combat the pandemic. Lifestyle factors are changeable habits and routine behaviors with an impact on physical and mental health. With the pandemic, sudden and radical changes occurred in the lifestyle of people worldwide. The main purpose of the study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle factors including (dietary habits, physical activity, sleeping patterns, smoking, and alcohol use) among the Saudi population. This is a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults residing in Saudi Arabia. An online survey was distributed via social media channels. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the distribution of demographic variables using Chi-square Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. Bowker test, and McNemar's Test were performed to evaluate the effects of lockdown on lifestyle factors. A total of 1051 participants were included in the study. There was a slight decrease in the overall diet score during the pandemic (14.98%) compared to before the pandemic (15.05%) (<i>p</i>-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), indicating poorer dietary intake during the lockdown. Approximately one-fourth of the participants (26.1%) reported following specific eating habits or a restricted diet during the pandemic (<i>p</i>-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). There was increased consumption of most components of dietary intake categories, during the lockdown. An increase in physical activities for three or more times was reported. A higher proportion of respondents reported sleeping nine or more hours a day during the lockdown (10.8%). Similarly, a higher percentage of individuals reported smoking daily during the lockdown (12.2%). As of overall health status, higher percentage of respondents reported poor health status during lockdown (6.1%). This study revealed major changes in lifestyle factors, negative shifts were revealed in dietary habits and smoking patterns. Positive changes were shown in physical activity, drinking water, and sleeping patterns. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 played a major role in changing lifestyle factors among adults in Saudi Arabia. Healthcare providers and public health officials are encouraged to increase awareness of healthy lifestyle factors that strengthen the immune system to combat COVID-19. The Saudi population needs increased awareness programs about healthy lifestyles to be prepared during pandemics.","Alhusseini, Alammari, Ramadan, Ziadeh, Zyadeh, Alshamrani, Qasim, Alamri, Alqahtani","https://doi.org/10.1177/22799036221123156","20220917","COVID-19; Lifestyle; Saudi Arabia; alcohol use; dietary habits; physical activity; quarantine; smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37895,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Women Who Are Refugees and Mothering: A Critical Ethnographic Study","Refugee women often experience trauma and social disconnection in a new country and are at risk of experiencing reduced physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Globally, COVID-19 has affected the health and well-being of the population at large. This critical ethnographic study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 on women who are refugees and mothering in Saskatchewan, Canada. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 27 women who are refugees and mothering young children aged 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and under. This study suggests that during COVID-19, refugee women are at high risk of experiencing add-on stressors due to isolation, difficulty in accessing health care, COVID-19-related restrictions in hospitals, limited follow-up care, limited social support, financial difficulties, and compromised nutrition. During COVID-19, collaborative efforts by nurses, other health-care professionals, and governmental and non-governmental organizations are essential to provide need-based mental health support, skills-building programs, nutritional counseling, and follow-up care to this vulnerable group.","Hirani, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1177/23333936221121335","20220917","COVID-19; Canada; ethnography; impact; mothering; pandemic; refugee; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37896,""
"Predicting a Rapid Transition to Telehealth-Delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy Amid COVID-19: A Mixed Methods Study","The sudden onset of COVID-19 forced mental health therapists to rapidly transition to telehealth services. While some therapists and organizations were able to achieve an expeditious transition, others struggled. Using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework, which outlines key phases that guide the implementation process, the current mixed methods study examined what factors predicted the transition to internet-based Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (iPCIT), a telehealth-delivered evidence-based practice (EBP). We investigated two areas related to the transition: (1) if PCIT therapists transitioned to provide iPCIT and (2) if they made this transition quickly. In Fall 2019, 324 therapists completed a survey about implementing PCIT. After stay-at-home orders, 223 of those therapists completed a follow-up survey about their transition to telehealth, organizational characteristics, their caseloads, and telehealth training. The majority of therapists (82%) transitioned to provide iPCIT, with 48% making the transition in less than a week. Open-ended responses indicated that therapists who did not transition-faced challenges related to limited client resources, a lack of training, and organizational delays. Qualitative findings informed predictors for two logistic regression models that are statistical models that predict the probability of an event occurring, with criterion variables (1) whether therapists transitioned to provide iPCIT and (2) whether they transitioned in less than a week. Results showed that caseload in Fall 2019 and receipt of iPCIT training were associated with iPCIT transition. Organizational setting, resiliency, and baseline caseload predicted rapid transition to iPCIT. Implications regarding supporting the implementation of telehealth delivery of EBPs are discussed.","Rosas, Sigal, Park, Barnett","https://doi.org/10.1007/s43477-022-00057-0","20220917","COVID-19; Implementation; ParentÃ¢â‚¬â€œChild Interaction Therapy; Telehealth; iPCIT","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37897,""
"Higher benefit-risk ratio of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder versus patients with bipolar disorder when compared to controls","Patients with major psychiatric disorders (MPD) that include schizophrenia (SCH), bipolar disorder (BP), and major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in MPD patients have not been fully evaluated. This study aimed to investigate adverse events (AEs)/side effects and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in MPD patients. This retrospective study included 2034 patients with SCH, BP, or MDD who voluntarily received either BBIBP-CorV or Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines, and 2034 matched healthy controls. The incidence of AEs/side effects and the efficacy of COIVD-19 vaccinations among the two groups were compared. The risk ratio (RR) of side effects in patients with MPD was 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.68) after the first dose and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65-0.99) following the second dose, suggesting a significantly lower risk in the MPD group versus healthy controls. The RRs of AEs did not differ between patients and controls. Notably, fully vaccinated patients exhibited a decreased risk of influenza with or without fever compared with controls (RR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.31-0.46; RR=0.23, 95% CI: 0.17-0.30; respectively). Further subgroup comparisons revealed a significantly lower risk of influenza with fever in MDD (RR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.08-0.21) and SCH (RR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.17-0.34) than BP (RR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.69-1.06) compared to controls. We conclude that the benefit-risk ratio of COVID-19 vaccination was more favorable in SCH or MDD versus BP when compared with controls. These data indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and protective in patients with MPD from COVID-19.","Zhu, Tian, Wang, Yu, Liu, Wang, Li, Fang, Jia, Li, Li, Ma, Sun, Ping, Cai, Jiang, Cheng, Chen, Liu, Xu, Xu, Chen, Liu, Yue, Song, Zhuo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Higher+benefit-risk+ratio+of+COVID-19+vaccination+in+patients+with+schizophrenia+and+major+depressive+disorder+versus+patients+with+bipolar+disorder+when+compared+to+controls.","20220917","COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2; bipolar disorder; effectiveness; major depressive disorder; safety; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37898,""
"Participating in extracurricular activities and school sports during the COVID-19 pandemic: Associations with child and youth mental health","In Ontario, Canada, school extracurricular activities and sports were modified or canceled for a prolonged period due to public health restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to examine the association of changes to extracurricular and sport participation and child and youth mental health. Data were collected on child and youth mental health symptoms (<i>n</i> = 908) and participation in extracurricular activities and sports in the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years. Results indicated that pre-COVID (2019-2020) participation in either extracurricular activities or sports was associated with reduced anxiety, inattention, and hyperactivity during the pandemic (ÃŽÂ² range -0.08 to -0.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Participation in either extracurricular activities or sports during-COVID (2020-2021) was associated with lower depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² range -0.09 to -0.10, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Findings suggest that participation in extracurricular activities and/or school sports both before or during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with better mental health outcomes in children and youth.

"Association between chronic low back pain and regular exercise, sedentary behaviour and mental health before and during COVID-19 pandemic: insights from a large-scale cross-sectional study in Germany","Nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a complex symptom with numerous possible causes and influencing factors. Understanding how modifiable factors affect the course of CLBP is important for preventing progression. As the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lifestyle of many people, this study paper assessed whether it also changed the influence of modifiable lifestyle factors (regular exercise and sedentary behaviour) and mental health factors (anxiety and depression) on CLBP pain intensity and disability by comparing the strength of these associations before and during the pandemic. We hypothesised that the importance of regular physical activity and good mental health for CLBP patients would increase during the pandemic. These questions were investigated in a cross-sectional study of insurance claims data and self-reported data from various questionnaires from 3,478 participants in a German CLBP health intervention (2014-2021) by calculating pre- and intra-pandemic odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each variable of interest and outcome. Potential confounders were also considered. Pandemic status was treated as an effect modifier. Based on the date of enrolment, participants were classified as ""pre-pandemic"" or ""pandemic"". Regularly exercisingÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°4Ã‚Â h/week significantly reduced the odds of high disability for men (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 - 0.79, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) and women (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 - 0.563, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) and reduced the probability of severe pain in women (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.65, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Each one-point increase in PHQ-4 score for anxiety and depression increased the OR of high pain intensity by 1.25 points (95% CI 1.18 - 1.34, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). A clear impact of COVID-19 lockdowns was observed. In individuals who exercisedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°4Ã‚Â h/week the OR of high disability was 0.57 (95% CI 0.36 - 0.92, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021) in the pre-pandemic group compared to 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 - 0.56, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) in the pandemic group. The probability of high disability increased from an OR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.33 - 1.52, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) per marginal increase in the PHQ-4 scale before the pandemic, to an OR of 1.73 (95% CI 1.58 - 1.89, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) during the pandemic. The magnitude of association of the factors that influenced high pain intensity and disability increased during the pandemic. On the one hand, the protective effect of regular exercising was greater in participants surveyed during lockdown. On the other hand, a higher risk through anxiety or depression during the lockdown was identified. An additional study with objective measures of sedentary behaviour and physical activity is needed to validate these results. More in-depth investigation of lockdown-induced associations between reduced daily physical activity, increased levels of anxiety and depression, and their effects on CLPB could also be worthwhile. This study used routinely collected data from a CLBP intervention that was previously evaluated and registered in the German Registry of Clinical Trials under DRKS00015463 (04/09/2018). The original ethics approval, informed consent and self-reported questionnaire have remained unchanged and are still valid.","Hochheim, Ramm, Wunderlich, Amelung","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-022-05806-8","20220916","COVID-19; Exercise; Germany; Graded chronic pain scale; Health; Humans; Insurance; Low back pain; Mental health; Odds ratio; Sedentary behaviour; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Germany; Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Sedentary Behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37900,""
"Using Molecular Visualisation Techniques to Explain the Molecular Biology of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations to a General Audience","Since the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2019, the virus responsible for the outbreak-SARS-CoV-2-has continued to evolve. Mutations of the virus' spike protein, the main protein driving infectivity and transmissibility, are especially concerning as they may allow the virus to improve its infectivity, transmissibility, and ability to evade the immune system. Understanding how specific molecular changes can alter the behaviour of a virus is challenging for non-experts, but this information helps us to understand the pandemic we are living through and the public health measures and interventions needed to bring it under control. In response to communication challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we recently developed an online educational application to explain the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations to the general public. We used visualisation techniques such as 3D modelling and animation, which have been shown to be highly effective teaching tools in molecular biology, allowing the viewer to better understand protein structure, function, and dynamics. We also included interactive elements for users to learn actively by engaging with the digital content, and consequently improve information retention.This chapter presents the methodological and technological framework which we used to create this resource, the 'SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutation Explorer' (SSPME). It explains how molecular visualisation and 3D modelling software were used to develop accurate models of relevant proteins; how 3D animation software was used to accurately visualise the dynamic molecular processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission, and antibody evasion; and how game development software was used to compile the 3D models and animations into a comprehensive, informative interactive application on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations. This chapter indicates how cutting-edge visualisation techniques and technologies can be used to improve science communication about complex topics in molecular biology and infection biology to the general public, something that is critical to gaining control of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.","Iannucci, Harvey, Hughes, Robertson, Hutchinson, Poyade","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10889-1_6","20220916","3D animation; 3D modelling; COVID-19; Interactive visualisation; Molecular visualisation; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Humans; Molecular Biology; Mutation; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37901,""
"Perceived weight-related stigma, loneliness, and mental wellbeing during COVID-19 in people with obesity: A cross-sectional study from ten European countries","Increased weight-related stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need to minimise the impacts on mental wellbeing. We investigated the relationship between the perceived changes in the representation of obesity in the media and mental wellbeing during the pandemic in a sample of people with obesity across 10 European countries. We also investigated the potential moderating effect of loneliness. Between September to December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, participants reported data on demographics, mental wellbeing (measured by World Health Organisation Five Wellbeing Index and Patient Health Questionaire-4), loneliness (measured by De Jong Gierveld short scale), and perceived change in the representation of obesity in media (measured by a study-specific question) using the online, cross-sectional EURopean Obesity PatiEnt pANdemic Survey (EUROPEANS). Data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, and shielding status, with random incept for country. The survey was completed by 2882 respondents. Most identified as female (56%) and reported their ethnicity as White or White-mix (92%). The total sample had a mean age of 41 years and a BMI of 35.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg/m<sup>2</sup>. During the peak of the pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic, perceiving more negative representation of people with obesity on social media was associated with worse psychological distress, depression, and wellbeing. Perceiving more positive representation, compared to no change in representation, of people with obesity on television was associated with greater wellbeing, yet also higher psychological distress and anxiety. Loneliness, as a moderator, explained Ã¢â€°Â¤0.3% of the variance in outcomes in any of the models. Perceiving negative representation of obesity on social media was associated with poorer mental wellbeing outcomes during the pandemic; positive representation on television was associated with both positive and negative mental wellbeing outcomes. We encourage greater media accountability when representing people with obesity.","Jones, Christiansen, Maloney, Duckworth, Hugh-Jones, Ahern, Richards, Brown, Flint, Robinson, Bryant, Halford, Hardman","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-022-01220-1","20220918","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37902,""
"Experiences of COVID-19 patients in a Fangcang shelter hospital in China during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative descriptive study","This study aimed to examine COVID-19 patients' experiences in a Fangcang shelter hospital in China, to provide insights into the effectiveness of this centralised isolation strategy as a novel solution to patient management during emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design. Data were collected by individual semistructured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. This study was undertaken in 1 of the 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China between 28 February 2020 and 7 March 2020. Fangcang shelter hospitals were temporary healthcare facilities intended for large-scale centralised isolation, treatment and disease monitoring of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases. These hospitals were an essential component of China's response to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 27 COVID-19 patients were recruited by purposive sampling. Eligible participants were (1) COVID-19 patients; (2) above 18 years of age and (3) able to communicate effectively. Exclusion criteria were (1) being clinically or emotionally unstable and (2) experiencing communication difficulties. Three themes and nine subthemes were identified. First, COVID-19 patients experienced a range of psychological reactions during hospitalisation, including fear, uncertainty, helplessness and concerns. Second, there were positive and negative experiences associated with communal living. While COVID-19 patients' evaluation of essential services in the hospital was overall positive, privacy and hygiene issues were highlighted as stressors during their hospital stay. Third, positive peer support and a trusting patient-healthcare professional relationship served as a birthplace for resilience, trust and gratitude in COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that, while sacrificing privacy, centralised isolation has the potential to mitigate negative psychological impacts of social isolation in COVID-19 patients by promoting meaningful peer connections, companionship and support within the shared living space. To our knowledge, this is the first study bringing patients' perspectives into healthcare service appraisal in emergency shelter hospitals.","Zhong, Zhao, Lee, Yu, Liu, Ji","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065799","20220916","COVID-19; INFECTIOUS DISEASES; Public health; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; COVID-19; Hospitals; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Mobile Health Units; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37903,""
"Surveying Hate and Its Effects During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders","<b>Objectives.</b> To summarize data collection on anti-Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI) experiences during COVID-19 and measure the associations of anti-AANHPI hate incidents with mental health, health access, and public safety among AANHPI adults. <b>Methods.</b> We cataloged COVID-19 surveys conducted in 2020 and 2021 on anti-AANHPI experiences. We then analyzed the 2020 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) AANHPI COVID-19 module by constructing a variable of experiencing or witnessing a hate incident and estimating its associations with serious psychological distress, forgone care, and perceived neighborhood safety. <b>Results.</b> Estimates of being a victim of a hate incident ranged from 6% to 30%. In the CHIS, 28% of respondents experienced or witnessed a hate incident. Experiencing or witnessing a hate incident was significantly associated with serious psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.33), forgoing care (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.27), and not feeling safe in one's neighborhood (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.70). <b>Conclusions.</b> Evidence from a multitude of data sources corroborates the toll of hate incidents suffered by AANHPIs.

"Fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19","Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been approved for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a variety of anxiety disorders; it is available as an oral preparation. Fluvoxamine has not been approved for the treatment of infections, but has been used in the early treatment of people with mild to moderate COVID-19. As there are only a few effective therapies for people with COVID-19 in the community, a thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of fluvoxamine as an anti-inflammatory and possible anti-viral treatment for COVID-19, based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs), is needed. To assess the efficacy and safety of fluvoxamine in addition to standard care, compared to standard care (alone or with placebo), or any other active pharmacological comparator with proven efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients. We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv), Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on COVID-19 to identify completed and ongoing studies up to 1 February 2022. We included RCTs that compared fluvoxamine in addition to standard care (also including no intervention), with standard care (alone or with placebo), or any other active pharmacological comparator with proven efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, in both inpatients and outpatients. Co-interventions needed to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing fluvoxamine to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy. We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence to treat people with asymptomatic to severe COVID-19 for the primary outcomes including mortality, clinical deterioration, clinical improvement, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events of any grade, and suicide or suicide attempt. We identified two completed studies with a total of 1649 symptomatic participants. One study was conducted in the USA (study with 152 participants, 80 and 72 participants per study arm) and the other study in Brazil (study with 1497 high-risk participants for progression to severe disease, 741 and 756 participants per study arm) among outpatients with mild COVID-19. Both studies were double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which participants were prescribed 100 mg fluvoxamine two or three times daily for a maximum of 15 days. We identified five ongoing studies and two studies awaiting classification (due to translation issues, and due to missing published data). We found no published studies comparing fluvoxamine to other pharmacological interventions of proven efficacy. We assessed both included studies to have an overall high risk of bias. Fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 in inpatients We did not identify any completed studies of inpatients. Fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients Fluvoxamine in addition to standard care may slightly reduce all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.27; risk difference (RD) 9 per 1000; 2 studies, 1649 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce clinical deterioration defined as all-cause hospital admission or death before hospital admission (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.89; RD 57 per 1000; 2 studies, 1649 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain regarding the effect of fluvoxamine on serious adverse events (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.03; RD 54 per 1000; 2 studies, 1649 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or adverse events of any grade (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37; RD 7 per 1000; 2 studies, 1649 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Neither of the studies reported on symptom resolution (clinical improvement), quality of life or suicide/suicide attempt. Based on a low-certainty evidence, fluvoxamine may slightly reduce all-cause mortality at day 28, and may reduce the risk of admission to hospital or death in outpatients with mild COVID-19. However, we are very uncertain regarding the effect of fluvoxamine on serious adverse events, or any adverse events. In accordance with the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials as they arise, to complete any gaps in the evidence.","Nyirenda, Sofroniou, Toews, Mikolajewska, Lehane, Monsef, Abu-Taha, Maun, Stegemann, Schmucker","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015391","20220916","COVID-19; Clinical Deterioration; Fluvoxamine; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37905,""
"Self-reported Illness Experiences and Psychosocial Outcomes for Reservation-Area American Indian Youth During COVID-19","Impacts of COVID-19 on reservation-area American Indian youth are unknown and may be substantial owing to the significant COVID-19 morbidity and mortality experienced by American Indian populations. To measure self-reported illness experiences and changes in psychosocial factors during the COVID-19 pandemic among reservation-area American Indian youth. This cross-sectional study included a random sample of US schools on or near US Indian reservations during Spring 2021, stratified by region, with students in grades 6 to 12 completing cross-sectional online surveys. All enrolled self-identifying American Indian students in grades 6 to 12 attending the 20 participating schools were eligible to be surveyed; participants represented 60.4% of eligible students in these schools. Data were analyzed from January 5 to July 15, 2022. Onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest were COVID-19 self-reported illness outcomes for self and family and close friends; perceived changes in family and friend relationships, school engagement, social isolation, and other psychological factors since the COVID-19 pandemic began; and worry over COVID-19-related health outcomes. A total of 2559 American Indian students (1201 [46.9%] male; 1284 [50.2%] female; 70 [2.7%] another gender; mean [SD] 14.7 [8.9] years) were included in the analysis. Approximately 14% of the sample reported having had a test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (14.3% [95% CI, 11.4%-17.6%]), a higher rate than for all cases nationally at the time of the survey. Regarding prevalence of COVID-19 among family and close friends, 75.4% (95% CI, 68.8%-80.9%) of participants reported having at least 1 family member or friend who had contracted COVID-19, while 27.9% (95% CI, 18.8%-39.3%) of participants reported that at least 1 family member or close friend had died of COVID-19. Regarding psychosocial impacts, COVID-19 was associated with strained friend relationships (eg, 34.0% [95% CI, 28.4%-40.0%] of students reported worry over losing friends), lower school engagement, and less social connectedness (eg, 62.2% [95% CI, 56.7%-67.4%] of students reported feeling less socially connected to people), although more than 60% of students also reported feeling no change or a decrease in negative emotions. Males were less likely to report perceived negative impacts, especially for negative emotions such as sadness (29.2% [95% CI, 23.3%-35.9%] of males vs 46.1% [95% CI, 43.9%-48.3%] of females reported feeling more sad) and anxiety (21.8% [95% CI, 18.2%-25.8%] of males vs 39.2% [95% CI, 34.1%-44.6%] of females reported feeling more anxious). This cross-sectional study provides novel insight into the perceived experiences of reservation-area American Indian youth, a population at uniquely elevated risk of poor health status and health care access, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although mortality and morbidity rates from COVID-19 were high on American Indian reservations, student reports of psychosocial impacts were complex and suggest many students were resilient in the face of the pandemic. These findings could be used to understand and address the challenges facing American Indian youth due to the pandemic and to guide future research that examines the factors and processes associated with the reported outcomes.","Stanley, Crabtree, Swaim, Prince","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.31764","20220916","Adolescent; American Indians or Alaska Natives; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37906,""
"Neurological Consequences, Mental Health, Physical Care, and Appropriate Nutrition in Long-COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a collapse of the world health systems. Now, vaccines and more effective therapies have reversed this crisis but the scenario is further aggravated by the appearance of a new pathology, occurring as SARS-CoV-2 infection consequence: the long-COVID-19. This term is commonly used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute infection of COVID-19 up to several months. In this review, the consequences of the disease on mental health and the neurological implications due to the long-COVID are described. Furthermore, the appropriate nutritional approach and some recommendations to relieve the symptoms of the pathology are presented. Data collected indicated that in the next future the disease will affect an increasing number of individuals and that interdisciplinary action is needed to counteract it.","Picone, Sanfilippo, Guggino, Scalisi, Monastero, Baschi, MandalÃƒÂ , San Biagio, Rizzo, Giacomazza, Dispenza, Nuzzo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01281-w","20220917","Long-COVID-19; Long-COVID-19 neurological implications; Nutrition and physical activity in long-COVID-19; Psychological care in long-COVID-19 patients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37907,""
"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients having followed virtual reality therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy: a content analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic led to exacerbation of mental health symptoms and deterioration in psychological well-being in individuals suffering from schizophrenia. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients suffering from treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) having undergone virtual reality therapy (VRT) or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on their symptomatology. The secondary objective is to identify the differences and similarities in relation to the response to the COVID 19 pandemic between these two groups of patients. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews was conducted with 42 patients suffering from TRS who had previously followed VRT or CBT. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed. Four themes emerged in this study: Psychotherapeutic Interventions, Impact of COVID-19 and Public health and safety policies, Substance use and Psychiatric follow-up. Participants from both groups reported that their therapy was beneficial in controlling AVH. Patients having followed CBT reported more depressive symptoms whereas patients having followed VRT reported more anxious symptoms. This study offers a first qualitative insight in patients suffering from TRS and the impacts of COVID-19 on them and opens the door to the protective factors of CBT and VRT for this specific population.","Hudon, LÃƒÂ©veillÃƒÂ©, Sanchez-Schicharew, Dellazizzo, Phraxayavong, Dumais","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2121852","20220915","COVID-19; avatar therapy; cognitive behavioural therapy; schizophrenia; virtual reality therapy; COVID-19; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Hallucinations; Humans; Pandemics; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenia, Treatment-Resistant; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37908,""
"Professional grief among nurses in Spanish public health centers after caring for COVID-19 patients","The aim of the present study is to investigate the professional grief suffered by nurses in various medical units, after coping with the COVID-19 pandemic for the last 18 months. Addressing and acknowledging the reality of professional grief is of fundamental importance to nurses' mental health, as this condition has both professional and personal consequences. A qualitative, content analysis approach was taken. Based on 25 interviews with nursing professionals working in different health centers units were performed. The following sampling schemes were used: first, convenience sampling, then nominated sampling, and finally theoretical sampling. From our analysis of the data obtained, three main themes were identified: the impact on nurses of COVID-19 outcomes; the symptoms of professional grief; and cognitive reactions. These core elements interacted with 12 subtopics, including symptoms of grief and the cognitive impact produced. A large proportion of the nurses consulted in this study have suffered and suffered professional grief and report many related symptoms. In response to the present pandemic and any future occurrence, the question of professional grief needs to be addressed. To help them cope better with this type of situation, nurses should receive appropriate training. Moreover, healthcare institutions should be made aware of the problem and be encouraged to offer assistance to address the impact produced on nurses by the deaths of their patients. This study shows the impact of professional grief on nurses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses are affected personally by the deaths of patients and by alterations to their working conditions. In many cases, this grief remains unresolved and its various symptoms persist.","VÃƒÂ¡zquez-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, AyllÃƒÂ³n-PÃƒÂ©rez, GutiÃƒÂ©rrez-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Valero-Cantero, Fernandez-OrdoÃƒÂ±ez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-GÃƒÂ¡mez, Casals","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12809","20220914","coronavirus infection; grief; mental health; nurse-patient relations; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37909,""
"A systematic review of the literature on telepsychiatry for bipolar disorder","Bipolar (BP) disorder is a highly morbid disorder that is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed and affects a large number of adults and children. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 public health emergency stay at home orders, most outpatient mental health care was provided via telepsychiatry, and the many benefits of virtual care ensure that this will continue as an ongoing practice. The main aim of this review was to investigate what is currently known about the use of telepsychiatry services in the diagnosis and treatment of BP disorder across the lifespan. A systematic literature review assessing the use of telepsychiatry in BP disorder was conducted in PubMed, PsychINFO, and Medline. Six articles were included in the final review. All included articles assessed populations aged 17 years or older. The literature indicates that BP disorder was addressed in telepsychiatry services at a similar rate as in-person services, reliable diagnoses can be made using remote interviews, satisfaction rates are comparable to in-person services, telepsychiatry services are able to reach and impact patients with BP disorder, are sustainable, and patient outcomes can improve using a telepsychiatry intervention. Given the morbidity of BP disorder, the research addressing the telepsychiatry diagnosis and treatment of BP disorder is sparse, with only emerging evidence of its reliability, effectiveness, and acceptance. There is no research assessing the safety and efficacy of telepsychiatry in pediatric populations with BP disorder. Given the morbidity associated with BP disorder at any age, further research is needed to determine how to safely and effectively incorporate telepsychiatry into clinical care for BP adult and pediatric patients.","Farrell, George, Amado, Wozniak","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2743","20220914","bipolar disorder; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37910,""
"The influences of depression and loneliness on A1C among middle-aged and older adults with diabetes","Even before increased social isolation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, 43% of adults aged 60 and older reported experiencing loneliness. Depression and loneliness often co-exist and are significant issues faced by middle-aged as well as older adults because each condition is likely to worsen health outcomes. This study of middle-aged and older adults examined how depression and loneliness affect diabetes (DM) control (A1C levels). This study is a secondary analysis of data from the Midlife in the United States Refresher (MIDUS-R) survey, a national survey of adults aged 25-74Ã‚Â years. Correlation analyses were conducted, and a hierarchical logistic regression was estimated to predict A1C levels Ã¢â€°Â¤7% (recommended goal) or &gt;7 using 1) demographics and physical health (ethnicity, gender, education, age, and comorbidities), 2) family and friend support, and 3) depression and loneliness. The sample of 92 participants with DM and A1C data from the MIDUS-R had mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 57.37, were 51% male, 68% non-Hispanic White; 39.1% had A1C &gt;7. The average level of depression was low (CES-D mean 9.42) and loneliness was moderate (UCLA scale mean 12.43). Loneliness was correlated with A1C (<i>r</i>=Ã‚Â .26, <i>p</i>&lt;Ã‚Â .05); depressive symptoms (<i>r</i>=Ã‚Â .71, <i>p</i>&lt;Ã‚Â .001), family and friends support (<i>r</i>=Ã‚Â -.36, <i>r</i>=Ã‚Â -.38, respectively, both <i>p</i>&lt;Ã‚Â .001). Only loneliness significantly predicted higher A1C levels. People with higher levels of loneliness had increased odds of having A1C &gt;7 (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.18, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .05) after controlling for depression and all other variables. Loneliness had a greater impact than depression on A1C level among persons with DM. Healthcare providers should assess patients for loneliness as well as depression and reduce adverse health impacts by referring to psychosocial support as needed.","Huang, Cho, Kuo, GarcÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2124287","20220914","Depression; MIDUS; diabetes; loneliness; social connectedness; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37911,""

This paper discusses the development of the iHV Emotional Wellbeing at Work (EWW) Champions Programme, which has built on the original model to enable the creation of EWW Champions. The iHV has a good track record of building leadership and capacity for rolling out training and development on a wider scale using the iHV Champions model of training. The portfolio currently includes a range of Perinatal and Infant Mental Health Champions (Baldwin and Kelly, 2016; Baldwin et al., 2018) [1,2], Research Champions (Mugweni et al., 2019) [3], Delivering Different News Champions, Healthy Weight and Healthy Nutrition Champions, Changing Conversations: Autism Ambassadors, and Neonatal Families Ambassadors. This paper discusses how the EWW programme was further developed to create this Champions' model to enable other experienced and skilled health visitors to become EWW facilitators.

"Opportunistic Risk Screening of Depression by Community Pharmacists: Noble Intervention to Mend the Mind during COVID-19","Depression is the most common condition affecting the mental health of individuals. During the whole lifetime, at least one in four individuals go through an episode of this disorder. Recently, the Malaysian number of cases has increased to around 500,000 with more adding due to COVID-19 pandemic. The first professionals to detect depression by analysing the rather emotional, presenting symptoms of the patient are the family physicians. In such circumstances, how is it possible for a community pharmacist to identify undiagnosed depression? Depression is real, sadly, the silent nature of the disorder results in an increase in its unreported cases. On the bright side we believe the new screening guidelines and intervention of community pharmacists might be one noble way to aid in the opportunistic risk screening of depression and heal the hidden emotions during COVID-19.","Chidambaram","https://doi.org/10.21315/mjms2022.29.4.15","20220915","community pharmacies; community pharmacists; depressive symptoms; family physicians; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37913,""
"Trends in psychotropic drug consumption among French military personnel during the COVID-19 epidemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic may have had significant mental health consequences for military personnel, which is a population already exposed to psychological stress. To assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed the dispensing of three classes of psychotropic drugs (anxiolytics, hypnotics, and antidepressants) among French military personnel. A retrospective analysis was conducted using the individualized medico-administrative data of persons insured by the National Military Social Security Fund from the National Health Data System. All active French military personnel aged 18-64 who received outpatient care and to whom drugs were dispensed between January 1, 2019, and April 30, 2021, were included from the French national health database. Rate ratios of dispensed anxiolytics, hypnotics and antidepressants (based on drug reimbursement) were estimated from negative binomial regressions before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three hundred eighty-one thousand seven hundred eleven individuals were included. Overall, 45,148 military personnel were reimbursed for anxiolytics, 10,637 for hypnotics, and 4328 for antidepressants. Drugs were dispensed at a higher rate in 2020 and 2021 than in 2019. There was a notable peak at the beginning of the first lockdown followed by a decrease limited to the duration of the first lockdown. During the first lockdown only, there were temporary phenomena including a brief increase in drug dispensing during the first week followed by a decrease during the rest of lockdown, possibly corresponding to a stocking-up effect. For the study period overall, while there was a significant downward trend in psychotropic drug dispensing before the occurrence of COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), the pandemic period was associated with an increase in dispensed anxiolytics (rate ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), hypnotics (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11-1.16, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and antidepressants (rate ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.13, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) in the military population. The COVID-19 pandemic has probably had a significant impact on the mental health of French military personnel, as suggested by the trends in dispensed psychotropic drugs. The implementation of mental health prevention measures should be investigated for this population.","Sanchez, Fuchs, Tubert-Bitter, Mariet, Jollant, Mayet, Quantin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02497-9","20220915","COVID-19; Military personnel; Psychotropic drugs; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Military Personnel; Pandemics; Psychotropic Drugs; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37914,""
"Sexual Desire in the Time of COVID-19: How COVID-Related Stressors Are Associated with Sexual Desire in Romantic Relationships","The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures have caused widespread social and economic disruptions, resulting in spikes in unemployment and financial instability, along with drastic changes to people's ability to feel socially connected. Many of the changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are risk factors for depressive symptoms, which are associated with lower levels of sexual desire. The current research (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4,993) examined whether responses to external stressors brought on by COVID-19 (i.e., financial concern, worry, loneliness, stress) were associated with sexual desire among a multi-national sample of people in relationships (Studies 1-2), and whether this association was, in part, due to reports of depressive symptoms (Study 2). In the period immediately following the onset of the pandemic, more financial concern (Study 1) and worry (Study 2) were associated with higher sexual desire, while other factors, like stress (Studies 1-2), were associated with lower desire. We also followed a subset of participants every two weeks during the initial stages of the pandemic and at times when people reported greater stress, loneliness, financial strain, or worry than their average, they reported greater depressive symptoms, which was, in turn, associated with lower sexual desire. Results suggest that the social isolation and stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have mixed associations with sexual desire at the onset of the pandemic. But over time, when people report heightened COVID-related stressors, they tend to report lower sexual desire for their partner, in part because these stressors are associated with more depressive symptoms.","Balzarini, Muise, Zoppolat, Gesselman, Lehmiller, Garcia, Slatcher, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-022-02365-w","20220917","COVID-19; Financial strain; Loneliness; Romantic relationships; Sexual desire; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37915,""

This study aimed to investigate female Indonesian migrant workersâ€™ (PMI) experience in Macau and Hong Kong during the start of the pandemic. Methods: A total of 399 female PMI completed the online survey between February and March 2020. They had an average age of 36 years old and the majority (78%) worked as domestic workers. Results: As many as 39% of participants had negative experiences related to their employment like termination before the contract ends. Thirty-two percent had difficulties in obtaining facemasks, for example, long queues at the pharmacy. In accessing information related to COVID-19, one-third of participants received it from unreliable sources and hard to find information in the Indonesian language. Participants worried if their income would decrease and being quarantined. They also worried if friends and employers would treat them differently if they go to the doctor because of fever and/or acute cough. Participants self-reported symptoms of anxiety (28%) and depression (35%), which correlated with their worry and trust in the stakeholders. Conclusion: To decrease the worry of PMI, the distribution of accurate information and prompt action from the stakeholders are crucial at the start of the pandemic.","Andrian Liem et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01F8-46E-B7A","20220920","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; social protection; covid-19 pandemic; health of migrant workers; health services; psychological disorders","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37916,""
"Flexibility predicts chronic anxiety and depression during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ A longitudinal investigation of mental health trajectories","The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant stressor potentially putting the well-being of the general population at risk. However, a significant proportion of the population exhibits resilience, raising questions regarding psychological constructs that could contribute to resilient coping. Studies indicate that flexibility, defined as the ability to adapt to changing contextual demands by employing a variety of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral strategies, may significantly contribute to coping with long-term stressors such as COVID-19. Cognitive and coping flexibility domains and longitudinal trajectories of anxiety and depression were assessed at three time points across a 13-months period in 571 Israelis. Analyses revealed four different trajectories for anxiety: resilient (66%), chronic (22%), emerging (7%) and improving (6%), and two trajectories for depression: resilient (87%) and chronic (13%). Individuals in the chronic trajectory group (for both anxiety and depression) exhibited lower levels of cognitive flexibility and coping flexibility as compared to individuals in the resilient trajectory group. Across time, anxiety and depression were linked to clinically significant PTSD-like symptoms. Cognitive and coping flexibility were linked to the probability of experiencing chronic mental health problems, making them a potential target for prevention and treatment.","Alla Hemi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0094-B59-0AF","20220918","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; depression; anxiety; longitudinal trajectories; stress exposure; flexibility","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-20","",37917,""
