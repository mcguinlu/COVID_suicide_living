"Survey on Mental Health Status in Iranian Population Aged 15 and Above One Year after the Outbreak of COVID-19 Disease: A Population-Based Study","Background: Mental disorders are the most common health problems that affect different population groups. According to the national survey in 2015 based on General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), 23.44% of Iranians older than 15 years were suspected of having a mental disorder. The study aimed to determine the mental health status of the population over 15 years of age in the Islamic Republic of Iran, one year after the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Methods: The population-based study was performed on 24584 individuals over 15 years of age in Iran between December and February, 2020. The GHQ-28 was completed through telephone interviews. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent t-test, and multiple logistic regression at 95% confidence level. Results: The results showed that the mean age of participants was 44.18Â±16.47 years. The prevalence of mental disorders was 29.7%. Mental disorder was associated with female gender (OR=1.195, 95% CI 1.10â€“1.29), 25â€“44 years (OR=1.206, 95% CI 1.06â€“1.36), urban life (OR=1.116, 95% CI 1.04â€“1.19), illiteracy (OR=1.286, 95% CI 1.11â€“1.48), being divorced (OR=1.924, 95% CI 1.50â€“ 2.45), and unemployment (OR=1.657, 95% CI 1.40â€“1.94). Among the participants and their families, 14.7% and 32.3% were infected with the disease, respectively. The COVID-19 mortality rate in their families was 13.2%. The prevalence of mental disorders in infected people (40% vs. 27.3%) and bereaved families (39.6% vs. 35.3%) was more than the non-infected groups. Conclusion: Our results showed that in Iran, the mental health of the general population had a rising trend compared to 2015, especially in people infected with COVID-19 and bereaved families. The observed difference may be due to the prevalence of the COVID-19 epidemic and rapid demographic, social, and economic changes in Iran. Planning to improve mental health in the mentioned population should be considered for the post COVID-19 era.","Ahmad Ali, Noorbala, Maleki, Azam, Seyed Abbas Bagheri, Yazdi, Faghihzadeh, Elham, Hoseinzadeh, Zarrintag, Hajibabaei, Marzieh, Seyedeh Elham, Sharafi, Kamali, Koorosh","https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2022.35","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Iranian Medicine; 25(4):201-208, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34167,""
"Who takes care of those who care? - a survey on the mental health of health professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world's scenarios as well as the routines and ways of living. Health professionals are part of the population acting in the front line, and in turn, they have become a risk group, which causes feelings such as stress and anxiety, with some may even showing signs of depression. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to characterize the presence of signs of anxiety, stress and depression and relate them to social skills in 70 health professionals in a city in Parana. For the evaluation of such variables, the HAD Instrument Scale was used to evaluate signs/symptoms of anxiety and depression, with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) also being used to evaluate the stress variable, in addition to an adapted open questionnaire (CABALLO, 2003) for social skills. From the results obtained, it could be observed that the majority of the participants presents signs of depression (79.7%), as well as signs of anxiety (78.6%). Furthermore, they also present high levels of stress when compared to the Brazilian normative sample. Thus, it can be understood that health professionals are predisposed to presenting high results, since they are exposed to a stressful and high-risk context and are also in need of caring strategies. Furthermore, it is important to further expand studies in the area, given that the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is something new and therefore, requires new forms of confrontation.","Nazar, T. C.

"Has COVID-19 increased the intention to undertake health tourism? Examination using a conditional process model","As the major public health emergency with the fastest spread, the greatest range, and the most difficulty in controlling recently, COVID-19 has created a huge shock and exerted an impact on public physical and mental health. Health tourism is an effective way of alleviating the general public's physical and mental health. Thus, it is necessary to examine the event strength of COVID-19 with respect to the willingness to undertake health tourism. Such research into tourists' behavior following the spread of COVID-19 could help identify potential areas of development for the tourism industry in the period of the pandemic under normal control. Many studies have investigated the negative shock and impact of COVID-19. However, little research has focused on behavioral responses in that regard. Hitherto, studies have ignored development opportunities in the tourism industry following COVID-19. By applying the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model and event system theory, we conducted a survey among 313 participants by means of an online questionnaire. Using the structural equation modeling technique, we aimed to identify the effect of recognizing the event strength of COVID-19 (novelty recognition, disruption recognition, criticality recognition) on the intention to undertake health tourism;we did so by taking into account the mediating role of risk perception and moderating role of risk communication. We obtained the following findings. (1) The novelty recognition of the event strength of COVID-19 tended to decrease the willingness to undertake health tourism;disruption recognition did not affect that intention. However, criticality recognition did increase such willingness.(2) Novelty recognition exerted a negative impact on risk perception;criticality and disruption recognition positively improved risk perception. (3) Novelty and criticality recognition indirectly affected the intention to undertake health tourism through the partial mediating effect of risk perception. Disruption recognition indirectly affected such intention through the mediating role of risk perception.(4) Risk communication did not directly promote the intention to undertake health tourism, but it did moderate the impact of risk perception with respect to such intention. Thus, releasing more risk information makes the public more aware of health matters, which increases the intention to undertake health tourism. This study makes an important contribution to research and tourism management. First, we constructed and empirically examined a conceptual framework using the SOR model: it provided a good theoretical framework to analyze the mechanism between recognition of event strength and the intention to undertake health tourism;it broadens the application possibilities of the SOR model. Second, we clarified practical means for developing the tourism industry in the period of the pandemic under normal control;examples here are the wellness tourism industry promoting the planning and design of wellness tourism products as well as increasing investment in safety and sanitation. Such measures could also help improve risk communication, raise public awareness of risk and wellness, and promote wellness tourism.","Cheng, Yun, Yin, Jie","https://doi.org/10.19765/j.cnki.1002-5006.2021.00.020","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Tourism Tribune; 37:4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34169,""
"Mental Health Outcomes and Sleep Status among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019","Objective: The immediate impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mental health of affected patients and psychiatric morbidities of these patients has been neglected by researchers. We assessed mental health outcomes and sleep status among inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 who were initially referred to our COVID-19 clinic in Mashhad, Iran during April-October 2020. Method: In this ethically approved cross-sectional study, 130 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were referred to outpatient clinics and wards of a referral hospital in Mashhad, Iran were surveyed during April-October 2020. Demographic data were collected after obtaining informed written consent. Validated Persian versions of insomnia severity index (ISI), 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), and 7-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) and revised impact of event scale (IES-R) were used as main outcome measures (i.e. status of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and event-related distress). Analysis was performed with SPSS using binary logistic regression. P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Overall, 65 inpatients and 65 outpatients were surveyed. The two groups did not significantly defer in terms of insomnia and depression severity, but the outpatients showed higher levels of anxiety (52.3% vs. 24.6%, P = 0.005) and distress compared to inpatients (80.0% vs. 64.6%, P &lt; 0.001). Male sex (OR = 0.017, 95%CI = 0.000-0.708, P = 0.032) exhibited independent and inverse association with depression in COVID-19 patients. Being married (OR = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.018-0.567, P = 0.009) was independently and inversely associated with anxiety. Insomnia was independently associated with event-related distress (OR = 7.286, 95%CI = 2.017-26.321, P = 0.002). Only depression was independently associated with insomnia (OR = 49.655, 95%CI = 2.870-859.127, P = 0.007). Conclusion: We found symptoms of psychological distress and anxiety to be more prevalent among outpatients with COVD-19 than inpatients. Insomnia can be a potential risk factor for adverse mental health outcomes in these patients.","Nahidi, Mahsa, Mokhber, Naghmeh, Sinichi, Farideh, Hatefipour, Zahra, Sadr, Parvin Zohorian, Emadzadeh, Maryam, Amir Rezaei, Ardani","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v17i3.9727","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry; 17(3):276-283, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34170,""
"Depression, Anxiety, Perceived Stress and Family Support in COVID-19 Patients","Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Iran in February 2020 and then quickly spread to many cities. Different factors contribute to the numerous psychological problems of this pandemic in patients, healthcare workers and the community. This study investigated the prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety and depression in COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March and April 2020 and revealed associations of these factors with social support received from family. Method: In this cross-sectional study, patients with COVID-19 admitted between 21st of March and 22nd of April 2020 were evaluated by three questionnaires: Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), stress levels were evaluated using the four-item perceived stress scale (PSS-4) and family support was evaluated using the perceived social support scale-family (PSS-Fa). In addition to obtaining prevalence of the noted psychological disorders and their relationship with demographic details, relationship of stress, anxiety and depression with family support was also investigated using the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. Results: Participants comprised 100 COVID-19 patients (38 females and 62 males). Findings suggested high levels of perceived stress in 26% of the participants, anxiety symptoms existed in 29% and borderline conditions existed in 17%. Moreover, depressive and its borderline symptoms were respectively observed in 17% and 23%. Family support was found to negatively and significantly correlated with anxiety (Pearson correlation = -0.249, P &lt; 0.05) and depression. (Pearson correlation = -0.221, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is recommended to further focus on non-clinical interventions, such as providing psychological first aids, boosting psychological resilience, and enabling greater family support, in efforts to prevent transformation of these psychological symptoms into long-term psychological disorders.","Mahdieh Hosseini, Largani, Gorgani, Fatemeh, Abbaszadeh, Mahsa, Arbabi, Mohammad, Sahar Karimpour, Reyhan, Seyyed Farshad, Allameh, Shahmansouri, Nazila, Parsa, Samaneh","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v17i3.9725","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry; 17(3):257-264, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34171,""
"Sexting in times of confinement An analysis of sending online sexual content before and during COVID-19 pandemic amongst university students: An International Journal of Pure Communication Inquiry","Sexting is a common practice among young adults that consists of sending material with sexual content to other people. During the COVID-19 pandemic containment situation, the main means of exploring sexuality have been through digital devices. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the practice of sexting before and during confinement due to COVID-19 amongst Spanish university students. A longitudinal design was adopted from the application of an online survey based on three standardized and internationally used instruments on a sample of university students (n = 499) before and during confinement. The results indicated that the practice of sexting was slightly higher during confinement. At the same time, the use of dating applications was a conditioning factor in sexting. Furthermore, it was noted that sexting had a significant influence on college students' levels of self-control, depression, anxiety, and stress during confinement. Finally, the main conclusions of this study are discussed where the situation of confinement has had an impact on the lives of students and their habits of digital consumption and expression of sexuality.","Romero-RodrÃ­guez, JosÃ©-MarÃ­a, Aznar-DÃ­az, Inmaculada, Hinojo-Lucena, Francisco-Javier, GÃ³mez-GarcÃ­a, Gerardo","https://doi.org/10.17646/KOME.75672.84","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Kome; 10(1):19-31, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34172,""
"Evaluation of the effectiveness of a questionnaire to identify symptoms and risk factors for the development of non-communicable diseases (MARKIZ study): study design and general characteristics of the research sample","Identification of aggravated heredity, complaints and symptoms caused by a number of socially significant non-communicable diseases is an important task that must be solved during mandatory and preventive medical examinations, as well as medical examinations. In Russia, a questionnaire has been developed for preventive medical examinations and medical examinations, but there is no questionnaire for mandatory medical examinations. In addition, questionnaire tools designed to assess anxiety and depression, adherence to treatment, age-related risk factors, post-COVID syndrome, and a number of others have not yet been developed and unified. This creates difficulties associated both with a uniform approach to identifying risk factors for socially significant non-communicable diseases during medical examinations at various levels, and with a universal interpretation of the results obtained during the survey. The work is devoted to the creation of a unified questionnaire to identify aggravated heredity, complaints, symptoms characteristic of non-communicable diseases and conditions, during mandatory preliminary and periodic medical examinations of workers, as well as preventive medical examinations and medical examinations.

"Priority areas for the prevention of non-communicable diseases on the agenda of the 75th World Health Assembly: plans for the future","Prevention of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) remains one of the main global strategic directions of the WHO activities. This situation is based on the present and predicted significant contribution of NCDs to the total morbidity and mortality of the world population related to an increase in the number of the older-age-group population, after 65 years, as well as the negative impact of risk factors, such as behavioral and psychosocial, infections and viruses, climate and environmental changes on the development, progression and outcomes of these diseases. The evidence-based confirmation of such processes has received the during the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection at the global level. The WHO also pays special attention to the growing problem of mental health associated with neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, as a consequence of the population life expectancy increase, influence of viral infections, climate and environment changes. At the same time, it is proven that mental disorders are factors that contribute independently of other causes to the progression of NCDs. In this regard, in order to significantly and long-term reduce the burden of NCDs, among the recommended global strategic directions for the prevention of NCDs, WHO will special focus on evidence-based economically justified and available interventions at the national or population level, outside of health systems, as well as in the frame of primary health care to ensure the universal health coverage. Effective approaches of such interventions will allow in the future save the population health, accomplish the WHO 13-th General program work tasks and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, preserve and increase human capital, the well-being of all people throughout the planet.

In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was widespread in the world. The mental health of school-age children has become a worldwide concern. Herein, we conducted this review to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of general children and special children with a high risk of psychological problems, focusing on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among school-age children in different countries and regions during the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the susceptibility between individuals and the accessibility of social resources, we further explored the child, family, and social related factors affecting the mental health of school-age children. Finally, some suggestions on the construction of children's mental health service system in major public health emergencies were put forward at the national, school-family-community, and individual levels.

"Early Period Results in Patients Developing Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum Due to COVID-19 Pneumonia: Single-Center Clinical Experience on 47 Cases","Objective: Pneumothorax (PNX) and/or pneumomediastinum (PNM) is an entity that can occur as late findings in COVID-19 patients with mechanical ventilator support. The purpose of this study was to determine the parameters that influence morbidity and mortality associated with PNX and/or PNM secondary to COVID-19 infection. Methods: The study was performed on patients from March 2020 to December 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) percentage were analyzed. Mortality in the first 48 h, between 48 h and 7 days, and after 7 days was assayed. Results: A total of 47 patients, only 2 of whom (4%) were in 20â€“40 years of age, were studied. The result was statistically significant (p&lt;0.03). Bilateral PNX was seen in 5 patients (11%). Tube thoracostomy was performed in 40 patients (85%). The isolated PM was detected as a single finding in 11 patients (23%). The mean age was 62 years. The mean mechanical ventilator PEEP and the FiO2 values were 11 cmH2O and 84%, respectively. When the mortality of the first 48 h and the first 7 days was compared, no statistically significant difference was found. However, a significant difference in the mortality observed after the 7th day, which is consistent with the literature, and the presence of diffuse subcutaneous emphysema was detected (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Tube thoracostomy is a highly effective method for treating PNX in all patients. Due to the elevated risk of PNX associated with the development of PNM in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, we suggest that more sensitive and earlier lung-protective breathing methods should be used.

"â€œThanks for helping me find my enthusiasm for physicsâ€: the lasting impacts â€œresearch in schoolsâ€ projects can have on students, teachers, and schools","Using 6Â years of evaluation data, we assess the medium- and long-term impacts upon a diverse range of students, teachers, and schools from participating in a programme of protracted university-mentored projects based on cutting-edge space science, astronomy, and particle physics research. After having completed their 6-month-long projects, the 14â€“18-year-old school students report having substantially increased in confidence relating to relevant scientific topics and methods as well as having developed numerous skills, outcomes which are corroborated by teachers. There is evidence that the projects helped increase students' aspirations towards physics, whereas science aspirations (generally high to begin with) were typically maintained or confirmed through their involvement. Longitudinal evaluation 3Â years later has revealed that these projects have been lasting experiences for students which they have benefited from and drawn upon in their subsequent university education. Data on students' destinations suggest that their involvement in research projects has made them more likely to undertake physics and STEM degrees than would otherwise be expected. Cases of co-created novel physics research resulting from Physics Research in School Environments (PRiSE) has also seemed to have a powerful effect, not only on the student co-authors, but also participating students from other schools. Teachers have also been positively affected through participating, with the programme having influenced their own knowledge, skills, and pedagogy, as well as having advantageous effects felt across their wider schools. These impacts suggest that similar â€œresearch in schoolsâ€ initiatives may have a role to play in aiding the increased uptake and diversity of physics and/or STEM in higher education as well as meaningfully enhancing the STEM environment within schools.","Archer, Martin O.; DeWitt, Jennifer","https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-4-169-2021","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Geoscience Communication; 4(2):169-188, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34181,""
"Challenges and opportunities for sustainable solid waste management in private nature reserves: The case of Sabi Sand Wildtuin, South Africa","The mismanagement of waste in protected areas may lead to significant and irreversible environmental, economic and social impacts, such as land degradation, resource depletion, surface and groundwater pollution, loss of biodiversity and impacts on the aesthetic value of these areas. This paper aims to identify the challenges and opportunities for sustainable solid waste management in privately protected areas, given the limited research conducted on this topic. A case study approach was followed, which focused on the Sabi Sand Wildtuin, a private nature reserve (PNR) in South Africa. Interviews were conducted with 30 participants, which included representatives from the management authority, commercial lodges, non-commercial properties and a waste service provider. Several challenges have been identified by interviewees. Behaviour was the most frequently mentioned challenge, where interviewees raised concerns about negative attitudes, unwillingness to implement waste management measures and a possible lack of support. Other frequently mentioned challenges included foreseen difficulties due to the size and location of the reserve and concerns around funding of waste management measures, especially given the financial implications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) travel and tourism restrictions. The most frequently identified opportunities included creating jobs and improving livelihoods, providing assurance and transparency of what happens to waste â€˜beyond the gateâ€™ and improving awareness, knowledge and skills related to waste management. To optimise the opportunities towards sustainable solid waste management, PNRs should focus on aligning their strategic direction to achieve legal compliance and support community initiatives to establish waste-related infrastructure and services that cannot be implemented within the reserve. Conservation implications: The pursuit of waste-related opportunities within privately protected areas could enhance the implementation of sustainable solid waste management in PNRs, whilst also contributing to pollution prevention, community upliftment and other secondary benefits, which could ultimately result in increased conservation efforts.","Roos, Claudine, Alberts, Reece C.; Retief, Francois P.; Cilliers, Dirk P.; Hodgson, William, Olivier, Iain","https://doi.org/10.4102/koedoe.v64i1.1710","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Koedoe; 64(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34182,""
"Meditation, mindfulness, and mental health: Opportunities, issues, and challenges","In the last six decades, the concept of mindfulness has been widely studied, researched, and practiced in mainstream psychology, mental health, and health disciplines.

"A meta-analysis of anxiety symptoms and related factors in Chinese college students before and after the COVID-19 epidemic","Objective: To explore the changes of anxiety symptoms and related factors in Chinese college students before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: The Chinese and English databases were searched to collect the studies on related factors of anxiety symptoms in Chinese college students with the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) . According to the survey time in the studies, it was divided into the before and during the epidemic. Meta-analysis was performed by using Statal5. 1. Results: Totally~ studies were included before the epidemic and 14 studies during the epidemic. The detection rate of anxiety symptoms in college students during the epidemic was higher than that before ( 24. 2% vs. 21. 9% ) . Totally 13 factors were included in the meta-analysis. Among them, senior year of college, only child, introvert, depression, physical illness, poor sleep quality, single parent and poor family economy were the risk factors for anxiety symptoms in college students before the epidemic (OR = 1. 48, 1. ~. 1. 59, 6. 62, 2. 23, 1. 82, 2. 77, 2. 13), and female, physical exercise and high social support were the protective factors (OR = 0. 82, 0. 53, 0. 71) . Senior year of college, introvert, depression, physical illness, poor sleep quality and poor family economy were the risk factors during the epidemic (OR = 2. 57, 1. 45, 1. 34, 3. 96, 1. 87, 1. 59), and medical student, physical exercise and high social support were the protective factors (OR = 0. 73, 0. 66, 0. 57). Conclusion: There exist significant differences between the influences of female, senior year of college, physical illness, depression, physical exercise, poor family economy, single parent and high social support with anxiety symptoms in Chinese college students before and during the epidemic.

"â€œDrilling Downâ€: psychiatry and dentistry in collaborative action","AimsPeople with severe mental health illnesses experience multiple adverse physical health outcomes, in part caused by difficulties accessing, engaging with health promoting behaviour, treatment and recovery strategies. As oral health is a major contributor to physical and mental wellbeing, obstacles to care, prevention, and therapy play an important role in the oral health of individuals with mental illnesses. Psychiatric medications are known to predispose to oral health pathologies, including sialorrhea and dental caries, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may rarely result in dental fractures, and substance misuse may contribute to poor dental health. Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 has been more acutely noticed by those already at risk of worse oral health outcomes, including people with mental health conditions.MethodsWe address the interplay between mental health and dental care, outline evidence behind the vital importance of collaborative working, and advocate for a joint approach between mental health and dental teams utilising harm reviews adapted to assessing the impact of delay dental care upon patients and familiesâ€™ quality of life. As COVID-19 persists and winter pressures are experienced every year, these raise the question of what needs to be done to demonstrate the effects of poor oral health on patients with learning difficulties and mental illness.ResultsWith annual winter pressures in healthcare, many elective operations are postponed to allow capacity for increased demand. Dental general anaesthetics are amongst the first lists to be suspended, particularly since the arrival of COVID-19. During the first peak of the pandemic, limited access to personal protective equipment and concerns over viral transmission risked by aerosol generating procedures restricted the provision of community dental care to urgent cases, and dental general anaesthetics to life-threatening infections alone.These impacts were particularly acute for those with learning difficulties and mental illness, further exacerbated by social, geographical and financial inequalities. Waiting for patients to deteriorate to access dental care treatment seems in direct opposition to the mental health movement towards community and early management of mental illnesses.ConclusionAdapted harm reviews are a powerful tool for mental health and dental teams to demonstrate to hospital managers the multidimensional impact that poor oral health has and causing physical, behavioural and emotional deterioration on patients, families and supporting staff. Wider understanding of the dental needs of those with mental health conditions may foster research on the interplay between oral and psychological health, and remains vital to multidisciplinary, compassionate and holistic care.","Chiara Cattra, Dr, Malaga, Elizabeth Gonzalez Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.530","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S88-S89, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34186,""
"Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on Overdose Presentations Through the Emergency Department in a Large Tertiary Hospital","AimsThe outbreak of COVID-19, lockdown and self-isolation has created a lot of additional pressure on the society as a whole. We aim to audit the number of patients presenting to SVUH ED since March 27th 2020 (the date at which the government imposed a stay-at-home order) with an overdose.MethodsThe cohort of cases analysed was identified using ED MAXIMS under the subheading of â€˜overdose and poisoningâ€™ presentations. Data were collected using MAXIMS and clinical portal and stored on the SVUH system and analysed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS.ResultsThere were a total of 713 cases in both years (from 27th of March â€“ 31st December), with 353 (49.5%) admitted in 2019 and 360 (50.5%) admitted in 2020. Out of those admitted, 423 patients were females (196 and 227 in 2019 and 2020 respectively). There was a significant increase in the number of female presentations in 2020, with a p value of 0.041.When stratifying patients based on age, the mean ages were 37.22 (SD 17.04) and 34.18 (SD17.32) in 2019 and 2020 respectively (p = 0.076). When dividing age groups in three categories (under 18, over 65 and 19â€“64), our data showed significant differences. There was a significant increase in numbers in the =18 yr and 19â€“64 age groups in 2020 compared with 2019. In the under 18 groups, there was an increase in numbers by 7.9% in 2020 (11.6% compared with 19.5%). When comparing numbers between Months per year, overall, there were no changes in presentations. Interestingly March 2020 had no presentations compared with March 2019, coinciding with the beginning of the pandemic in Ireland. May showed more than 50% decrease in presentations in 2020. Similar numbers were seen in the rest of the months of both years.ConclusionBetween 2019 and 2020, there was a 1.9% increase of ED presentations with overdoses, which did not show any significance in increase of numbers or in age demographics. There were three main findings from our analysis:1. A significant difference between the two years in a rise in female patients admitted with overdose (p = 0.041)2. An increase in presentations in the age groups of under 18 and 19â€“64. This may allude to increase strain in the younger population with loss of jobs, financial burdens etc.3. There were no presentations in March 2020, coinciding with the beginning of the pandemic in Ireland.","Raneem Saleh, Dr, Abdubadie Kutubi, Dr, Zainab Shobowale, Dr, Renad Saleh, Dr, Allys Guerandel, Professor, Moore, Susan Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.480","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S172, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34187,""
"Changes in Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team Referral Numbers and Patient Caseload During COVID-19 Pandemic in First Lockdown","AimsThe COVID-19 Pandemic has had an impact on most aspects of functioning on the world in general. We wanted to see what impact of COVID-19 Pandemic has had on a Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team North Peterborough. The main objectives of this audit were to see changes in Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team North number and source of referrals, average length of stay, total number of patients Home Treated during this period (Pre and during COVID-19 pandemic) and to also identify whether patients with a certain diagnosis deteriorated or presented more to services compared to others.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed case-notes and data were collected from RiO Electronic Patient Records (EPR) covering all the factors we wanted to analyse. Data collection periods were pre-COVID-19 between 1st April 2019 and 30th September 2019 and COVID-19 pandemic (1st Lockdown) between 1st April 2020 and 30th September 2020. Total number of referrals received between April and September 2019 pre-pandemic were 844 and total number of referrals received during COVID-19 pandemic between April and September 2020 were 660. Data were exported from the electronic patient record into Microsoft Excel and quantitative analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.ResultsThe results showed 21.8% drop in total number referrals from 844 to 660 and there were 20.89% (79) less patients Home Treated from April and September 2020 during first lockdown compared to the similar period in 2019. Significant increase observed in patients with bipolar affect illness by 32% (from 86 to 128 patients), acute stress reaction and adjustment disorder by 15% (from 68 to 80 patients) and psychotic disorder by 11.5% (from 245 to 277patients) in 1st lockdown period compared to 2019 similar period. Declining trend observed in intentional self-harm by various means by 20.75% and 4% drop in personality disorder patients. Anxiety and depression patients number remained same in both periods.ConclusionAlthough referral numbers dropped significantly and Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team caseload decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic first lockdown, the number of patients with serious mental illness presented to services increased remarkably (bipolar and psychotic illness). Overall, no major change in length of stay of patients with Crisis Team was observed when compared both periods and referral numbers remained low from all sources during COVID-19 pandemic.","Awon Raza, Dr, Sujith Pillai, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.477","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S170-S171, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34188,""
"Audit on COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Hesitancy Amongst Pregnant or Postnatal Patients Under the Care of a Perinatal Mental Health Community Team","AimsWomen with perinatal mental illness are at increased risk for severe illness with COVID-19. Vaccination against COVID-19 is strongly recommended by JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) and RCOG guidance. Mental health professionals should proactively inform their patients about COVID-19 vaccination and also address any concerns or misinformation, should they be raised. The aim of this audit was to evaluate the rate of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among patients under the West Kent community perinatal mental health team. In addition, we aimed to identify factors that deter patients from taking the COVID-19 vaccine. In patients who were hesitant to take the vaccine, we offered further information to aid their decision-making process.MethodsWe identified patients under the care of the West Kent perinatal mental health community team on 27/10/2021. We excluded patients who were discharged from the team in subsequent weeks during data collection. We collected patient demographics including highest level of education, ethnicity, religion and socio-economic status. Patientsâ€™ COVID-19 vaccine status was obtained via GP records or through telephone contact.If patients had not had their COVID-19 vaccine, they were contacted to enquire whether they were planning to take the vaccine, if not, to ascertain reasons for refusal and whether they wanted additional information about the vaccine. Those women who requested additional information were offered the RCOG information sheet and decision aid.ResultsAmongst 86 patients included in the audit, 59% (n = 51) had taken both dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 12% (n = 10) had taken a single dose. 29% (n = 25) were unvaccinated.68% (n = 17) of unvaccinated patients were pregnant and 32% (n = 8) were postnatal. All women who did not accept COVID-19 vaccine were contacted to offer further information. Following this contact, 39% (n = 9) decided to accept the vaccine, 52% (n = 12) refused the vaccine and 26% (n = 6) were uncertain but were willing to consider taking the vaccine in the future.The reasons for hesitancy in accepting the vaccine included a lack of trust in the vaccine, concerns around its development over a short period of time, concerns around close associates experiencing illness or side effects after taking the vaccine and scepticism over efficacy of the vaccine. Few women did not wish to take the vaccine during their pregnancy, but were willing to consider it after the birth of their baby.ConclusionWe identified potential areas to optimise uptake of COVID-19 vaccines by discussing the importance, safety, efficacy and providing up-to-date information regarding COVID-19 vaccine in the perinatal period.","Bosky Nair, Dr, Oh, Alex Dr, Mahdi Alsahaf, Dr, Unwana Etteh, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.471","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S168, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34189,""
"Monitoring of ADHD Medication: Are We in Line With NICE Guidelines? a Closed Loop Audit","AimsAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults is a growing clinical problem and its prevalence among patients being referred to the General Adult Psychiatry clinic is rapidly increasing. The treatment of ADHD involves the use of medications such as methylphenidate, atomoxetine and lisdexamfetamine. These medications can cause significant adverse effects including arrhythmias, hypertension and appetite suppression. NICE guidelines stipulate that individuals on such medications should have weight, blood pressure and heart rate monitored every 6 months. The aim of this closed-loop audit was to assess if weight, heart rate and blood pressure are being monitored in line with current NICE guidelines in those who are on medication to treat ADHD in a Community Mental Health Team in Glasgow.MethodsPatients with an ADHD diagnosis were identified through a search of electronic case records. Electronic records were reviewed for each patient identified to assess if weight, heart rate and blood pressure had been recorded in the last 6 months. The results of the first cycle of this audit was presented at a local meeting in May 2021 with relevant clinicians present. The patient cohort identified was subsequently re-audited in December 2021 to assess if there had been an improvement in the monitoring of these medications.Results30 patients were identified who had an ADHD diagnosis. 15 male and 15 female patients were identified. Patient age ranged from 18â€“50. 10 patients did not engage with services and were so subsequently excluded from our analyses. There was a substantial improvement in the monitoring of weight, heart rate and blood pressure in the second cycle compared with the first cycle of this audit. 45% of patients had their weight recorded (previously 15%), 40% had their heart rate recorded (previously 8%) and 50% had their blood pressure monitored (previously 19%).ConclusionThere has been a significant improvement in monitoring heart rate, blood pressure and weight every 6 months in line with NICE guidelines in the second cycle compared with the first cycle of this audit. However, we are still not currently meeting NICE guidelines. This is of particular clinical significance given the increasing prevalence of patients with an ADHD diagnosis and subsequent increase in the use of these medications. The COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in face-to-face reviews has likely had an impact on our ability to monitor these medications.","Langan, Clare Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.459","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S163, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34190,""
"Investigating the Influence of the Pandemic on the Wandsworth Home Treatment Team","AimsThis study aimed to determine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Wandsworth Home Treatment Team (HTT), South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust. We hypothesised that demographics and illness characteristics of patients would differ before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and that concerns about possible infection with COVID-19 influenced the decision to be referred to the HTT. Additionally, we hypothesised that there would be fewer face-to-face contacts during the initial months of the pandemic.MethodsRoutinely collected data from the trust's electronic records (RiO) were compared from the 15th March â€“ 15th May in both 2019 (control) and 2020 (early pandemic). Patients could have a maximum of 1 variable absent to be included in the study and should have been under the care of the WHTT for longer than 2 days. Overall, 301 patients were included in this study, 181 from 2019 and 122 from 2020. Variables compared were: marital status, age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, referral source, referral urgency, referral reason, referral weekday, count seen (number of contacts with a clinician), face-to-face contacts, and length of stay.ResultsThe demographic variables: age, sex, marital status, and ethnicity were not significant. Likewise, the length of stay of patients, referral reason, and referral weekday were also not significant. However, during the early pandemic, there was an increase of 11% in the diagnosis of psychotic disorders/psychotic episodes (p = 0.039). Further, the referral urgency of patients within the 2020 period was significantly raised (p=&gt;0.01). The referral source of patients was significantly different with an increased number of patients having been referred to the HTT from the ward (p = 0.017). The mean interactions (count seen) between patients and clinicians significantly lessened from 2019 to 2020, 12.8 Vs 10.2 (p = 0.008). Moreover, the percentage of face-to-face contact had also decreased from 2019 to 2020, 56.1 Vs 46.6 (p = 0.007).ConclusionOverall, less patients received care from the home treatment team during the first wave of the pandemic. Age, marital status, sex, ethnicity, length of stay, referral reason, and weekday were not significant. On the contrary, the diagnosis of patients, count seen, face-to-face contacts, referral urgency, and referral source were statistically significant. These findings reflect a different referral pattern to the Wandsworth HTT during the initial months of the pandemic accompanied with fewer face-to-face and other interactions overall.","Ali, Ibrahim Mr, Allerdiena Hubbeling, Dr, Saxena, Saurabh Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.447","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S158, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34191,""
"Improving COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake in Service Users Admitted to an Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Ward","AimsIt is well known that individuals suffering from mental illness have more comorbidities and lower life expectancies compared to the general population. It is unsurprising therefore, that these individuals are more vulnerable to both contracting COVID-19, and developing severe illness if infected. When patients are admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit this offers an invaluable opportunity to ensure that unvaccinated patients are identified, and if consenting, are supported to receive whichever dose of the vaccine they require. We undertook an audit to examine the proportion of patients admitted who had not received their first, second or third dose of the COVID-19 vaccination. Reviewed in the context of gender, age, ethnicity, legal status, mental health diagnoses and additional comorbidities, in order to determine any trends that might assist in improving uptake. We then repeated the audit aiming to offer the appropriate COVID-19 vaccination to every newly admitted unvaccinated patient. If refused, to then council reluctant patients, providing simple, understandable vaccine information, and to re-offer vaccination.MethodsThe audit took place on a mixed adult psychiatric inpatient ward in London.The first cycle of the audit was completed retrospectively. Data were collected from the electronic notes of new admissions from November and December 2021 (total 41). This included information on COVID-19 vaccination status, and documentation of vaccines offered and administered during admission. Additional information was also compiled to calculate risk stratification scores.Subsequently, we repeated the audit cycle for admissions in January and February 2022 (on-going). However, this time with the aim that all patients have their COVID-19 vaccination status documented promptly, and that their next vaccination is offered/administered during admission if required.ResultsResults from the initial audit cycle showed 33/41 patients had not received a full set of COVID-19 vaccinations (or no vaccination record found). Only 6/33 unvaccinated patients were offered the next vaccination during admission, and 3/33 actually received one. 21/33 patients without a full set of vaccinations were BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic).Initial results from the second cycle showed an improvement in the number of patients offered the vaccine. 5/10 unvaccinated patients were offered vaccines in January, however data collection is ongoing.ConclusionAlthough our data set is not yet complete, initial results show that a simple intervention such as early identification of unvaccinated patients on admission, can act as a prompt to clinicians to ensure vaccines are offered. Thereby, increasing vaccine compliance in this vulnerable patient group.","Holliday, Miranda Dr, Stock, Lisanne Dr, Patel, Bhina Dr, Fidaa Natour, Dr, Cohn, Victor Dr, Mercedes Chavarri, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.445","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S157, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34192,""
"A Review of the Quality of Cardiometabolic Risk Monitoring Amongst Psychiatric Inpatients, and of Interventions to Reduce Their Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease","AimsIn Britain, individuals with severe mental illness die on average 15â€“20 years earlier than the general population. Their higher rates of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to this. This audit reviewed how well cardiometabolic risk factors are screened for during inpatient admissions, and how frequently appropriate interventions are implemented for identified risk factors. It then assessed ways of improving current monitoring and interventions. We prioritised enhanced collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals, combined with formalising and systematising the physical health screening process.MethodsBed coordination provided identification details of all patients admitted to an all-male acute psychiatric ward from 01/05/2019â€“31/08/2019. Each patient's record was reviewed to ascertain whether risk factors outlined in Lester UK Adaptation: Positive Cardiometabolic Health Resource were screened for. If a risk factor in this resource's â€œred zoneâ€ was identified, the patient's documentation was reviewed to see whether corrective action was attempted. Raw numbers and percentages of patients receiving any given physical health check were reviewed. For abnormal results, how many patients had appropriate action taken was then also checked.Results63 patients were admitted, 50 of whom had a Rethink template completed. All physical health data (except blood results) were collected using the Rethink template.41 patients smoked tobacco: seven accepted cessation support, 19 declined cessation support, and 15 were not offered support. 9 patients had no smoking status documented.26 patients self-reported healthy lifestyles versus 24 who did not. Of these 24, 17 had no lifestyle intervention documented.31 patients had a BMI &gt; 25, of whom two were offered support, and 28 had no documented support.12 patients were hypertensive, of whom three were offered further support, and eight had no further action documented.44 patients were normoglycaemic, fifteen had no blood glucose test, and four had pre-diabetes/diabetes of whom one was offered further support.32 patients had dyslipidaemia: one received further support, four were already on appropriate pharmacotherapy, and 27 had no further intervention documented. 25 had no bloods taken.ConclusionMost patients had identifiable cardiometabolic risk factors: smoking, BMI &gt; 25, poor lifestyle, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia (in decreasing order). Where risk factors were identified, intervention to address these risk factors and identification of barriers to supporting patients were lacking. COVID-19 may have changed the nature of admissions and health priorities. Structural changes were implemented, including changes to admission physical health assessments, introduction of well-man clinics, and improved communication between inpatient and community settings on discharge. A re-audit is pending.","Cuthbert, Thomas Dr, Ma, Linh Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.433","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S152, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34193,""
"Physical Health Monitoring of Patients Prescribed Depot Antipsychotic Medication in North West Edinburgh Community Mental Health Team (CMHT)","AimsTo assess the effect of interventions in the physical health monitoring of patients prescribed depot antipsychotic medications. We hypothesised that compliance with monitoring would improve post-intervention. It is well recognised that patients with severe mental illness have a significantly reduced life expectancy. Depot antipsychotic medication increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, stroke and type 2 diabetes. The SIGN guidelines recommend that all patients on antipsychotic medications should have annual physical health monitoring. Baseline data of patients on depot antipsychotic medication in North West (NW) Edinburgh CMHT in 2019 demonstrated that this was not being achieved. We sought to create interventions to improve compliance with physical health monitoring for patients on depot antipsychotic medication.MethodsBaseline data were collected in 2019 for all patients under NW Edinburgh CMHT receiving depot antipsychotic medication (60 patients). The data addressed 9 domains including smoking status, blood monitoring, BMI and physical monitoring.Following the baseline data collection interventions were put in place to increase compliance with monitoring. These interventions included a physical health questionnaire and training of staff in the CMHT to perform phlebotomy and ECGs.Following these interventions the data (74 patients) were re-audited in 2020 following the same domains.After this initial re-audit a physical health monitoring clinic was implemented in order to specifically target this patient population. The data (66 patients) were then re-audited in 2021.ResultsBaseline data identified that domains were reached between 8% (Lipid monitoring) and 51% (glucose monitoring). Following the initial interventions 77% of domains improved in compliance. Between the two periods, notable improvements were observed in the monitoring of Blood Pressure (9% to 37%), ECG (20% to 43%) and lipids (29% to 46%). There was however a decline in all domains between the 2020 and 2021 data, with 66% of domains still having improved compared to 2019 data.ConclusionOverall, interventions have improved compliance with monitoring of physical health for patients on depot antipsychotic medications. It is likely that continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the decline between the 2020 and 2021 data. As a result of this audit a weekly physical health monitoring clinic has been set up and once formally established it is hoped that compliance with physical health monitoring will continue to improve. Limitations include effects of COVID-19 pandemic, inconsistency in documentation and patient non-attendance to the monitoring clinic. We recommend further audit cycles, with additional interventions being implemented as identified.","Adrianna Klejnotowska, Dr, Bailey, Robyn Dr, Thompson, Alexandra Ms, Wojtowicz, Jakub Mr, Haggart, Josh Mr, Evans, Hamsi Ms, Choi, Hae-young Ms, Mallis, Adam Mr, MacLeod, Anna Ms, Murdie, Douglas Dr, Argent, Vikki Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.427","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S149-S150, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34194,""
"The Effect of the First Coronavirus Lockdown on Psychiatric Outpatient Attendance, a North Fife Survey","AimsThere has been a significant change in the way we see patients during psychiatric consultations, this has led to challenges we face in delivering safe and effective care to patients under our care. â€œTelepsychiatryâ€ has been used in literature from countries like Australia and India, there is very little around coming from the UK but there appears to be many ongoing research making the rounds. It is interesting to know that the existing literature on remote/virtual consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic are on the rise. The idea of this study was conceived during outpatient clinics after making an observation that many patients were likely to miss their appointments when they had telephone appointments compared to video consultations. This prompted a study to know if this is more likely to be observed in other outpatient clinics. The purpose of this study was to establish if virtual/remote consulting has affected patient attendance rate and whether this is also affected by the type of virtual consultation.MethodsThe data were collected using the â€œ2020 stats sheetsâ€ for inpatient appointments between North Fife consultants from January to October 2020. This was registered with the NHS Fife clinical effectiveness team in January 2021.ResultsThe results were categorized for the purpose of this survey as January â€“ March (Pre-lockdown) and April â€“ October (lockdown). It is important to note that some face-to-face appointments occurred during lockdown because there were emergency assessments and drug monitoring appointments scheduled.The results of this survey showed that there was a clear reduction in clinic appointments made during lockdown compared to pre-lockdown and slight observable improvement in attendance rates during the lockdown. There was no statistical significance seen using t-test comparing attendance rates between video and telephone consultations including new patient virtual consultations.ConclusionThe large sample size over this period suggests that the results are reliable and valid, we can therefore say virtual/telephone consultation does not affect attendance. It should be noted that the attendance rate may be a good indicator but we should also consider patient/clinician satisfaction, communication quality/effectiveness and other factors which could influence patient's compliance to outpatient follow-up. It is important to acknowledge the lack of a control group and the COVID-19 pandemic were major cofounding factors. Mental health services should continue the use of virtual consultation post-pandemic and possibly integrate it with in person consultations (hybrid), this may help with attendance rate of patients with difficulty attending face-to-face appointments.","Adebola Adegbite, Dr, Howson, George Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.422","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S147-S148, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34195,""
"Physical Health and Mental Health Comorbidities of People With Functional Neurological Disorders Referred to a Community Neuropsychiatry Service Pre-& Post March 2020 Lockdown Due to COVID-19","AimsHealth comorbidities contribute significantly to the development and maintenance of illness in patients with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). As part of a service evaluation project, we investigated the physical and mental health comorbidities of people referred to a community neuropsychiatry service in East Kent, in one-year periods preceding and following the March 2020 lockdown due to COVID-19.MethodsWe included all people accepted to the service between 23rd March 2019 and 23rd March 2021, where the reason for referral was Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) or Non-Epileptic Attack Disorder (NEAD). Referrals to the service for other reasons were excluded, as were declined referrals. Routinely collected data sources were reviewed and data stored in anonymized fashion. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).ResultsTotal number of referrals for FND in the 2-year period was 260, with 161 referrals for NEAD and 99 for other FND.In the pre-lockdown period, 163 patients were referred due to FND (101 with NEAD, 62 for other FND). There were fewer FND referrals in the post-lockdown period: 60 referrals for NEAD and 37 for other FND. The majority were female (74% pre-lockdown, 81% post-lockdown). Where ethnicity was recorded, White British was the most common (94% pre-lockdown, 90% post-lockdown), with a small number of people from other ethnic groups (3.5% White Other, 1.4% BAME, 1.4% Mixed pre-lockdown;5.4% White Other, 3.2% BAME and 1.1% Mixed post-lockdown). Ethnicity was not specified in 21 cases (13%).Of the pre-lockdown group, 15 patients had prior contact with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (9%), with 7 patients (7%) in the post-lockdown group. Many patients had previous contact with mental health services (47% pre-lockdown, 53% post-lockdown). The majority of patients had at least one physical illness (69% pre-lockdown, 73% post-lockdown). Most had 1â€“3 physical comorbidities but 9% (pre-lockdown, 7% post-lockdown) had more than 4. Fibromyalgia (14% pre-lockdown, 12% post-lockdown), chronic pain (23% pre-lockdown, 21% post-lockdown), and epilepsy (11%, 9%) were common. Over 90% had psychiatric illness in both periods. Most patients had 1â€“3 psychiatric illnesses;a few had more than 4 (6.1% pre-lockdown, 1.4% post-lockdown). Depressive disorder was the most common comorbidity in both groups (41% pre-lockdown, 44% post-lockdown), followed by anxiety (35% pre-lockdown, 36% post-lockdown). PTSD was present in 8% pre-lockdown and 8.2% post-lockdown.ConclusionPhysical and psychiatric comorbidities are common in people with FND;multidisciplinary working and liaison between services is crucial for care of these patients.","Williams, Verity Dr, Oluwaseun Olaluwoye, Dr, Dunlop, Alan Mr, Rafey Faruqui, Professor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.421","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S147, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34196,""
"Service Evaluation of COVID and Non-COVID Admission Trends to an East Midlands General Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Unit","AimsTo explore the differences in admissions between the first COVID-19 lockdown cohort and a pre-COVID-19 cohort.Methods23 young people who were admitted to an East Midlands General Adolescent Inpatient Unit during the first COVID-19 lockdown from March 2020 to September 2020 were compared with the 48 young people who were admitted in the same period in 2019. Demographic details, admission duration and reasons, mental health act (MHA) status, diagnoses, functional status, and incidents were obtained retrospectively from the trust's online records.ResultsThe unit received more female admissions prior to lockdown (60.4% Vs 47.8%). Approximately 30% of adolescents in the pre-COVID-19 group were not in education whereas those admitted during COVID-19 were all receiving education. More of the pre-COVID-19 group attended school than college and more of the COVID-19 group were employed, consistent with a lower mean age of admission in the former group. Most of the COVID-19 admissions were local and none were out of area. Young people were also more likely to be looked after by their parents during COVID-19 (82.6%) and none were taken care of by their relatives.Pre-COVID019 admissions were discharged sooner than their counterparts, which had 13% of admissions between 6â€“9 months. Both cohorts had mainly informal admissions due to risk to self. Most of the COVID-19 admissions were due to anxiety, followed by self-harm while the majority of pre-COVID-19 admissions were due to depression and PTSD. 43% of the COVID-19 admissions had at least one comorbid diagnosis, notably depression. More adolescents in the COVID-19 cohort were not started on any psychiatric medication during and after admission.The mean number of incidents were two times higher in the COVID-19 group;self-harm was the most common reason. There was more violence towards staff during lockdown. However, absconsion, possession of contraband items, and staff error were higher in the pre-COVID-19 group.ConclusionThe introduction of COVID-19 restrictions was associated with a change in both the frequency and nature of inpatient admissions to this ward. Less young people were admitted during COVID-19, more frequently with anxiety as the primary reason and stayed for longer. Although the pre-COVID-19 group received more psychiatric medication, it is unclear if this contributed to a better functional status overall. This service evaluation also demonstrated the impact of COVID-19 on young people's mental health and life circumstances. An exploration of these trends in other units across the country would increase the generalisability of results.","Tan, Sue Fen Dr, Chand, Parveen Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.418","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S145-S146, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34197,""
"Improving Patient Engagement in Psychological Interventions","AimsThe aim of this service evaluation project is to gain understanding about the reasons for service user's disengagement in psychological interventions. We felt that the findings of this project will enable services to better understand the experience of service users and help recognise why someone requesting services does not follow through. Around 68% of patients who were referred to psychological therapy did not complete therapy in our community mental health team highlighting a need to improve patient engagement in psychological interventions. Patients under secondary mental health services have complex needs and any referral decision to the most appropriate psychological intervention will need to be carefully considered as a part of their treatment plan. Premature termination from psychological interventions can lead to poor treatment outcome, waste staff time and contribute to unnecessary long waiting lists.MethodsRandom sample of 20 service users who disengaged from psychological therapy were chosen and telephone interviews were conducted to determine their perspectives on reasons for their termination. Introductory letter informing about this project was posted to the service users and they were contacted after a week to gather information. The following themes were included in the interview questionnaire like demographic characteristics, psychopathological difficulties, problems related to therapy or therapist, external circumstantial problems, internal factors and service user views on satisfaction/achievement of therapy goals.ResultsThe results showed:1. The most frequent reported reason for disengagement from psychological intervention was COVID-19 and internal factors (thinking that therapy would not help, low mood/too anxious, previous bad experience with therapy and feeling unwilling to open).2. Number of session's service users attended ranged from 0 to 6 and no one completed the therapy.3. Waiting time (from referral to start of therapy) ranged from 2 to 6 months.4. 37.5% of service users were not aware about therapy details.ConclusionThe results were shared with staff via local meetings Recommendations were drawn to improve patient engagement and retention in therapy.1. Outpatient pack resources developed to offer service users at appointments which has written information sheets about presenting problems, overview of psychological interventions/assessment and diaries for service users.2. New template was drafted to improve the referral process to psychology by referrers having access to guides on how to assess a person's psychological needs, readiness for therapy and the provision of consultation slots with psychologists.","Rajeswari Sivaji, Dr, Ravindra, B.

"What Is the Future of Primary Mental Health Care?: A Post COVID-19 Service Evaluation","AimsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many service lines needed to be transformed to enable more telemedicine and virtual consultations. This enabled seamless care across many service boundaries as all services adapted to operate virtually. During COVID-19, the mental health of many patients deteriorated. With easing of restrictions, we wanted the patient voice to be heard and to ensure our service was patient-centred. We undertook a service evaluation to understand our patients preferences. Our cross-sectional study evaluated patient preferences for their care which we felt was important as earlier during pandemic, patients did not have the choice to choose between virtual vs face-to-face consultations. We felt this was important to our patients so they could exercise choice of consultation and this would enable the patient voice to be heard.Methods591 patients across three practices in primary care were identified from the Serious Mental Illness (SMI) and on the depression register. They were asked about their preference of care: telemedicine vs face-to-face consultations. Using a simple questionnaire, in order to record their preference on the patient screen. Of these a total of 495 patients (83%) participated in the study.ResultsOf the 495 respondents, 308 (52%) declined virtual telemedicine consultations and 175 (29%) patients were content with virtual consultations. Of the 175 patients who wanted telemedicine were 20 to 40 years of age. Reasons given included convenience (allows family and work commitment) and overall time management (reluctancy to travel). The 308 patients (52%) wanted face-to-face consultations because they wanted human contact, validation of their mental health problems, reassurance and were uncomfortable about discussions on the phone. They also had poor mobility especially the elderly who chose traditional models of care.ConclusionAs services are restored to the new norm of patient care, patient choice should remain paramount if services are to remain patient centric. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many services transformed to virtual consultation of necessity without recognising the impact on patients themselves. Patients with serious mental health and depression are inherently vulnerable and our evaluation goes to show that despite the popularity of telemedicine. Patient choice should enable patients to access face-to-face care for greater patient satisfaction.","Zarif, Ahmad Mr, Imaduldin Nazir, Mr, Azad Mahmod, Mr, Hajira Bibi, Miss, Rasheed, Reshma Dr, Patel, Anjali Miss, Yathorshan Shanthakumaran, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.412","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S143, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34199,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Related Work Model Changes on Service Pathways for New Patient Assessments at East Kent Neuropsychiatry Service: Service Evaluation Comparing One Year Pre-COVID-19 Lockdown With One Year Post-Lockdown","AimsNeuropsychiatry Service in East Kent typically receives referrals for patients with brain injury, progressive neurological conditions, epilepsy specific neuropsychiatric conditions, rare forms of dementia, and functional neurological conditions. COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine functioning of the service requiring multiple service innovations including introduction of remote access assessments, skills development clinics, and video-conferencing based psychoeducation groups. We conducted a service evaluation with governance approval to understand the impact of COVID-19 work model changes on referral sources, patient attendance, discharge destinations and the mental health professionalsâ€™ involvement in the management of the patients referred to the service.MethodsWe applied to Service Evaluation and Audit Group of Kent and Medway NHS Partnership Trust for permission to collect service data using routinely collected clinical and business administration information. We used an approved data collection form for anonymized data collection. We analysed data for new patient assessments conducted over one-year prior to COVID-19 lockdown announced on 23rd March 2020 and compared it with one-year post-COVID lockdown period ending on 22 March 2021. We used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to carry out descriptive and statistical analysis of the data from two service evaluation period.ResultsThe total number of new patient assessments conducted during the two designated service evaluation periods was 365. 233 new patient assessments (64%) were conducted during the one-year pre-COVID-19 lockdown and 132 (36%) new patient assessments were conducted during the one-year post-COVID-19 lockdown.Neurology teams in the local area were the main source of referrals during the two study periods, referring 59% and 51% of total referrals during the two evaluation periods respectively. Other referral sources included local memory service, inpatient psychiatric units, community mental health teams, neuropsychology, neurorehabilitation, palliative care and acute medicine. The primary management model was multidisciplinary. 49% of assessment contacts were made by specialist nursing during the first evaluation period. 48% of assessment contacts were made by the medical staff during the post-lockdown period. 13.3% of patients did not attend their appointments during the first period, dropping to 9.8% in the Post-Lockdown period.Most patients who completed treatment were discharged to GP care (89% pre-COVID-19 and 94% post-lockdown). 12% patients from Pre-Lockdown period were still receiving care at the end of one year and 35% were still receiving care in at the end of post-lockdown period.ConclusionThe service evaluation identifies systemic differences in service use characteristics during Pre-lockdown and Post-lockdown periods.","Oluwaseun Olaluwoye, Dr, Williams, Verity Dr, Dunlop, Alan Mr, Rafey Faruqui, Professor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.411","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S142-S143, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34200,""
"The Use of Skype Video Telecommunication (VTC) for Social Visits in a Medium Secure Hospital: A Service Evaluation","AimsThe COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented disruptions in the ways we lived and interacted with one another. Research studies done in the immediate aftermath suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions may have increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, which together with disruptions in services may have precipitated psychological distress and mental health deterioration, particularly among persons with pre-existing mental health conditions. Following the introduction of first national lockdown in late March 2020, all visits to the hospital by family and friends were ceased. VTC became one of the rapid interventions implemented across several NHS Hospitals to promote continued patient contact with carers. In October 2021, we set out to undertake an evaluation project to determine the level of patient satisfaction with the use of Skype for social visits, to understand patient and staff perspectives on its pros and cons, and to understand patient preference post-COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsAll ward-based staff who had ever facilitated Skype social visits and all patients who had had at least one social visit facilitated by Skype were approached to participate in the project. Data were collected using anonymous questionnaires with both quantitative and qualitative items.ResultsA total of twenty-nine patients and thirty-nine nursing staff participated in the study.Sixty-two per cent of patient-participants reported being satisfied with the Skype social visits and over half (52%) rated the Skype social visits as â€˜the sameâ€™ as face-to-face visits. All participants reported patient-satisfaction with the process and speed of setting up a Skype visit, the benefits of visual contact and the reduction of travel costs. A few patient-participants noted that they relished the opportunity of seeing their home environment. Issues regarding increased demands on staffing resources, privacy, IT skills, and hardware and software glitches were identified.Overall, Skype social visits have been a positive experience for the patients and have not resulted in any significant risk concerns. Most patients (90%) indicated that they would like Skype social visits to continue post-COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionThe average length of stay (LOS) of patients is often longer in forensic compared to general adult mental health units and about 4.5 years at the study site. This evaluation found that the introduction of Skype for the purposes of social visits was considered a useful development by both patients and staff. The study findings were fed back to all stakeholders and certain changes have been implemented as a result.","Obinna Okonkwo, Dr, Gibbon, Simon Dr, McCarthy, Lucy Dr, Taylor, Nicholas Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.410","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S142, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34201,""
"The Effects of Remote Consultation (RC) on Outpatient Clinic Attendance Rates in City Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) and Patient Feedback on RC","AimsThe outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 forced a sudden change in service delivery in CMHT. Remote consultations (RC) via telephone or video were introduced to facilitate safe contact between staff and patients. Traditional face to face (F2F) appointments have high rates of non-attendance (DNA). This project aimed to examine whether the DNA rate for CMHT appointments has been affected by the introduction of RC. In addition to this, patients were asked to give feedback about how they felt about the use of RC.MethodsWe retrospectively studied the outcome of outpatient medical appointments within City CMHT over two periods, namely pre COVID-19 which was between April to June 2019 and during COVID-19 which corresponded to the same period in 2020. A list of patients over these two periods were extracted from trust electrical medical record: System One (S1). Further review patientsâ€™ notes on S1 was conducted to identify DNA group, among which detailed information including gender, age groups, types of outpatient clinics (urgent or routine, first review or follow-up review), types of consultations (remote or F2F).In addition, an anonymous patient feedback form on RC was given out to 30 patients attending F2F appointments at the clinic between May and August 2021.Results94% appointments were conducted remotely in 2020 while 100% were F2F in 2019 during the periods studied. 2020 saw a 16% increase in attendance rate and a nearly half reduction in cancelled appointments from 30% to 16%. There was a slight drop in DNA rate by 2%.19 patient feedbacks indicated at least one RC experience. Among them, 47% rated it as very good and 58% felt RC offered the same level of care and treatment as F2F. On the other hand, 74% would like to be seen F2F for future appointments when given a choice.Free comments about RC were captured including â€˜Not everything gets coveredâ€™, â€˜it makes me anxious to talk to a medical team over the phoneâ€™ and â€˜things like bruises could be missed in a RCâ€™. However, one patient said they found RC is less stressful.ConclusionA massive shift from F2F to RC was seen due to COVID-19 restriction. Attendance rated was improved with RC, however, it was mainly achieved by a significant reduction in cancelled appointments. Its impact on overall DNA rate appeared minuscule.Despite nearly half of the patients indicated RC is as good as F2F. Most patients prefer f2f for future consultation.","Miller, Ting Dr, Thomas, Joshua Dr, Mukundan, Anitha Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.403","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S139, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34202,""
"Changing Patient Profile in a Psychiatric Hospital During COVID Pandemic: A Comparison With Pre-COVID State","AimsCOVID-19 pandemic has a massively adverse mental health impact and people with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses are one of the most severely affected groups. We intended to study the changes in the patient profile in a psychiatric hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing it to the period just before the pandemic.MethodsConsecutive patients (n = 210) admitted to psychiatric ward under one team during COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020 to January 2022) were compared with patients (n = 234) admitted in the immediate pre-pandemic period (January 2017 to January 2020). Demographic (age, gender, and ethnicity) and clinical variables (diagnosis, admission days, Mental Health Act status, risk to self and others) were collected from the electronic patient records and analysed.ResultsDuring the pandemic monthly admission rates have gone up by 38.1% over the base rate of 6.32/month. There was no difference in the mean age at admission;or the proportion of patients aged 18â€“40 years or above in the pre-pandemic and pandemic groups. Similarly the gender composition of patients in the two periods was comparable. Proportion of patients from Asian background increased from 7.7% to 16.8% during pandemic period (p &lt; 0.05). The number of hospital days decreased from 31.97 Â± 45.8 days in the pre-pandemic period to 22.44 Â± 25.1 days during pandemic (p &lt; 0.05). Along with increased admission rates, it suggested a rapid flow of the admission and discharge during the pandemic. Considering diagnostic composition between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, psychotic (27.8% v 26.7%) and mood disorders (18.8% v 23.3%) were the predominant;and substance related disorders (20.5% v 16.7%) were the most common comorbidities. Risk to self was associated with 84.3% admissions during the pandemic compared to 78.6% in the pre-pandemic period;however, risk to others was noted in 13.8% v 22.2% (p &lt; 0.01) respectively. There was no difference in proportions getting admitted under Mental Health Act or being discharged with Community Treatment Order. Interestingly, proportions of patients getting discharged under the care of Home Treatment Team decreased from 31.1% pre-pandemic to 16.5% during pandemic period (p &lt; 0.005).ConclusionThere is an increase in admission rate and decrease in the number of admission days, suggestive of increased demand of clinical resources during pandemic. This could be reflective of the stressful situation and adverse impact on mental health in the pandemic period. As the impact on mental health is expected to continue, there is a need for greater resources both in community and inpatient psychiatric services.","Nilamadhab Kar, Dr, Jiwanmall, Stephen Amarjeet Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.395","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S136, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34203,""
"Detentions in BSMHFT (Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation NHS Trust) - Covering the Birmingham and Solihull Geographical Area Under the Mental Health Act Between 2018 to 2021","AimsTo continue to monitor trends in detentions under the Mental Health Act based on race, age, gender, and sexuality during the COVID-19 Pandemic to consider if there were any specific areas that would need to be addressed.MethodsWe investigated available mental health detention documents stored in mental health legislative office, Birmingham and Solihull mental health foundation NHS Trust.ResultsWe found that detentions under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act have increased very gradually over the last three years (2018 to2021). However, there has been gradual reduction in detentions under Section 3 within the white population beginning in 2019 and continuing with a marked acceleration in reduction during the two peaks of the pandemic. This is marked in the 66yrs plus age group. As the pandemic has eased this reduction has stopped and reversed with increased section 3 admissions in last few months in this population. The detentions in the black and Asian population have followed a reverse pattern, with marked increase during the pandemic peaks in 2020/2021 and a marked fall as the pandemic has eased.Conclusion1. Mental health act detention data during the Pandemic shows that the pandemic has disproportionality impacted black and Asian population of all ages and Elderly white population.2. During the pandemic there has been a marked increase in detentions under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (for treatment) in the Black and Asian population with a marked reduction in the white population. This difference is stark in the working age population.3. This highlights:a. The need for a well-functioning community based health and social care offer to reduce detentions in the black and Asian population.b. Return of admissions under the mental health act of white elderly post vaccination (which are vast majority white) shows a reversal of the trend of this group not accessing inpatient treatment fully during the pandemic.4. Community Treatment Order (CTO) detentions in the Black and Asian population continue to increase through the pandemic disproportionately5. There is no material change during the pandemic, in short term detentions (section 2, 5(2)) or other inpatient detentions under the Mental health act6. There are no significant trend changes noted based on gender or sexuality or age during the pandemic in BSMHFT (Birmingham and Solihull mental health foundation NHS Trust).","Dinesh Maganty, Dr, Harsh, Rajendra Dr, Cleverley, Tom Mr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.393","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S135, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34204,""
"Service Evaluation of the Just Right State (JRS) Programme, Step 3 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Child and Family Clinic, Belfast Trust, Northern Ireland (March-December 2020)","AimsCOVID-19 resulted in dramatic shifts in how interventions are provided within mental health services, creating the opportunity to virtually deliver JRS groups to parents of young people attending Belfast CAMHS. This is a sensory attachment intervention that facilitates the process of self-regulation and co-regulation through the use of food, sensory activities and an enriched environment provision. It is currently facilitated by CAMHS clinicians via video calls over 4 consecutive weeks.1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual JRS intervention2. Measure discharge rates after JRS intervention to examine if attendance at JRS at the point of entry into CAMHS can lead to more timely discharge due to targeted early intervention3. To capture parent and clinician feedback focusing on the challenges and improvements that have occurred due to this adapted delivery of servicesMethodsA systematic database search was conducted examining number of parents who have attended overall;weekly attendance;Did Not Attend rate;length of time between CAMHS initial assessment and JRS intervention;number of families discharged after JRS and number of families allocated to partnership/medic after JRS.CAMHS clinicians (not directly involved in facilitating JRS intervention) gathered qualitative feedback from families (via phone calls with parents who provided consent).Results132 parents were invited between March-December 2020. 41 families have been discharged, 60 families have been allocated to partnership or medic and 31 are awaiting future JRS groups due to non-engagement, or a further review by JRS facilitators or a CAMHS clinician that they are already allocated to.Five parents provided positive qualitative feedback.ConclusionAs JRS has engaged a high number of parents in a relatively short time -period, it would be helpful to further explore its effectiveness as a first line intervention in CAMHS, thereby informing service delivery moving forward.","Gillanders, Catherine Dr, Jamieson, Katie Miss","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.390","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S134, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34205,""
"Does a Dog Improve the Mental Well-being of Patients and Staff in a CAMHS Hospital?","AimsThe aim was to create and deliver support sessions with the psychiatry consultant's dog, Rupert, to improve the emotional health of both patients and staff. It was hypothesised that having time with a calm and affectionate dog would reduce both young person and adult anxiety, improve their mood, and help them communicate. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a gradual increase in demand from children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), and consequent pressure on NHS staff. On June 2021, Rupert was registered as an emotional support dog with the Trust and began weekly visits to the Darwin Hospital, Stoke-On-Trent. This is a 12 bedded CAMHS hospital, which has seen an increase in patient illness and increasing staff absence due to COVID-19. Informal reports from staff and patients suggested multiple mental health benefits from spending time with Rupert. To quantify the impact of an emotional support dog on the unit, it was agreed to perform a service evaluation on mood, communication and anxiety of both patients and staff.MethodsA questionnaire, using a Likert-type rating scale, was given to staff and patients before and after spending time with Rupert. Questions asked for ratings of mood, anxiety, and comfort in communicating on a scale from â€˜very lowâ€™ to â€˜very highâ€™. The data collection took place in the last 3 months of 2021. In all, 19 people completed the questionnaire. Because of the small sample size, non-parametric bootstrap resampling methods were used to test before-and-after paired differences for individual participants.ResultsBecause the rating scale is ordinal, care needs to be exercised in interpreting differences, but in broad terms a unit increase is equivalent to an improvement, for example, from â€˜lowâ€™ to â€˜neutralâ€™. On average, patients reported statistically significant improvements in mood (mean diff: 1.14, 95% CI: [0.43, 1.71]), anxiety (mean diff: 2.00, 95% CI: [1.43, 2.57]), and communication (mean diff: 1.00, 95% CI: [0.43, 1.86]). Results for staff were similar with improvements in mood (mean diff: 1.08, 95% CI: [0.83, 1.58]) and anxiety (mean diff: 0.83, 95% CI: [0.50, 1.25]) but smaller in communication (mean diff: 0.33, 95% CI: [0.08, 0.67]).ConclusionTaking an emotional support dog into a CAMHS Hospital produced clear benefits, with consistently positive feedback from sessions and no negative effects. Such was the improvement in both patient and staff well-being, staff have since been encouraged to register their dogs too.","Foster, Michael Dr, Quinn, Mica Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.388","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S133, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34206,""
"Remote Clinical Assessments and Management During COVID-19: Views of the Patients and Clinicians About the Future Preferences","AimsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic most clinical services changed to remote consultation and management to minimise virus transmission by direct contact. As the social distancing and restrictions have eased with greater control of the pandemic, the nature of consultations is going to change. At this juncture we intended to understand the perception and satisfaction of patients and clinicians on remote consultations and management during COVID-19 and to determine their preference about clinical engagement in the future.MethodsThis was a trust-wide anonymous survey conducted through surveymonkey. It involved both patients and mental healthcare staff (MHS) and explored about the quality and satisfaction in remote consultations, option to patients, and use of remote consultations in future. Clinicians were sent the online link to complete, with a reminder two weeks later. The patients were explained during their appointments about the survey, those who agreed to participate and gave informed consent, their responses to the questions were recorded.ResultsThe sample consisted of 78 patients and 107 MHS representing adult, old age, children and adolescent and intellectual disability subspecialties. Most (92.4%) participants had participated in remote consultations and understood the reason behind it. Around a third (32.7%) of MHS and 46.2% of patients felt strongly satisfied in remote consultations, and together with satisfaction these were 56.1% v 71.8% respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The quality of the remote consultations were considered somewhat (11.2% v 23.1%) or a lot better (8.4% v 15.4%) by MHS and patients respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Majority (82.7%) felt that an option should be given to patients for the type of consultation, face to face or remote. After the pandemic, the preference for psychiatric consultations were primarily face to face (30.3%), primarily remote (8.6%) and a mixture of the two (61.1%);there were no difference between patients and MHS. However while 71.4% doctors, 70.8% other clinicians (occupational therapists and psychologists) and 75.0% of clinical managers opted for mixture of face to face and remote, 26.9% of nurses opted for that. Background subspecialty, age group, ethnicity, experience of remote consultation with GP or hospital doctors, attendance or admission to general or psychiatric hospitals during pandemic, disabilities, or having COVID-19 did not influence the suggestion for the future consultation type.ConclusionFollowing the pandemic, both clinicians and patients express a preference for a mixture of face to face and remote consultations;and an option regarding that should be given to the patients.","Nilamadhab Kar, Dr, Lai-Ting Cheung, Dr, Jiwanmall, Stephen Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.382","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S130, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34207,""
"Behavioural Changes in a Patient With Schizoaffective Disorder","Background:A 46-year-old man has a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder complained of intermittent abdominal pain for many years. Due to this, he had been reviewed by the GP and he was prescribed medication to help with his intermittent abdominal pain.Case Report:Over the years the abdominal pain gradually worsened. He also has communication issues due to language barriers and was unsettled for most of his assessment.His past medical history includes a duodenal ulcer, infected swollen legs and recurrent urinary tract infections.He continued to have pyrexia despite being on regular paracetamol. Following his second episode of pyrexia, he was referred to the hospital for further investigation.This was found to be acute acalculus cholecystitis, with possible cholecystocolic fistula and pneumonia. He was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and is awaiting cholecystectomy.Discussion:Behavioural change in people with mental illness need not necessarily be linked to their mental state as it can very well be the atypical manifestation of physical illnesses- some of which could be fatal. Prompt recognition and referral to acute medical or surgical services is essential. Staff need training in bias, diagnostic overshadowing and atypical presentations in those with mental illness which will help reduce rates of avoidable morbidity and premature mortality.In any case physical illnesses may not present typically. Acalculous cholecystitis is a rare type of gall bladder inflammation and the cause in Mr X's case is not clear. At times of COVID-19, with the anxieties around exposure to hospitals and infections, it is important to be aware of this and ensure that people with worrying physical symptoms are promptly referred whether or not it is considered to be related to COVID-19.ConclusionDue to the pandemic, we were cautious on the ward and community about COVID-19 and preventing catching and spreading the infection. During all this, patients change of behaviour shouldn't be alluded to deterioration of mental health and mental health professionals should also consider ruling out physical causes for the change of presentation.","Anto Varughese, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.372","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S126, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34208,""
"Improving Efficiency and Quality of Handover in the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT): A Focus on Achieving Team Buy-In","AimsTo Reduced Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) handover time to less than 30 minutes within one month and to improve the quality of handover. The non-medical staff have been part of the team for many years, whilst medical staff have recently changed or are on short rotations. Previous changes have not been well sustained. Much of the initial enthusiasm for this project was coming from the medical staff members. We felt that it was important to fully explore the driving human factors to achieve sustainable buy-in.MethodsThe total period of the project was 7 weeks. First two weeks were used for daily baseline data-collection and informal and formal discussions with team members to formulate driver diagram and change ideas. Two â€œPlan, Do, Study, Actâ€ (PDSA) cycles with two intervention points at week 3 and week 4.ResultsKey human factors identified in the MHLT were burnout and emotional fatigue, core team values (cohesion, flexibility, and camaraderie), and disillusion with authority and imposed change. Contributing factors to burnout and emotional fatigue were long and short-term staff sickness, chronic under-staffing, and systemic changes in the general hospital due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The human factors were used to guide key decisions in methodology and creation of change ideas. These decisions included: Avoidance of surveys and questionnaires (staff request), limiting the total number of changes, any additional administration to be undertaken by medical staff, and avoiding a rigid handover system. Following 2 PDSA cycles, there were improvements in average length of handover from 44 minutes (2-week baseline data) to 30 minutes (4-weeks post second intervention). When compared to the baseline data there were also improvements in the average number of interruptions (7 vs 2), availability of key information (69% vs 92%), allocation of staff member (80% vs 95%) and allocation of review date (83% vs 95%). No difference in the average number of patients for handover discussion between 2-week baseline data (15) and the 5 weeks after (15).ConclusionThe aims for the Quality Improvement Project were met and a plan has been set to re-audit in both 6 months and 1 yearsâ€™ time to test sustainability of change. Sudden illness and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to short and long-term staff shortage, contributing to burnout and emotional fatigue. Attention to the unique human factors involved in team dynamics and staff morale can help achieve buy-in and real change.","Bharat Velani, Dr, Sagar Jobanputra, Dr, Chiemezie Ukachukwu, Dr, Adeagbo Osundina, Dr, Niranga Karunaratne, Dr, Deb, Tanya Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.345","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S115, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34209,""
"Understanding the Psychological Impact of Lockdown: Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Emergency Presentations","AimsThe pandemic of the COVID-19 variant caused a near-global lockdown, and the psychological impact of the direct effects of the virus, along with the resulting lockdown periods cannot be overestimated. Referrals made to the Liaison Psychiatry service at Derriford hospital during the 2020 lockdown were audited to better understand effects on patientsâ€™ mental health and resulting emergency presentations to services. These data were then used to identify areas for improvement, in order to tailor services to better support the population during recovery from the current lockdown, and for planning for future similar events.MethodsReferrals to the Derriford Liaison Psychiatry service between the 1st and 12th of May 202 were audited, totalling 106 referrals and a subsequent 87 assessments. Quantitative data on patient demographics, presentation, and outcomes was extracted from assessments along with qualitative data on patientsâ€™ subjective experiences from the initial lockdown period for thematic analysis. Routine data were used for comparator time periods from 2019, and during the second 2021 lockdown.ResultsDespite a lower number of presentations to ED during the first lockdown, the data demonstrate a higher acuity in presentations with more referrals for admission under section. The lockdown is shown to have particularly affected those with pre-existing psychiatric and physical comorbidity, along with specific patient groups. Thematic analysis confirms this, showing the diverse factors contributing to emergency presentations and demonstrating the increased stress of life in the home under lockdown. Comparisons between the qualitative and quantitative data confirm that patient experiences directly match both the routinely collected data and prior research. The project also revealed a reliance on private and third sector organisations for signposting on from assessments, and highlighted frequent changes to services during lockdown as a source of confusion for both patients and staff.ConclusionThe scale of impact identified affirms that exploration of the lockdown's contribution to presentation should be routine, particularly for identified at-risk patient groups. Areas frequently highlighted by patients can be used to fully explore the impact of lockdown on presentation during assessment. Patient information for self-referral needs to be regularly updated given frequent changes in service provision. Staff also need to be kept up to date on changing service structure at handover meetings.","Scurr, Tom Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.339","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S112-S113, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34210,""
"â€œInside Outâ€: A Regional Inpatient Joy in Work Project","AimsInpatient admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic went up in the regional unit by 18%. This included a 50% increase in Eating Disorder Presentations and more complex SMI requiring admission to Beechcroft. Beechcroft is the regional inpatient unit for CAMHS in Northern Ireland. This project aimed to improve staff joy in work by 30% by June 2021, following what was one of the most difficult years to be a health professional with the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsWe used the IHI Joy in Work methodology along with our own rating scales in the inpatient unit.Several PDSA cycles were carried out including focus groups, gathering baseline data from different wards, and our change ideas- Beechcroft stars nominations, Virtual Quizzes and Staff recognition certificates.ResultsBaseline data on our run chart demonstrated a bad day median in Beechcroft with 4.3 being the score.With the PSDA cycle we demonstrated a 33% improvement in good day scores with a median of 1.4.We have learnt that Joy in work comes from recognising the work already being done and rewarding the efforts our staff go to.Spread and scale with Beechcroft stars now part of fortnightly MDT meeting and management meeting.

"Quality Improvement Project to Improve COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake on an Old Age Psychiatric Ward (Meridian Ward)","AimsPeople with mental health issues have challenges in accessing medical care and it is hypothesised that this may result in a significant number failing to receive protection from COVID -19 by means of vaccination. This study aimed to identify the number of inpatients on a psychiatric general ward (Meridian ward) between May 2021 and June 2021 who were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 so that unvaccinated patients could be offered vaccination during their inpatient stay.MethodsData were gathered on the COVID-19 vaccination status of all patients on Meridian ward (inpatient mental health ward) admitted between May and June 2021. This was a total of 10 patients. This information was gathered directly from the patients, their summary care records and GP records. We also audited whether the patient's vaccination status was recorded in the notes.Results50% of the patients were fully vaccinated. 20% had received one vaccine and 30% of patients were unvaccinated. 20% of the unvaccinated patients received their first dose during admission.ConclusionPatients with mental health issues sufficient to result in psychiatric admission face additional challenges when it comes to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. It is important that healthcare workers are aware of this and facilitate interventions that maximise vaccination in this at-risk group. To improve uptake among this group it is recommended:â€¢ Patientsâ€™ vaccination status is assessed and recorded during inpatient admissions.â€¢ GP surgeries should identify patients on their database with mental health issues who are unvaccinated and providing these individuals with support around accessing information, transport or providing vaccinations at patient's homes.â€¢ There should be clear documentation of vaccination status on summary care record and ward notes.","Khan, Fariah Dr, Etherington, Emma Dr, Potan Kheder, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.312","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S101, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34212,""

Change ideas included a single point of contact for internal and external queries, regular complex case management meetings, development of a referral process and clinical review for complex cases along with teaching sessions.Qualitative feedback from the team pre- and post-intervention, at baseline and regular follow-up intervals, in the form of monthly team meetings, emails, focus-groups and semi-structured interviews.ResultsA full thematic map was created after initial consultation;themes included communication improvement between teams and external agencies, timely support for complex case management, improving transition processes and development of robust clinical review processes.Qualitative feedback has been collated, analysed and final recommendations to be shared with the MDT professionalsConclusionPreliminary results have shown improvements in communication among the MDT, stakeholders, and external agencies.The consultation process highlighted that there is a substantial need for standardisation and consistency within communicative practices to promote enhanced care delivery and improved patient outcomes.","Hasan, Syeda Dr, Moir, Rachel Dr, Neary, Jessica Miss, Gupta, Rupa Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.301","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S96-S97, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34213,""
"Outcomes of a Quality Improvement Project to Reduce Unnecessary Blood Tests in Beechcroft Regional Child & Adolescent Mental Health Unit, Belfast Trust","AimsAn estimated 25% of blood tests are unnecessary with an annual cost to the trust of approx. Â£26.5 million. Aside from the huge financial impact, patients are undergoing unnecessary invasive procedures with detrimental impact on lab flow processes and inappropriate use of Doctor and Nursing Staff time. Some young people have multiple admissions to Beechcroft in a short space of time or bloods checked in A + E prior to transfer are missed and replicated. Longstanding use of blood template terms â€œAdmission bloodsâ€ or â€œEating Disorder Bloodsâ€ has added to the problem. Initial scoping exercise found one young person had 40 blood tests during their admission. AIM STATEMENT: Reduce baseline blood testing of Glucose, Lipids and TFTs by 10% by June 2021MethodsQI project commenced December 2019 using the IHI Model for Improvement Methodology was promoted by the project team through conversations with staff, unit meetings, email and posters.Outcome Measure: Total glucose, lipid and TFT blood tests recorded fortnightly for the unit over 18 monthsProcess Measures: Training as part of new nursing staff induction, reminders in daily nursing handover, number of staff attending Biochemistry liaison meetingsBalance Measures: Reduced blood test costs, reduced unnecessary staff workloadChange Ideas6 PDSA cycles were implementedâ€¢ Separate Bloods Diary for each ward â€“ January 2020â€¢ Blood diary brought into weekly care planning meetings â€“ July 2020â€¢ Education Posters displayed in ward clinical rooms â€“ September 2020â€¢ MDT meeting with Clinical Biochemistry â€“ April 2021â€¢ Junior Doctor to update bloods diary post weekly care-planning â€“ May 2021â€¢ Bloods diary brought to daily nursing handover & dissemination of new monitoring guidelines â€“ June 2021ResultsGlucose tests reduced by 68% with new median of 2.2 instead of 7. Lipids and TFTs median of 10 remains unchanged.ConclusionCOVID-19 has disrupted monitoring. Fundamental changes made within our service by stopping blood glucose monitoring and using BMs instead has led to significant improvements. We will continue to monitor results following 2 recent change ideas. We hope to include patient feedback moving forward.","Gillanders, Catherine Dr, Doherty, Francess Dr, Fitzsimmons, Sarah Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.296","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S94, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34214,""
"Alcohol Screening on Admission to an Acute Mental Health Ward","AimsAlcohol misuse is estimated to cost the NHS Â£3.5 billion/year. Only 6% of people suffering from alcohol dependence in England, receive treatment per year, highlighting that alcohol misuse is under-identified. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have significantly changed their drinking habits, evidenced by government tax receipt data, suggesting alcohol sales increased by 3% to 5% in the UK compared to 2019. Problems associated with harmful alcohol consumption were intensified by the crisis, even though the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption are uncertain. There was a notable increase of patients with dual diagnosis of mental illness and alcohol misuse on our ward, which is a general adult inpatient psychiatric ward. As such, the aim was to assess and improve alcohol screening on admission to an acute mental health ward.MethodsThrough a System One review, we assessed whether alcohol consumption is documented on admission (within 72 hours) in units, and a validated screening tool is used (AUDIT-C), which was expected in all patients. Their notes were initially retrospectively analysed and subsequently reviewed approximately six weeks following the implementation of interventions.Interventions included presenting the findings of the primary survey to our colleagues during a multidisciplinary team meeting on the ward and a trust-wide audit meeting attended by both junior and senior doctors. Additional interventions included posters outlining the importance of alcohol screening in the interview rooms of the acute wards (including a QR code link to our presentation and findings).ResultsOut of the 17 patients on the ward, 47% (8/17) were not appropriately screened for alcohol misuse during their first 72 hours of admission. 47% (8/17) had no documented alcohol history on admission clerking. Only 12% (2/17) had partially quantifiable alcohol intake, both drinking above the recommended weekly amount. None of the â€˜Current Drinkerâ€™ patients had AUDIT-C screening. Improvement was noted following the interventions during the secondary survey.ConclusionAlthough alcohol screening in acute psychiatric admissions is often vague or incomplete, simple reminders and education can improve screening. If the alcohol history cannot be obtained from the patient on admission, which is often the case, the clinician should clearly document review of notes for historical alcohol use, to avoid potential complications, such as alcohol withdrawal, delirium tremens or seizures.This project raises further questions on how effective brief interventions for excessive alcohol consumption in acutely unwell/psychotic patients are, encouraging a further area of research.","Sutapa Gesell, Dr, Tsitsiou, Yvonne Dr, Prochazka, Josef Mr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.295","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S94, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34215,""
"Evaluating the Dissemination of Mental Health Resources and Service Information in Primary Care: A Quality Improvement Project","AimsBackground: Demand for mental health support in primary care has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in an era of social distancing, the use of digital technology for communication has never been more important. It is therefore vital for mental health services to be easily accessible online, especially because 90% of people with mental health problems are cared for entirely within primary care, despite using &lt;10% of mental health expenditure. Aims: 1. To evaluate the dissemination of resources and services to patients during initial mental health consultations. 2. To develop an easy to access and cost-effective resource containing details of both adult and child mental health services.MethodsAn anonymised survey was used to explore the dissemination of mental health resources at the Cotswold Medical Practice. The baseline data collection revealed a lack of easily accessible and shareable information, furthermore, a review of existing literature found that no resource existed containing details of both local and national services. Consequently, two virtual documents were created for adult and child mental health resources. These were added to an accuRx template to allow clinicians to easily send the resources to patients via text message. The resources were then re-evaluated 1â€“week and 5â€“weeks postâ€“intervention.ResultsPreâ€“intervention the average GP provided patients with 2.4 mental health resources and there was no standardisation of the information given. Post-intervention, over 25 resources were provided as both 6â€“page virtual documents contain a range of resources including: NHS services, local and national charity services, private services, self-help books and mobile apps.ConclusionThe novel virtual resource produced is a cost-effective resource that helps improve the quality and quantity of information provided to patients about mental health services. The resource produced is compatible with virtual consultations and is sustainable for long term use.","Challen, Chloe Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.284","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S89, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34216,""
"Have You Seen the NEWS Today? - a QI Project","AimsThe main focus of this QIP was to improve the documentation of NEWS (National early warning scores) and subsequent escalation as appropriate in an Old Age Psychiatric Ward setting. This would in turn lead to improved Physical health outcomes, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThe NEWS chart is based on a simple aggregate scoring system in which a score is allocated to physiological measurements, when patients present to, or are being monitored in hospital. This will ensure that patients who are deteriorating, or at risk of deteriorating, will have a timely initial assessment. This should supplement clinical judgement in assessing the patient's condition.Early detection and escalation of deteriorating NEWS leads to improved patient outcomes and referral to the appropriate specialties, for subsequent management.The initial phase of the QIP comprised of retrospective data collection surrounding the recognition and documentation of NEWS on an 18-bedded Old age Psychiatric ward. This period spanned the 2nd wave of the pandemic, from November- December.Potential interventions were implemented in the form of raising NEWS awareness by educating nursing staff via teaching sessions, displaying posters all over the ward and nursing station. Team also reviewed all NEWS charts everyday during ward management rounds which served as a daily reminder for the staff measuring the observations.NEWS of & greater than 3 was defined as the threshold for escalation.Following change implementation, data were collected to capture the progress made over a month.ResultsAnalysis of data pre and post- interventions displayed a significant improvement in escalation of unwell patients from 26% to 60%.ConclusionImproved outcomes and early detection of potentially deteriorating patients, leading to early transfer of patients to an Acute Medical setting and better overall management.Raised awareness and understanding of physical health management in Mental Health nurses.The QIP was presented at the Trust QI Forum meeting and was met by and overwhelmingly positive response. In order to enhance NEWS recording an electronic format is now being adapted. There is also a consideration around providing regular NEWS teaching sessions to all inpatient staff across the trust.","Birgi, Harleen Kaur Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.281","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S87-S88, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34217,""
"Improving Access and Confidence in Learning Lessons From Serious Incidents: A Quality Improvement Project Aimed at Junior Doctors","AimsBirmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust (BSMHFT) previously developed some methods of learning lessons following serious incidents. However, despite various systems available, frontline junior doctors were not regularly exposed to important learning opportunities. This potentially resulted in doctors not being aware of learning from serious incidents, and not feeling embedded within the organisation, with potential effects on their training experience. As we identified an unmet need within the Trust in learning lessons from serious incidents amongst junior doctors, we aimed to improve access and confidence in learning from serious incidents by starting a Quality Improvement project on this theme.MethodsThe current approach involved a comprehensive quarterly bulletin circulated by email to staff. An initial survey confirmed that this was not very effective in delivering learning lessons information to junior doctors.Using a QI driver diagram, we identified potential areas for change. Selected change ideas were sequentially trialled including shortened email bulletins, supervision templates and remote learning lessons sessions. Initial PDSAs highlighted difficulties with communication via email, with many trainees failing to read/engage with this format.ResultsThe use of remote interactive learning sessions yielded positive results, with improvement in the confidence in learning from Serious incidents. We therefore continued to refine this method to wider groups.During the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced multiple setbacks and created a timeline tosupport team morale, maintain team energy, visualise progress and motivate the team. We therefore managed to persevere and strengthened the group by recruiting members to the team and complete the project.ConclusionThe team have been able to create a sustainable, effective and interactive short teaching session which has shown to be effective in engaging trainees in this vital area and help us meet our aim. This format further has the potential to be refined and implemented locally and nationally.","Beyers, Cornelia Dr, Parkinson, Eleanor Dr, Harsh, Rajendra Dr, Sameer Nardeosingh, Dr, Dolapo Oseji, Dr, Packham, Alice Dr, Conway, Nick Mr, Rowe, Renarta Dr, Scally, Ruth Dr, Rochelle-Bates, Joshua Mr, Onaiza Awais, Dr, Farhaana Surti, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.280","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S87, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34218,""
"The Pattern of Clinical Activities in Alliance CAMHS Over a 3-Month Period: 2020 vs 2021","AimsThis Quality improvement project will look into the data collected over the same period in 2020 and 2021 to highlight patterns and changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how to improve the quality of service provided by the team.MethodsThe record of a total of 349 patients was accessed from the Alliance team spreadsheet and patient electronic records (Rio) between September and November in 2020 and 2021.The inclusion criteria include:1. All patients referred to the team2. All patients managed by the team3. Patients referred between September and November 20204. Patients referred between September and November 2021Data collected include:1. Presenting complaint2. Demographics- gender and race3. Source of referral4. Outcome of referral5. Timeline of first contact after referralResults1. The overall number of referrals between September and November 2020 was more than referrals over the same time period in 2021;188 patients in 2020 and 161 in 20212. Of the 188 referred in the 2020 audited period, 55%(102) were from minority ethnic groups compared to 50%(80) in the 2021 audited period. So the number and proportion of minorities requiring mental health support rose due to the impact of COVID pandemic infections, restrictions, and lockdowns.3. In 2020, the proportion of male patients was 26%(49) compared to 18%(30) in 2021. This is important because the majority of our patients are females which implies that the COVID pandemic had a significant effect on the entire population leading to more male patient referrals.4. The overall number of patients that presented with self-harm was greater in 2020 than in the 2021 period of audit.5. The overall number of patients that presented with anxiety was also greater in 2020 than in the 2021 period of audit.6. Of the 188 patients referred between September to November 2020, 58% (109) of them were seen within 24 hours of referral compared to 61% (99) in 2021. In the 2021 period, the restrictions have stopped and it has become far easier to carry out assessments at home and school while using the necessary protective gear.7. It was noticed that there was a lot of telephone support in 2020 but none in 2021. The majority of these patients were those who were already known to the service and were being supported but deteriorated mentally during the peak of the pandemic.8. There was a lot of referral from the single point of access (SPA) in between September and November 2020 while there was none over the same time period in 2021. This could have resulted from another impact of the pandemic when a lot of service providers were off sick and their patients could not reach them directly so they opted to go through SPA. Some new referrals also came this way.9. It is also noteworthy that 59% (112) of patients seen in the 2020 audited period were already known to the service while 54%(88) seen in 2021 were known. This implies that a lot of our patients deteriorated due to the pandemic10. We also had more new referrals in 2021 than in 2020 for the same audited period.11. Six percent of the 188 patients seen 2020 audited period had telephone support while none did in 2021. Since all restrictions were lifted in July 2021, the service has opted for a more conventional approach of patient assessment which is face to face especially when expedient.12. Fifty-two percent (85) of 161 patients seen in the 2021 audited period were signposted to another service while 44% (72) of 188 seen in 2020 were signposted.ConclusionThis audit has proven that not only did the pandemic affect the overall volume of patients seen, but it also increased the proportion of male patients seen and the relative proportion of minority ethnic groups that used the service.The pandemic and government policies also influenced how patients were assessed seeing how 2020 had a lot of telephone support.It's impressive to know that the team managed to cope in these challenging periods without compromising the quality and standard of care as well as leaving behind an up to date medical records making this audit possible a d easyImportant Recommendations includes:1. Completing annual audits on the pattern of clinical activities2. Continued review of quality and consistency of data collection3.

"Psychiatric, Neurophysical and Neurocognitive Sequelae of Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome: A Systematic Review","AimsCOVID-19 causes cognitive, neurophysical and psychiatric sequalae that persist beyond the acute illness. These appear to be independent of the direct impact on respiratory function although the impact of multiorgan, especially brain pathology, may be a contributory factor â€“ as may psycho-social effects of the disease. We performed a systematic review of literature to assess the sequelae of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome to better understand the need for dedicated interventions to improve functioning.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of reports included in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. We searched for cohort studies exploring psychiatric and neuro-cognitive sequelae of post-acute COVID-19 in adults with a sample size of at least 100. The search was conducted on 4 February 2022. Findings are reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two authors independently assessed the included studiesâ€™ methodological quality using The National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies and all records were rated as good or fair.ResultsOur search identified 66 records and 14 met protocol requirements. The studies varied in sample size ranging from 100 to 3762 participants. Time to follow-up ranged from 1â€“12 months. Main symptoms identified by a majority of the studies were;Fatigue (25% to 85%) and Sleep problems (20% to 79%). Psychiatric symptoms;Anxiety (19% to 56%), Depression (11% to 47%), PTSD (6% to 43%) and altered sense of reality (3% to 15%). Neuro-cognitive symptoms;Cognitive dysfunction (25% to 85%), brain fog (12% to 81%), memory problems (24% to 73%), concentration difficulties (25% to 54%), and attention deficit (27%).Female sex, advanced age, pre-morbid asthma or COPD, increased disease severity, high BMI and new neurological complications during hospitalisation were some of the identified risk factors for persistent symptoms in post-acute COVID-19. One study identified male sex as a risk factor for moderate to severe PTSD. Current evidence suggests that symptoms decrease over time.ConclusionThere is clear evidence of neuro-physical, psychiatric and neurocognitive sequelae in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Differences in assessing and reporting findings makes it difficult to synthesize meaningful information. Identifying and formulating standardised assessments for outcome measures and reporting systems would be useful in future research. Further research into symptoms of post-acute COVID-19, to understand the pathophysiology will better enable us to raise public awareness, introduce preventative measures and incorporate appropriate treatment strategies for rehabilitation.","Vincent, Arun Dr, Oghenefejiro Ofovwe, Dr, Gschwandtner, Manfred Mr, Sukhi Shergill, Professor, Rafey Faruqui, Professor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.256","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S77, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34220,""
"Assessing the Impact of Pre-Existing Mental Health and Neurocognitive Disorders on the Mortality and Severity of COVID-19 in Those Aged Over 18 Years: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","AimsSince the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, evidence suggests that people with underlying mental health disorders have worse outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Our aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on people with pre-existing mental health or neurocognitive disorder including COVID-19 related mortality and severity.MethodsWe conducted systematic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for articles published between 1 December 2019 and 15 March 2021. The language was restricted to English. We included all case control, cohort and cross sectional studies that reported raw data on COVID-19 associated mortality and severity in participants aged 18 years or older with a pre-existing mental health or neurocognitive disorder compared to those without. Three independent reviewers extracted data according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We calculated the odds ratio as the summary measure along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The random effects model was used to calculate the overall pooled risk estimates. COVID-19 related mortality was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measure was COVID-19 related severity, defined as intensive care unit admission or use of mechanical ventilation.ResultsFifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis comprising of 8,021,164 participants. There was a statistically significant increased risk of mortality for participants with a pre-existing mental health or neurocognitive disorder compared to those without (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.63â€“2.90, P &lt; .00001). Increased mortality risk was found on subgroup analysis for participants with pre-existing schizophrenia (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.38â€“4.71, P = .003) and dementia (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 2.42â€“6.06, P &lt; .00001). There was no statistically significant difference in the severity of illness when comparing the two groups. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of participants with comorbid diabetes and chronic lung disease in those with a pre-existing mental health or neurocognitive disorder compared to those without.ConclusionThe results show that people over 18 years with a pre-existing mental health or neurocognitive disorder have an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 and are more likely to have comorbid diabetes and chronic lung disease. These results highlight the need for better physical health monitoring and management for this group of people and better integration of mental and physical health services, as well as adding to the evidence that they should be prioritised in the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination schedules worldwide.","Thomas, Catrin Dr, Williams, Laura Dr, Dhandapani, Asha Dr, Sarmishtha Bhattacharyya, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.253","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S75-S76, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34221,""
"An Overlooked Crisis: The Impact of COVID-19 on UK Medical Students and Their Mental Health","AimsMedicine is an undoubtedly challenging degree but studying medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has posed added challenges for medical students across the UK. With teaching being moved online, practical exams cancelled, and final year students being fast-tracked onto the NHS frontline, there has been a dramatic change in how traditional medicine is being taught- with a â€˜hands-onâ€™ approach being swapped for video calls and remote teaching. This study will highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of medical students, how they have coped through what has been an unprecedented two years and what can be done to support them through their medical training.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was performed on medical students at University College London. This involved a combination of face-to-face interviews and an online survey. They were asked about the impact on their overall mental well-being, as well as what the most challenging aspect of studying medicine during the pandemic was. They were also asked how optimistic they feel about their future in the medical profession. The data gathered were then analysed.ResultsThere were 30 responses, which were a combination of face to face and an online survey. Students unanimously agreed that the most challenging aspects were loneliness, lack of face-to-face teaching and minimal social interaction. 60% stated that their mental health has suffered significantly, and everyone felt that they have missed out on certain aspects of teaching during the pandemic, namely cadaveric dissections, time on wards and gaining vital communication skills. However, the benefits of online teaching included learning at their own pace and being able to take breaks to avoid burnout.ConclusionThere are limited studies looking at the long-term effect of COVID-19 on medical students in the UK. This survey highlights the detrimental impact of the pandemic on medical training and the mental health of these students. To address the possibility of burnout before they start their medical career, more resources could be signposted by medical schools to students during this challenging time. As we are transitioning out of the pandemic, we should be mindful not to forget the cohort of students who studied medicine alone in their homes. Most importantly, we must ensure this generation of doctors is well supported as they begin to care for members of the public.","Aapti Shetty, Miss, Bhatia, Gurleen Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.245","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S72, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34222,""
"Web Pages on Mindfulness-Based Interventions: A Review on the Different Training of Third-Wave Psychotherapies Available in the United Kingdom","AimsWith extensive evidence and track record on efficiency, third-wave psychotherapies, i.e. mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have gained popularity in the United Kingdom (UK) as the mainstream tool for mental health and well-being. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of MBI training has shifted from physical meetings to online to improve access nationally. To date, there is limited data on the differences of online MBIs available in the UK. This web pages review is aimed to elucidate the available resources for online training on MBIs in the UK.MethodsGoogle Search engine was used to identify web pages providing MBI training in the UK from February 2021 to March 2021. The search words used were â€œmindfulnessâ€, â€œacceptance commitment therapyâ€, â€œdialectical behaviour therapyâ€, â€œDBTâ€, â€œCompassion focused therapyâ€, â€œCFTâ€, â€œEnglandâ€, â€œNorthern Irelandâ€, â€œScotlandâ€, â€œWalesâ€, and â€œUnited Kingdomâ€. The search word â€œACTâ€ was omitted due to a high number of irrelevant search results. Inclusion criteria were any web page providing mindfulness training in the English language, based in the UK. Exclusion criteria were web pages that were not from the UK with limited information and the web page was not about the provision of mindfulness training. Given the high number of web pages appearing in the Google Search for each of the localities, further search was stopped when all ten web pages that appeared on a Google search page were all excluded.ResultsThe total number of web pages returned from searches was 23,030,000 of which were 13.1 million for England, 2.89 million for Scotland, 3.09 million for Wales, 2.18 million for Northern Ireland, and 1,770,000 were unspecified. Only 165 web pages offering MBI training were included. Among those, 57% were for the general public while 30% had information for both professionals and the public. The majority of them, i.e. 65% offered online training courses when only 25% of them offered both online and face-to-face training. There were 25% of web pages offering free basic courses for the public. There was a similar split between the group, individual and mixed training.ConclusionThere is a significant amount of MBI training resources available online for both public and professionals. One interesting finding is that a significant portion of them provide free basic training which is very encouraging and certainly has a positive impact on the accessibility of mindfulness education during the pandemic disruption.","Loo, Jiann Lin Dr, Jashan Selvakumar, Mr, May Honey Ohn, Dr, Dhandapani, Asha Dr, Sathyan Soundararajan, Dr, Ali, Sahar Ms, Nikhil Gaurishankar, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.243","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34223,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Suicidal Thoughts in the United Kingdom","AimsBackground: The impact of the pandemic and resultant restrictions on suicidal thoughts may vary across populations, geographical areas, between high and low socio-economic groups and vulnerable populations. Aim: To investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and resultant restrictions on suicidal thoughts in the United Kingdom.MethodsThe study group conducted a cross sectional survey using a questionnaire based on published approaches (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, Impact of Events Scale-Revised) to understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 and the resultant restrictions on suicidal thoughts. The study was conducted in 3 phases to capture the different phases of the pandemic restrictions:Phase 1: 1st May 2020 to 31st July 2020Phase 2: 12th November 2020 to 12th February 2021Phase 3: 1st July 2021 to 30th September 2021Inclusion: All individuals above 16 years of age who wanted to participate were eligible.Analysis strategy: Descriptive analysis and logistic regression is applied in this study.ResultsThe study recruited 29133 participants in phase 1;83851 participants in phase 2 and 75204 participants in phase 3. The largest age group of participants was 45â€“64 years. About two thirds of respondents were female. Majority of participants were of White British ethnicity. 31% participants in phase 1, 30% in phase 2 and 19% in phase 3 reported suicidal thoughts.The preliminary regression analysis indicates that younger and male participants reported more suicidal thoughts among other findings which will be reported in the presentation.Limitations: The non-probability sample design and time limited surveys meant that longitudinal changes were not possible to elicit.ConclusionThere is mixed evidence on whether rates of suicidal thoughts increased during the pandemic. The results of this study will add to the evidence base and influence future pandemic planning and efforts to developing resilience and good mental health in society.","Shanaya Rathod, Professor, Phiri, Peter Dr, Saseendran Pallikadavath, Professor, Graves, Elizabeth Dr, Brooks, Ashlea Ms, Pranay Rathod, Mr, Lin, Sharon Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.238","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S69, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34224,""
"Comparison of Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders Among the Adult Population in Bangladesh, Before and During the COVID-19 Lockdown","AimsThe aims were to determine and compare the prevalence of possible psychiatric disorders among Bangladeshi adults before and during lockdown. It was hypothesized that prevalence of possible psychiatric disorders would increase during the lockdown. In Bangladesh, lockdown was implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in conditions where those prone to developing psychiatric disorders were more vulnerable in an environment where the mental healthcare infrastructure is already lacking. Although many studies outlined the devastating impact on mental health that the lockdown measures created, this unique study specifically uses a World Health Organization developed research instrument for a lower-middle-income country.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative study with one stage design to determine possible psychiatric cases. Initially, 603 adults were randomly contacted using Facebook messenger & groups and email. Questionnaires including the validated Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ)-20 in Bangla, for screening psychopathology of the cases, and a structured questionnaire containing socio-demographic and other related variables, were inputted into Google Forms and hyperlinks were distributed. Eventually, 570 participants, from 18 to 77 years, with Internet access, who completed the questionnaires, were included in the study through purposive and consecutive sampling. The SRQ variables were divided into four categories: (1) depressive/anxious;(2) somatic symptoms;(3) reduced vital energy;and (4) depressive thoughts. Using IBM SPSS Statistics, paired sample t-tests were used during data analysis.ResultsThe mean age of cases was 34.69 Â± 13.02 years;male: female = 1.41:1. The prevalence of possible psychiatric disorders was 43.9% during lockdown compared to 23.3% before lockdown (t = 19.497, P = 0.000). Before lockdown, sex and employment status were significant factors for the SRQ positive cases. After lockdown, in the SRQ positive cases, sex, educational status, COVID-19 positive cases and death due to COVID-19 among family members were highly significant (p = 0.0001) factors. Somatic symptoms and depressive thoughts were approximately double in prevalence among the SRQ positive cases during lockdown compared to before lockdown.ConclusionThere was a significant impact on mental health where a reduction in psychological and socioeconomic support occurred. These findings are in line with those in the literature where somatic symptoms have been identified as most commonly experienced during the pandemic. Increased depressive thoughts are associated with increased feelings of possible impending death and fear of an uncertain situation. Clearly, the mental health infrastructure of Bangladesh is in even greater need of rapid change to ensure resilience to the survivors of the lockdown.","Radwan, Rifat Binte Dr, Mallik, Chiro Islam Dr, Pike, Grace Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.236","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S68, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34225,""
"Metabolic Effects of Antidepressants;Is It Time to Change the Conversation?","AimsThe incidence of depression has risen both nationally and internationally. The mainstay of management remains referral to IAPT and treatment with SSRI and SNRIs and the rates of prescribing are rising exponentially. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more people faced mental health challenges. In the last ten years, the incidence of SSRI prescribing rose from 6.8% to 100%. A known side effect of antidepressant medication is weight gain, dyslipidemia, increasing risk of impaired fasting glycaemia and diabetes. Our study was conducted to assess the actual risk incurred in our population from the point of starting therapy till date.MethodsPatients were identified from the GP clinical system (SystmOne) to identify those with a current prescription of antidepressants and antipsychotics. A retrospective analysis of 591 patients' case records was undertaken. Body weight, BMI, fasting glucose, HbA1c, fasting lipids and Q risk were analysed at the time of prescription initiation, post treatment and any rise in cardiovascular risk over a period of years. The data were analysed to see the trajectory of deterioration in metabolic risk. All patients were assessed to ensure they had been signposted and referred to weight management services.ResultsThe data show a positive correlation between the onset of antidepressant and antipsychotic prescribing, worsening of BMI, increase of cardiovascular and metabolic risk. The data show an exponential rise in BMI and metabolic risk (cardiovascular Q risk, dyslipidemia, imparied fasting glycaemia, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease) for patients taking SSRI and SNRI within 12 months. This effect continues for the length of the prescribing interval. We also found that with the rise of BMI dose, escalation was common due to reduced effectiveness. The average rise in cardiovascular Q risk average was 14.05% over three years. Patients need careful counselling at the outset and need regular reassessment of metabolic risks at each medication review. Informed consent must be obtained - risks of SSRI, SNRI and antipsychotic risk should be stated.ConclusionA known iatrogenic risk of antidepressant medication is weight gain, dyslipidemia, increasing risk of impaired fasting glycaemia and diabetes. Careful counselling and metabolic risk assessment is required when initiating these medications. Throughout the length of prescribing patients need re-assessment of their cardiovascular and diabetes risk with timely referral to weight management services to counterbalance metabolic risks.","Patel, Anjali Miss, Yathorshan Shanthakumaran, Dr, Rasheed, Reshma Dr, Imaduldin Nazir, Mr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.231","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S66, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34226,""
"How Does an Observational Assessment Adapted for Online Delivery Perform Compared to an In-Person Assessment? Learning From the National Autism Service for Adults","AimsThe National Autism Service for Adults receives over 600 referrals annually and with an extensive waitlist, COVID-19 restrictions on in-person assessments were a challenge for service delivery. We aimed to adapt the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) for online delivery and investigate whether it is comparable to the in-person ADOS in predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnostic outcome. We also aimed to obtain qualitative feedback from service users and clinicians regarding experiences of the online ADOS.MethodsA working group of staff who administer ADOS and representatives from psychiatry, psychology and management reached consensus that an online version of ADOS module 4 was feasible based on experience that a lot information required for coding is obtained verbally and some tasks were adaptable for online delivery. After the pilot, it was agreed all algorithm items could be coded except â€˜unusual eye-contactâ€™. Subsequently, 163 service users attended an online ADOS between August 2020 and February 2021. A matched-comparison group consisted of 198 service users seen for an in-person ADOS between May 2014 and February 2020. Algorithm scores were recorded and ASD diagnosis was made by a trained clinician. Qualitative feedback regarding the online ADOS was collected from 46 service users and 11 clinicians.ResultsThe working group agreed the online and in-person ADOS were closely matched regarding administration and coding. Mean scores for service users who received an ASD diagnosis were comparable for the online and in-person ADOS groups (7 and 8 respectively). This was also shown for those who were not diagnosed with ASD (3 and 4 respectively). A two-sample t-test showed no significant difference in total scores between the online and in-person ADOS (p = 0.38). Qualitative feedback suggested good service user and clinician satisfaction;only 27% of service users indicated they would have preferred an in-person assessment;88% of clinicians reported there were gains from offering an online alternative. Although the online and in-person ADOS perform similarly, clinicians reported relying more on qualitative reports over scores from the online version to inform diagnostic decision.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine using an online ADOS within an adult diagnostic service. Due to its comparable performance, the online-ADOS is a viable alternative option for service delivery when in-person assessments are not possible. As this clinic group has high rates of comorbid mental health difficulties, the applicability of online assessments could generalise to other services and have an impact beyond the pandemic.","Blackmore, Charlotte Miss, Nolan, Alexandra Miss, Vladimira Stoencheva, Miss, Greenwood, Natalie Mrs, Liu-Thwaites, Natasha Dr, Stefanos Maltezos, Dr, Grainne McAlonan, Professor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.225","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S63-S64, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34227,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence of First Episode Psychosis in South London","AimsTransmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic. Many studies are underway to ascertain the mental health impact of this seismic event, however no study has investigated its effect on psychosis incidence. We hypothesise that the overall crude incidence rates of first episode psychosis (FEP) will be higher during the pandemic when comparing the same area of South London in defined pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods.MethodsClinical records for all patients aged 18 to 64 years presenting to early intervention in psychosis services in the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth between July 1st 2019 to December 31st 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and July 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020 (pandemic period) were extracted from the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRiS), an online database containing anonymised patient records. All patients were manually screened using the Screening Schedule for Psychosis to confirm FEP, with 104/235 cases meeting criteria for FEP in the pre-pandemic period compared with 158/376 in the pandemic period. Crude, age-standardised, and sex-standardised incidence rates and ratios were calculated for interpretation.ResultsThe crude incidence rate of FEP was significantly higher in the pandemic period (68.3, 95% CI:[57.6 ;78.9]) than the pre-pandemic period (44.9, 95% CI:[36.3 ;53.6]). The crude incidence ratio was 1.52 (95% CI:[1.28 ;1.77]), indicating that the overall crude incidence of FEP in the pandemic period was significantly higher (52%) than in the pre-pandemic period. The directionality and statistical significance of this ratio was unperturbed by standardisation for age (SIR = 1.45, 95% CI[1.23 ;1.70]) and sex (SIR = 1.56, 95% CI[1.33 ;1.83]).ConclusionOur results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the incidence of FEP in the South London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth. Further research is required to elucidate the factors contributing to this increase to inform targeted interventions and prevent deterioration in at-risk patients.","Meyer, Zeryab Mr, Aryn Azlan, Miss, Edoardo Spinazzola, Dr, Quattrone, Diego Dr, Robin Murray, Sir","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.219","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S61-S62, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34228,""
"Uptake of COVID-19 Vaccination in a Medium Secure Psychiatric Hospital Population","AimsCompared with the general population, people with mental health disorders are at increased risk of negative physical and mental health outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the UK, all adult mental health in-patients were offered COVID-19 vaccination as a priority group. Patients admitted to medium secure care have greatly increased mortality compared with the general population. Understanding COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and reasons for refusal, in patients in medium secure hospitals is important given the high prevalence of chronic physical health comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes, as these conditions are also associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 disease. Aims: To assess the proportions of patients who accepted or declined the COVID-19 vaccine, and explore their reasoning. To examine vaccine uptake between White and Black Asian minority ethnic (BAME) patients, and between younger/older patients.MethodsThe study took place at a medium secure hospital with male and female inpatients. All patients were offered a COVID-19 vaccine, and had a capacity and physical health evaluation completed by their Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist.ResultsData regarding capacity to consent to the vaccine, acceptance/refusal, and demographics were retrospectively collected from the clinical records. In total, 85 patients (92.4% of eligible patients) had capacity to decide if they wanted the COVID-19 vaccine. Of these 68 (80.0%) consented and 17 (20.0%) declined to consent.A similar proportion of patients aged under and over 40 years old consented. Those from a BAME background were more likely to decline than White British patients. The reasons for capacitous refusal appeared similar to the general population.ConclusionCOVID immunisation was broadly acceptable for patients in medium secure hospitals. The prevalence and reasoning of capacitous refusal appears similar to the general English population.The indication that BAME patients were more likely than White patients to decline the vaccination echoes the findings of research conducted in the Leicester general hospital. Further consideration needs to be given to how the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination can be improved in people with BAME ethnicity, especially as this group is also overrepresented in secure hospital settings.The study demonstrates that similar services should be able to approach the vaccination process with confidence. As many people with severe mental disorder also have high physical comorbidity that would increase the risk of a poor clinical outcome if they contracted COVID-19, protecting this vulnerable population through vaccination must be a priority for mental health services.","Gibbon, Simon Dr, McPhail, Emma Dr, Mills, Georgina Dr, McBride, Martin Dr, Rebakah Storer, Ms, Taylor, Nicholas Dr, McCarthy, Lucy Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.217","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S60-S61, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34229,""
"The Relationship Between Availability and Changes to Perceived Workplace Support and Their Impact on the Mental Health, Well-being and Burn-Out of Healthcare Professionals (HCP): Insight and Mitigating Strategies From the CoPE-HCP Cohort Study","AimsTo examine the relationship between self-reported level of workplace support (WS) and various mental health outcomes in HCPs and non-HCPs at different time-points during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine whether improved WS is associated with improved mental health outcomes over time. Lastly, to identify what support healthcare professionals (HCPs) perceive to be most helpful.MethodsCohort survey study at baseline (July-September 2020) and follow-up (approximately four months later).SettingHCPs working in primary or secondary care, from UK and other countries, and non-HCP controls from primarily London-based universities.Participants1574 HCPs and 147 non-HCPs (academic and research staff at London-based universities). The inclusion criteria for the study were: 1) aged 18 or older, 2) electronic consent given, and 3) identified as HCP or non-healthcare academic staff or self-declared non-HCPs.Main outcome measuresPresence of generalized anxiety disorder (assessed using the GAD-7), clinical insomnia (ISI), major depressive disorder (PHQ-9), well-being (SWEMWBS), and burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization;EEDP2Q). Qualitative data exploring what support HCPs perceive as most useful was gathered using free-text inputs.ResultsAt baseline and follow-up, consistently, compared to those who felt unsupported, those who felt supported had significantly reduced risk (odds) of generalized anxiety disorder (baseline: 59% [95% CI of OR, 0.29 to 0.57], follow-up: 41% [0.38 to 0.92]), clinical insomnia (51% [0.34 to 0.69], 66% [0.20 to 0.55]), major depressive disorder (58% [0.31 to 0.58], 54% [0.31 to 0.74]), emotional exhaustion (65% [0.26 to 0.46], 61% [0.27 to 0.56]) and depersonalization (58% [0.28 to 0.61], 68% [0.21 to 0.50]).At follow-up, self-reported improved WS (vs. baseline) was associated with significantly improved GAD-7 (adjusted difference. -1.73 [-2.54 to -0.91]), ISI (-0.96 [-1.88 to -0.04]), PHQ-9 (-1.32 [-2.16 to -0.49]), SWEMWBS (0.97 [0.37 to 1.57]) and EEDP2Q (burnout) (-1.30 [-1.82 to -0.79]) scores, independent of baseline level of support.Five themes were identified constituting WS: â€˜managerial supportâ€™ was the largest sub-theme.ConclusionA consistent association was observed between level of WS and the mental health of HCPs and non-HCPs.

"Campus Close-Down Came in Handy: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Among Sudanese Medical Students and Their Association With Brief and Extended Closure Periods","AimsTo estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among Sudanese medical students and investigate the relationship and impact of closure periods on depression.MethodsA cross-sectional analytical study was conducted. Data were collected from 1676 enrolled students from 10 medical schools in the capital of Sudan - Khartoum- who faced complete lockdown and agreed to participate in online google form. A self-administered questionnaire containing depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-42) and socio-demographic inquires was used.ResultsThe chief responders were females 1158 (69.1%) while males were 518 (30.9%). The prevalence of stress symptoms was the highest (51.9%), followed by depression symptoms (49.8%) and anxiety symptoms (28.8%). 96 students attempted suicide (6%) and about 5 folds have suicidal ideation (27%). According to multiple binary logistic analyses, college closure time was significantly associated with decreasing chances of getting depression symptoms (OR: 0.39, 95% C.I: 0.21â€“0.70, p = 0.002), while being a female, COVID-19 patient or having a family history of depression appeared to elevate depression, anxiety and stress levels. The impact of university closure on stress and anxiety is non-significant.ConclusionDepression, stress, and to a lesser extent anxiety are widespread among Sudanese medical students and suicidal ideation is noteworthy. All of these require serious and expeditious interventions. Controversially, our findings suggest that university closure serves as a protective factor, relieving depression in medical students but not exaggerating it.","Hamid Magzoub Student, doctor, Mohammed Osman Student, doctor, Mohamed Mohamed Student, doctor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.212","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S59, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34231,""
"Insight to Psychological Aspects of Cancer","AimsThe baseline of this study1) What is the type of psychiatric disturbances in oncology settings?2) Is there any importance in cancer education?3) How to manage psychiatric disturbances?MethodsAs of lockdown concerning COVID-19, this study is conducted online among 20 cancer patients. This is a cross-sectional study where Each patient has explained the purpose of the study, procedures, and consent was taken from patients then a questionnaire was given, and this was assessed. Among the profile of the study population, 50% were males and 50% were females of the total study population, 60% were married and 40% were unmarried, Participants were aged between 22 and 63 years. The study population also consists of 20% are breast cancer, 25% lung cancer,10% lung cancer, and the rest are other types of cancers. Patient details are collected from the Facebook groups for cancer patients. Assessment has 2 parts, one is based on CES-D Test where each individual was each patient answered 20 question and next part is based on 5 questions regarding Financial Depression, Behavioral changes, Feelings, Education about cancer and Psychiatric support.ResultsIt is found that 60% population are normal, 25% had mild Depression, 10% have moderate Depression followed by 5% with severe depression.Among associations between marital status and various disorders, it was found that psychological disturbances are 2 times fold more in married people while compared to unmarried. There is also an association between treatment modalities are observed, in that anxiety is prevalent with people who had chemotherapy. Based on education and financial status, those who are with less education about cancer and less financially stable have also prominent disturbances.ConclusionThe study was based on other research study related to the spectrum of psychological disturbance based on treatment stage, financial status, awareness of cancer among patients, and role of marital status among individuals Offering mental health services to patients with cancer is becoming an integral part of oncologic treatments because psychological problems harm cancer management. The most common psychiatric disorders in cancer patients are depression, anxiety disorders, and adjustment disorders.

"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Young People With OCD","AimsThe full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be determined, but it is likely to have had a significant influence on the development of young people, especially those with mental health conditions such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This study aims to investigate the change in symptoms and whether these were linked to COVID-19/lockdown, as well as the treatment and support received.MethodsThe Mood and Anxiety team for West Kent were contacted to request patients with a diagnosis of OCD. A total of 16 patients were included (12â€“18 years, 63% female), as they were known to services prior to March 2020. Data were retrospectively collected by searching electronic notes between September 2018 and October 2021 to identify patient demographics, OCD symptoms and severity (and whether this had been affected by COVID-19/lockdown), and if they were receiving medication and therapy. It was noted whether questionnaires had been completed, and how frequently patients were contacted by CAMHS.Results75% of young people reported increasing OCD symptoms after March 2020. Of the patients who reported an increase in symptoms, nearly half (47%) explicitly attributed this to either the COVID-19 pandemic or lockdown. Prior to March 2020, 31% of patients were receiving medication for OCD, this increased to 69% of patients between March 2020 and September 2021. 31% of patients were undergoing therapy for OCD prior to March 2020, and over the following 18 months, 50% were receiving therapy, with the remainder of patients on the waiting list. The most common therapy was CBT. Prior to March 2020, 13% of patients had completed questionnaires relevant to OCD, which increased to 44% between March 2020-Septermber 2021. Patients were contacted more frequently via CAMHS post-March 2020 (62.5% vs 25%), but the method of contact switched to mainly remote methods.ConclusionOverall, there was an increase in OCD symptoms during the pandemic, with a proportion of patients identifying either COVID-19 or lockdown as contributing factors. The number of patients receiving both psychological and pharmacological therapy for OCD increased. There were low numbers of patients completing questionnaires for OCD, which would be a useful way to identify changes in symptoms across patients. Contact from mental health services increased during the pandemic, although this shifted to virtual formats. This suggests that CAMHS need to prepare for the possible increasing need for services due to the pandemic and provide support targeted to those with OCD.","Bennett, Sharna Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.175","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S44, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34235,""
"Comparative Study of Care Home Referrals During Three National COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns","AimsTo compare characteristics, presentation and treatment of care home patients referred to care home pathway team during three lockdowns.MethodsData were collected from referrals to G&W care home pathway team during lock downs:First: 23rd March 2020 to 30th June 2020Second: 5th November 2020 to 2nd December 2020Third: 5th January 2021 to 8th March 2021Variables collected included number of referrals, age, gender, type of care home, reason for referral, type of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), diagnosis, new diagnosis of dementia, comorbidity, type and professional to make initial contact, blood tests at point of referral, appointments, duration on caseload, type of interventions for BPSD, admission, and use of antipsychotics. They were analysed for statistical significance at p value &lt;0.05.ResultsThere were 23, 21 and 34 referrals respectively in the three lockdowns, with significant reduction in the weekly average of referrals (1.6), and number of men (17.4%) referred in the first lockdown. Significantly greater proportion of referrals in first lockdown was for BPSD (65.2%), with aggression (40%) as most common BPSD. Alzheimer's dementia was commonest dementia (67%) across lockdowns with fewer new diagnosis (21.7%) made in first lockdown. There was lower rate of delirium (21.7%) in fist lockdown associated with fewer blood investigations (56.5%) at point of referral. Although there was no difference by type of professional, number of appointments, and discharges, duration on caseload (median 58.5 days) was significantly longer during first lockdown. There was access to medical, nursing, and psychological therapies input during all lockdowns. There was reduction in medication prescription including antipsychotics (33%), with no new antipsychotics commenced in all lockdowns.ConclusionDespite availability of mental health services, this study highlights reduction in access to mental health services as well as physical health investigations for elderly residents in care homes during the first lockdown.","Vellingiri Raja Badrakalimuthu, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.173","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S43, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34236,""
"Experience and Reflection From Inpatient Staff at an Intellectual Disability Hospital During COVID-19","AimsThe COVID-19 pandemic and the associated impact on the NHS led to particular challenges for Intellectual Disability (ID) inpatient hospitals across the country. The aim of this Research Project is to gather the experience of Inpatient staff in our local ID Hospital following the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in July 2020.MethodsWe gathered data by means of survey from inpatient staff including â€˜staff nursesâ€™ and â€˜health care support workersâ€™ from 2 cute assessment and treatment units and 1 rehabilitation unit over the preceding 3 months. We obtained 15 responses. We gathered quantitative data via a questionnaire on the views of staff regarding the service provision for patients and staff during COVID-19. We also gathered qualitative data on learning points and how things would have been done differently in hindsight.ResultsThe responses were anonymised, directly transcribed, coded and grouped into themes. 67% of staff stated appropriate type and quantity of Personal Protective Equipment was available. 60% of staff stated it was â€˜easyâ€™ to access a General Practitioner for patient reviews. 60% of staff stated, there was a change in arrangements for Do Not Resuscitate/Escalation plans during COVID-19. 47% of staff stated there was availability of virtual or face-to-face clinical training support. 67% of staff did not take sickness leave due to symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 patient. 67% of staff did not receive or found it difficult to access a COVID-19 test. 47% of staff reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their physical and mental health well being. 13% of staff found the Counselling/emotional Support helpful.Some of the key themes that emerged in the qualitative data analysis included the importance of being grateful for personal health and well being, move lives could be saved if earlier and more frequent testing was available during the first wave, delays in the arrival of PPE in the hospital and ideas to mitigate risk by designating members of staff to a fixed work area to reduce mixing.ConclusionA wide range of reflections, suggestions and feedback were obtained during the research project which will be helpful to plan and organise services moving forward should future waves of COVID-19 emerge.","Malhotra, Rahul Dr, Zeenish Azhar, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.172","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S43, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34237,""
"Association of Social Anxiety Disorder and Physical Activity With Psychological Distress During COVID-19 Imposed Lockdown: A Medical Student Survey From a Developing Country","AimsCOVID-19 imposed lockdowns have impacted the mental health of medical students worldwide. However, the relationship of social anxiety disorder with psychological distress during the pandemic has not been studied. The objective of this study was to assess the association of social anxiety disorder and physical activity with psychological distress in medical students during COVID-19 imposed lockdown.Methods256 medical students (M/F: 144/112) took part in this online cross-sectional survey conducted in September 2020 during a government imposed lockdown. Kessler-10 (K10) questionnaire, social interaction anxiety scale (SIAS) and international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) - short form were used to assess psychological distress, social anxiety and physical activity, respectively. Data were analysed using SPSS v25, with application of multivariate logistic regression to assess association of various factors with psychological distress.ResultsOut of 256 medical students, 73 (28.5%) had severe psychological distress and 105 (41.0%) had mild to moderate distress. A logistic regression model to assess the effect of social anxiety disorder, level of physical activity and gender with the likelihood of having severe psychological distress was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) with overall accuracy of 73.8%. The risk of developing severe psychological distress was higher among females [OR 2.13 (95% CI 1.17â€“3.87), p = 0.013] and those with social anxiety disorder [OR 4.56 (95% CI 2.27â€“9.16), p &lt; 0.001]. Low physical activity was not a significant risk factor for psychological distress [OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.35â€“2.23), p = 0.794].ConclusionThis study shows that COVID-19 imposed lockdown has adversely affected the mental health of medical students. Female students and those with social anxiety disorder are at more risk of developing severe psychological distress.","Muhammad Arish, Mr, Muhammad Arham, Dr, Rehan, Fatima Ms, Sajeel Saeed, Mr, Kashif Tousif, Mr, Farhan, Muhammad Mr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.169","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S41-S42, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34238,""
"Mental Health Status of High School Students in Khartoum State, Sudan During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","AimsThis study sought to assess mental health status of high school students in Khartoum State, to evaluate the participantsâ€™ adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures and to identify factors associated with commitment to COVID-19 guidelines and mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThis was a descriptive, cross-sectional and institution-based study. 364 post-primary students in 10 schools were selected by multistage stratified cluster sampling. Mental health status was evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Chi-square testing was used to identify influencing factors of mental health status and commitment to practicing COVID-19 preventive measures.ResultsA median commitment score of 2/5 was achieved. 70.8% of students in this study demonstrated low commitment (&lt; 50%) to practicing COVID-19 preventive guidelines. Commitment to COVID-19 preventive measures was significantly associated with gender (p = 0.047), academic year (p = 0.033) and post-primary schools attended by the participants (p &lt; 0.001). 36.5% of the participantsâ€™ GHQ-12 scores demonstrated severe psychological distress (GHQ-12 &gt; 20/36). A mean GHQ-12 score of 18.4 and median of 19 was achieved, indicating moderate to severe psychological distress. GHQ-12 scores were significantly associated with incidence of COVID-19 infection among family members (p = 0.016).ConclusionOver one-third of high school students in Khartoum State demonstrated moderate to severe psychological distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was significantly associated with first-degree family members having a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Commitment to preventive measures set by the General Directorate of Global Health was significantly associated with gender and academic year. A lesser psychological impact could be achieved through timely health education, expression of confidence in professional healthcare providers and perception of sound health status, together with consistent public health campaigning.","Randa Altamih, Dr, Osman Elmahi, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.164","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S39-S40, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34239,""
"Differences in Remote Mental Healthcare: Minority Ethnic Service User Experiences and Perceptions During COVID-19","AimsCOVID-19 has resurfaced health inequalities but also provides new opportunities for remote healthcare. Minority ethnic service users (SUs) are substantially under-represented in secondary mental health services due to gaps in understanding needs of this priority group. We aimed to assess and identify any differences in characteristics and acceptability, with a focus on minority ethnic mental health SUs.MethodsA prospective, online feedback questionnaire was developed with the help of SUs. This was built into video consultations (VCs), using the secure Attend Anywhere platform through a survey link. We present results between July 2020 and January 2022, during which, a total of 2,565 SUs completed the online questionnaire after VCs. SPSS (version 27) was used for descriptive statistical analysis. Chi-squared test, using 5% level of significance, was conducted to test differences between the two (minority Vs majority ethnic) SU groups.ResultsOf 2,565 SUs, 119 (4.6%) were from minority ethnic groups (Asian British, Mixed/multiple, Black British, and Other), 2,398 (93.5%) were White British, and 48 (1.9%) preferred not to disclose. A higher percentage of SUs were females from both minority (55.6%) and White British (66.1%) ethnic groups (<U+03F0>2=5.476, p &lt; 0.05). By age group, almost half (48.7%) of minority ethnic SUs were less than 25 years old, compared with those from White British ethnicity (29.2%). In contrast, only 2.5% minority ethnic SUs were aged =65 years with none =80 years old (<U+03F0>2 Likelihood Ratio = 27.11, p &lt; 0.001).No significant differences were found for video technical quality, such as waiting area, joining the video call, sound, and video quality. Similar findings were observed for video care delivery aspects with no significant differences between (minority ethnic and White British) SUs. Overall, both groups felt comfortable during the video call (<U+03F0>2=0.137, p &gt; 0.05), their needs were met (<U+03F0>2=0.384, p &gt; 0.05) and felt supported (<U+03F0>2=0.164, p &gt; 0.05). However, according to care team, a significantly higher percentage of minority ethnic SUs (43%) had remotely consulted Specialist (Eating disorders, Well-being/IAPT) services compared with those of majority ethnicity (29%) (<U+03F0>2 Likelihood Ratio = 21.936, p &lt; 0.05).ConclusionBoth minority ethnic and White British SUs found video care to be acceptable, with positive experiences. A significantly high proportion of minority ethnic SUs was younger and had remotely consulted Specialist services, with none in the 80-plus age group. These findings highlight priority areas to address among this massively underrepresented group in mental healthcare services.","Lamiya Samad, Dr, Teague, Bonnie Dr, Moreira, Karen Dr, Bagge, Sophie Ms, Khalifa Elzubeir, Dr, Marriott, Emma Dr, Wilson, Jonathan Dr, Agarwal, Nita Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.162","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S38-S39, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34240,""
"Face-to-Face Psychiatry Placements and Their Impact on Student Attitudes to Psychiatry","AimsLast year the COVID-19 pandemic meant that there could not be any face-to-face psychiatry placements for medical students at QMUL (Queen Mary University of London). This year there has been a return to face-to-face placements within psychiatric settings. The aim of this project was to evaluate whether face-to-face placements have an impact on medical student attitudes to psychiatry. This will have implications for recruiting students into the specialty, once they qualify.Methods128 students were placed in face-to-face psychiatric settings at the beginning of their 4th year of medical school. The placements were 3 days a week for 5 weeks. The placements varied with some students being placed in inpatient services and others within the community, across a broad range of subspecialties including child and adolescent, general adult and forensic. Students were given the Attitudes To Psychiatry Questionnaire to fill out before and after their placement. Students were also given the opportunity to provide open text feedback on their placement in the form of a weekly feedback form. Results were analysed using simple descriptives of data and paired t-tests. The study was conducted with permission from Associate Dean for Undergraduate Teaching and QMUL Centre Lead for Psychiatry.Results115 students (89.8%) completed pre-placement attitudes to psychiatry questionnaire and 51 students (39.9%) completed the post-placement questionnaire.Paired t-tests were used to compare average pre and post-placement results for individual questions. There were significant changes in student responses to questions about psychiatric undergraduate training being valuable, attitudes to psychiatrists and psychiatric treatment. Lots of students gave positive feedback on their placements citing interesting experiences, helpful seniors and varied learning opportunities.ConclusionStudents having face-to-face psychiatry placements has objectively changed some attitudes to psychiatry and is very important for their experience and interest in the specialty. The students have valued the exposure and contact with patients and the varied experiences. This will hopefully lead to more students considering psychiatry as a career as well as keeping mental health as a priority for any patient that they see.","Swerdlow, Abigail Dr, Rudra, Sonya Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.156","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S36, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34241,""
"OpenMinds on Mental Health Literacy: A Reflective Journey of a Medical Student","AimsAs a medical student from a local university, the first author undertook a mental health education course, i.e. OpenMinds at the King's College University. The aim of the course is to improve literacy about key mental health issues that children and adolescents face and the stigma against mental illnesses. Upon completion of training, a medical student will be able to lead intervention workshops to share the mental health knowledge with local school audiences on these issues, promote early detection of mental illnesses among the audiences and their peers with the aim of improving health-seeking behaviour by providing information of where to access help to reduce the duration of untreated illness. This article is aimed to describe the personal reflective experience of a medical student and the lessons learnt.MethodsThe OpenMinds course was an eight-week workshop on important mental health topics such as depression, anxiety, coping strategies and psychosis. This was followed by a session on effective teaching detailing various techniques including maintaining children's concentration, increasing engagement by utilising different learning techniques, safeguarding and maintaining well-being during conversations about difficult and sensitive topics.ResultsAfter attending the OpenMinds educational workshop, the first author had delivered three workshops (one primary school and two secondary schools) as part of the bigger organising team from the other university. Overall, the verbal feedback from the local schools on the workshops was positive (Kirkpatrick's evaluation outcome level one). The challenge faced was virtual teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic which meant not being able to read facial expressions or body language while delivering information. This limitation could be mitigated by having a trained teacher moderating the sessions on-site and making sure the workshops ran smoothly. Online lessons emphasised the use of technology which was proven to be useful as videos and other audiovisual aids had the ability to keep the children engaged and provide different sources of learning concurrently.ConclusionHaving participated in this course, the first author has learned teaching skills and a better way of communicating mental health issues to vulnerable audiences. Although face-to-face workshops are still not possible at the time of writing, the first author is keen to set up an OpenMinds branch at his university and be able to share with his fellow colleagues these skills in the future.","Jashan Selvakumar, Mr, Loo, Jiann Lin Dr, May Honey Ohn, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.151","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S34, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34242,""
"Junior Doctor Mentors: Enhancing Medical Student Psychiatry Training","AimsIncreased clinical contact during undergraduate psychiatry placements has been shown to both increase the likelihood of students considering a career in psychiatry and reduce mental-health related stigma. It can be challenging to provide medical students with a valuable clinical experience, a problem which has been further exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. We aimed to develop a junior doctor mentoring scheme to increase clinical exposure and teaching for students.MethodsWithin NHS Lanarkshire, groups of 4â€“6 University of Glasgow medical students are accommodated for their five-week clinical psychiatry blocks, during which they have a varied structured timetable, providing an overview of different psychiatric specialties. As such, students meet a wide range of clinicians, which can unfortunately mean there is little continuity in their training throughout the block.We developed a mentoring scheme to help address this issue. Enthusiastic trainee doctors â€“ including foundation year two doctors, GP trainees and psychiatry core trainees â€“ were invited to participate. Medical students are paired with a mentor for the duration of their block, during which they meet informally on a weekly basis. Mentors provide students with ward shadowing opportunities and bedside teaching, as well as completing work-place based assessments (WPBAs), discussing case reports and providing an additional perspective for end-of-block reports.ResultsThe mentoring scheme has been running successfully for every five-week student placement since October 2020. Student feedback has been collected via an anonymous electronic questionnaire. Students were asked what they enjoyed the most about their placement, with students frequently highlighting the support from their mentor.Examples from free-text comments included, â€œhaving an assigned mentor was really useful as someone to touch base with and go through clinical casesâ€ and, â€œhaving a mentor was invaluable â€“ it is crucial to have a friendly face on the wards and a contact to complete WPBAsâ€.Informal feedback from mentors has also been positive with trainees enjoying the opportunity to develop their teaching skills and support student training. Mentors also highlighted the role's benefit for their portfolios and specialty applications.ConclusionThis simple and cost-free intervention has had resoundingly positive feedback from medical students and trainees. Medical students enjoy having consistent informal teaching, support and feedback. Our mentoring scheme will continue for all medical students in NHS Lanarkshire and we would encourage other areas to consider a similar project. By increasing clinical exposure we hope to further reduce mental health stigma amongst students and inspire the psychiatrists of tomorrow.","Ruddock, Kenneth Dr, Neil, Catriona Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.148","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S33, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34243,""
"Buddhist Philosophy and Mental Health: Lessons for the 21st Century","AimsThe aim of this research was to highlight the aspects of Buddhist philosophy which may help to improve mental health. COVID-19 has had a considerable psychological impact on healthcare staff and the general population, emphasizing the importance of treatments and techniques to aid their mental health.MethodsMindfulness, Impermanence and Non-self were discussed as core aspects of Buddhist philosophy and how these relate to mental well-being. Reference was made to peer-reviewed studies that show the positive effects of these concepts.ResultsThis research highlighted the wealth of evidence that Mindfulness, Impermanence and Non-self has in improving mental well-being. However, there were also risks, including depersonalisation and increased anxiety in certain mindfulness practitioners.ConclusionThe findings of this research has generated new ways in which we discuss mental well-being and challenges our current understanding of suffering, providing individuals with further tools to assist with their mental health.

"A Perinatal Mental Health Education Programme for Maternity, Neonatal and Other Allied Multidisciplinary Teams in NHS Lothian: Why, How, and What's Next","AimsThroughout the development of the NHS Lothian Perinatal Mental Health Service, their goals alongside maternity and neonatal teams, family nurse and health visiting services have been to strengthen interdisciplinary working and improve the quality of perinatal mental health care delivered to birthing people. The aims of developing a programme of multidisciplinary education sessions were to develop the knowledge and confidence of non-mental health professionals in caring for birthing people experiencing mental health difficulties, and aid understanding of available services and referral pathways to facilitate appropriate care.MethodsThe programme has been delivered by a Perinatal Psychiatrist and Clinical Midwifery Educators in bimonthly sessions lasting two hours. Sessions have included scenario-based learning, education regarding illnesses and disorders, and promotion of infant mental health and trauma-informed care.Participants have attended virtually via Microsoft Teams or in person. Sessions have been recorded and accessed following teaching. Confidentiality is upheld throughout. A standard operating procedure utilising multi-modal methods has been designed to maximise staff engagement with sessions. Feedback accessed via a QR code has been collated via a Microsoft Forms questionnaire comprising of Likert scale and free-text answer questions. Feedback has guided programme development and topic selection.Initially, sessions were open to inpatient maternity services, but now outpatient maternity services, neonatology, and health visiting and family nursing colleagues are invited to maximise the reach of the staff delivering sessions.ResultsSessions have been well accessed by a variety of professionals, with increasing attendance at each session. Feedback has been obtained from 43% of those attending. Results have been very positive: 100% of respondents strongly agreed or agreed that the format of the session worked well with 92% of respondents strongly agreeing or agreeing that the session content was pitched at the appropriate level. 100% of respondents felt that the content covered was useful in their clinical role which supports the emphasis of the sessions on linking knowledge to clinical application to build confidence. 100% of respondents would recommend these education sessions to a colleague.ConclusionFeedback to date has shown that participants have found the sessions to be accessible and the content appropriately pitched and clinically valuable. Despite launching the programme amidst the challenges of COVID-19, participants have found the delivery of the sessions to be supportive and collaborative.The next phase in the development of the programme will be to understand in more detail what participants are learning and the impact on their practice.","Argent, Vikki Dr, Sherratt, Megan Ms, Nelson, Marian Ms","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.104","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S14-S15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34245,""
"Improving the Appropriateness of Referrals From Primary to Secondary Care Confounded by the COVID Era: Student Status and Quality of Referral Evaluation in Oxford City Team (SQUARE-OCT)","AimsThe Oxford City and NE Oxon Adult Mental Health Team (AMHT) is an adult mental health team receiving referrals from GPs for most cases suspected to have a mental health illness requiring secondary mental health servicesâ€™ input in Oxford city. In January 2020, the team was remodelled with care coordinators working in separate functions based on the duration AMHT support was required for, i.e. an assessment team and a treatment team, but with medics covering both functions of the team. This quality improvement project examines AMHT referrals over 2020/21, hypothesising a reduction in the proportion of inappropriate referrals following the remodelling compared to a 2018/19 pre-remodelling audit.MethodsThe project covers a total of 2803 referrals the team has received from 13/01/2020 to 12/01/2021. The outcomes measured included the number of inappropriate referrals returned to the GP, referrals only requiring a single assessment, the proportion of these referrals as university students in Oxford, and the diagnostic groupings of the referrals in students vs non-students. These outcomes were measured pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic over 2020/21.ResultsA reduction in the total number of referrals to the team was noted over 2020/21 but this was compared to an 11 month audit in 2018/2019. During the study period, 19.5% (546/2803) of referrals were deemed inappropriate compared to 21% of referrals received in 2018/2019. Of 2803 referrals, 14.7% (97/658) were inappropriate pre-COVID-19 vs 20.9% (449/2145) during the pandemic. Of the total number of referrals, 32.9% were returned to the GP following a single assessment.The top 3 diagnostic categories in â€˜non-studentsâ€™ were mood/affective disorders (33.7%), anxiety/stress related disorders (17.2%), and neurodevelopmental disorders (7.8% total - ADHD was 3%). A significant increase in ADHD referrals and mood disorders amongst students compared to non-students is notable with the top 3 diagnostic categories for students being mood/affective (24.7%), neurodevelopmental disorders (19.5% - ADHD 17.7%), and anxiety/stress related disorders (13.4%). Students constituted 26% of the total number of referrals.It was notable that during the pandemic there was a higher proportion of inappropriate referrals.ConclusionOur project demonstrates a reduction in the proportion of inappropriate referrals sent to the AMHT following remodelling as compared to 2018/19. Further work is necessary to elucidate the contributing factors and reduce inappropriate referrals even further. An innovation is planned to automate the logging of referral outcomes to expedite a re-audit.","Quadros, Wesley Mr, Ahmad, Mohamed Dr, Wishwanath Patkee, Dr, Theodora Katsanouli, Dr, Hyams, Katy Dr, Watkins, Nicola Ms, Amani Krayem, Ms, Maja Bilip, Dr, Zghoul, Tarek Dr, Shah Tarfarosh, Dr, Holm-Mercer, Leah Dr, Sureyya Toparlak, Dr, Tian, Adam Dr, Masood, Khadija Dr, Digby Quested, Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.93","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34246,""
"Safety of Delivering Eating Disorders Day Treatment Programme on the Virtual Platform in (COVID-19) Pandemic","AimsIntensive treatment for eating disorders include day treatment programme and specialist inpatient. COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdown in the UK on the 23rd March 2020. Adult Eating Disorders Day Treatment Programme in Surrey started delivering their care on the virtual platform from that date. It offered a combination of â€˜virtualâ€™ only and â€˜blendedâ€™ care (virtual and in person) for more than a year. This service evaluation examined the safety of delivering intensive eating disorders treatment on the virtual platform.MethodsData from March 2020 to March 2021 were retrospectively collected from Electronic patient record. Two clinicians collected the data on age, referral origin, accommodation, employment status, diagnosis (subtype), length of illness, comorbid mental and physical health diagnosis, duration of day care treatment, medication, admission weight and BMI, discharge weight and BMI, changes in bloods and ECG, acute hospital admission, risk-to-self events, admissions to Specialist Eating Disorders Unit and reasons for discharge.ResultsData indicated that 21 patients were admitted in day treatment programme over 1 year period. 10 patients had solely virtual treatment and 11 patients had blended day treatment programme. 11 patients had anorexia nervosa restrictive subtype, 5 patients had Anorexia Binge purge subtype and 5 patients had Anorexia Nervosa, Unspecified.Average length of illness was 4.49 years. Mean age for the group was 24.7 years and most patients lived with family (n 18) and were unemployed (n 11). More than 2/3rd (76%) patients had comorbid mental health diagnosis and 48% (n 10) had comorbid physical health diagnosis.Average length of admission was 5.26 months. Mean BMI on admission was 15.3 (Range 12â€“19) and mean BMI on discharge was 16.9 (Range 13.65â€“22).Safety and outcome data indicated that there were no serious incidents recorded in that time period. 1 (5%) patients required admission to acute hospital as their physical health deteriorated. 8 (38%) patients required specialist inpatient admission as the day care did not affect any changes to their eating behaviours, and 4 (19%) patients had events indicating self harm episodes(19%).ConclusionOur service evaluation data indicated that it is relatively safe to deliver day treatment programme on the virtual platform. Weekly face to face physical health monitoring (weight, BP, Pulse, temperature) and regular physical health investigations (Blood tests and ECG) were integral part of managing risks to health. On the other hand, delivering day treatment programme on the virtual platform has enabled the day treatment programme to prevent any significant outbreak of COVID-19 in a vulnerable group of patients and allowed them to receive uninterrupted support during pandemic.","Adaora Obiekezie, Dr, Friel, Claudia Ms, Pathan, Mohammad Tayeem Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.91","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34247,""
"Training Non-Medical Staff for SARS-CoV-2 Swab Collection on a Psychiatric Old Age Ward","AimsIn the second half of 2020 patients admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre had to isolate in their rooms until a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result was obtained. This was stressful for both patients, who were unwell in their mental state, and staff. Swabs for PCR testing were only being collected by junior doctors which meant that out of hours, this responsibility would fall exclusively upon the duty doctor. There were often significant delays to obtain a sample. We decided to train non-medical staff on an old age ward so that the responsibility of collecting samples could be shared with nurses and healthcare assistants.MethodsIn November 2020 we held one training session with several members of staff from our ward. In the following days we did one to one training sessions with the members of staff who, due to their shifts, were not available for the original training session. We excluded admissions that happened prior to SARS-CoV-2 being mandatory, those where the patient refused to be swabbed, and those patients who were transferred from another institution already with a pre-admission swab.ResultsThere were 37 admissions, of which we included 30 based on the exclusion criteria. 17 admissions occurred prior to training and 13 after the training sessions. Prior to training, it took 1.059 days to obtain a sample and it took 0.846 days after the training sessions.ConclusionProviding a training session to enable nurses and healthcare assistants to take samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing reduced the amount of time between admission and obtaining a swab sample. We therefore shortened the first step of the process that leads to obtaining a negative result and enable a patient to come out of isolation.","Legg, Joanna Dr, Ouabbou, Sophie Dr, Hay, Susan Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.90","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S7-S8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34248,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak (2nd Wave) on Mental Health of the Healthcare Community in the NHS: A Web-Based Questionnaire Study","AimsTo determine the mental impact the second wave of COVID-19 has had on health care professionals working in the National Health Services (NHS), United Kingdom.MethodsA cross-sectional descriptive web-based survey was conducted among the staff of National Health Services (NHS) in Poole, United Kingdom. Two tertiary care hospitals staff were part of this study. The study was spanned over a duration of 6 months, October 2020 to April 2021. A standard GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaire along with demographic information was uploaded on google docs for data collection. All healthcare staff working in the hospitals were included. Any person that did not fill the questionnaire completely was excluded. Data collected were analysed using SPSS for descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test was done keeping p &lt; 0.05 as significant.ResultsA total of 160 health care professionals took part in the survey, with a mean age of 37.36 (SD = 11.51) years, predominantly females (58.8%). The majority of participants were not depressed (78.1%, p = 0.004) nor were they anxious (85%, p = 0.008). A significant difference (p = 0.050) was seen in participant's anxiousness regarding the source of information. All other demographic parameters were not significant for differences in depression or anxiety (p &gt; 0.05). 33.6% of the respondents agreed and 9.6% totally agreed to being terrified of contracting the coronavirus. 40.4% disagreed while 16% did not have an opinion. A similar trend was seen for the other statements. More than half (56.3% and 56.9%) of the participants answered in the affirmative that they were worried about contracting the disease and getting their living place contaminated, a staggering 91.3% were anxious about affecting their families.ConclusionThe second wave of COVID-19 has had minimal effect on the mental health of health care workers in the NHS.","Nasim, Omer Dr, Hayat, Muhammad Khizar Dr, Hussain, Zeinab Dr, Malghalara Afridi, Dr, Khan, Raza Ali Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.89","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S7, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34249,""
"Evaluation of a Drama-Based Experiential Learning Group Programme for Multidisciplinary Staff and People With Lived Experience in Psychiatry","AimsExperiential learning, such as simulation-based training, is widely used in health education. Dramatic self-expression adds another layer through enacted perspective taking, and embodied self-exploration of interaction with others, to foster situated learning. We describe the evaluation of an innovative drama-based experiential learning project involving collaboration between multidisciplinary mental healthcare staff and people with lived experience of mental illness. The programme was facilitated at East London NHS Foundation Trust by a theatre company experienced in delivering workshops with service users. A weekly group programme took place online over 8 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic and included activities of improvisation, embodied enactments and debriefing. The programme led to co-production of a drama piece that was filmed and distributed online. It was hypothesised that the experiential learning might result in individual benefits for all participants, such as improved well-being and increased mutual understanding of each other's experience of mental health care. The project aimed to improve relationships between healthcare disciplines, and between staff and service users. Additionally, aims were to empower service users, and support staff to practice core interpersonal skills. Objectives of the evaluation were to study the impact of the experiential learning, understand participantsâ€™ experience, and explore challenges and benefits.MethodsA mixed methods approach was taken to evaluate the programme. Following completion of the project, participants were invited to complete a questionnaire utilising a Likert scale rating of overall satisfaction with the project, perceived benefit and impact on specific domains such as working with others. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted according to a topic-guide, and qualitative data were analysed using open & axial coding for thematic analysis.Results11 participants, including Psychiatrists, Occupational Therapists and current service users, completed the experiential learning and filming. Questionnaire data suggested participants were highly satisfied with the learning and felt it would be valuable to others. Themes include the positive experience of creativity, dismantling of hierarchy, improved empathy, confidence and connection. Potential challenges were digital inequality and lack of dedicated time for professional development.ConclusionA drama-based experiential learning group programme for healthcare staff and service users is a highly beneficial learning experience. Participants describe changes on a personal level as well as improved understanding of othersâ€™ perspectives. This form of experiential learning features collaborative working that aligns with principles of co-production and supports the development of interpersonal skills;the findings suggest that drama-based experiential learning is a useful method in health education to complement knowledge acquisition.","Dave, Rupal Dr, Walker, Thomas Dr, Grant-Peterkin, Hugh Dr, Fisher, Robert Dr, Frank Rohricht, Professor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.79","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S2-S3, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34250,""
"Exploring the effect of implementing affordable socially assistive pet robots in eight care homes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a stratified cluster randomised controlled trial and mixed-method study","Robot pets may assist towards challenges of supporting an aging population with growing dementia prevalence. Prior work focused on impacts of robot seal Paro on older adult wellbeing, but recent studies suggest good acceptability and implementation feasibility of more affordable devices (Joy for All (JfA) cats and dogs). We aimed to respond to limited effectiveness research. We conducted an eight-month, stratified, cluster randomised controlled trial, in eight care homes in Cornwall, UK. Over four months, four care homes each received two JfA devices (one cat and dog), and four homes received care as usual (intervention and control group). Psychometrics were collected pre and post intervention, to compare change from baseline to follow-up in the intervention vs control group. In the final four months, all eight care homes had devices, but only qualitative data was collected, due to Covid-19 and reduced capacity. The primary outcome was neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home version (NPI)). Care provider burden was a secondary outcome (occupational disruptiveness NPI subscale), alongside the Challenging Behaviour scale, Holden Communication scale, Campaign to End Loneliness questionnaire and medication use. Qualitative data was collected through care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews to understand use, experience and impact. We also collected demographic data and assessed dementia severity. In total, 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection. There was a significant difference in total change from baseline to follow-up for NPI (p=.000) and occupational disruptiveness (p=.031) scores between the intervention and control group. Neuropsychiatric symptoms increased in the control group, while decreasing in the intervention group. No significant difference was seen for communication issues or challenging behaviour. On NPI sub-domains, there was a significant difference from baseline to follow-up for delusions (p=.034), depression (p=.010), anxiety (p=.001), elation (p=.023) and apathy (p=.009), all of which decreased in the intervention group and increased slightly in the control group. The summative impact results suggested most residents who interacted with robots received a positive impact (85%, 46/54). Those who interacted had significantly higher dementia severity scores (p=.001) than those who did not interact. The qualitative results suggested good adoption and acceptability, suitability for subjectively lonely individuals, lack of novelty effect through sustained use and demonstrated 'reasons for use' of robots were entertainment, anxiety and agitation. Affordable robot pets hold potential in improving wellbeing for care home residents and people with dementia, including reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness. This work suggests no novelty effect, and contributes towards understanding robot pet suitability, finding interactions were more common among residents with more moderate/severe dementia and potentially those subjectively lonely. This trial was pre-registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04168463), and is reported following the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trials.","Bradwell, Edwards, Winnington, Thill, Allgar, Jones","https://doi.org/10.2196/38864","20220713","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34251,""
"Impact of Social Isolation on the Physical and Mental Health of Older Adults: A Follow-Up Study at the Apex of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives and caused changes in habits. The World Health Organization recommends social isolation as a way of minimizing the risk of contagion of the disease. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of older adults and to investigate how anthropometric, functional, and clinical aspects are associated with this process. Fifty healthy older adults were followed-up during 5 months. The subjects had their physical and mental health assessed during social isolation (pre-vaccine situation) and after the opening of stores and activities in the municipality (post-vaccine situation). Physical evaluation was performed using the 30-s sit and stand test. Participants' mental health was assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Loneliness Index. In this methodological design, muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and loneliness index were subject to pre-post analyses. In addition, these variables were included as outcomes in linear regression models. Participants' anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors were included as predictors of the statistical model. Participants' scores at baseline were consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscle strength of the subjects was appropriate to their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined, but with statistical significance only for depressive symptoms (p = 0.017, effect size of 0.11). Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained 42.8% of depressive symptoms, 22.3% of loneliness, and 30.2% of muscle strength in the elderly. Older adults presented baseline scores consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscular strength of the subjects was appropriate for their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined. Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained a substantial part of the depressive symptoms, loneliness, and muscular strength in the elderly. Health care professionals should be aware of performing a wide assessment in subjects' lives to ensure better health status.","Vidal Bravalhieri, Oliveira Rodrigues, Batiston, de Souza Pegorare, Christofoletti","https://doi.org/10.1159/000525661","20220713","Aging; COVID-19; Health impact assessment; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34252,""
"Online cognitive behavioural therapy as a psychological vaccine against stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women: A randomised controlled trial","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the population's levels of stress and anxiety due to its contagious nature and the uncertainties generated by its novelty. One population that is especially vulnerable to these psychological consequences are pregnant women. This is why the objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an online stress management programme of a cognitive behavioural nature on pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Spain. The trial was controlled and randomised, with a total of 207 pregnant women divided into three groups: the Online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy group (o-CBT) (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 70); the Online Psychological Support group (o-PS) (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 69); and the Usual Care group (UC) (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 68). To test the therapy's efficacy, the women's resilience, perceived stress, pregnancy-specific stress and psychopathological symptoms were assessed before and after the intervention. The o-CBT and o-PS consisted of a programme of 8 group sessions (one per week). The results showed that pregnant women who participated in the o-CBT group presented lower rates of pregnancy-specific stress and perceived stress, as well as greater resilience and lower anxiety, depression and obsessions-compulsions symptoms. These data show the efficacy of the treatment programme and thus confirm the importance of implementing these types of interventions during a woman's pregnancy, especially over periods of major stress, such as during a pandemic.","Puertas-Gonzalez, MariÃƒÂ±o-Narvaez, Romero-Gonzalez, Sanchez-Perez, Peralta-Ramirez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.07.016","20220713","COVID-19; Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; Pregnancy; Psychopathology; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34253,""
"Characteristics of mental health stability during COVID-19: An online survey with people residing in a city region of the North West of England","Despite the significant mental health challenges the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated government measures have presented, research has shown that the majority of people have adapted and coped well. The aim of this study was i) to determine the proportion of people with mental stability and volatility during the pandemic in a North West England city region sample and ii) to establish group differences in psychosocial variables. Mental stability and volatility refer to the extent to which individuals reported change in levels of common mental health symptoms over the course of 12 weeks. No change in mental health over the 12 weeks reflected mental stability whilst change in mental health reflected mental volatility. A two-wave-online survey (N = 163) was used to explore the psychological and social impact of the pandemic on relatively disadvantaged neighbourhoods within the region. The data collected represents 12 weeks of individual pandemic experience between mid-June and mid-December 2020. A three-level composite common mental health change variable was created combining self-reported anxiety and depression to group stable, volatile, and very volatile individuals in terms of the changeability of their mental health. Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc tests were used to determine how people with mental stability and volatility differed on factors categorised within an ecological framework of resilience (individual, community, societal, and COVID-19 specific). Individuals categorised as 'stable' in terms of mental health symptoms (63.6%) had better mental and physical health; were more tolerant of uncertainty; and reported higher levels of resilience and wellbeing compared to 'very volatile' people (19.8%). These individuals also reported feeling less socially isolated, experienced a greater sense of belonging to their community which was more likely to fulfil their needs, and were more likely to have access to green space nearby for their recommended daily exercise. 'Stable' individuals did not report worrying any more during the pandemic than usual and tolerated uncertainty better compared to those in the 'volatile' group. The majority of participants in this sample were mentally stable and coping well with the challenges presented by the pandemic. The resilience of these individuals was related to key place-based factors such as a strong sense of community and useable local assets. The data showcase the role of place-based social determinants in supporting resilience and thereby highlight key preventative measures for public mental health during times of international crisis.","Ujhelyi Gomez, Corcoran, Ring, Hassan, Abba, Downing, Goodall, Gabbay, Clarke, Moran, Obe, Bennett","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266153","20220713","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34254,""
"An Integrated Care Platform System (C3-Cloud) for Care Planning, Decision Support, and Empowerment of Patients With Multimorbidity: Protocol for a Technology Trial","There is an increasing need to organize the care around the patient and not the disease, while considering the complex realities of multiple physical and psychosocial conditions, and polypharmacy. Integrated patient-centered care delivery platforms have been developed for both patients and clinicians. These platforms could provide a promising way to achieve a collaborative environment that improves the provision of integrated care for patients via enhanced information and communication technology solutions for semiautomated clinical decision support. The Collaborative Care and Cure Cloud project (C3-Cloud) has developed 2 collaborative computer platforms for patients and members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and deployed these in 3 different European settings. The objective of this study is to pilot test the platforms and evaluate their impact on patients with 2 or more chronic conditions (diabetes mellitus type 2, heart failure, kidney failure, depression), their informal caregivers, health care professionals, and, to some extent, health care systems. This paper describes the protocol for conducting an evaluation of user experience, acceptability, and usefulness of the platforms. For this, 2 ""testing and evaluation"" phases have been defined, involving multiple qualitative methods (focus groups and surveys) and advanced impact modeling (predictive modeling and cost-benefit analysis). Patients and health care professionals were identified and recruited from 3 partnering regions in Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom via electronic health record screening. The technology trial in this 4-year funded project (2016-2020) concluded in April 2020. The pilot technology trial for evaluation phases 3 and 4 was launched in November 2019 and carried out until April 2020. Data collection for these phases is completed with promising results on platform acceptance and socioeconomic impact. We believe that the phased, iterative approach taken is useful as it involves relevant stakeholders at crucial stages in the platform development and allows for a sound user acceptance assessment of the final product. Patients with multiple chronic conditions often experience shortcomings in the care they receive. It is hoped that personalized care plan platforms for patients and collaboration platforms for members of MDTs can help tackle the specific challenges of clinical guideline reconciliation for patients with multimorbidity and improve the management of polypharmacy. The initial evaluative phases have indicated promising results of platform usability. Results of phases 3 and 4 were methodologically useful, yet limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Experiences, impacts and service needs of injured and ill workers in the WSIB process: evidence from Thunder Bay and District (Ontario, Canada)","Individuals experience negative physical, social and psychological ramifications when they are hurt or become ill at work. Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) is intended to mitigate these effects, yet the WSIB process can be difficult. Supports for injured workers can be fragmented and scarce, especially in underserved areas. We describe the experiences and mental health needs of injured and ill Northwestern Ontario workers in the WSIB process, in order to promote system improvements. Community-recruited injured and ill workers (n = 40) from Thunder Bay and District completed an online survey about their mental health, social service and legal system needs while involved with WSIB. Additional Northwestern Ontario injured and ill workers (n = 16) and community service providers experienced with WSIB processes (n = 8) completed interviews addressing similar themes. Northwestern Ontario workers described the impacts of workplace injury and illness on their professional, family, financial and social functioning, and on their physical and mental health. Many also reported incremental negative impacts of the WSIB processes themselves, including regional issues such as ""small town"" privacy concerns and the cost burden of travel required by the WSIB, especially during COVID-19. Workers and service providers suggested streamlining and explicating WSIB processes, increasing WSIB continuity of care, and region-specific actions such as improving access to regional support services through arm's-length navigators. Northwestern Ontario workers experienced negative effects from workplace injuries and illness and the WSIB process itself. Stakeholders can use these findings to improve processes and outcomes for injured and ill workers, with special considerations for the North.

Individuals in Northwestern Ontario who were hurt or became ill at work experienced negative effects on their physical, financial, social and psychological well-being, including some related to or worsened by the WSIB process. This is consistent with research conducted elsewhere in the province. Injured and ill workers in Northwestern Ontario may face additional regional barriers to proper care and recovery, including limited employment opportunities, Ã¢â‚¬Å“small townÃ¢â‚¬Â privacy concerns and the costs and burden of care-related travel, especially during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Suggestions to improve the WSIB process provided by Northwestern Ontario injured workers and service providers included general system improvements (e.g. streamlining and explicating WSIB processes, increasing WSIB continuity of care, designating an armÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s length system navigator), and several suggestions particular to the northern context.

"Lifestyle pattern changes, eating disorders, and sleep quality in diabetes: how are the effects of 18Ã‚Â months of COVID-19 pandemic being felt?","The pandemic resulted in a lifestyle crisis which may negatively affect patients with diabetes. Despite current knowledge, there is a lack of longitudinal studies evaluating this effect. To assess patients' perceptions about changes in lifestyle, and eating and sleeping patterns after 18Ã‚Â months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify if aspects related to the pandemic (social distancing, COVID-19 infection, behavioral changes, and financial difficulties) are predictors of worsening in eating and sleeping parameters. This was a longitudinal study that followed patients with diabetes from April 2020 to July 2021 in Southern Brazil. Individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years, were included. The outcome of this study was the assessment of daily habits during a 18-month period of theÃ‚Â COVID-19 pandemic. Specific questionnaires were applied once participants were included in this study (3Ã‚Â months after the onset of the pandemic) and at the 18-month follow-up, which included the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), the Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), and a specific questionnaire on diet, physical activity, and sleepÃ‚Â pattern. Data were compared within and between groups (type 1 and type 2 diabetes), and multivariable models were used to identify subgroups of worse outcomes. A total of 118 (78.6%) participants remained in the study at follow-up (mean age 54.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.9Ã‚Â years, 41.3% male). In total, 33.9% of participants perceived weight gain during the pandemic, especially those with type 1 diabetes (43.1% vs 25.0% in type 2 diabetes, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04). About one in four participants reported emotional eating and changes in their eating habits for financial reasons. Regarding sleep patterns, more than half the participants reported taking naps during the day, out of which 30.5% of them perceived worse sleep quality, with no difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes groups. There were no within-group differences in MSQ and EAT-26 scores. Among participants with type 2 diabetes, ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â years (OR 27.6, 95%CI 2.2-345.7), diabetes durationÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°15Ã‚Â years (OR 28.9, 95%CI 1.4-597.9), and perceived emotional eating (OR 10.9, 95%CI 1.1-107.5) were associated with worsened food quality. Worse sleep quality during the pandemic was associated with ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â years for both type 2 diabetes (OR 5.6, 95%CI 1.1-31.5) and type 1 diabetes (OR 5.5, 95%CI 1.0-29.9). Follow-up data from a cohort of patients with diabetes indicate that at the end of 18Ã‚Â months of social distancing, some lifestyle aspects worsened and some improved, showing that these patients responded differently to the adversities of this period. The evidence of clinical features associated with worsening in food and sleep quality provides new insights to prioritizing actions in crisis situations.","Erthal, Alessi, Teixeira, Jaeger, de Oliveira, Scherer, de Carvalho, Schaan, Telo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-022-01927-7","20220713","COVID-19 outbreak; Eating behavior; Living habits; Longitudinal study; Mental health; Sleep behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34257,""
"The Use of ECT in the Elderly-Looking Beyond Depression","We reviewed recent evidence on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the geriatric population. This review looked at the literature on depression, for which there is a breadth of data, as well as other conditions that have historically not been as well studied, as well as attempting to provide practical recommendations for ECT practitioners. This review also examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ECT in the elderly. ECT shows robust efficacy across many psychiatric diseases, from depression and bipolar disorder to psychosis and catatonia. It has also shown positive results at improving behavioral symptoms of dementia, as well as improving motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. It is routinely found to be a safe treatment as well, generally with only minimal transient side effects. ECT should not be considered a ""last-resort"" treatment for geriatric patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. It has historical and recent literature supporting its use in many psychiatric disorders and has been shown to be safe with minimal side effects when appropriate considerations are taken for the elderly population.","Chatham, Shafi, Hermida","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01353-0","20220713","Dementia; Depression; ECT; Elderly; Electroconvulsive therapy; Geriatric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34258,""

"Changing Roles of the State School Nurse Consultants: How the Pandemic Has Accentuated Their Value and Visibility","State School Nurse Consultants (SSNCs) played a pivotal role in navigating school health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools faced unprecedented challenges in which many school administrators found themselves having to make strategic decisions on school health for the first time in their careers. The work of SSNCs has been recognized and appreciated in an unprecedented way, as they became key gatekeepers in school health, forming new partnerships with State Departments of Health and Education stakeholders; supporting school nursing practice, school nurses' mental health, and pandemic fatigue; providing resources; and organizing many state-wide virtual trainings. SSNCs were strategic in developing state school health policy and providing funding support, increasing school nurse positions in their states.

"The role of specialist perinatal psychiatrists in modern medicine","The perinatal period, from the beginning of pregnancy to one year after birth, is a time of considerable physiological and emotional change, where women face a significant risk of development or relapse of mental health disorders. Mental health disorders are one of the most common conditions faced in the perinatal period, but often go unrecognised. There are several barriers to accessing and delivering care, such as instances of structural bias, cultural diversity, stigma, lack of resources and the additional challenge brought by the coronavirus pandemic. Perinatal psychiatry is a dynamic and evolving field, which spans gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic background and many other characteristics, to care for people at a vulnerable time in their lives.

"Effect of motor skills development on psychological and social traits of students of mazandaran province during the covid-19 pandemics","Nowadays, the covid 19 pandemics are challenging all students. The present study aimed to investigate whether motor skill development affects students' psychological and social traits during the covid 19 pandemics. The present study's population consisted of all students aged 9-17Ã‚Â years in the three grades of the elementary, middle, and high school in Mazandaran province in the academic year 2020-2021, which corresponded to approximately 534 thousand students. We used a simple random sampling to determine the sample size because Iranian schools were closed. In this study, we selected 15 individuals for each of the experimental and control groups. Due to some students dropping out or leaving the practice, the samples comprised 42 girls and 45 boys in the control group and 41 girls and 43 boys in the experimental group. To collect data, we used the Standard Student Social Skills Questionnaire by Garsham and Elliott (1990), Cooper-Smith Self-Esteem Questionnaire, and Children's Depression Scale Short Form (CDS-A). We conducted the experimental group for 36 sessions, i.e., three months and three sessions per week, and each session lasted 30-45Ã‚Â min, depending on the quarantine conditions on the 19th day. To analyze the data, we used a two-way analysis of variance and the Scheffe post hoc test. The results showed that all groups had lower scores in psychological traits than those in the pretest. However, no significant difference was found between groups (<i>P</i>.Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), and this effect was not significant in social traits (05/0Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>P</i>.).

"Health indicators and poor health dynamics during COVID-19 pandemic","It is expected that the coronavirus pandemic will exacerbate inequality in wellbeing compared to the pre-pandemic situation. However, there are theories (e.g., the Conservation of Resource (COR) theory) that acknowledge situation-specific lower wellbeing for individuals who typically have more resources. The argument is that perception of loss might occur differently across the socioeconomic spectrum such that individuals with higher socioeconomic status perceive that they experience more loss. Therefore, given the pandemic situation, it is possible that indicators of poor wellbeing (e.g., depression) becoming less concentrated among the poor, contrary to expectation. Given the above, we examine income-related inequality in self-assessed health and depressive symptoms in South Africa. This is done using both pre-pandemic data (i.e. National Income Dynamic Study) and data collected during the pandemic (National Income Dynamic Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey). Consistent with expectation, we find that poor self-assessed health is not only disproportionately concentrated amongst the poor, but this concentration has increased compared to the pre-pandemic period. However, contrary to expectation, depressive symptoms have become less concentrated amongst the poor compared to the pre-pandemic period. We note that while there may be an alternative explanation for this change in trend, it may also be due to situation-specific lower wellbeing for individuals who typically have more resources. We argue that this has implication for tracking population health in a crisis.","Oyenubi, Nwosu, Kollamparambil","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03425-z","20220713","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Inequality; South Africa; Wellbeing indicators","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34265,""
"How Did the Psychological Well-Being of Church of England Clergy and Laity Change From the First to the Third National COVID-19 Lockdowns?","The balanced affect model of psychological well-being conceptualises positive and negative affect as two separate continua and well-being as the function of these two entities. The COVID-19 pandemic lasted over two years in the United Kingdom and initially caused widespread declines in mental health and well-being. This paper tests whether such declines continued or stabilised as the pandemic lockdowns persisted. The psychological well-being of a religiously committed sample was assessed by perceived changes in affect balance (a function of negative and positive affect) using The Index of Affect Balance Change (TIBACh) from the first to the third COVID-19 lockdowns in the Church of England. The 2020 sample in the first lockdown comprised 792 stipendiary parochial clergy and 2,815 laity who were not in licensed ministry in the Church of England. A repeat survey in the third lockdown in England in 2021 collected responses from 401 equivalent clergy and 1027 equivalent laity. Both clergy and lay people showed increased proportions reporting lower positive affect and increased proportions reporting higher negative affect in the second survey, suggesting psychological well-being had continued to deteriorate as lockdowns persisted.","Village, Francis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11089-022-01017-z","20220713","Balanced affect; COVID-19 lockdowns; Clergy; Lay people; Psychological well-being; Religion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34266,""
"Next Gen Hawai'i: Collaborative COVID-19 Social Media Initiative to Engage Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, and Filipino Youth","The Next Gen Hawai'i social media project was initiated in the fall of 2020 to address ongoing public health concerns and the need for accessible and reliable information across Hawai'i's diverse communities by strategically amplifying the voices of Hawai'i's youth in their Native languages. The collaborative effort arose from conversations within the Hawai'i's Native Hawaiian &amp; Pacific Islander COVID-19 Response, Recovery, and Resilience Team, composed of diverse public and private organizations involved in statewide COVID-19 response efforts for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities. Next Gen Hawai'i's focus was on Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Filipino, and other populations disproportionately suffering from COVID-19. Five social media platforms were developed to spread messaging to youth and young adults about COVID-19. Public Health Ambassadors (from high school to young adults) were recruited and engaged to create culturally and linguistically rooted messaging to promote public health and prevention-based social norms. This strength-based approach recognized youth as important community leaders and ambassadors for change and empowered them to create content for dissemination on platforms with national and global reach. Messaging was designed to build individual, community, and digital health literacy while integrating core cultural values and strengths of Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino communities. Over 250 messages have been delivered across Next Gen Hawai'i social media channels on topics including vaccine information, mask-wearing, staying together over distances, mental health, and in-languages resources in Chuukese, Chamorro, Marshallese, Samoan, Hawaiian, Ilocano, Tagalog, and other Pacific-basin languages. Reach has included more than 75 000 views from various social media channels, media features, successful webinars, and relevant conference presentations.

"Patient-led integrated cognitive behavioural therapy for management of long COVID with comorbid depression and anxiety in primary care - A case study","Long COVID affects approximately ten-percent of people following post-acute Coronavirus infection. Long COVID is a complex, multisystemic recent illness. Therefore, there are currently no unitary guidelines on its management. The UK national guidelines currently recommended that interventions are guided by objective research evidence and subjective experiences of patients. They also emphasise multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary professional care and patient self-management. The current case study applied patient-led integrated cognitive behavioural therapy in a 36-year-old male presenting with long COVID symptoms with comorbid depression and anxiety. It applied integrated interdisciplinary CBT with emphasis on enhancing patient self-management. The patient attended twelve, individual, 60Ã¢â‚¬â€¦min video sessions, via Microsoft Teams over a period of five months. The treatment was conducted in collaboration with the patient's general practitioner, physiotherapists and cardiopulmonary specialists. In line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, it applied symptom monitoring, graded pacing and behavioural experiments. At the end of therapy, the patient showed reliable change in his somatic symptoms, depression and anxiety symptoms. He also showed improved quality of life. This case illustrates the effective use of patient-led CBT for managing symptoms of long COVID with comorbid depression and anxiety in primary care.","Skilbeck","https://doi.org/10.1177/17423953221113605","20220713","anxiety; cognitive behavioural therapy; depression; long COVID; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34268,""
"Predictors of reported alcohol intake during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada among middle-aged and older adults: results from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)","To examine proportions and predictors of change in alcohol intake and binge drinking during the first 2 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic among middle-aged and older participants in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) COVID-19 Questionnaire Study. A total of 28,559 (67.2% of the potential sample) CLSA participants consented to the study with 24,114 completing the exit survey (fall 2020). Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions to examine predictors of change (increase or decrease) in alcohol intake and binge drinking were performed. Among alcohol users, 26.3% reported a change in alcohol consumption during the first 10 months of the pandemic. Similar percentages increased (13.0%) or decreased (13.3%) consumption. In our mutually adjusted logistic regression model, odds of change in alcohol intake were greater for younger age, higher income, current cannabis smoker, positive screen for depression, anxiety, and loneliness. The magnitude of all associations for decreased intake was less than that of increased intake, and the directions were opposite for male sex and age. Predictors of current binge drinking (27.9% of alcohol users) included male sex, younger age, higher education and income, cannabis use, depression, and anxiety. Factors predictive of potentially worrisome alcohol use (i.e. increased intake, binge drinking) included younger age, sex, greater education and income, living alone, cannabis use, and worse mental health. Some of these factors were also associated with decreased intake, but the magnitudes of associations were smaller. This information may help direct screening efforts and interventions towards individuals at risk for problematic alcohol intake during the pandemic.

RÃƒÂ©SULTATS: Chez les consommateurs dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool, 26,3 % ont dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© un changement de leur consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool au cours des 10 premiers mois de la pandÃƒÂ©mie. Un pourcentage semblable de consommateurs dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool avaient accru (13 %) ou diminuÃƒÂ© (13,3 %) leur consommation. Dans notre modÃƒÂ¨le de rÃƒÂ©gression logistique mutuellement ajustÃƒÂ©, la probabilitÃƒÂ© de changement dans la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool ÃƒÂ©tait plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e chez les rÃƒÂ©pondants plus jeunes, les rÃƒÂ©pondants au revenu ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©, les fumeurs de cannabis actuels et les rÃƒÂ©pondants ayant fait ÃƒÂ©tat de dÃƒÂ©pression, dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ou de solitude. Les associations avec la diminution de la consommation ÃƒÂ©taient moins significatives quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avec lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢augmentation de la consommation, et elles allaient dans le sens opposÃƒÂ© pour ce qui est du sexe masculin et de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢ge. Les prÃƒÂ©dicteurs de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢hyperalcoolisation rapide actuelle (27,9 % des consommateurs dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool) ÃƒÂ©taient le sexe masculin, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢ge plus jeune, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢instruction et le revenu ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s, la consommation de cannabis, la dÃƒÂ©pression et lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©. CONCLUSION: Les facteurs pouvant prÃƒÂ©dire une consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool potentiellement inquiÃƒÂ©tante (c.-ÃƒÂ -d. consommation accrue, hyperalcoolisation rapide) ÃƒÂ©taient lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢ge plus jeune, le sexe, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢instruction et le revenu ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s, le fait de vivre seul, la consommation de cannabis et la moins bonne santÃƒÂ© mentale. Certains de ces facteurs ÃƒÂ©taient aussi associÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ une consommation rÃƒÂ©duite, mais ces associations ÃƒÂ©taient moins significatives. Ces informations pourraient orienter les efforts de dÃƒÂ©pistage et les interventions auprÃƒÂ¨s des personnes Ãƒ risque de consommation problÃƒÂ©matique dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool durant la pandÃƒÂ©mie.","McMillan, Hogan, Zimmer, Sohel, Wolfson, Kirkland, Griffith, Basta, Raina","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-022-00661-5","20220711","Alcohol use; Binge drinking; CLSA; COVID-19; Older adults; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34269,""
"[Inpatient care capacities in child and adolescent psychiatry-increase in emergency admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic?]","The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying containment measures have had aÃ‚Â fundamental impact on the mental health of children and adolescents. In the present study, the emergency admissions of the first two Corona years (2020/21) at the Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hall i.Ã‚Â T./Innsbruck were retrospectively analysed and compared with the two years before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018/19). There was no change in the total number of emergency admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 before Corona, but in 2021 emergency admissions increased by 40.1%. The pre-Corona (2018/19) gender ratio of 65.4% girls to 34.6% boys did not change in 2020. In 2021, the proportion of girls increased to 74.4%. In the COVID-19 pandemic, acute suicidality increased (+48.3%) while aggression decreased (-51.0%). Acute intoxications increased in the first Corona year and decreased again in 2021. The present study results show that the mental health needs of children and adolescents increased significantly in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and that this was also reflected in child and adolescent psychiatry. The increased demands must now be met with appropriate care and prevention measures as well as sufficient child and adolescent psychiatric bed capacities in order to mitigate the longer-term psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as best as possible. Die COVID-19 Pandemie und die damit einhergehenden EindÃƒÂ¤mmungsmaÃƒÅ¸nahmen haben sich auf die psychische Gesundheit der Kinder und Jugendlichen ausgewirkt. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden die Akutaufnahmen der ersten beiden Corona-Jahre (2020/21) an der Abteilung fÃƒÂ¼r Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie Hall i. T./Innsbruck retrospektiv analysiert und mit den zwei Jahren vor der COVID-19 Pandemie (2018/19) verglichen. 2020 gab es keine VerÃƒÂ¤nderung in der Gesamtzahl der Akutaufnahmen im Vergleich zum Vor-Corona-Jahr 2019, im Jahr 2021 stiegen die Akutaufnahmen hingegen um 40,1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%. Das GeschlechterverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 65,4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% MÃƒÂ¤dchen zu 34,6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% Jungen in den Vor-Corona-Jahren blieb im Jahr 2020 unverÃƒÂ¤ndert. 2021 stieg der MÃƒÂ¤dchenanteil auf 74,4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%. In der COVID-19 Pandemie nahm die akute SuizidalitÃƒÂ¤t zu (+48,3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), wohingegen die Fremdaggression abnahm (Ã¢Ë†â€™51,0Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%). Akute Intoxikationen haben im ersten Corona-Jahr zugenommen und dann 2021 wieder abgenommen. Die vorliegenden Studienergebnisse zeigen, dass der Mental-Health-Bedarf bei Kindern und Jugendlichen im Verlauf der COVID-19 Pandemie anstieg und sich dies auch in der Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie deutlich bemerkbar machte. Den gestiegenen Anforderungen muss nun mit entsprechenden Versorgungs- und PrÃƒÂ¤ventionsmaÃƒÅ¸nahmen sowie ausreichenden kinder- und jugendpsychiatrischen BettenkapazitÃƒÂ¤ten begegnet werden, um lÃƒÂ¤ngerfristige psychosoziale Auswirkungen der COVID-19 Pandemie bestmÃƒÂ¶glich abzufedern.","Sevecke, Wenter, Schickl, Kranz, Krstic, Fuchs","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40211-022-00423-2","20220711","COVID-19; Child and adolescent psychiatry; Emergency admissions; Mental health; Suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34270,""
"Comparisons of mental health symptoms, treatment access, and self-harm behaviors in rural adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of adolescents worldwide, and research on the mental health effects are ongoing. Adolescents living in rural areas of the United States were already known to be at a disadvantage in terms of access to mental health services, as well as elevated rates of mental health concerns and self-harm risk. Research on how these factors may have changed since the pandemic began is needed to better understand which areas saw the biggest impact and where we can best direct resources to assist youth. Data from the current study were taken from a project examining adolescent mental health and self-harm risk. The pandemic disrupted the timeline for the study resulting in data being collected in two separate waves: before (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°695) and after (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°206) the pandemic began. Comparisons were made between these two samples on multiple factors including depression, anxiety, emotion dysregulation, alcohol and substance use, experiencing of bullying, overall impairment, mental health services access, and self-harm. Results indicated that adolescents in the pandemic sample were more likely to have seen a counselor and been hospitalized for a mental health reason, and were more likely to have experienced past-year suicide thoughts and plans than adolescents in the pre-pandemic sample. The pandemic sample also showed more depression and anxiety symptoms, greater emotion dysregulation, and greater intensity of recent suicide ideation. Implications for assisting youth through post-pandemic times are discussed.","Brausch, Whitfield, Clapham","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02039-x","20220711","Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Rural; Self-injury; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34271,""
"Personality traits and risk of posttraumatic stress disorder among dental residents during COVID-19 crisis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented mental health challenges among healthcare professionals, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few studies have examined PTSD predictors in dental settings. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the relationship between personality traits and PTSD symptoms among US dental residents engaged in patient care during the pandemic. An online survey was administered to residents in advanced education in general dentistry, dental anesthesia, general practice residency, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and pediatric dentistry programs between September 2020 and April 2021. The survey included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Big Five Inventory, and the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Logistic regression models, analysis of variance, and Tukey tests were used to examine the association between variables and PTSD scores and assess differences in personality traits and PTSD by specialty. Among 149 respondents (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 29.9 Ã‚Â± 4.9 years; 57.0% female), 53.7% reported experiencing stress during the pandemic. Many residents (38.9%) were not aware of available mental health resources. A total of 17.4% of residents met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, but only 1.3% reported a previous PTSD diagnosis. The most significant predictors of PTSD were neuroticism (odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.90, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.046) and stress unrelated to the resident's program role during the pandemic (odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.88, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02). PTSD symptoms were highly prevalent among dental residents, with stress and neuroticism being the most significant predictors.","Metz, Whitehill, Alraqiq","https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.13034","20220712","COVID-19 pandemic; PTSD; dental residency; neuroticism; occupational stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34272,""
"""COVID knocked me straight into the dirt"": perspectives from people experiencing homelessness on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic","People experiencing homelessness are uniquely susceptible and disproportionately affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding context-specific challenges, responses, and perspectives of people experiencing homelessness is essential to improving pandemic response and mitigating the long-term consequences of the pandemic on this vulnerable population. As part of an ongoing community-based participatory research study in partnership with a homeless service organization in Indiana, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 34 individuals experiencing homelessness between January and July 2021. Guided by the NIMHD Health Disparities Research Framework, which builds on the socio-ecological model, data was thematically coded using Nvivo12 qualitative coding software and themes were organized by levels of influence (individual, interpersonal, community, societal) and domains of influence (biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, health care system). Narratives revealed numerous and compounding factors affecting COVID-19 risks and health outcomes among people experiencing homelessness across all levels and domains of influence. At the individual level, people experiencing homelessness face unique challenges that heightened their susceptibility to COVID-19, including pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, substance use and behavioral health risks, socioeconomic precarity, and low health literacy and COVID-related knowledge. At the interpersonal level, poor communication between people experiencing homelessness and service providers led to limited understanding of and poor compliance with COVID safety measures. At the community level, closures and service disruptions restricted access to usual spaces and resources to meet basic needs. At a policy level, people experiencing homelessness were disregarded in ways that made pandemic relief resources largely inaccessible to them. Our findings reveal important and mitigable issues with ongoing pandemic response efforts in homeless populations through direct, first-hand accounts of their experiences during COVID-19. These insights offer opportunities for multilevel interventions to improve outreach, communication, and impact mitigation strategies for people experiencing homelessness. This study highlights the importance of centering the voices of vulnerable communities to inform future pandemic response for homeless and other underserved and marginalized populations.","Rodriguez, Martinez, Ziolkowski, Tolliver, Young, Ruiz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13748-y","20220712","COVID-19; Community-based participatory research; Disaster response; Health disparities; Homelessness; Pandemic response; Socio-ecological model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34273,""
"Of not passing: homelessness, addiction, mental health and care during COVID-19","People experiencing homelessness in the UK were unconditionally offered housing (and support) from the beginning of the first lockdown in March 2020. For many, that meant '(re)entering' the support system and having a chance to 'move on' to longer-term housing. This beneficial effect of some of the policy reactions to the pandemic on people experiencing homelessness was unexpected. On the flip side, however, particularly for people struggling with drug use and mental health issues, adequate support was not available for long periods of time; support was either suspended temporarily or people were excluded from institutional support for not adhering to, for instance, lockdown rules. Similarly, digital support alternatives-modelled on increasingly widespread telemedicine-did often not work specifically for people struggling with complex needs or women experiencing homelessness. This research paper reports detailed evidence of what we observed as continued and catalysed exclusions based on interviews and ethnographic observations with both people experiencing homelessness and service providers from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Referring to our insights and learnings from three locally and temporally overlapping research projects between May 2020 and April 2021, we also propose changes to redesign future (health)care provision to prevent such impasses-which extend beyond lockdown situations to general conditional housing and support.","Lenhard, Margetts, Meng","https://doi.org/10.1136/medhum-2021-012367","20220712","Anthropology; COVID-19; Drug and alcohol misuse; Health policy; Mental health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34274,""
"Voluntary testing for COVID-19: perceptions and utilization among the inhabitants of Saudi Arabia","Voluntary testing (VT) plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The present study investigated the perceptions and utilization of VT services for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the inhabitants of Saudi Arabia. In total, 3,510 adult participants from all provinces of Saudi Arabia were recruited via a national online survey. Of the 3,510 participants, 88.9% were aware of the testing services available to them and of those, more than half (59.5%) had used the VT services and 96.1% were satisfied with the services. Contact with a positive COVID-19 case was the top reason for accessing VT, while a lack of awareness about the availability of VT services was the top perceived limiting factor. A history of chronic health conditions, anxiety and/or depression, and previous symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 were found to be predictors of the utilization of VT services (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.96; OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.88; and OR 3.31, 95% CI 2.77-3.95), respectively. The awareness of voluntary COVID-19 testing services was satisfactory among the Saudi Arabian population, but can be improved.

"Remote Follow-up of Self-isolating COVID-19 Patients with a Patient Portal: Protocol for a Mixed-method Pilot Study (The Opal-COVID Study)","Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 are instructed to self-isolate at home. However, during self-isolation, they may experience anxiety and insufficient care. Patient portals can allow patients to self-monitor and share their health status with healthcare professionals for remote follow-up, but little data is available on the feasibility of their use. This manuscript presents the protocol of the Opal-COVID Study which has four objectives: 1) assess the implementation of using the Opal patient portal for distance monitoring of COVID-19 patients self-isolating at home; 2) identify influences on the intervention's implementation; and describe 3) service and 4) patient outcomes of this intervention. This mixed-method pilot study aims to recruit 50 COVID-19 patient participants tested at the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Canada) for 14 days of remote follow-up. With access through a smartphone app to an existing patient portal configured for this study, patients will complete a daily self-assessment of symptoms, vital signs, and mental health, monitored by a nurse, and receive teleconsultations, as needed. Study questionnaires will be administered to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical background, implementation outcomes (acceptability, usability, and respondent burden) and patient satisfaction. Coordinator logbook entries will inform on feasibility outcomes, namely, recruitment/retention rates and fidelity, as well as on the frequency and nature of contacts with healthcare professionals via Opal. The statistical analyses for Objectives 1 (implementation outcomes), 3 (service outcomes), and 4 (patient outcomes) will evaluate the effects of time and sociodemographic characteristics on the outcomes. For Objectives 1 (implementation outcomes) and 4 (patient outcomes), the statistical analyses will also examine the attainment of predefined success thresholds. As to the qualitative analyses, for Objective 2 (influences on implementation), semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with four groups of stakeholders (i.e., patient participants, healthcare professionals, technology developers and study administrators) and submitted to content analysis, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to help identify barriers and facilitators of implementation. For Objective 3 (service outcomes), reasons for contacting healthcare professionals through Opal will also be submitted to content analysis. Between December 2020 and March 2021, 51 patient-participants were recruited. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 39 involved stakeholders, from April to September 2021. Delays were experienced due to measures taken at the MUHC to address COVID-19. The quantitative and qualitative analyses began in May 2022. As of June 2022, two manuscripts (respectively on the implementation and the patient outcomes) were being prepared and three conference presentations had been given on the study's methods. This protocol is designed to generate multidisciplinary knowledge on the implementation of a patient portal-based COVID-19 care intervention and will lead to a comprehensive understanding of feasibility, stakeholder experience, and influences on implementation that may prove useful for scaling up similar interventions.

"Long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy in a face-to-face versus videoconferencing setting: A single case study","Due to the coronavirus pandemic and crisis, psychotherapists around the world were forced to switch to video- or tele-based treatments overnight. To date, only a few studies on the effectiveness of video-based psychodynamic psychotherapy via the Internet exist. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to examine symptom improvement, therapeutic relationship, nonverbal synchrony processes,Ã‚Â and intersession processes within a systematic single case design and compare face-to-face to video-based approaches in long-term psychodynamic-oriented psychotherapy. We examined 85 sessions of a client with major depression whose psychodynamic psychotherapy changed from a face-to-face setting to a video-based setting. Video recordings were analyzed using motion energy analysis, and nonverbal synchrony was computed using a surrogate synchrony approach. Time series analyses were performed to analyze changes in symptom severity, therapeutic relationship, and intersession processes. The results showed that symptom severity improved descriptively, but not significantly, across the entire course of psychotherapy. There were significant differences, however, in the therapeutic relationship, intersession experiences, and synchronous behavior between the face-to-face and video-based settings. The results indicate that the presented methodology is well situated to investigate the question whether psychodynamic psychotherapy in video-based setting works in the sameway as in a face-to-face setting.","Andreas, Gablonski, Tschacher, Gebhardt, Rabung, Schulz, Kadur","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23411","20220712","alliance; nonverbal dynchrony; process-outcome research; psychodynamic therapy; videoconferencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34278,""
"Global prevalence of stigmatization and violence against healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","During COVID-19, stigmatization and violence against and between professional healthcare workers worldwide are increasing. Understanding the prevalence of such stigmatization and violence is needed for gaining a complete picture of this issue. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to update estimates of the prevalence of stigmatization and violence against healthcare workers during the pandemic. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. This review followed PRISMA guidelines and encompassed these databases: PubMed, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Web of Science, MEDLINE Complete, OVID (UpToDate), and Embase (from databases inception to September 15, 2021). We included observational studies and evaluated the quality of the study using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Further, a random effects model was used to synthesis the pooled prevalence of stigmatization and violence in this study. We identified 14 studies involving 3452 doctors, 5738 nurses, and 2744 allied health workers that reported stigmatization and violence during the pandemic. The pooled prevalence was, for stigmatization, 43% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21% to 65%) and, for violence, 42% (95% CI: 30% to 54%). Stigmatization and violence during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to have affected almost half the studied healthcare workers. Healthcare professionals are more prone to be stigmatized by the community and to face workplace violence. Health administrators and policymakers should anticipate and promptly address stigmatization and violence against and between healthcare workers, while controlling the spread of COVID-19. Health care systems should give serious attention to the mental health of all health providers.","Saragih, Tarihoran, Rasool, Saragih, Tzeng, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12794","20220712","COVID-19; healthcare workers; meta-analyses; stigmatization; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34279,""

"The early impacts of COVID-19 on unpaid carers of people living with dementia: part II of a mixed-methods systematic review","With a lack of existing comprehensive reviews, the aim of this mixed-method systematic review was to synthesise the evidence on the early impacts of the pandemic on unpaid dementia carers across the globe. This review was registered on PROSPERO [CDR42021248050]. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from 2020 to July 2021. Studies were included if they reported on the different impacts of the pandemic on unpaid dementia carers aged 18+, with papers published in English, German, Polish, or Spanish. A number of research team members were involved in the selection of studies following PRISMA guidance. Thirty-six studies (43 papers) from 18 countries reported on the early impact of the pandemic on unpaid dementia carers. Impacts were noted on accessing care and support; carer burden; and well-being. Studies found that carers had limited access to care and support services, increased workload, enhanced feelings of social isolation, and reduced wellbeing. Specifically, reductions in access to care and support increased carer's unpaid caring tasks, removing any opportunities for temporary respite, and thus further increasing carer burden and reducing mental well-being in many. The needs of unpaid dementia carers appear to have increased during the pandemic, without adequate support provided. Policy initiatives need to enable better mental health support and formal care provision for unpaid carers and their relatives with dementia, whilst future research needs to explore the long-term implications of carer needs in light of care home restrictions and care delivery.","Giebel, Talbot, Wharton, Lorenz-Dant, SuÃƒÂ¡rez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Cannon, Tetlow, Lion, Thyrian","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2084510","20220712","COVID-19; Dementia; carer burden; carers; mental health; social care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34281,""

The persistent symptoms of post COVID-19 conditions were classified into three categories as follows: Category A (the prevalence of symptoms is higher in the acute-visit group than in the post-acute-visit group), Category B (the prevalence of symptoms is not different between the two groups) and Category C (the prevalence of symptoms is higher in the post-acute-visit group than in the acute-visit group). Category A mainly included respiratory symptoms. Category B had generalized weakness, weight loss, cardiologic symptoms, hypogeusia, hyposmia, anxiety, and various gastrointestinal symptoms. Category C included fatigue, decreased attention, depression, blurred vision, hair loss, and sexual dysfunction. Anxiety, depression, fatigue and age were also associated with the number of symptoms and their categories, and anxiety is the most correlated factor (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) among them. The persistent symptoms of post COVID-19 condition involve multi-organ and continue for four weeks or greater. Therefore, long-term observation and multidisciplinary interventions are essential for patients with post COVID-19 conditions.","Jung, Ha, Choe, Lee, Jo, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e213","20220713","COVID-19; Omicron Variant; Post COVID-19 Conditions; Ageusia; Anxiety; COVID-19; Fatigue; Humans; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34282,""
"Paternal Postnatal Depression During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Health Care Providers","The fast spread of COVID-19 can cause some psychological disorders for men. One of the psychological disorders is paternal postpartum depression (PPD). The aim of the present research was to review studies that have investigated paternal postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this narrative review, databases such as Google Scholar, Scientific Information Databases (SID), Magiran, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for the full texts of published studies in the Persian and English languages in the period of 2019 to 2021. Finally, 3 articles were selected and reviewed in this study. The results of this review study were classified into 3 main categories such as (1) The psychological status of men during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) The effect of paternal PPD on children's development and family psychological status during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) The role of healthcare providers in the management of paternal PPD. The findings of the studies showed that paternal PPD increases the rate of child maltreatment, maternal depression, and domestic violence. The promotion of the interpersonal skills of healthcare providers with fathers suffering from depression or psychological problems is the determinant factor of successful results. The results showed that paternal PPD has a wide range of consequences in this pandemic. Therefore, it would be recommended that healthcare staff have close contact with families and screen fathers for paternal PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yazdanpanahi, Vizheh, Azizi, Hajifoghaha","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319221110421","20220713","COVID-19; paternal; postnatal depression; postpartum depression; COVID-19; Child; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Fathers; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Postpartum Period; Risk Factors; Tuberculin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34283,""
"Melting COVID-frozen goals: How goal disengagement supports well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current research addresses dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic's disruption to goal pursuit. Specifically, we examined the effects of disengaging from frozen goals (goals for which progress had been disrupted due to COVID-19). In May 2021, we asked participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°226) what percentage of their goals were COVID-frozen goals and asked them to report their engagement in one such goal (vs. an active goal): the degree to which they think about the goal, ruminate about the goal, and are committed to the goal. Participants also reported on two facets of their recent well-being: psychological distress (stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety) and life satisfaction. As expected, percentage of COVID-frozen goals was positively associated with psychological distress (stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety). Moreover, frozen goal rumination (but not thought frequency or commitment) was negatively associated with life satisfaction and positively associated with psychological distress (stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety; even when controlling for active goal rumination). Furthermore, individual differences in the capacity to disengage and reengage in alternatives were negatively associated with frozen goal rumination, positively associated with life satisfaction, and negatively associated with psychological distress (stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety). These results highlight the adaptive function of disengagement in goal pursuit. We discuss implications for the goal disengagement literature and for coping with COVID-19.

"Association of alcohol use and dietary lifestyle of commercial drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria","Alcohol intake, particularly to cope up with stress and depression experienced by commercial drivers during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, is alarming as a rise in sales has been reported in certain countries during the quarantine. Alcoholism leads to malnutrition, either because those involved consume an insufficient amount of essential nutrients or because alcohol and its metabolism prevent the body from properly absorbing, digesting, and using those nutrients. This study was carried out to assess the association of alcohol use and dietary lifestyle of commercial motor drivers during the pandemic. The anthropometric studies revealed that 69.5% of the respondents fall within the range of 18.5-24.49 indicating that they have normal weights. 63.5% reported daily consumption of alcohol, and 51% claimed that it does not affect their appetite, while 64.5% of the respondent stated that alcohol does not present them with any health problems. There was no significant association between the consumption of alcohol and nutritional status (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), but a significant association between dietary lifestyle patterns and the nutritional status of participants was recorded (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). It is, therefore, essential that commercial drivers are given adequate information and guidance on improving their dietaryÃ‚Â lifestyle.","Edo, Nwosu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-022-00885-y","20220712","Alcohol intake; Commercial motor drivers; Dietary pattern; Nigeria; Nutritional status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34285,""

"Behavior Change Around an Online Health Awareness Campaign: A Causal Impact Study","National Eating Disorders Association conducts a NEDAwareness week every year, during which it publishes content on social media and news aimed to raise awareness of eating disorders. Measuring the impact of these actions is vital for maximizing the effectiveness of such interventions. This study is an effort to empirically measure the change in behavior of users who engage with NEDAwareness content, and compare the detected changes between campaigns in two different years. We analyze a total of 35,895 tweets generated during two campaigns of NEDAwareness campaigns in 2019 and 2020. In order to assess the reach of each campaign, we consider the users participating in the campaigns and their number of followers, as well as retweeting engagement. We use the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text modeling and causal impact analysis in order to gauge the change in self-expression of users who have interacted with the NEDAwareness content, compared to a baseline group of users. We further enrich our understanding of the users by extracting gender information from their display names. We find that, despite large media corporations (such as MTV and Teen Vogue) participating in the campaign, it is governmental and nonprofit accounts who are among the accounts that attract the most retweets. Whereas the most influential accounts were well-connected in 2019, the 2020 campaign saw little retweeting between such accounts, negatively impacting the reach of the material. Both campaigns engaged women at around 40% and men 17%, supporting previous research showing women to be more likely to share their experiences with eating disorders. Further, women were more likely to mention other health topics within the 15 days of the intervention, including pregnancy and abortion, as well as depression and anxiety, and to discuss the developing COVID pandemic in 2020. Despite the positive message of the campaign, we find that the users who have engaged with this content were more likely to mention the linguistic categories concerning anxiety and risk. Thus, we illustrate the complex, gender-specific effects of NEDAwareness online health intervention campaign on the continued self-expression of its audience and provide actionable insights for potential improvement of such public health efforts.","Suarez-Lledo, Mejova","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.857531","20220712","Twitter; eating disorders; health informatics; health interventions; mental health; social media; Adolescent; COVID-19; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Public Health; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34287,""
"Interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID: a systematic review of registered trials","Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a substantial proportion are experiencing ongoing symptoms for months after infection, known as 'long COVID'. Long COVID is associated with a wide range of physical and neuropsychological symptoms, including impacts on mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing. However, intervention research is only beginning to emerge. This systematic review synthesizes currently registered trials examining interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in patients with long COVID. Standard systematic review guidelines were followed. Trials registered in two large trial registries in 2020 to May 2022 were reviewed. Included studies were narratively synthesized by type of intervention and a risk-of-bias assessment was conducted. Forty-two registered trials were included, with a total target sample size of 5814 participants. These include 11 psychological interventions, five pharmacological and other medical interventions, and five evaluating herbal, nutritional, or natural supplement interventions. An additional nine trials are examining cognitive and neurorehabilitation interventions and 12 are examining physiotherapy or physical rehabilitation. Most trials are randomized, but many are feasibility trials; trials are evaluating a wide spectrum of outcomes. While there is a newly emerging body of research testing interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID, the breadth and scope of the research remains limited. It is urgently incumbent on researchers to expand upon the intervention research currently under way, in order to generate high-quality evidence on a wide range of candidate interventions for diverse long COVID patient populations.","Hawke, Nguyen, Ski, Thompson, Ma, Castle","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002203","20220712","COVID-19; mental health; psychosocial interventions; systematic review protocol; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-14","",34288,""
