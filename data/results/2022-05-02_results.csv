"Healthcare workers' mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Longitudinal analysis of interview and social media data","The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the fractures of healthcare systems around the world, particularly in relation to the healthcare workforce. Frontline staff, in particular, have been exposed to unprecedented strain and delivering care during the pandemic has impacted their safety, mental health and wellbeing. The aim of this paper was to explore the experiences of HCWs delivering care in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand their wellbeing needs, experiences and strategies used to maintain wellbeing (at individual and organizational levels). We analysed 94 telephone interviews with HCWs and 2000 tweets about HCWs mental health taking place during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results were grouped under six themes: redeployment; wellbeing support and coping strategies; mental health effects; organisational support; social network and public support. These findings demonstrate a need for open conversations, where staff's wellbeing needs and strategies can be shared and encouraged, rather than implementing solely top-down psychological interventions. At the macro level, findings also highlighted the impact on HCWs' wellbeing of public and government support, as well as the need for ensuring protection through PPE, testing, and/or vaccines for frontline workers.","Norha Vera San Juan; Sam Martin; Anna Badley; Laura Maio; Petra Gronholm; Caroline Buck; Elaine Flores; Samantha Vanderslott; Aron Syversen; Sophie Mulcahy Symmons; Inayah Uddin; Amelia Karia; Cecilia vindrola Padros","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.29.22274481","20220501","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-02","",30811,""
"Self-reported mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with alcohol and cannabis use: a latent class analysis","Mental health problems and substance use co-morbidities during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are a public health priority. Identifying individuals at high-risk of developing mental health problems and potential sequela can inform mitigating strategies. We aimed to identify distinct groups of individuals (i.e., latent classes) based on patterns of self-reported mental health symptoms and investigate their associations with alcohol and cannabis use. We used data from six successive waves of a web-based cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years and older living in Canada (6,021 participants). We applied latent class analysis to three domains of self-reported mental health most likely linked to effects of the pandemic: anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Logistic regression was used to characterize latent class membership, estimate the association of class membership with alcohol and cannabis use, and perform sex-based analyses. We identified two distinct classes: (1) individuals with low scores on all three mental health indicators (no/low-symptoms) and (2) those reporting high scores across the three measures (high-symptoms). Between 73.9 and 77.1% of participants were in the no/low-symptoms class and 22.9-26.1% of participants were in the high-symptom class. We consistently found across all six waves that individuals at greater risk of being in the high-symptom class were more likely to report worrying about getting COVID-19 with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) between 1.72 (95%CI:1.17-2.51) and 3.51 (95%CI:2.20-5.60). Those aged 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°were less likely to be in this group with aORs (95%CI) between 0.26 (0.15-0.44) and 0.48 (0.29-0.77) across waves. We also found some factors associated with class membership varied at different time points. Individuals in the high-symptom class were more likely to use cannabis at least once a week (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.28, 95%CI:1.92-2.70), drink alcohol heavily (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.71, 95%CI:1.49-1.96); and increase the use of cannabis (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.50, 95%CI:2.80-4.37) and alcohol (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.37, 95%CI:2.06-2.74) during the pandemic. Women in the high-symptom class had lower odds of drinking more alcohol during the pandemic than men. We identified the determinants of experiencing high anxiety, depression, and loneliness symptoms and found a significant association with alcohol and cannabis consumption. This suggests that initiatives and supports are needed to address mental health and substance use multi-morbidities.","SomÃƒÂ©, Wells, Felsky, Hamilton, Ali, Elton-Marshall, Rehm","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03917-z","20220430","Alcohol; COVID-19; Latent class analysis; Mental health; cannabis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-02","",30812,""
"Predictors of hospitalisation and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Finland: A population-based register study with implications to vaccinations","The aim of this study was to investigate how age and underlying medical conditions affect the risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they should be weighed while prioritising vaccinations against COVID-19. This population-based register study includes all SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test-positive cases until 24 Feb 2021, based on the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The cases were linked to other registers to identify presence of predisposing factors and severe outcomes (hospitalisation, intensive care treatment, death). The odds of severe outcomes were compared in those with and without the pre-specified predisposing factors using logistic regression. Furthermore, population-based rates were compared between those with a given predisposing factor and those without any of the specified predisposing factors using negative binomial regression. Age and various comorbidities were found to be predictors of severe COVID-19. Compared to 60-69-year-olds, the odds ratio (OR) of death was 7.1 for 70-79-year-olds, 26.7 for 80-89-year-olds, and 55.8 forÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 90-year-olds. Among the 20-69-year-olds, chronic renal disease (OR 9.4), malignant neoplasms (5.8), hematologic malignancy (5.6), chronic pulmonary disease (5.4), and cerebral palsy or other paralytic syndromes (4.6) were strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality; severe disorders of the immune system (8.0), organ or stem cell transplant (7.2), chronic renal disease (6.7), and diseases of myoneural junction and muscle (5.5) were strongly associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation. Type 2 diabetes and asthma, two very common comorbidities, were associated with all three outcomes, with ORs from 2.1 to 4.3. The population-based rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased with age. Taking the 60-69-year-olds as reference, the rate ratio was highest (3.0) for 20-29-year-olds andÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 1 for 70-79-year-olds and 80-89-year-olds. Comorbidities predispose for severe COVID-19 among younger ages. In vaccine prioritisation both the risk of infection and the risk of severe outcomes, if infected, should be considered.","Salo, Lehtonen, Auranen, Baum, Leino","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.04.055","20220430","COVID-19; Chronically ill (max 6); Elderly; Risk factors; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-02","",30813,""
