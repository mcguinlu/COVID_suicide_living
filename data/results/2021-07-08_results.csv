"Predictors of black fungus fear during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Bangladeshi health workers: a cross-sectional study","Background: Raised of mucormycosis or black fungus cases middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear associated with black fungus may turn out to be a terrifying public health issue. This study aimed to assess the association between the fear and knowledge of black fungus and other determinants among healthcare workers in Bangladesh. Methods: From 25th May 2021 to 5th June 2021, a cross-sectional study was carried out among healthcare workers. For data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, a semi-structured online questionnaire was used followed by convenient and snowball sampling methods. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to assess the association between the fear and knowledge of black fungus and other determinants. Results: A total of 422 healthcare workers participated in this study. The results indicated that with the increased knowledge score of black fungus, the average score of black fungus fear was significantly increased ({beta} = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.50, p <0.001). Alongside, the respondents having insomnia had a higher score of black fungus fear compare to not having insomnia ({beta} = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.49, 5.33, p <0.001) significantly. The gender, profession, and death due to COVID-19 of friends and family members had a significant effect on black fungus fear score increment. Conclusion: Even in the COVID-19 pandemic, the black fungus fear among healthcare workers may hinder their quality of life. Our study findings recommend an emphasis on the mental health aspects and ensure support to the healthcare workers so that they can tackle the ongoing situation with lesser frictions.

"How district nurses can support team wellbeing during the pandemic and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid adaptation of the community nursing service, including the introduction of online communication platforms to prevent COVID-19 transmission among staff. Remote working has protected the workforce in the community from being decimated through team sickness, but has resulted in nurses who are feeling anxious and isolated from their colleagues while experiencing increased workloads, with complex and often emotionally challenging situations. The pressures of community nursing and the associated impact on sickness absence relating to mental health are well documented. The resources made available to support staff wellbeing were increased during the pandemic, but there remains some disparity of access to these resources. There is much that can be done by the district nurse as a leader of a team to ensure that the pressures are managed in a way that promotes team cohesion and mutual respect, while ensuring that open communication about wellbeing is encouraged.","Merchant","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjcn.2021.26.7.318","20210707","Community nursing; District nurse; Open communication; Remote working; Team wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15755,""
"Depression, Anxiety, and Mother-Infant Bonding in Women Seeking Treatment for Postpartum Depression Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> The conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect maternal mental health and the mother-infant relationship. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression, anxiety, and mother-infant bonding among women seeking treatment for postpartum depression (PPD). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Baseline data collected in two separate randomized controlled trials of a psychoeducational intervention for PPD in the same geographic region, one prior to COVID-19 (March 2019-March 2020) and one during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-October 2020), were compared. Eligible participants had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10, were Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18 years of age, had an infant &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12 months old, and were fluent in English. Outcomes included PPD (EPDS), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]), and mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire [PBQ]). All were measured continuously and dichotomized at accepted clinical cutoffs. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 603 participants (305 pre-COVID-19; 298 during COVID-19), mothers enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic reported higher levels of symptoms of PPD (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.35; 95% CI, 0.64 to 2.06; Cohen <i>d</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31) and anxiety (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.52; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.32; Cohen <i>d</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.30). During COVID-19, women had 65% higher odds of clinically significant levels of depression symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.65; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.31) and 46% higher odds of clinically relevant anxiety symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.46; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in mother-infant bonding. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The findings of this study suggest that rates and severity of PPD and anxiety symptoms among women seeking treatment for PPD have worsened in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, treatment-seeking mothers have consistently maintained good relationships with their infants. Considering the difficulties women with PPD face when accessing treatment, it is important that strategies are developed and disseminated to safely identify and manage PPD to mitigate potential long-term adverse consequences for mothers and their families. <b><i>Trial Registration:</i></b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03654261 and NCT04485000.","Layton, Owais, Savoy, Van Lieshout","https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.21m13874","20210707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15756,""
"The correlation between mental health status, sleep quality, and inflammatory markers, virus negative conversion time among patients confirmed with 2019-nCoV during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: An observational study","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread to the whole world. Psychological and sleep problems among confirmed patients have drawn extensive attention which may be highly related to immune function and inflammatory responses of people. The aim of this study is to examine the correlation of mental health status, sleep quality, and inflammatory markers, virus negative conversion time (NCT) among confirmed patients during the COVID-19 outbreak.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in this study. Data from 66 patients assessed with demographic information, anxious symptom, depressive symptom, stress, and sleep quality were collected using a smartphone-based questionnaire platform and then clinical characteristics and laboratory indicators were collected using case review.Nearly 30% of the participants reported depression, anxiety, perceived pressure, and poor sleep quality. Compared with the group without depression, neutrophil count, and ratio of neutrophil count to lymphocyte count (NLR) in the depression disorder group were increased (PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .028, 0.043). There was also a significant difference in NLR and NCT between the anxiety group and the non-anxiety group (PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .021, .024). Similarly, compared with the good sleep quality group, NLR in the poor sleep quality group was increased (PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .011). Correlation analysis indicated that Self-Rating Depression Scale score was positively related to neutrophil count and NLR (rÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.366, 0.330, PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .016, .031). The total score of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was negatively related to lymphocyte count (rÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å -0.317, PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .049), and the sleep disturbance as 1 of the 7 dimensions of PSQI scale was positively correlated with NCT and NLR (rÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.370, 0.340, PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .020, .034).In our study, confirmed patients were prone to have psychological and sleep problems. The level of inflammation in patients with psychological and sleep problems was higher than that in patients without corresponding problems. The inflammatory level increased with the increase of Self-Rating Depression Scale score, and the lymphocyte count decreased with the increase of the PSQI score. NCT was prolonged in the anxiety group and sleep disturbance was positively correlated with NCT.","Li, Cai, Jia, Zhou, Liu, Zhou, Zhang, Ren, Tang","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000026520","20210707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15757,""
"Physical Activity Levels and Mental Health Burden of Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Lockdown","The outbreak of COVID-19 has precipitated international lockdown measures to curb disease transmissions. The closure of public activity spaces as well as changes in pandemic workload may disrupt healthcare workers' physical activity and self-care routines. We sought to examine the association between physical activity levels and mental health burden of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 lockdown in Singapore. This cross-sectional study comprised of an multidomain survey that was administered digitally to 707 healthcare workers between May 17 and June 18 2020. Exercise frequency, duration and intensity of these healthcare workers had reduced significantly during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown. 25.3%, 37.2%, and 11.9% had screened positive for moderate-to-extremely-severe depression, anxiety and stress respectively. Reductions in exercise duration was a significant risk factor for mild stress and moderate-to-severe depression while increase in exercise frequency was found to be a protective factor against depressed mood. Our study revealed that a short-term reduction in physical activity levels during lockdown was associated with poorer psychological outcomes. Given the protection that exercise confers on depression, physical activity should be promoted at the workplace and at home to support healthcare workers to cope through this protracted health crisis.

"Working online due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a research and literature review","Given the contemporary situation of many analysts in the world now being forced to work online due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to review the working online issue. Substantial debate over previous years has questioned whether a genuine analytic process can unfold through online work. This debate is reviewed with the conclusion that such a process is not necessarily precluded. Research outcomes are then reviewed to highlight those things that can facilitate positive outcomes when working online. These cover the 'online disinhibition effect', the therapeutic alliance, particular ways of using the screen, focussing on trauma, the importance of self-awareness, knowing the predictors of mental health, certain potential positives of isolation/quarantine and psychotherapy interventions that may be currently needed. Final recommendations and suggestions are then presented as in the diagnosis issue, professional development and guidelines to do with practical and ethical considerations. Etant donnÃƒÂ©e la situation actuelle dans laquelle beaucoup dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢analystes dans le monde sont maintenant obligÃƒÂ©s de travailler en ligne du fait des effets de la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID-19, il est important de revisiter le sujet du travail en ligne. Dans les derniÃƒÂ¨res annÃƒÂ©es, il y a eu un dÃƒÂ©bat important sur la question de savoir si un authentique travail analytique pouvait se dÃƒÂ©ployer dans le cadre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un travail en ligne. Ce dÃƒÂ©bat est revisitÃƒÂ© ici avec la conclusion quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un tel processus nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est pas nÃƒÂ©cessairement rendu impossible. Les rÃƒÂ©sultats de recherches sont alors ÃƒÂ©tudiÃƒÂ©s afin de souligner les ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©ments qui peuvent faciliter des effets positifs quand on travaille en ligne. Cela recouvre Ã¢â‚¬ËœlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢effet de dÃƒÂ©sinhibition du travail en ligneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alliance thÃƒÂ©rapeutique, les maniÃƒÂ¨res particuliÃƒÂ¨res dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢utiliser lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©cran, se concentrer sur le traumatisme, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢importance de la conscience de soi, la connaissance des indicateurs de santÃƒÂ© mentale, certains aspects potentiellement positifs de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢isolation/la quarantaine et les interventions psychothÃƒÂ©rapeutiques qui peuvent alors ÃƒÂªtre avisÃƒÂ©es. Des recommandations et des suggestions sont enfin prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©es au sujet du diagnostic, de la formation continue et des consignes sur les considÃƒÂ©rations pratiques et ÃƒÂ©thiques. Angesichts der gegenwÃƒÂ¤rtigen Situation vieler Analytiker auf der Welt, die aufgrund der Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie gezwungen sind, online zu arbeiten, ist es wichtig, das Problem der Online-Arbeit zu untersuchen. Eine eingehende Debatte in den vergangenen Jahren hat in Frage gestellt, ob sich ein echter analytischer ProzeÃƒÅ¸ innerhalb einer Online-Arbeit entfalten kann. Diese Debatte wird mit der SchluÃƒÅ¸folgerung ÃƒÂ¼berprÃƒÂ¼ft, daÃƒÅ¸ ein solcher ProzeÃƒÅ¸ nicht unbedingt ausgeschlossen ist. Dazu werden Forschungsergebnisse betrachtet um diejenigen Dinge hervorzuheben, die positive Ergebnisse bei der Online-Arbeit ermÃƒÂ¶glichen kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Diese umfassen den 'Online-Enthemmungseffekt', die therapeutische Allianz, bestimmte Arten der Verwendung des Bildschirms, die Konzentration auf Traumata, die Bedeutung des SelbstbewuÃƒÅ¸tseins, die Kenntnis der PrÃƒÂ¤diktoren fÃƒÂ¼r psychische Gesundheit, bestimmte potentiell positive Aspekte von Isolation/QuarantÃƒÂ¤ne und psychotherapeutischen Interventionen, die mÃƒÂ¶glicherweise aktuell benÃƒÂ¶tigt werden. AbschlieÃƒÅ¸end werden dann Empfehlungen und VorschlÃƒÂ¤ge gegeben bezÃƒÂ¼glich der Diagnosefrage, der beruflichen Entwicklung und der Richtlinien im Zusammenhang mit praktischen und ethischen ÃƒÅ“berlegungen. A causa della situazione attuale in cui molti analisti nel mondo sono forzati a lavorare online per gli effetti della pandemia da COVID-19, ÃƒÂ¨ importante rivedere il tema del lavorare online. Il dibatto negli ultimi anni si ÃƒÂ¨ sostanzialmente incentrato sul se un processo analitico genuino possa realizzarsi attraverso il lavoro online. Questo dibattito viene rivisto con la conclusione che un tale processo non ÃƒÂ¨ necessariamente precluso. I risultati delle ricerche vengono rivisti per evidenziare quegli elementi che possono facilitare risultati positivi nel lavorare online. Questi comprendono gli ""effetti di disinibizione online"", l'alleanza terapeutica, modi particolari di utilizzare lo schermo, il focalizzarsi sul trauma, l'importanza della consapevolezza di sÃƒÂ©, la conoscenza dei fattori predittivi della salute mentale, un certo potenziale positivo dell'isolamento/quarantena e gli interventi psicoterapeutici che possono essere necessari. Infine vengono presentati raccomandazioni e suggerimenti riguardo al tema della diagnosi, l'aggiornamento professionale e le linee guida per affrontare questioni pratiche ed etiche.

"Influenza vaccination coverage in elderly and high-risk adults: characterization of associated factors","To evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with non-vaccination against influenza in the risk group. A cross-sectional, population-based study, carried out in the city of Rio Grande (RS). The outcome was defined as belonging to risk groups and not having been vaccinated in the last 12 months. Demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral variables, and access for health services were analyzed. In this study, 680 individuals participated. The prevalence was 46.0% (95%CI: 41.8-50.3), ranging from 27.9% (elderly) to 81.8% (pregnant women). Young adults, single, intermediate socioeconomic bracket, smoker, with depressive symptoms, who did not perform physical activity and did not consult a physician in the last year, had a higher prevalence of non-vaccination. Half of the sample was not vaccinated in the period. Due to the similarity of influenza-like illness and the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), increasing vaccination would minimize mortality and use of hospital beds due to influenza, optimizing the response of hospital capacity.","Meneghini, Hood, Menezes, Mendoza-Sassi, Dumith","https://doi.org/10.31744/einstein_journal/2021AO5830","20210707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15760,""
"Factors associated with social isolation and loneliness in community-dwelling older adults during pandemic times: a cross-sectional study","Psychosocial aspects need to be discussed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, no studies have investigated the factors associated with social isolation and loneliness among community-dwelling older adults. Therefore, this study analyzed the association of social isolation and loneliness with socioeconomic, clinical, and health characteristics, and Covid-19-related variables, among community-dwelling older adults during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted via a telephone survey of community-dwelling older adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years in Macapa, Amapa, Brazil. A structured form was used to collect data. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using Pearson's correlation test and a linear regression model. Participants comprised 86 community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of 71.78+6.98 years. Among them, 9.3% were diagnosed with Covid-19, of whom 3.5% were hospitalized. Most participants reported no difficulty obtaining food, medicines, or attending routine medical appointments during the pandemic. Furthermore, 23.3% (n=20) were socially isolated, and 20.9% (n=18) reported feelings of loneliness. The mean values for fear, anxiety, and obsession were 19.01Ã‚Â±7.25, 1.01Ã‚Â±1.90, and 2.84Ã‚Â±3.28, respectively. A moderate positive correlation was identified between loneliness and the number of diseases, and a weak positive correlation between loneliness and the number of medications and depressive symptoms and risk for sarcopenia. The linear regression model indicated that higher loneliness scores were associated with a greater number of diseases (ÃŽÂ²=0.288; p=0.007). The findings suggest a probable resilience of the older population to Covid-19, despite the association of loneliness with many diseases in times of a pandemic.","Pegorari, Silva, AraÃƒÂºjo, Silva, Ohara, Matos, Matos, Pinto","https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0195-2020","20210707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15761,""
"Mental health and internet use by university students: coping strategies in the context of COVID-19","The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) among university students and analyze the relation between disorders and internet use and the use of coping strategies in the face of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional study using a non-probability sample of 275 students. Data was collected online using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire, Problematic Internet Use Scale and a coping strategies inventory. We conducted a descriptive and inferential analysis of the data and multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables that best explained the variation in the problematic internet use. Prevalence of CMD was 58.5% and the presence of CMD was positively correlated with frequency of internet use and the use of avoidant coping strategies, based on confrontation, the search for social support and acceptance of responsibility (p&lt;0.05). The presence of CMD and the use of confrontation coping strategies were the variables that best explained problematic internet use (R2=0.33%; p&lt;0.00). High levels of digital socialization should be taken into account in mental health care actions aimed at university students in the context of COVID-19. Este estudo objetivou estimar a prevalÃƒÂªncia de Transtornos Mentais Comuns (TMC) em estudantes universitÃƒÂ¡rios, analisando a correlaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o com o uso de internet e com a utilizaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de estratÃƒÂ©gias de enfrentamento ante ao isolamento social na pandemia de COVID-19. Trata-se de um estudo transversal, quantitativo, com amostra nÃƒÂ£o probabilÃƒÂ­stica, constituÃƒÂ­da por 275 estudantes. A coleta de dados foi realizada online, por meio dos instrumentos Self Report Questionnaire-20, Escala de Uso ProblemÃƒÂ¡tico de Internet e InventÃƒÂ¡rio de EstratÃƒÂ©gias de Enfrentamento. A anÃƒÂ¡lise de dados foi descritiva e inferencial, sendo tambÃƒÂ©m realizada uma anÃƒÂ¡lise de regressÃƒÂ£o linear mÃƒÂºltipla. A populaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o pesquisada apresentou uma prevalÃƒÂªncia de TMC de 58,5%, que correlacionou-se positivamente com a frequÃƒÂªncia de uso de internet, e com a utilizaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de estratÃƒÂ©gias de enfrentamento evitativas, baseadas no confronto, orientadas para a busca de suporte social e aceitaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de responsabilidade (p&lt;0,05). A presenÃƒÂ§a de TMC e a utilizaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de estratÃƒÂ©gias de enfretamento baseadas no confronto foram as variÃƒÂ¡veis que melhor explicaram o uso problemÃƒÂ¡tico de internet (R2=0,33%; p&lt;0,00).

"Mental health in medical students during COVID-19 quarantine: a comprehensive analysis across year-classes","The COVID-19 pandemic brought abrupt changes when quarantine measures were implemented. Most medical students had distance learning as their main content delivery mode, but in clerkship (fifth and sixth years), in-person activities were maintained under new protocols. These different modes may have affected student mental health. This study examines mental burden and empathy in medical students during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the year of attendance. All students attending first to the sixth year in the same medical school were invited to participate. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) were provided. HADS scores for Anxiety and Depression (n=347) were 9.8Ã‚Â±4.3 and 7.1Ã‚Â±3.6, respectively; the SRQ-20 (n=373) score was 8.1Ã‚Â±4.5; all scores were negatively correlated with the year of attendance. IRI (n=373) scores were: 2.6Ã‚Â±0.5 (Empathic Concern), 2.7Ã‚Â±0.7 (Perspective Taking), 2.5Ã‚Â±0.9 (Fantasy), and 1.7Ã‚Â±0.7 (Personal Distress). Fantasy was negatively correlated with the year of attendance. MAAS scores were positively correlated with the year of attendance. Worse mental health scores were found for first-year students across all scales. We found high levels of mental burden in medical students in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in first-year students, who may have fewer resources to deal with stress.

This risk is due to their high rates of pre-pandemic psychiatric comorbidities and the pandemic's disruption to routines and access to necessary supports. Prior research has indicated that children with ASD may experience a worsening of specific psychiatric symptoms in response to COVID-19, though this body of work is limited in scope. The present study expands this literature by examining specific types of psychiatric problems that emerged about 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the onset of the pandemic, and risk factors predicting changes in these psychiatric symptoms. Parents of children with a confirmed ASD diagnosis (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 257), who enrolled in a clinic registry at an outpatient specialty autism center, were included in this study. All data were gathered online via customized and standardized questionnaires. Results showed that 59% of children experienced either a worsening of their pre-pandemic psychiatric diagnoses and/or the development of new psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic. Multivariable regression models indicated that risk factors for increased psychiatric problems included child understanding of COVID-19, COVID-19 illness in the family, low family income, and elevated parental depression and anxiety symptoms (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Findings from this study emphasize the urgent need to provide effective and accessible psychiatric services for children with ASD and their families during and after the pandemic. LAY SUMMARY: Children with ASD are at high risk for psychiatric problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that 59% of children in our clinical sample are experiencing increased psychiatric problems. The child's understanding of COVID-19, COVID-19 illness in the family, low family income, and depression and anxiety symptoms in the parent increase the risk for poor mental health during the pandemic. These findings indicate the importance of helping children with ASD access mental health treatment during COVID-19.","Vasa, Singh, Holingue, Kalb, Jang, Keefer","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2574","20210707","COVID-19; autism spectrum disorder; children; psychiatric problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15764,""
"Evaluation of the Mental Health of Health Professionals in the Covid-19 era Under what mental health conditions are our health care workers facing into a new wave of Coronavirus?","The aims of this study were to analyze the mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of a broad sample of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Spain and to identify potential factors that have a significant effect on their mental health and HRQoL. This prospective cohort study comprised 2089 HCWs who completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), the Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Insomnia Severity Index(ISI) and the Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire(EQ-5D). Sociodemographic and clinical data in relation to Covid-19 were also recorded. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis and multivariable linear regression models were applied to identify factors associated with mental health and HRQoL. 80.87% of participants were female and 19.13% male; 82.38% were aged under 55 years; 39.13% were physicians and 50.17% were nurses or auxiliaries; 80.42% of the health workers have directly treated patients with Covid-19 and 12.28% have themselves tested positive for Covid-19. 38.58% of HCWs had clinical depression; over half(51.75%) had clinical anxiety; 60.4% had clinical stress; and 21.57% had clinical insomnia. Older professionals(&gt;55 years) reported lower rates of anxiety, depression, insomnia and stress. Having worked directly with Covid-19 patients appears to be an explanatory variable of suffering greater anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia, and of having a worse HRQoL amongst our HCWs. The group of HCWs suffering the worst mental state were nursing home workers. Our study confirms that symptomatology of anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia and HRQoL were affected amongst HCW during the Covid-19 pandemic.","MartÃƒÂ­n, Padierna, Villanueva, Quintana","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14607","20210707","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health-related quality of life; healthcare workers; insomnia; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15765,""

"Beyond the physical risk: Psychosocial impact and coping in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to examine the psychosocial impact and identify risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes in healthcare professionals during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Cyprus. Healthcare professionals are in the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic facing an unprecedented global health crisis, which can have consequences on their psychosocial health. There is a need to identify risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes to inform the design of tailored psychological interventions. Cross-sectional online study. A total of 1071Ã‚Â healthcare professionals completed self-report questionnaires. Measures included sociodemographic information, COVID-19-related characteristics, quality of life (Brief World Health Organization Quality of Life; WHOQOL-Bref), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; PHQ-8), occupational burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; CBI), and coping (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced; Brief COPE). This article follows the STROBE reporting guidelines. The prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and clinically significant depression was 27.6% and 26.8%, respectively. Significant risk factors for poor psychological outcomes included being female, being a nurse or doctor (vs non-medical professional), working in frontline units (inpatient, intensive care), perceptions of inadequate workplace preparation to deal with the pandemic, and using avoidance coping. Depression and occupational burnout were significant risk factors for poor quality of life. The findings suggest several individual, psychosocial, and organisational risk factors for the adverse psychological outcomes observed in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the urgent need for screening for anxiety and depression and psychological interventions to combat an imminent mental health crisis in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic response protocols and public health initiatives aiming to improve and prevent mental health problems in healthcare professionals during the current and future health crises, need to account for the various factors at play.","Fteropoulli, Kalavana, Yiallourou, Karaiskakis, Koliou Mazeri, Vryonides, Hadjioannou, Nikolopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15938","20210707","COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; coping; depression; healthcare professionals; mental health; occupational burnout; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15767,""
"Emotions in Covid-19 Twitter discourse following the introduction of social contact restrictions in Central Europe","Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns have played a critical role in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, but may increase psychological burden. This study sought to examine emotions reflected in social media discourse following the introduction of social contact restrictions in Central Europe. German-language Twitter posts containing '#corona' and '#covid-19' were collected between 2020/03/18 - 2020/04/24. A total of 79,760 tweets were included in the final analysis. Rates of expressions of positive emotion, anxiety, sadness and anger were compared over time. Bi-term topic models were applied to extract topics of discussion and examine association with emotions. Rates of anxiety, sadness and positive emotion decreased in the period following the introduction of social contact restrictions. A total of 16 topics were associated with emotions, which related to four general themes: social contact restrictions, life during lockdown, infection-related issues, and impact of the pandemic on public and private life. Several unique patterns of association between topics and emotions emerged. Results suggest decreasing polarity of emotions among the public following the introduction of social contact restrictions. Monitoring of social media activity may prove beneficial for an adaptive understanding of changing public concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Hanschmidt, Kersting","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01613-y","20210707","Anxiety; Covid-19; Emotions; Natural language processing; Social media; Topic models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15768,""
"Global Changes in Secondary Atmospheric Pollutants During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic","We use the global Community Earth System Model to investigate the response of secondary pollutants (ozone O<sub>3</sub>, secondary organic aerosols SOA) in different parts of the world in response to modified emissions of primary pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantify the respective effects of the reductions in NOx and in volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions, which, in most cases, affect oxidants in opposite ways. Using model simulations, we show that the level of NOx has been reduced by typically 40% in China during February 2020 and by similar amounts in many areas of Europe and North America in mid-March to mid-April 2020, in good agreement with space and surface observations. We show that, relative to a situation in which the emission reductions are ignored and despite the calculated increase in hydroxyl and peroxy radicals, the ozone concentration increased only in a few NOx-saturated regions (northern China, northern Europe, and the US) during the winter months of the pandemic when the titration of this molecule by NOx was reduced. In other regions, where ozone is NOx-controlled, the concentration of ozone decreased. SOA concentrations decrease in response to the concurrent reduction in the NOx and VOC emissions. The model also shows that atmospheric meteorological anomalies produced substantial variations in the concentrations of chemical species during the pandemic. In Europe, for example, a large fraction of the ozone increase in February 2020 was associated with meteorological anomalies, while in the North China Plain, enhanced ozone concentrations resulted primarily from reduced emissions of primary pollutants.","Gaubert, Bouarar, Doumbia, Liu, Stavrakou, Deroubaix, Darras, Elguindi, Granier, Lacey, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Shi, Tilmes, Wang, Brasseur","https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD034213","20210707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15769,""
"Perceptions, risk and understandings of the COVID-19 pandemic in urban South Africa","How people perceive the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and understand their risk can influence their health, behaviours and overall livelihood. The disease's novelty and severity have elicited a range of attitudes and perspectives countrywide, which consequently influence the public's adherence to public health prevention and treatment guidelines. To investigate perceptions, experiences and knowledge on COVID-19 in a community-based cohort study. Adults living in Soweto in South Africa's Gauteng province during the first six weeks of the national lockdown regulations (i.e. Alert Level 5 lockdown from end of March to beginning of May 2020). Participants completed a series of surveys and answered open-ended questions through telephonic interviews (<i>n</i> = 391). We queried their perceptions of the origins of COVID-19, understandings of the disease, personal and communal risks and its relations with the existing disease burden. Findings from our sample of 391 adults show that perceptions and knowledge of COVID-19 vary across several demographic characteristics. We report moderate levels of understanding about COVID-19, prevention methods and risk, as well as exposure to major physical, psychosocial and financial stressors. Depressive symptoms, perceived infection risk and concern about COVID-19 significantly predicted COVID-19 prevention knowledge. Public health communication campaigns should focus on continuing to improve knowledge and reduce misinformation associated with the virus. Policymakers should consider the mental health- and non-health-related impact of the pandemic on their citizens in order to curb the pandemic in a manner that maximises well-being.","Kim, Burgess, Chiwandire, Kwinda, Tsai, Norris, Mendenhall","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.27i0.1580","20210707","COVID-19; South Africa; knowledge; perceptions; risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15770,""
"Social Media Addiction and Mental Health Among University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia","Deteriorating mental health among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic is a serious worldwide public health concern. This study aims to examine the linkage between social media addiction and mental health of university students in Indonesia and to address whether family relationship and religiosity may mitigate the harmful effects of social media on the mental health of students at this time. We collected data from 709 students at universities across the country between June 3 and June 20, 2020. Mental health was measured using 10 items validated by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. We found that students with higher social media addiction scores had a greater likelihood of experiencing mild depression (OR 1.07, CI: 1.02-1.12). Students who had good relationships with their parents and were more religious showed better mental health than those who had poor relationships with their parents and were less religious. This study suggests the need to mitigate university students' mental health risks through reducing social media addiction while encouraging family relationships and religiosity during the pandemic.","Sujarwoto, Saputri, Yumarni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00582-3","20210707","COVID-19 pandemic; Indonesia; Mental health; Social media addiction; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15771,""
"Sleep disturbance among frontline nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","The main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of sleep disturbance and related psychological factors (stress, anxiety and depression) among frontline nurses in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using QualtricsÃ‚Â® software was used in this research. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with poor sleep quality. Of the 987 frontline nurses who participated, 58.8% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°580) reported poor sleep quality. In an examination of PSQI components the mean sleep duration was 7.04 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.59) hours per night, and the sleep latency mean was 38.18Ã‚Â min (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31.81). Poor sleep (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) was significantly associated with age, marital status, years of experience, comorbidity, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with having COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that poor quality of sleep was significantly associated with stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. Sleep disturbance is a significant problem for frontline nurses working in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to maintain the health conditions and reduce sleep disturbance among frontline nurses are needed in order to help support nurses' work during contagious disease outbreaks. These can be implemented through online workshops and training to enhance nurses' responses to the pandemic or to any further disease outbreaks.","Al Maqbali","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-021-00337-6","20210707","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Frontline nurses; PSQI; Sleep disturbance; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15772,""

However, little is known about normative levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in parents of school-age children. The present study reports on generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in 1570 parents and guardians of a nationally representative sample of children ages five to twelve years using two widely used and validated questionnaires: the eight-item variant of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Moderate to severe levels of generalized anxiety symptoms were reported in 12.7% of the total sample and moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms were reported in 14.1% of the sample; 17.7% of the sample reported moderate to severe levels of either generalized anxiety or depressive symptoms. This percentage was higher for females, younger parents and guardians, and parents and guardians reporting lower household incomes. These data, collected online in early 2018, may be useful for researchers and clinicians studying and treating anxiety and depression in parents.

We use semi-structured, qualitative interviews to explore the advantages, challenges, and positive impacts of the online parenting group from the perspectives of the group leader and the five group participants. Participants' narrative reflections show that they were satisfied with the convenient and engaging online delivery of the program and would recommend it to other parents. Parents reported significant improvements in their parenting and greater awareness of their strengths and struggles. The online delivery of COS-P resulted in more efficient service delivery, greater attendance rates, and adherence to the model. The stressors on the experienced facilitator, due to the abrupt transition and multiple technical and communication challenges, may have been mitigated by supervisor and collegial support, as well as careful preparation for herself and the participants.

We find that Covid-19 has been unusually burdensome for parents as they are more likely to have experienced negative physical and mental health outcomes and suffer more negative financial impacts. Despite the challenges parents face, they also remain cautious about in-person school and vaccinations. Although mothers have been the focus of much news coverage, we find that both mothers and fathers have been similarly and negatively impacted by Covid-19.

"Religion Protected Mental Health but Constrained Crisis Response During Crucial Early Days of the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study demonstrates that religion protected mental health but constrained support for crisis response during the crucial early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from a national probability-based sample of the U.S. population show that highly religious individuals and evangelicals suffered less distress in March 2020. They were also less likely to see the coronavirus outbreak as a crisis and less likely to support public health restrictions to limit the spread of the virus. The conservative politicization of religion in the United States can help explain why religious Americans (and evangelicals in particular) experienced less distress and were less likely to back public health efforts to contain the virus. We conclude that religion can be a source of comfort and strength in times of crisis, but-at least in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic-it can also undercut efforts to end the root causes of suffering.","Schnabel, Schieman","https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12720","20210707","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; coronavirus; crisis response; pandemic; politics; psychological distress; religion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15780,""

The findings also support the use of the scale in surveys and for educational and trainings purposes.","Al-Ma'seb, Al-Sejari","https://doi.org/10.1111/issj.12264","20210707","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; factor analysis; mental health; validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15781,""
"Analysis of Perceptions and Emotional Repercussions in Twitter Users in Colombia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health. Up to a quarter of the population has reported mental health disorders. This has been studied mainly from a nosological perspective, according to diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, we did not find studies that have explored the daily expressions of the population. Our objective was to evaluate the perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions on the emotional well-being of the Colombian population. We performed a Twitter metrics and trend analysis. Initially, in the trend analysis, we calculated the average duration in hours of the 20 most popular trending topics of the day in Colombia and we grouped them into trends related to COVID-19 and unrelated trends. Subsequently, we identified dates of events associated with the pandemic relevant to the country, and they were related to the behaviour of the trends studied. Additionally, we did an exploratory analysis of these, selected the tweets with the greatest reach and categorised them in an inductive way to analyse them qualitatively. Issues not related to COVID-19 were more far-reaching than those related to coronavirus. However, a rise in these issues was seen on some dates consistent with important events in Colombia. We found expressions of approval and disapproval, solidarity and accusation. Inductively, we identified categories of informative tweets, humour, fear, stigma and discrimination, politics and entities, citizen complaints, and self-care and optimism. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic generates different reactions in the population, which increasingly have more tools to express themselves and know the opinions of others. Social networks play a fundamental role in the communication of the population, so this content could serve as a public health surveillance tool and a useful and accessible means of communication in the management of health crises.","Botero-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Mosquera-QuiÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³nez, MartÃƒÂ­nez Torres, BolÃƒÂ­var-MonÃƒÂ¡, Jover T, Vargas C, Franco, GÃƒÂ³mez-Restrepo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.05.005","20210707","Coronavirus infections; Infecciones por coronavirus; Mental health; Public health; Red social; Salud mental; Salud pÃƒÂºblica; Social networking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15782,""
"COVID-19 and MENtal Health: Addressing Men's Mental Health Needs in the Digital World","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a source of stress and have important mental health implications for all persons but may have unique implications for men. In addition to the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19, the rising COVID-19 death toll, ongoing economic uncertainty, loneliness from social distancing, and other changes to our lifestyles make up the perfect recipe for a decline in mental health. In June 2020, men reported slightly lower rates of anxiety than women, but had higher rates of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. As of September 2020, men sought mental health care at a higher rate than women for family and relationships, with year-over-year visits up 5.5 times and total virtual mental health care visits monthly growth in 2020 was up 79% since January. Because men are not a homogeneous group, it is important to implement strategies for groups of men that may have particularly unique needs. In this paper, we discuss considerations for intervening in men's mental health during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including current technology-based cyberpsychology options.","Ellison, Semlow, Jaeger, Griffth","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883211030021","20210707","COVID-19; Mental health; help-seeking behaviors; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15783,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on adolescent psychiatric inpatient admissions","COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of individuals and families across the globe. For many, the impacts of this global pandemic have been insurmountable and have resulted in significant stressors. Although medical advances have allowed individuals to slowly begin to restore their sense of normalcy, COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented mental health impacts for many, especially children and adolescents. The present study examines whether stressors related to COVID-19 and whether subsequent quarantine/isolation were possible contributors to psychiatric crises that led to adolescent psychiatric inpatient admissions. Electronic medical records of those admitted to Strong Memorial Hospital's Child and Adolescent Inpatient Unit between March 13, 2020 and January 1, 2021 were reviewed. Admission and discharge notes were analyzed to determine the presence and context of keywords related to COVID-19. Approximately, 53% of all adolescent psychiatric crises that led to inpatient admission were related to COVID-19 stressors. Results of this study will be used to help understand the extraordinary mental health impacts of a global pandemic and will assist mental health service leaders to better plan for patient flow should there be another wave of quarantine/isolation. Additionally, these results can help inform and develop pandemic-related strategies and interventions that can reduce overall distress in children and adolescents.","Reece, Sams","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211030666","20210707","COVID-19; adolescents; crisis; inpatient; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15784,""
"The global prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and, insomnia and its changes among health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health professionals who are at the frontline of this crisis have been facing extreme psychological disorders. This research aims to provide an overall scenario of the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, as well as insomnia and to inspect the changes in these prevalence over time by analyzing the existing evidence during this COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A systematic search was performed on March 30, 2021, in PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar databases, and Web of Science. To assess the heterogeneity, Q-test, I 2 statistics, and Meta regression and to search for the publication bias, Eggers's test and funnel plot were used. The random-effect model and subgroup analysis were performed due to the significant heterogeneity. Results Among eighty-three eligible studies in the final synthesis, 69 studies (n = 144649) assessed the depression prevalence of 37.12% (95% CI: 31.80â€“42.43), 75 studies (n = 147435) reported the anxiety prevalence of 41.42% (95% CI: 36.17â€“46.54), 41 studies (n = 82783) assessed the stress prevalence of 44.86% (95% CI: 36.98â€“52.74), 21 studies (n = 33370) enunciated the insomnia prevalence of 43.76% (95% CI: 35.83â€“51.68). The severity of the mental health problems among health professionals increased over the time during January 2020 to September 2020. Limitations A significant level of heterogeneity was found among psychological measurement tools and across studies. Conclusions Therefore, it is an emergency to develop psychological interventions that can protect the mental health of vulnerable groups like health professionals.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07393","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15785,""

"Reflections on the psychologist's role in nursing homes during the Covid crisis","Lors de lâ€™arrivÃ©e de la Covid en EHPAD, un contexte vraiment spÃ©cifique sâ€™agence. Lâ€™apparition dâ€™une pathologie inconnue et redoutÃ©e dans un climat dâ€™isolement en chambre ne peut que venir nourrir inquiÃ©tude et imaginaire chez les rÃ©sidents. Face Ã  lâ€™Ã©mergence de nouveaux besoins mais aussi Ã  lâ€™organisation institutionnelle modifiÃ©e, cette esquisse cherche Ã  redÃ©finir un potentiel cadre fonctionnel pour la pratique du psychologue. AprÃ¨s avoir dÃ©fini les grandes caractÃ©ristiques de la fonction, Ã  partir de notre expÃ©rience clinique, nous chercherons Ã  dÃ©gager les invariants devant Ãªtre conservÃ©s dans une situation telle. Parmi quelques mÃ©canismes, le renforcement des assises narcissiques, lâ€™observation de certains comportements prenant le masque de la dÃ©pression ou encore la crise identitaire nous permettront de dÃ©finir des objectifs. The arrival of Covid-19 in nursing homes gave rise to a very specific situation. The appearance of an unknown and frightening pathology in a climate of isolation, with residents confined to their rooms, can only fuel concern and imagination among residents. In the light of the emergence of new needs, and also of upheavals in institutional organization, the aim of this study was to define a functional framework for the psychologist. On the basis of clinical experience, after having defined the main characteristics of the psychologist's role, we identify conditions that should be maintained in situations of this sort. Among other mechanisms, the strengthening narcissistic foundations, the observation of certain behaviors that could mask depression or again the detection of identity crises could enable the definition of relevant objectives.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2021.05.005","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","",15794,""
