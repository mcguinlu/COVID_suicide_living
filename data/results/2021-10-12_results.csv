"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental healthcare consultations among children and adolescents in Norway: a nationwide registry study","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: There have been widespread concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions on children's and adolescents' mental health. While some studies have found increasing rates of mental health problems during the pandemic, other evidence suggest that mental symptoms and disorders were increasing before the pandemic. This study compared trends in mental healthcare use during the first 15 months of the pandemic with similar pre-pandemic trends. METHODS: Consultations related to mental symptoms and disorders were identified through national registries from primary and specialist healthcare services, including hospitalizations, covering the entire population of children 6-18 years in Norway (N=908 272). The monthly likelihood of having a consultation or hospitalization related to overall mental health problems, and specific diagnoses for depression, anxiety, ADHD and sleep problems were plotted from January 2020 to May 2021 and compared to trends over the same period between 2017-2019 using event study and difference-in-difference designs. FINDINGS: We found reductions in consultations for mental health symptoms and disorders in primary and specialist healthcare during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020. This decline was temporary, and volumes of consultations quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, during fall 2020, consultation volumes related to mental health in primary care increased. This increase persisted into the winter of 2021 but levelled off by the last month of the sample period. The increase in consultation volumes was about 50 % compared to the pre-pandemic period. We did not find increases in consultations in specialist healthcare, except for hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: We found an increase in primary care consultation volumes related to mental health among children that depart from the previously established increases over recent years. We did not see similar increases in consultations in the specialist healthcare. It is unknown whether increases in primary care consultations represent milder cases, which primarily do not need specialist treatment, or if the stability in specialist healthcare consultations reflects capacity problems or timelags in referrals.","Miriam Evensen; Rannveig Kaldager Hart; Anna Aasen Godoy; Lars Johan Hauge; Ingunn Olea Lund; Ann Kristin Knudsen; Maja Weemes Grotting; Pal Suren; Anne Reneflot","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.07.21264549","20211011","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18716,""
"Prospective predictors of risk and resilience trajectories during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving stressor with significant mental health consequences. We aimed to delineate distinct anxiety-response trajectories during the early stages of the pandemic and to identify baseline risk and resilience factors as predictors of anxiety responses. Methods. Using a crowdsourcing website, we enrolled 1,362 participants, primarily from the United States (n = 1064) and Israel (n = 222) over three time-points from April-September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modeling to identify anxiety trajectories over time. Group comparison and multivariate regression models were used to examine demographic and risk and resilience factors associated with class membership. Results. A four-class model provided the best fit. The resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) was the most common (n = 961, 75.08%), followed by chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64%), recovery (n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78%). While COVID-19 stressors did not differ between trajectories, resilient participants were more likely to be older, living with another person and to report higher income, more education, fewer COVID-19 worries, better sleep quality, and more dispositional resilience factors at baseline. Multivariate analyses suggested that baseline emotion regulation capabilities and low conflictual relationships uniquely distinguished participants in distinct trajectories. Conclusions. Consistent with prior resilience research following major adversities, a majority of individuals showed stable low levels of low anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about dispositional resilience factors may prospectively inform mental health trajectories early in the course of ongoing adversity.","Tal Shilton; Anthony D Mancini; Samantha Perlstein; Grace E DiDomenico; Elina Visoki; David M Greenberg; Lily A Brown; Raquel E Gur; Rebecca Waller; Ran Barzilay","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.08.21264752","20211011","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18717,""
"Rapid response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in post-COVID depression","The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. After COVID-19, depression was reported in 40% of patients at one-, three-, and six-months follow-up. Emerging literature suggests anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of antidepressants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We aim to investigate the efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in treating post-COVID depression. We included 60 patients affected by a major depressive episode and treated with SSRI in the six months following recovery from COVID. The severity of depression was rated at baseline and after four weeks on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Response to treatment was considered when the patients achieved a 50% HDRS reduction. To investigate changes of depressive symptomatology over time, repeated measures ANOVAs according to clinical variables were performed. We found that 55 (92%) patients showed a clinical response to antidepressant. Patients showed a significant decrease over time of HDRS score (baseline HDRSÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23.37Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.94, post-treatment HDRSÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.71Ã‚Â±4.41, FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 618.90, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), irrespectively of sex, previous psychiatric history, previous history of mood disorder, and SSRI type. This is the first study to explore the SSRI efficacy in post-COVID depression, suggesting rapid antidepressant effects in most patients. SSRIs treatment could contribute to the rapid antidepressant response by directly targeting the neuroinflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2. We suggest screening psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors to diagnose emergent depression and pharmacologically treat it to reduce the disease burden and related years of life lived with disability.","Mazza, Zanardi, Palladini, Rovere-Querini, Benedetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.09.009","20211011","Antidepressive agents; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Psychopathology; Serotonin uptake inhibitors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18718,""
"Publication trends related to schizophrenia, mental health, and depression during COVID-19","The aim of this article is to analyze publication trends related to schizophrenia, mental health, and depression during COVID-19 in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry. In 2020, 576 articles were identified using bibliometric analysis from scopus.com. According to the results, India had the most articles on schizophrenia, mental health, and depression, followed by China, Australia, Bangladesh, and Japan, during COVID-19. Meanwhile, the most frequently used keywords were schizophrenia (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 39), COVID-19 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 35), mental health (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23), depression (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 22), and adolescents (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12). These represent the trend of publications related to the topics discussed in 2020.

"Decreasing mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study among Danes before and during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on people's lives and may influence mental health in the general population. In a unique representative Danish longitudinal study, we examined mental well-being measured just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Danish Health and Wellbeing Survey is the Danish contribution to the European Health Interview Survey. In this study, we included the wave from autumn 2019, which we re-invited in the autumn 2020. The study population consisted of 4,234 persons. The main outcome was mental well-being measured by the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). Linear and logistic regression models were conducted to evaluate change in SWEMWBS between 2019 and 2020. The SWEMWBS distribution was similar in 2019 and 2020, although the distribution moved to lower scores in 2020 compared to 2019. Mean SWEMWBS decreased significantly from 25.5 in 2019 to 24.6 in 2020 corresponding to a mean change of -1.0 (95%CI, -1.1. to -0.8). The proportion with low SWEMWBS increased from 16.5% in 2019 to 20.1% in 2020 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). The mean change was similar for men and women and for different age groups. The most negative development was observed among persons without depression or long-standing illnesses at baseline and among persons with higher educational level. Among persons with depression SWEMWBS increased. As expected, mental well-being significantly decreased in the adult Danish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, somewhat more unexpectedly, the decrease was most pronounced among persons without depression or long-standing illnesses and among higher educated groups.","Thygesen, MÃƒÂ¸ller, ErsbÃƒÂ¸ll, Santini, Nielsen, GrÃƒÂ¸nbÃƒÂ¦k, Ekholm","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.09.035","20211011","Covid-19; Denmark; Mental health; Mental well-being; Panel study; Public health surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18720,""

"Global prevalence and burden of depressive and anxiety disorders in 204 countries and territories in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic","Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020. We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 0Ã‚Â·9 [95% uncertainty interval 0Ã‚Â·1 to 1Ã‚Â·8; p=0Ã‚Â·029] for human mobility, 18Ã‚Â·1 [7Ã‚Â·9 to 28Ã‚Â·3; p=0Ã‚Â·0005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0Ã‚Â·9 [0Ã‚Â·1 to 1Ã‚Â·7; p=0Ã‚Â·022] and 13Ã‚Â·8 [10Ã‚Â·7 to 17Ã‚Â·0; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0Ã‚Â·1 [0Ã‚Â·1 to 0Ã‚Â·2; p=0Ã‚Â·0001] for major depressive disorder, 0Ã‚Â·1 [0Ã‚Â·1 to 0Ã‚Â·2; p=0Ã‚Â·0001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (-0Ã‚Â·007 [-0Ã‚Â·009 to -0Ã‚Â·006; p=0Ã‚Â·0001] for major depressive disorder, -0Ã‚Â·003 [-0Ã‚Â·005 to -0Ã‚Â·002; p=0Ã‚Â·0001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53Ã‚Â·2 million (44Ã‚Â·8 to 62Ã‚Â·9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27Ã‚Â·6% [25Ã‚Â·1 to 30Ã‚Â·3]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152Ã‚Â·9 cases (2722Ã‚Â·5 to 3654Ã‚Â·5) per 100Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 population. We also estimated an additional 76Ã‚Â·2 million (64Ã‚Â·3 to 90Ã‚Â·6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25Ã‚Â·6% [23Ã‚Â·2 to 28Ã‚Â·0]), such that the total prevalence was 4802Ã‚Â·4 cases (4108Ã‚Â·2 to 5588Ã‚Â·6) per 100Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49Ã‚Â·4 million (33Ã‚Â·6 to 68Ã‚Â·7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44Ã‚Â·5 million (30Ã‚Â·2 to 62Ã‚Â·5) DALYs globally in 2020. This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.

"National Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Australian Residential Aged Care Residents and Staff","This study is the first to obtain data on the prevalence of, contributors to, and supports required for, pandemic-related distress within the residential aged care sector in Australia. A nested mixed-methods approach was used to examine aged care leaders' opinions about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of aged care residents and staff. A total of 288 senior staff of Australian residential aged care facilities (care managers, clinical care coordinators, and lifestyle team leaders; mean ageÃ‚Â = 52.7Ã‚Â years, <i>SD</i>Ã‚Â = 10.3) completed an online survey between 10<sup>th</sup> September and 31<sup>st</sup> October 2020. On average, nearly half of their residents experienced loneliness (41%) and a third experienced anxiety in response to COVID-19 (33%). The most frequently noted contributors to poor mental health among residents were restrictions to recreational outings and watching news coverage relating to COVID-19. Participants emphasized the need for increased access to counseling services and improved mental health training amongst staff. Residential care staff were similarly impacted by the pandemic. More than a third of staff were reported as anxious (36%) and 20% depressed, in response to COVID-19. Staff were worried about introducing COVID-19 into their facility and were impacted by news coverage of COVID-19. Staff would feel supported by financial assistance and by increased staff-resident ratios. Senior staff perceive that the mental health of Australian aged care residents and staff was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most noted contributors were identified, as was the mental health support for aged care communities. This study provides government and policymakers with clear intervention targets for supporting the sector. Clinicians can support residential aged care communities by providing on-site or telehealth counseling, and upskill and train residential aged care staff on how to respond to the emotional needs of residents in response to COVID-19.","Brydon, Bhar, Doyle, Batchelor, Lovelock, Almond, Mitchell, Nedeljkovic, Savvas, Wuthrich","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1985671","20211011","COVID-19; aged care; mental health; older adults; residential aged care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18723,""

This, among other mental disorders and mental health consequences, highlights a specific psychiatric phenomenon: the hikikomori condition. The hikikomori is a phenomenon of persistent and extreme social withdrawal. The condition's established diagnostic set of criteria is not yet to be found in diagnostic manuals classifying mental disorders. Little is known about the exact mechanism of its development, but some authors see a close link between its emergence and the rise of the internet. Typically, the individual gradually withdraws into a voluntary isolation as a result of a socially humiliating or unfavourable situation. Although the outside world is not completely irrelevant to them, they tend to follow online the events of the world and they also keep in touch with others mostly online in order to avoid retraumatization. The COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to the rise of online lifestyles as a consequence of lockdowns, has contributed significantly to the more and more frequent use of the internet, while real social contact has been inevitably reduced. This constellation can be seen as a major risk factor for hikikomori, which in the long term could be an unanticipated complication of the pandemic, especially in adolescents and young adults.

COVID-19 may result in the appearance of neuropsychiatric syndromes. Moreover, other corollaries of the pandemic (e.g., isolation, job loss) may lead to increasing stress and, ultimately, psychiatric disorders even among the non-infected population. We aimed to test the theory of whether the pandemic, due to the aforementioned factors, was associated with the reversal of the declining suicide rate trend in Hungary. To compare the observed number of suicides during the COVID-19 months (March-December 2020) with the expected numbers, we used an interrupted time series model and, for the estimations, quasi-Poisson regression. Expected numbers were calculated based on trends derived from monthly data between 2010 and 2020. During the months of the pandemic, the number of suicides among males rose significantly by 18% compared to the hypothetical trend that would have occurred in the absence of COVID-19. A significant increase (16%) was also observed in the total population. By contrast, the number of female suicides did not differ significantly from the number expected based on the pre-COVID-19 trend. After the outbreak of the epidemic, Hungarian males committed significantly more suicides, while no relevant changes were observed among females. Interestingly, studies from other countries found either no change or decrease when comparing suicide numbers from the COVID-19 period with the corresponding numbers from the pre-COVID-19 period. The explanation for this discrepancy is still lacking, so further investigations are needed.

"Anxiety of pregnant women in time of catastrophic events, including COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","In March 2020, daily life was disrupted by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Pandemic-related prenatal anxiety could lead to depression, a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and abnormal neonatal development. This study aimed to investigate the impact of anxiety on the mental health of pregnant women exposed to catastrophic events as compared to those without such exposure. PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies. This study compared the prevalence of anxiety among pregnant women during a catastrophic event. Fifteen full texts were assessed for inclusion, with 3 included, 10 excluded for not meeting criteria, and 2 excluded for other reasons. The included studies were published before the current COVID-19 pandemic but included the SARS 2003 outbreak. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, 10 further studies were conducted, but they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of two studies using STAI revealed that women exposed to a catastrophic event had a higher mean STAI score of 1.82 points (95% CI: 0.47-3.18 points). Women with complications during pregnancy should be assessed for anxiety independently from catastrophic events. During financial crises, environmental or other disasters, special attention should be given to women with low risk, normal pregnancies.","Feduniw, Modzelewski, Kajdy, Sys, Kwiatkowski, Makomaska-Szaroszyk, Rabijewski","https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482X.2021.1985453","20211011","COVID-19; Maternal perinatal anxiety; catastrophic event; distress; natural disasters; perinatology; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18726,""
"Mental health and resilience during the coronavirus pandemic: A machine learning approach","This study explored risk and resilience factors of mental health functioning during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A sample of 467 adults (M ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.14, 63.6% female) reported on mental health (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and somatic symptoms), demands and impacts of COVID-19, resources (e.g., social support, health care access), demographics, and psychosocial resilience factors. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD rates were 44%, 36%, and 23%, respectively. Supervised machine learning models identified psychosocial factors as the primary significant predictors across outcomes. Greater trauma coping self-efficacy and forward-focused coping, but not trauma-focused coping, were associated with better mental health. When accounting for psychosocial resilience factors, few external resources and demographic variables emerged as significant predictors. With ongoing stressors and traumas, employing coping strategies that emphasize distraction over trauma processing may be warranted. Clinical and community outreach efforts should target trauma coping self-efficacy to bolster resilience during a pandemic.","Samuelson, Dixon, Jordan, Powers, Sonderman, Brickman","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23254","20211011","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; coping self-efficacy; depression; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18727,""
"To prevent being stressed-out: Allostatic overload and resilience of general practitioners in the era of COVID-19 A cross-sectional observational study","Responsibility of general practitioners (GPs) in delivering safe and effective care is always high but during the COVID-19 pandemic they face even growing pressure that might result in unbearable stress load (allostatic overload, AO) leading to disease. We aimed to measure AO of Hungarian GPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore their recreational resources to identify potential protective factors against stress load. In a mixed-method design, Fava's clinimetric approach to AO was applied alongside the Psychosocial Index (PSI); Kellner's symptom questionnaire (SQ) to measure depression, anxiety, hostility and somatisation and the Public Health Surveillance Well-being Scale (PHS-WB) to determine mental, social, and physical well-being. Recreational resources were mapped. Besides Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests, regression analysis was applied to identify explanatory variables of AO. Data of 228 GPs (68% females) were analysed. Work-related changes caused the biggest challenges leading to AO in 60% of the sample. While female sex (OR: 1.99; CI: 1.06; 3.74, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.032) and other life stresses (OR: 1.4; CI: 1.2; 1.6, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) associated with increased odds of AO, each additional day with 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°min for recreation purposes associated with 20% decreased odds (OR: 0.838; CI: 0.72; 0.97, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.020). 3-4Ã¢â‚¬â€°days a week when time was ensured for recreation associated with elevated mental and physical well-being, while 5-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°days associated with lower depressive and anxiety symptoms, somatisation, and hostility.

"Mental depression: Relation to different disease status, newer treatments and its association with COVID-19 pandemic (Review)","The present study aimed to review major depression, including its types, epidemiology, association with different diseases status and treatments, as well as its correlation with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Mental depression is a common disorder that affects most individuals at one time or another. During depression, there are changes in mood and behavior, accompanied by feelings of defeat, hopelessness, or even suicidal thoughts. Depression has a direct or indirect relation with a number of other diseases including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. In addition, antidepressant drugs have several side effects including sedation, increased weight, indigestion, sexual dysfunction, or a decrease in blood pressure. Stopping medication may cause a relapse of the symptoms of depression and pose a risk of attempted suicide. The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected the mental health of individuals, including patients, individuals contacting patients and medical staff with a number of mental disorders that may adversely affect the immune ability of their bodies. Some of the drugs currently included in the protocols for treating COVID-19 may negatively affect the mental health of patients. Evidence accumulated over the years indicates that serotoninÃ‚Â (5HT) deficiencies and norepinephrineÃ‚Â (NE) in the brain can lead to mental depression. Drugs that increase levels of NE and 5HT are commonly used in the treatment of depression. The common reason for mood disorders, including mania and bipolar disease are not clearly understood. It is assumed that hyperactivity in specific parts of the brain and excessive activity of neurotransmitters may be involved. Early diagnosis and developing new treatment strategies are essential for the prevention of the severe consequences of depression. In addition, extensive research should be directed towards the investigation of the mental health disturbances occurring during and/or after COVID-19 infection. This may lead to the incorporation of a suitable antidepressant into the current treatment protocols.","Abdel-Bakky, Amin, Faris, Abdellatif","https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2021.12479","20211011","COVID-19; latest treatments; major depression; mental health; molecular mechanism; neurotransmitters","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18729,""

Furthermore, levels of suicidal thinking and of depression were higher in 2020 than in 2019 and 2016. The sample size of the current study was rather modest and suicide ideation was assessed with a single item only. The rate of students suffering from suicidal ideation was twice as high in 2020 than in previous years.

"The Potential Benefits of Non-skills Training (Mental Toughness) for Elite Athletes: Coping With the Negative Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The spread of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on global sport. This is especially true at the elite level, where it has disrupted training and competition. Concomitantly, restrictions have disrupted long-term event planning. Many elite athletes remain unsure when major events will occur and worry about further interruptions. Although some athletes have successfully adapted to the demands of the COVID-19 crisis, many have experienced difficulties adjusting. This has resulted in psychological complications including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. This article critically examines the extent to which non-cognitive skills training, in the form of increased awareness of Mental Toughness, can help elite athletes inoculate against and cope with negative psychological effects arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-cognitive skills encompass intrapersonal (motivations, learning strategies, and self-regulation) and interpersonal (interactions with others) domains not directly affected by intellectual capacity. Previous research indicates that enhancement of these spheres can assist performance and enhance mental well-being. Moreover, it suggests that training in the form of increased awareness of Mental Toughness, can improve the ability to cope with COVID-19 related challenges. In this context, Mental Toughness encompasses a broad set of enabling attributes (i.e., inherent and evolved values, attitudes, emotions, and cognitions). Indeed, academics commonly regard Mental Toughness as a resistance resource that protects against stress. Accordingly, this article advocates the use of the 4/6Cs model of Mental Toughness (i.e., Challenge, Commitment, Control, and Confidence) to counter negative psychological effects arising from COVID-19.","Dagnall, Drinkwater, Denovan, Walsh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.581431","20211011","COVID-19; elite athletes; mental toughness; non-cognitive skills; positive psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18731,""
"Heart transplantation in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: delirium, post-transplant depression, and visitor restrictions; the role of liaison and inpatient psychosomatic treatment-a case report","Heart transplant recipients show a high risk of developing major depression with an increased risk of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Heart transplant specialists and patients face unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have enormous clinical implications such as the increased risk of COVID-19 as well as visitor restrictions with social isolation during the post-transplant inpatient treatment. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman with end-stage heart failure caused by non-compaction cardiomyopathy who received an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) without any intra-operative complications. Post-operatively, she showed acute psychotic symptoms in the intensive care unit (ICU) with improvement after switching intravenous tacrolimus treatment to an oral intake. Furthermore, the patient developed severe depressive symptoms with malnutrition and had a prolonged hospitalization. Standard medical care was complemented by intensive psychocardiological treatment to overcome the crisis. High complexity of the post-transplant management after OHT underlines the importance of multidisciplinary teamwork, involving heart transplant specialists and allied mental health professionals. This collaboration led to an excellent long-term result. Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital visitor policies may be scrutinized, carefully looking at the role of social isolation, post-operative experience in the ICU, and medical complications after OHT.","Sadlonova, Gerecke, Herrmann-Lingen, Kutschka","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab355","20211011","COVID-19 pandemic; Case report; Delirium; Heart transplantation; Post-transplant depression; Visitor restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18732,""
"Care Challenges Due to COVID-19 and Mental Health Among Caregivers of US Adults With a Chronic or Disabling Condition","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses new challenges for caregivers of adults with chronic or disabling conditions. This study uses nationally representative data to examine the prevalence of pandemic care challenges and supports and their associations with caregiver mental health and interpersonal well-being. Participants include 311 caregivers aged 50-80 in the United States who were providing care for an adult with a chronic or disabling condition from the June 2020 National Poll on Healthy Aging. Five care challenges (e.g., confusion on public health guidelines) and 2 supports (e.g., physician offered information on care during COVID-19) are treated as predictors of caregiver mental health (care-related stress, self-reported mental health, and depressive symptoms) and interpersonal well-being (interpersonal conflicts, lack of companionship, and isolation). Each care challenge/support was endorsed by 13%-23% of caregivers. In adjusted models, difficulty getting needed medical care was associated with greater caregiver stress, depressive symptoms, and lower interpersonal well-being. All care challenges universally predicted greater caregiver stress. Caregiving supports were not independently associated with caregiver' mental health and interpersonal well-being. Care challenges were associated with caregivers' mental health and interpersonal well-being during the early months of the pandemic. Some of these challenges may be attributed to changing public health guidelines and practices as the pandemic unfolded, whereas others are relevant to all care contexts (e.g., less support from family). Tools and supports for caregivers must consider both changing policies and care needs.","Leggett, Carmichael, Leonard, Jackson, Kirch, Solway, Kullgren, Singer, Malani, Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab031","20211011","Aging; Family caregiving; National poll; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18733,""
"Medical sequels of COVID-19","COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world population, with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. While the evidence to date has attempted to describe clinical feature of acute illness, recent reports have also begun to describe persistent symptoms that extend beyond the initial period of illness. Adverse outcomes, in addition to respiratory, have been found to occur at different levels: cardiovascular, neurological, or immunological; skin, gastrointestinal or renal manifestations. The detrimental effect on mental health has also been described, not only in COVID-19 patients. The burden of disease secondary to this pandemic is likely to be enormous and not limited to acute disease alone, thus epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the long-term impact of this disease.

The investigators of the international Collaborative on Fatigue Following Infection (COFFI) conducted a systematic review of post-COVID fatigue and a narrative review on fatigue after other infections, and made recommendations for clinical and research approaches to assessing fatigue after COVID-19. In the majority of COVID-19 cohort studies, persistent fatigue was reported by a significant minority of patients, ranging from 13% to 33% at 16-20 weeks post-symptom onset. Data from the prospective cohort studies in COFFI and others indicate that fatigue is also a prevalent outcome from many acute systemic infections, notably infectious mononucleosis, with a case rate for clinically significant Post-infective fatigue after exclusion of recognized medical and psychiatric causes, ranging from 10%-35% at 6 months. To better characterize post-COVID fatigue, the COFFI investigators recommend the following: application of validated screening questionnaires for case detection; standardized interviews encompassing fatigue, mood, and other symptoms; and investigative approaches to identify end-organ damage and mental health conditions.","Sandler, Wyller, Moss-Morris, Buchwald, Crawley, Hautvast, Katz, Knoop, Little, Taylor, Wensaas, Lloyd","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab440","20211011","COVID-19; assessment; cohorts; fatigue; post-viral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18735,""

"Psychological Well-Being of Older Adults With Cognitive Deterioration During Quarantine: Preliminary Results From the GeroCovid Initiative","<b>Objectives:</b> The spread of COVID-19 has undeniably unsettled the social, psychological and emotional life of the entire world population. Particular attention should be paid to older adults with dementia, given their vulnerability to emotional stressors. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the impact of the first wave quarantine related to Covid-19 on psychological and affective well-being of older adults with mild/major neurocognitive disorders and of their caregivers. <b>Methods:</b> Data on participants' assessment before the quarantine (PREQ) were retrospectively collected. Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia were recruited from different Centers for Cognitive Decline and Dementia in Italy. During the quarantine, psychological and affective well-being were evaluated by phone through the administrations of scales measuring anxiety and depression (DASS), perceived stress (PSS), coping strategies (COPE) and the caregivers' burden (CBI). The scales' results were compared across participants' PREQ cognitive level (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE Ã¢â€°Â¥25, 23-24, and Ã¢â€°Â¤ 22) with multiple linear regression models. <b>Results:</b> The sample included 168 patients (64% women) with a mean age of 79 Ã‚Â± 7 years.

"Pilot study of a well-being app to support New Zealand young people during the COVID-19 pandemic","Well-being apps represent a promising and scalable approach for improving mental health outcomes in youth, especially during a global pandemic when access to face-to-face interventions may be limited. <i>Whitu</i> (meaning 7 in the New Zealand MÃ„Âori language Te Reo) is a newly developed well-being app with 7 modules that support young people to learn and practice evidence-based coping skills, including relaxation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and goal-setting. During this pilot, we explored the acceptability, usability, and preliminary efficacy of <i>Whitu</i> before refining the app for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We recruited 20 New Zealand young people aged 16-25Ã‚Â years via social media to trial the first prototype of the <i>Whitu</i> app over 6Ã‚Â weeks. Within-group differences from baseline to 2- and 6-weeks post intervention in self-reported well-being, depression, anxiety, stress, self-compassion, optimism and sleep quality were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVA. A further 21 participants aged 16-30Ã‚Â years were recruited to participate in 4 focus groups to give feedback on the app's usability and cultural acceptability. Feedback was analysed using directed content analysis. Statistically significant improvements in anxiety (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.024) and stress (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.017) were observed from baseline to 2-weeks post intervention. Improvements in well-being (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.021), depression (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.031), anxiety (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005), and stress (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004) were also observed from baseline to 6-weeks. No statistically significant changes were seen in self-compassion, optimism, or sleep quality. Effect sizes (partial ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup>s) ranged from 0.25 (depression) to 0.42 (stress). Qualitative feedback comprised of five key themes, namely: factors affecting engagement, issues with functionality, preferences regarding aesthetics, effectiveness and adverse effects, and cultural acceptability. Our preliminary results suggest that <i>Whitu</i> may be an effective app for improving multiple dimensions of young people's well-being. Modifications to the look and feel, cultural content, and onboarding have been undertaken based on the qualitative feedback, and an RCT is currently underway.","Serlachius, Boggiss, Lim, Schache, Wallace-Boyd, Brenton-Peters, Buttenshaw, Chadd, Cavadino, Cao, Morunga, Thabrew","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100464","20211011","Adolescent; COVID-19; Coping skills; Mental health; Mobile apps; Pandemic; Well-being; Young adult; mHealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18738,""
"Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychological distress in older adults without cognitive impairment living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A feasibility study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on the mental health of older adults living in nursing homes. Very few studies have examined the effects of Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) on older adults living in nursing homes during the pandemic. We conducted a feasibility study using a single-group design, to explore the effectiveness of ICBT on psychological distress in 137 older adults (without cognitive impairment) from 8 nursing homes in 4 southeast cities in China, between January and March 2020. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, and functional disability were measured at baseline, post-treatment (5Ã‚Â weeks) and at a 1-month follow-up. Mixed-effects model was used to assess the effects of ICBT. Statistically significant changes with large effect sizes were observed from pre- to post-treatment on the PHQ-9 (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, Cohen's <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.74), GAD-7 (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.71), GDS (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.30), K-10 (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.93), and SDS (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.03). Furthermore, improvements in treatment outcomes were sustained at 1-month follow-up, and high levels of adherence and satisfaction were indicated. ICBT was effective in reducing psychological distress in older adults without cognitive impairments living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it could be applied in improving the mental health of this vulnerable group during the pandemic.","Ying, Ji, Kong, Chen, Lv, Hou, Zhu, Miao, Yu, Li, Kuang, Jiang, Zhu, Liu, Xu, Mi, Lou, Ruan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100461","20211011","CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy; CIs, confidence intervals; COVID-19; DSM-IV, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th edition; Feasibility study; GAD-7, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item; GDS, Geriatric Depression Scale; ICBT, Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy; ITT, intention-to-treat; Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy; K-10, 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; LOCF, last observation carried forward; MMRM, mixed-effects model for repeated measure; Mental health; Older adults; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item; Psychological distress; RCT, randomized controlled trials; REML, restricted maximum likelihood; SD, standard deviation; SDS, Sheehan Disability Scales; UN, unstructured","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18739,""
"Reduced physical activity and weight gain are associated with an increase of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic A general practitioners' prospective observational study","We aimed to assess associations between depressive symptoms, lifestyle, and somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective, observational study using a self-designed questionnaire. Three general practitioners' (GP) offices in rural Germany. 271 adult patients without manifest cardiovascular or pulmonary disease with (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°82) and without (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°189) hypertension reporting to our GP offices. The reported increase of depressive symptoms (loneliness, sleeplessness, joylessness, listlessness) prior to the first documented case in Germany on 27.01.2020 (t<sub>0</sub>) as opposed to patients' health perception during the Corona pandemic (t<sub>1</sub>) was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures were changes in physical activity (PA), dyspnea and angina in the two groups. Out of 271 patients (50.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.8 years, 55.1% females), 1.5% were tested positive for COVID-19. Overall, listlessness (8.5%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), sleeplessness (5.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and joylessness (4.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) were increased. Dyspnea significantly increased (9.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and employment status worsened (6.5%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There were significant associations between the increase of depressive symptoms, weight increase (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017), and reduction in physical activity (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.046). However, after adjusting for age, hypertensive patients did not show more depressive symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.704), dyspnea (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.063) or angina (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.432), nor was there any difference in PA (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.906) compared to healthy individuals. We demonstrate an association between the deterioration of depressive symptoms, weight gain, and reduced physical activity during COVID-19, both in hypertensives and healthy controls.

"Intolerance of Uncertainty, Looming Cognitive Style, and Avoidant Coping as Predictors of Anxiety and Depression During COVID-19: a Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased distress and uncertainty. Understanding the progression of mental health and factors underlying the perpetuation of distress during the pandemic is pivotal in informing interventions and public health messaging. This current study examined longitudinal effects of two cognitive vulnerabilities, looming cognitive style, and intolerance of uncertainty, as well as coping styles on anxiety and depression through online questionnaires at two time points in the pandemic, May 2020 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1520) and August 2020 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°545). Depression, but not anxiety, significantly increased across time, which was moderated by coping style. Serial mediation modeling using path analysis demonstrated a significant pathway illustrating increased looming cognitive style in the beginning of the pandemic leads to increased intolerance of uncertainty, avoidant coping, and anxiety later in the pandemic. Results suggest a novel model in conceptualizing anxiety during the pandemic, namely highlighting looming cognitive style as an underlying cognitive vulnerability factor and antecedent of intolerance of uncertainty and illuminating the temporal directionality between looming cognitive style and intolerance of uncertainty. These findings provide important implications regarding intervention and public health messaging with modifiable behavioral and cognitive factors to improve mental health during a pandemic.","Carnahan, Carter, Sbrocco","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41811-021-00123-9","20211011","Anxiety; Coping; Depression; Intolerance of uncertainty; Looming cognitive style","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18741,""

"Child wellbeing in the United Kingdom following the COVID-19 lockdowns","The COVID-19 pandemic led to huge changes to children's daily lives including school closures, loss of contact with family and friends, and financial difficulties which impacted on the wellbeing of all children. The Social Determinants of Health model gives us a framework to consider the impact of lockdown directly on children, and indirectly through the impact on parents, families, community and government policy as children cannot be considered in isolation to families or society. Children have suffered directly with lack of access to healthcare, and a decline in their mental health. Infant bonding may have been affected due to maternal stress, anxiety or depression, compounded by limited Health Visitor support. Poverty, food insecurity and lack of exercise contributed to increased obesity. Many children will have been exposed to domestic violence, parental mental illness and child abuse without being able to tell teachers or other adults outside of the home, these Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) increase the risk for subsequent health and behaviour problems. Children have spent many hours online for school learning and socialising with friends but faced risks of criminal exploitation and grooming. The long-term financial implications of COVID-19 will continue to impact on society for many years to come and further increase social inequalities.","Singh, Shah, Mbeledogu, Garstang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paed.2021.09.004","20211011","COVID-19; adverse childhood experiences; mental health; poverty; social inequality; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18743,""
"The Factor Structure and Rasch Analysis of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) Among Chinese Students","The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a new one-dimensional scale used to measure fear of an individual about the COVID-19.

The sample used for validation comprised 2,445 Chinese students. The psychometrical characteristics of the Chinese FCV-19S (FCV-19S-C) were tested using Rasch analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) proved the unidimensional structure of the model. Both infit and outfit mean square (MNSQ) values (0.69-1.31) and point-measure correlations (0.82-0.86) indicated a good model fit. Person-item separation and reliability values indicated good reliability of the scale. The person-item map revealed an acceptable level of match between the persons and the items. Differential item functioning of the FCV-19S-C showed no differences with respect to age or gender.

"Latent Profile of Internet and Internet Game Usage Among South Korean Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> Globally, more people are spending time on the Internet and gaming since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consequently, concerns about developing behavioral addiction of adolescents have been raised. Such risk could be greater for adolescents in South Korea where the majority of adolescents have access to the Internet and own a smartphone. In fact, statistics indicate that Korean youths are spending significantly more time on the Internet and gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies on the patterns of time spent on the Internet and Internet gaming show inconsistent results. The aim of this study is to investigate the latent profiles of the Internet and Internet game usage among adolescents in South Korea. <b>Method:</b> Data from a national survey on elementary and middle school students across South Korea were used. The sample consists of 3,149 respondents, and 2,984 responses were analyzed after removing missing responses. Latent profile analysis was performed to investigate the number of latent profiles for the Internet and Internet game usage time. To validate the profiles, differences in problematic gaming behavior, sex, and neuroticism were examined. <b>Results:</b> Seven profiles were found: Casual User, Moderate User, Smartphone User, Internet User, PC Internet Gamer, Heavy User, and Excessive User. Validation of the profiles indicated differences in problematic gaming behavior, sex, and neuroticism among selected profiles. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study presented different profiles of the Internet and Internet game usage among adolescents in South Korea. Profiles with higher game usage time scored higher in problematic game use compared to other profiles. Males were more likely to be in the profiles with high gaming time, and females were more likely to be in Internet and Smartphone User profiles. The results indicate that Internet and Internet gaming usage patterns could be classified by the type of device used and the content of the Internet.","Kim, Lee, Nam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.714301","20211011","Internet addiction; Internet gaming; South Korea; adolescents; mental health; sex","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18745,""

"Liver disease in the era of COVID-19: Is the worst yet to come?","The global social, economic and political crises related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presumably had more indirect than direct negative impacts on health systems. Drastic lifestyle changes, social isolation and distancing, and individual and global financial crises resulted in robust populations forfeiting healthy habits and seeking comfort in alcoholic beverages, drugs and unhealthy diets. The inevitable consequences are increases in the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis decompensation and ultimately liver-related mortality. The inaccessibility of regular clinical and sonographic monitoring systems has caused difficulties in the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and has prevented prompt hepatocellular carcinoma detection and treatment. A dramatic reduction in the number of liver donors and the transformation of numerous transplantation centers into COVID-19 units drastically decreased the rate of orthotopic liver transplantation. The indirect, unavoidable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the following years have yet to be determined. Substantial efforts in the management of patients with liver disease in order to overcome the inevitable COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality that will follow have yet to be initiated. Several questions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver disease remain. The most important question for general CLD patients is: How will the modification of clinical practice during this pandemic affect the outcomes of CLD patients?

"Cope with the COVID-19 pandemic: Dynamic bed allocation and patient subsidization in a public healthcare system","In many countries and territories, public hospitals play a major role in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. For public hospital managers, on the one hand, they must best utilize their hospital beds to serve the COVID-19 patients immediately. On the other hand, they need to consider the need of bed resources from non-COVID-19 patients, including emergency and elective patients. In this work, we consider two control mechanisms for public hospital managers to maximize the overall utility of patients. One is the dynamic allocation of bed resources according to the evolution process of the COVID-19 pandemic. The other is the usage of a subsidy scheme to move elective patients from the public to private hospitals. We develop a dynamic programming model to study the allocation of isolation and ordinary beds and the effect of the subsidy policy in serving three types of patients, COVID-19, emergency, and elective-care. We first show that the dynamic allocation between isolation and ordinary beds can provide a better utilization of bed resources, by cutting down at least 33.5% of the total cost compared with the static policy (i.e., keeping a fixed number of isolation beds) when facing a medium pandemic alert. Our results further show that subsidizing elective patients and referring them to private hospitals is an efficient way to ease the overcrowded situation in public hospitals. Our results demonstrate that, by dynamically conducting bed allocation and subsidy scheme in different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient overall utility can be greatly improved.","Ma, Zhao, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108320","20211011","Capacity planning; Dynamic allocation; Health care; Hospital beds; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18751,""
"Robotics and artificial intelligence in healthcare during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is unarguably the biggest catastrophe of the 21st century, probably the most significant global crisis after the second world war. The rapid spreading capability of the virus has compelled the world population to maintain strict preventive measures. The outrage of the virus has rampaged through the healthcare sector tremendously. This pandemic created a huge demand for necessary healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advanced robotics and artificial intelligence-based applications. The intelligent robot systems have great potential to render service in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, telehealthcare, disinfection, and several other operations during this pandemic which has helped reduce the workload of the frontline workers remarkably. The long-awaited vaccine discovery of this deadly virus has also been greatly accelerated with AI-empowered tools. In addition to that, many robotics and Robotics Process Automation platforms have substantially facilitated the distribution of the vaccine in many arrangements pertaining to it. These forefront technologies have also aided in giving comfort to the people dealing with less addressed mental health complicacies.

"A network analysis of adolescent mental well-being during the coronavirus pandemic: Evidence for cross-cultural differences in central features","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose unprecedented threat globally. Adolescents and youth may be especially susceptible to the long-term impact of these stressors, thus intervening early is an important priority. However, it is also crucial to understand how young people maintain psychological well-being in the face of adversity, particularly given that many nations are experiencing further waves of the pandemic. The understanding of such resilient outcomes could inform the development of programs to encourage positive mental health.We explored adolescents' resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic stress by examining core aspects of well-being across countries using network analysis. Using the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, cross-sectional data was collected online from adolescents from India (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯310; MalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯159, FemalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯151, aged 12-18), Israel (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯306; MalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯154, FemalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯152, aged 12-18) and the United Kingdom (UK; <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1666; MalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯598, FemalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1068, aged 12-25). Two highly similar network clusters were identified for UK and Israel, with three clusters emerging for India. UK and Israeli networks centred on ""dealing with problems well"" while Indian centred on ""feeling useful"". As central items highlight aspects of well-being that influence or are influenced by other aspects, these findings may inform interventions to safeguard adolescent mental health during future phases of the pandemic.","Shukla, Wu, Lavi, Riddleston, Hutchinson, Lau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111316","20211011","COVID-19; Cross-cultural; Network analysis; Resilience; Well-being; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18753,""
"Italians do it Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ less COVID-19 lockdown impact on sexual activity: Evidence from a large representative sample of Italian adults","To explore how sexual activity was impacted by COVID-19 lockdown measures in the general adult population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 6,003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years, representative of the Italian general population. Study subjects were recruited at the time of the Nation-wide stay-at-home order (from April 27 to May 3, 2020). We identified characteristics associated to decreased frequency of sex during lockdown, differentiating between cohabiting and non-cohabiting subjects. Over one third (35.3%) of Italians reported to have changed (8.4% increased and 26.9% decreased) their sexual activity during lockdown. When focusing on cohabitants (N=3,949, 65.8%), decreased sexual activity (20.7%) was more frequently reported by men (22.3%; compared to women, multivariable odds ratio=1.23; 95% confidence interval=1.05-1.44), younger (p for trend &lt;0.001), more educated subjects (p for trend=0.004), subjects living in smaller houses (p for trend=0.003), and those reporting longer time spent outdoor before the lockdown (p for trend &lt;0.001). COVID-19 lockdown drastically altered people's day-to-day life and is likely to have impacted on lifestyle habits and behavioral risk factors, including sexual attitudes and practice. This is the first national population-level study exploring changes in sexual life in this COVID-19 era. As we report sexual practice to have been affected by lockdown restrictions, we suggest these changes are to be explored beyond imposed social distancing, into mental health, social, and other determinants.","Amerio, Lugo, Bosetti, Fanucchi, Gorini, Pacifici, Odone, Gallus","https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.JE20210055","20211011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18754,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among patients with epilepsy or other chronic conditions","To investigate the opinions of different groups of people in Iran on their willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed a sample (based on consecutive referrals) of five groups of people in late 2020: a group of the general population from Shiraz (without a history of any chronic medical or psychiatric problems), patients with epilepsy, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), patients with cardiac problems, and patients with psychiatric problems. The survey included four general questions and three COVID-19 specific questions. 582 people participated. In Total, 66 (11.3%) people expressed that they were not willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Psychiatric disorders (OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.31-7.60; p = 0.006) and male sex (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.23-3.58; p = 0.010) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is a global issue. Patients with psychiatric disorders had the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy. Previous studies have shown that depression and anxiety are associated with a reduced adherence to the recommended medical advices. Why male sex is associated with vaccine hesitancy is not clear. Researchers should investigate the rates and the factors affecting the vaccine hesitancy in their corresponding communities.","Asadi-Pooya, Barzegar, Sadeghian, Nezafat, Shahisavandi, Nabavizadeh","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.311","20211011","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Epilepsy; Hesitancy; Vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18755,""

"Pilot Wellness Program With Adapted Social-Emotional Learning and COVID-19 Curriculum for Refugee Youth","Refugee children are less likely than their non-refugee peers to receive timely diagnoses and treatment for mental and/or behavioral health problems, despite facing multiple risk factors including potential exposure to trauma during premigration, migration, and postmigration experiences. Social-Emotional Learning offers preventive mental health education for children through well-established, evidenced-based curricula. Although there are clear benefits of Social-Emotional Learning curricula, which can help children achieve long-term success emotionally and academically, Social-Emotional Learning curricula are not easily accessible for refugee children, often because of language and socioeconomic barriers. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted Social-Emotional Learning program that included culturally specific, multilingual, trauma-informed wellness, and physical education during the COVID-19 pandemic: EMPOWER (Emotions Program Outside the Clinic With Wellness Education for Refugees). We used the Intervention Mapping framework which guided the (1) planning, (2) program development, and (3) mixed-method evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the EMPOWER pilot. We found that this adaptation was well-received by Afghan refugee families and that COVID-19 safety measures were well-understood after participation. Challenges emerged around videoconferencing connectivity and around finding a common language for discussing emotions. Future iterations of the program and evaluations will require continued partnerships with community members and organizations. As we continue and expand EMPOWER, we aim to evaluate short-term improvement in Social-Emotional Learning competence as well as long-term mental and behavioral health outcomes for children and their families.","Rosenberg, McDonough Ryan, O'Brien, Ganjavi, Sharifi","https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981211048830","20211011","COVID-19; SocialÃ¢â‚¬â€œEmotional Learning; community-based participatory research; mental health; refugee","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18757,""

"What are the long-term symptoms and complications of COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review","Although the majority of people with Covid-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and will recover fully, there is now increasing evidence that a significant proportion will experience persistent symptoms for months after the acute phase of the illness. These symptoms include, among others, fatigue, problems breathing, lack of smell and taste, headaches, and depression and anxiety. It is also clear the virus has lasting fluctuating multiorgan sequelae, including affecting not only the respiratory system but also the heart, liver, and nervous system. We present a protocol for a livingÃ‚Â systematic review that aims to synthesize the evidence on the prevalence and characteristics of post-acute COVID-19. The living systematic review will be updated regularly, approximately every 6 months, as new evidence emerges. We will include studies that follow up at least 100 people with Covid-19 at 12 or more weeks post Covid-19 onset, with no restrictions regarding country, setting, or language. We will use descriptive statistics and, for outcomes reported in two or more studies, we will use meta-analyses to estimate prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the exact method. Heterogeneity between estimates will be assessed using the I2 statistic. Our findings will also be presented as infographics to facilitate transcription to lay audiences. Ultimately, we aim to support the work of policy makers, practitioners, and patients when planning rehabilitation for those recovering from Covid-19.

"Playing remotely in times of crisis: a program to overcome social isolation","This study aims to examine the feasibility of an intergenerational remote intervention program designed to promote the well being and social connection of vulnerable older adults, mainly people with aphasia and dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic in the south of Brazil. Undergraduate students were guided to lead weekly sessions of clowning, storytelling, dancing, and cooking-related activities for 3 months (from November/2020 to February/2021). The mixed-method design of the study addresses the implementation and feasibility of the program. Data analysis considered both quantitative - number of individuals who accepted the invitation to participate, voluntary dropouts, attendance - and qualitative data - participative observation and thematic analysis of evaluative conversations. An inclusive group of thirty-four older adults with stroke-induced cognitive impairments, dementia and individuals without any neurological conditions enrolled in the program based on social and racial equity principles. Feasibility and acceptability were addressed in terms of recruitment, implementation, remote evaluation, delivery of remote intervention, adherence, and attendance. Activities and participants' perceptions are described. The initial period of the program achieved 83,7% of adherence and sustainability for additional three months. Preliminary results suggest feasibility and acceptability, considering formal and informal support in digital inclusion. Participatory observations describe that the structure of sessions and activities were well received. The analysis of participants' perceptions detects the thematic saliency feelings of social connection and a sense of having learned with the group. Preliminary results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the program, pointing to its potential mental health benefits. This article is protected by copyright.

"Metformin to decrease COVID-19 severity and mortality: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a serious challenge for medicine and science. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms associated with the clinical manifestations and severity of COVID-19 has identified several key points of immune dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For diabetic patients, factors including higher binding affinity and virus penetration, decreased virus clearance and decreased T cell function, increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation, and cytokine storm may make these patients susceptible to a more severe course of COVID-19 disease. Metabolic changes induced by diabetes, especially hyperglycemia, can directly affect the immunometabolism of lymphocytes in part by affecting the activity of the mTOR protein kinase signaling pathway. High mTOR activity can enhance the progression of diabetes due to the activation of effector proinflammatory subpopulations of lymphocytes and, conversely, low activity promotes the differentiation of T-regulatory cells. Interestingly, metformin, an extensively used antidiabetic drug, inhibits mTOR by affecting the activity of AMPK. Therefore, activation of AMPK and/or inhibition of the mTOR-mediated signaling pathway may be an important new target for drug therapy in COVID-19 cases mostly by reducing the level of pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine storm. These suggestions have been partially confirmed by several retrospective analyzes of patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized for severe COVID-19.","Kamyshnyi, Matskevych, Lenchuk, Strilbytska, Storey, Lushchak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112230","20211010","COVID-19; Immunometabolism; Lymphocytes; Metformin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18761,""

"Physical, cognitive, and mental health impacts of COVID-19 after hospitalisation (PHOSP-COVID): a UK multicentre, prospective cohort study","The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes. The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 5Ã‚Â·9 months (IQR 4Ã‚Â·9-6Ã‚Â·5) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40-59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity. We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.

"Generalized anxiety disorder and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from China during the early rapid outbreak","Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common but urgent mental health problem during disease outbreaks. Resilience buffers against the negative impacts of life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology such as GAD. This study assesses the prevalence of GAD and examines the protective or compensatory effect of resilience against worry factors during the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Chinese citizens aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years from January 31 to February 2, 2020. A total of 4827 participants across 31 provinces and autonomous regions of the mainland of China participated in this study. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and a self-designed worry questionnaire were used to asses anxiety disorder prevalence, resilience level, and anxiety risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associations of resilience and worry factors with GAD prevalence after controlling for other covariates. The prevalence of anxiety disorder was 22.6% across the 31 areas, and the highest prevalence was 35.4% in Hubei province. After controlling for covariates, the results suggested a higher GAD prevalence among participants who were worried about themselves or family members being infected with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 3.40, 95%CI 2.43-4.75), worried about difficulty obtaining masks (AOR 1.92, 95%CI 1.47-2.50), worried about difficulty of distinguishing true information (AOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.36-2.02), worried about the prognosis of COVID-19 (AOR 2.41, 95%CI 1.75-3.33), worried about delays in working (AOR 1.71, 95%CI 1.27-.31), or worried about decreased income (AOR 1.45, 95%CI 1.14-1.85) compared with those without such worries. Additionally, those with a higher resilience level had a lower prevalence of GAD (AOR 0.59, 95%CI 0.51-0.70). Resilience also showed a mediating effect, with a negative influence on worry factors and thereby a negative association with GAD prevalence. It may be beneficial to promote public mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak through enhancing resilience, which may buffer against adverse psychological effects from worry factors.","Chen, Gao, Dai, Mao, Wang, Chen, Xiao, Jia, Zheng, Fu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11877-4","20211010","COVID-19 pandemic; Generalized anxiety disorder; Resilience; Worry factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18765,""
"The effect of COVID-19 public health restrictions on the health of people with musculoskeletal conditions and symptoms: the CONTAIN study","To quantify the change in quality of life, disease-specific indicators, health and lifestyle before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with musculoskeletal diagnoses and symptoms. We undertook an additional follow-up of two existing UK registers involving people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and participants in a trial in the UK who had regional pain and were identified at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. Participants completed the study questionnaire between July and December 2020, throughout which time there were public health restrictions in place. The number of people taking part in the study was 1054 (596 axSpA, 162 PsA, 296 regional pain). In comparison with their previous (pre-pandemic) assessment, there was an age-adjusted significant, small decrease in quality of life measured by EQ-5D [-0.020 (95% CI -0.030, -0.009)] overall and across all population groups examined. This was primarily related to poorer mental health and pain. There was a small increase in fibromyalgia symptoms, but a small decrease in sleep problems. There was a small deterioration in axSpA disease activity, and disease-specific quality of life and anxiety in PsA participants. Predictors of poor quality of life were similar pre- and during the pandemic. The effect of lockdown on activity differed according to age, gender and deprivation. Important lessons include focusing on addressing anxiety and providing enhanced support for self-management in the absence of normal health care being available, and awareness that all population groups are likely to be affected.","Macfarlane, Hollick, Morton, Heddle, Bachmair, Anderson, Whibley, Keenan, Murchie, Stelfox, Beasley, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab374","20211011","COVID-19; axial spondyloarthritis; pain; psoriatic arthritis; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-12","",18766,""
