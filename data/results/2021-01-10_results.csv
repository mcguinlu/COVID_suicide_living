"A Novel Artificial Intelligence-Powered Emotional Intelligence and Mindfulness App (Ajivar) for the College Student Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. METHODS: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college student population.","Sturgill, Ronda; Martinasek, Mary; Schmidt, Trine; Goyal, Raj","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25372","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(1): e25372, 2021 Jan 05.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(1): e25372, 2021 Jan 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9146,""
"Time Trends of the Public's Attention Toward Suicide During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective, Longitudinal Time-Series Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems around the world. Emerging evidence has suggested that substantially few patients seek help for suicidality at clinical settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has elicited concerns of an imminent mental health crisis as the course of the pandemic continues to unfold. Clarifying the relationship between the public's attention to knowledge about suicide and the public's attention to knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic may provide insight into developing prevention strategies for a putative surge of suicide in relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective, longitudinal time-series study is to understand the relationship between temporal trends of interest for the search term ""suicide"" and those of COVID-19-related terms, such as ""social distancing,"" ""school closure,"" and ""lockdown."" METHODS: We used the Google Trends platform to collect data on daily interest levels for search terms related to suicide, several other mental health-related issues, and COVID-19 over the period between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. A correlational analysis was performed to determine the association between the search term ''suicide'' and COVID-19-related search terms in 16 countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between interest levels for the search term ""suicide"" before and after school closure. RESULTS: We found that interest levels for the search term ""suicide"" statistically significantly inversely correlated with interest levels for the search terms ""COVID-19"" or ""coronavirus"" in nearly all countries between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. Additionally, search interest for the term ''suicide'' significantly and negatively correlated with that of many COVID-19-related search terms, and search interest varied between countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between search interest levels for the term ""suicide"" before and after school closure. The Netherlands (P=.19), New Zealand (P=.003), the United Kingdom (P=.006), and the United States (P=.049) showed significant negative trends in interest levels for suicide in the 2-week period preceding school closures. In contrast, interest levels for suicide had a significant positive trend in Canada (P<.001) and the United States (P=.002) after school closures. CONCLUSIONS: The public's attention to suicide might inversely correlate with the public's attention to COVID-19-related issues. Additionally, several anticontagion policies, such as school closure, might have led to a turning point for mental health crises, because the attention to suicidality increased after restrictions were implemented. Our results suggest that an increased risk of suicidal ideation may ensue due to the ongoing anticontagion policies. Timely intervention strategies for suicides should therefore be an integral part of efforts to flatten the epidemic curve.","Burnett, Dayle; Eapen, Valsamma; Lin, Ping-I","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24694","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(4): e24694, 2020 12 30.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(4): e24694, 2020 12 30.; Attention; Public Opinion; Search Engine/trends; Suicide/psychology; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9147,""

"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lived Experience of Diverse Older Adults Living Alone With Cognitive Impairment","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults with cognitive impairment living alone (an estimated 4.3 million individuals in the United States) were at high risk for negative health outcomes. There is an urgent need to learn how this population is managing during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a qualitative study of 24 adults aged 55 and older living alone with cognitive impairment from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Participants' lived experiences during the pandemic were elicited via 59 ethnographic interviews conducted over the phone either in English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify codes and themes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of transcripts revealed 5 themes: (a) fear generated by the pandemic, (b) distress stemming from feeling extremely isolated, (c) belief in misinformation, (d) strategies for coping during the pandemic, and (e) the importance of access to essential services. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This pandemic put a spotlight on the precarity and unmet needs of older adults living alone with cognitive impairment. Findings underscore the need to expand access to home care aides and mental health services for this population.","Portacolone, Elena; Chodos, Anna; Halpern, Jodi; Covinsky, Kenneth E; Keiser, Sahru; Fung, Jennifer; Rivera, Elizabeth; Tran, Thi; Bykhovsky, Camilla; Johnson, Julene K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa201","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gerontologist;2021 Jan 06.; Publication details: Gerontologist;2021 Jan 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9149,""
"HIV and COVID-19: Intersecting Epidemics With Many Unknowns","As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question. Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar, but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a ""risk factor"" for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, and mental health disorders, as well as other structural vulnerabilities, which might increase their risk of COVID-19. In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions affect secondary health outcomes and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e.g., telemedicine).","Lesko, Catherine R; Bengtson, Angela M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa158","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Epidemiol;190(1): 10-16, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication details: Am J Epidemiol;190(1): 10-16, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9150,""
"Repurposing of CNS drugs to treat COVID-19 infection: targeting the sigma-1 receptor","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The escalating number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals has conferred the viral spread with the status of global pandemic. However, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic drugs available on the market to treat COVID-19, although several drugs have been approved. Recently, two articles using the comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction map revealed that the sigma-1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Knockout and knockdown of SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor, encoded by SIGMAR1) caused robust reductions in SARS-CoV-2 replication, which indicates that the sigma-1 receptor is a key therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor, could prevent clinical deterioration in adult outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the brief history of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Here, we propose repurposing of traditional central nervous system (CNS) drugs that have a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor (i.e., fluvoxamine, donepezil, ifenprodil) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Finally, we discussed the potential of other CNS candidates such as cutamesine and arketamine.","Hashimoto, Kenji","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01231-x","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci;2021 Jan 05.; Publication details: Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci;2021 Jan 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9151,""
"Anxiety, depression, and stress in response to the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic","Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the state of anxiety, depression, and stress present in the society during the development of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Methods: Mixed methods study; a three-section questionnaire was developed which included sociodemographic, perceptions, emotions, and behaviors related to the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, and two emotional assessment psychometric tests. The proportions and confidence intervals of the variables were calculated and compared using the Chi-square test. Results: More than 40% of the subjects presented some degree of anxiety and 41.3% depression; the proportion of stress was < 30%. Of the subjects who experienced anxiety, 18.6% also had moderate-to-very severe depression or stress. Conclusion: There are emotional indicators derived from the 2019 coronavirus pandemic in almost half of the study population. The identification and timely treatment of these states could lessen the psychological impact due to 2019 coronavirus.","PÃ©rez-Cano, HÃ©ctor J; Moreno-MurguÃ­a, Madeleine B; Morales-LÃ³pez, Oscar; Crow-Buchanan, Olliever; English, Jane A; Lozano-AlcÃ¡zar, Jaime; Somilleda-Ventura, Selma A","https://dx.doi.org/10.24875/CIRU.20000561","","Country: MX; MÃ‰XICO; MEXICO; MEXICO; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cir Cir;88(5): 562-568, 2020.; Publication details: Cir Cir;88(5): 562-568, 2020.; Anxiety/etiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Depression/etiology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Stress, Psychological/etiology; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology; Anxiety Disorders/etiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Depressive Disorder/epidemiology; Depressive Disorder/etiology; Emotions; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Psychometrics; Risk-Taking; Severity of Illness Index; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9152,""

Here we report pilot data collected shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 using two online surveys, combined with a conservation intervention experiment, primarily on people who are receiving or have received higher education in China  We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13, 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats  Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats  Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats  The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants  Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19  A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoplesâ€™ knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly  We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings  This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China  A better understanding of the relationship between disease, wildlife and human health could help guide the public and policymakers in an improved program for bat conservation","Lu, Manman, Wang, Xindong, Ye, Huan, Wang, Huimin, Qiu, Shan, Zhang, Hongmao, Liu, Ying, Luo, Jinhong, Feng, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Biological Conservation;: 108952, 2021.; Publication details: Biological Conservation;: 108952, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9181,""

Multilevel regression models were fitted with individual, household, and state-level covariates, in addition to state and census-region-level random effects. Living in state with the highest quartile of small business closures was associated with increased prevalence of GAD (OR: 1.06; CI: 1.03-1.11) compared to lowest quartile, but had no association with MDD. Living in the highest quartile of urban mobility was associated with lower prevalence of both GAD (OR: 0.88; CI: 0.85-0.93) and MDD (OR: 0.90; CI: 0.86-0.95) relative to the lowest quartile.

"Psychological reactions and insomnia in adults with mental health disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disrupted millions of lives and commerce. We investigated psychological reactions and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak in adults with mental health disorders (MDs). A self-reported psychological and sleep online survey was conducted in China between February 5th to 19th, 2020. A total of 244 adults with MDs and 1116 controls matched for age, gender and sites were included. Worsened symptoms of anxiety, depressive and insomnia were defined when severity levels shifted to a more severe category compared to pre-COVID-19. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found significantly increased prevalence of anxiety (MDs: 54.9% vs. 49.6%, controls: 25.5% vs. 14.3%), depression (MDs: 63.9% vs. 61.5%, controls: 29.9% vs. 21.2%) and insomnia (MDs: 66.0% vs. 57.8%, controls: 31.5% vs. 24.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 period (all P-value &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Furthermore, adults with MDs had higher odds for developing COVID-19-related stress (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.41, 95% CI 2.49Ã¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.67), worsened anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.95, 95% CI 1.38Ã¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.76), depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.04, 95% CI 1.43Ã¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.93) and insomnia (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.22, 95% CI 1.53Ã¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.21) during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to controls. Moreover, higher COVID-19-related stress and lower levels of pre-COVID-19 anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms were predictors for worsened anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults with MDs, respectively.

"Psychological distress among Italians during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine","Quarantine as a preventive action to reduce people's exposure to a contagious disease has substantial psychological impact. We aimed to collect information on psychologically distressing experiences of Italians living in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 6 to 20 April 2020 participants filled out an online questionnaire. Demographic and physical symptoms data from the prior 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of quarantine were collected. Psychological impact of quarantine was assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). In all, 20,158 participants completed the online survey. Of these, 11,910 (59.1%) were from Lombardy, the region with 37.7% of positive cases identified during the survey period. 30.1% of responders were male. About half (55.9%) of responders were 18-50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, 54.3% had a tertiary level of education, 69.5% were workers, 84.1% were living in houses with Ã¢â€°Â¥3 rooms, and 13.7% were living alone. 9.7% had had contact with COVID-19 positive people. Of all responders, 9978 (48.6%) reported a psychological impact, 8897 (43.4%) of whom reported mild or moderate and 1081 (5.2%) severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis, after adjustments, showed that an increasing CPDI score was associated with gender (female), first-second educational level, being unemployed, living in a Ã¢â€°Â¤2 room house, having had new health problems during the previous 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, and not having been out of the house in the previous week. Concerning the type of psychological distress, 2003 responders (9.9%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 1131 (5.5%) moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 802 (3.9%) moderate to severe physical symptoms. A positive correlation was found between responder rate (per 10.000 residents) and positive COVID-19 cases (per 10.000 residents) by region (r<sub>s</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.83, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), and between responder rate and region latitude (r<sub>s</sub> = +Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.91, p = &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), with a greater response rate in the north. Considering Lombardy Region responders, a negative correlation between CPDI score and distance from place of residence to the red zone (Nembro-Alzano) was found. Higher prevalence of psychological distress was found up to 25Ã¢â‚¬â€°km away from the red zone and, in particular, severe distress up to 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°km. Policy makers and mental health professionals should be aware of quarantine's adverse mental health consequences. Factors influencing the success of quarantine and infection control practices for both disease containment and community recovery should be identified and additional support to vulnerable persons at increased risk of adverse psychological and social consequences of quarantine should be guaranteed.","Bonati, Campi, Zanetti, Cartabia, Scarpellini, Clavenna, Segre","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03027-8","20210109","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Infectious diseases; Knowledge; Online surveys; Outbreak; Pandemic; Perceptions; Public health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9197,""
"Ethical Implications of COVID-19: Palliative Care, Public Health, and Long-Term Care Facilities","Outbreaks of COVID-19 among nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care facilities in the United States have had devastating effects on residents. Restrictions such as banning visitors, sequestering residents, and testing health care staff have been implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, consequences include a decline in mental and physical health, decompensation, and a sense of hopelessness among residents. We present and explore a case study at an assisted living facility addressing the ethical issues in balancing the management of the community versus the resident's right to autonomy and self-determination. A team of palliative care experts was brought into assisted living facilities to manage patients, care for well residents, and provide input in advance care planning and symptom management. The principles of self-determination and autonomy, stewardship, and distributive justice were explored. The use of nursing skills in triage and assessment, principles in public health, and the 8 domains of palliative care provided a comprehensive framework for structuring emergency operations. Palliative interventions and the role of palliative care nurses played an integral part in addressing ethical challenges in the containment of the virus and the deleterious effects of social isolation among the elderly.","Parekh de Campos, Daniels","https://doi.org/10.1097/NJH.0000000000000735","20210108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9198,""
"Mental Illness, Mass Shootings, and the Future of Psychiatric Research into American Gun Violence","This article outlines a four-part strategy for future research in mental health and complementary disciplines that will broaden understanding of mass shootings and multi-victim gun homicides. First, researchers must abandon the starting assumption that acts of mass violence are driven primarily by diagnosable psychopathology in isolated &quot;lone wolf&quot; individuals. The destructive motivations must be situated, instead, within larger social structures and cultural scripts. Second, mental health professionals and scholars must carefully scrutinize any apparent correlation of violence with mental illness for evidence of racial bias in the official systems that define, measure, and record psychiatric diagnoses, as well as those that enforce laws and impose criminal justice sanctions. Third, to better understand the role of firearm access in the occurrence and lethality of mass shootings, research should be guided by an overarching framework that incorporates social, cultural, legal, and political, but also psychological, aspects of private gun ownership in the United States. Fourth, effective policies and interventions to reduce the incidence of mass shootings over time-and to prevent serious acts of violence more generally-will require an expanded body of well-funded interdisciplinary research that is informed and implemented through the sustained engagement of researchers with affected communities and other stakeholders in gun violence prevention. Emerging evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has produced a sharp increase both in civilian gun sales and in the social and psychological determinants of injurious behavior adds special urgency to this agenda.","Metzl, Piemonte, McKay","https://doi.org/10.1097/HRP.0000000000000280","20210108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9199,""

"Maintaining normal sleep patterns, lifestyles and emotion during the COVID-19 pandemic: The stabilizing effect of daytime napping","This study aimed to assess changes in sleep pattern and their influence on people's daily life and emotion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-developed questionnaires were used to measure changes in nocturnal sleep, daytime napping, lifestyles and negative emotions in individuals before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine hundred and thirty effective questionnaires were collected in this study. Repeated measures analysis of variance and hierarchical regression analysis were applied. We found that individuals' sleep rhythms were delayed, and sleep duration and sleep latency were increased during the stay-at-home orders. Meanwhile, their exercise levels and learning/working efficiency were decreased, and electronic device use time, annoyance levels and anxiety levels were increased. Delayed sleep patterns affected lifestyles and emotions. Moreover, sleep quality positively predicted learning/working efficiency and exercise levels, and negatively predicted use of electronic devices and negative emotions. Sleep patterns became delayed on weekdays during stay-at-home orders in all four daytime napping groups (no daytime napping, daytime napping as before, more daytime napping and less daytime napping), and the group taking daytime naps as before had a minimal variation, and their lifestyles and emotions were significantly better than those of the other groups. This study demonstrated that under the influence of stress caused by the pandemic, maintaining regular daytime napping was an effective way to stabilize sleep patterns and biological rhythms, keep good lifestyles and alleviate the effect of acute psychological stress, and to prevent and control mental disorders during the pandemic.","Dai, Zhou, Li, Zhang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13259","20210108","COVID-19; mental health; napping; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9201,""
"Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia","Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings. Muchas personas con demencia son atendidas en casa por cuidadores informales no remunerados, generalmente miembros de la familia. Los cuidadores pueden sufrir una serie de efectos perjudiciales fÃƒÂ­sicos, emocionales, econÃƒÂ³micos y sociales, que a menudo se describen colectivamente como una carga para el cuidador. El grado de carga que se experimenta estÃƒÂ¡ asociado con las caracterÃƒÂ­sticas del cuidador, como el gÃƒÂ©nero, y con las caracterÃƒÂ­sticas de la persona con demencia, como la etapa de la demencia, y la presencia de problemas de comportamiento o trastornos neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos. Es un fuerte predictor del ingreso en una residencia para personas con demencia. Las intervenciones psicoeducativas pueden prevenir o reducir la carga del cuidador. En general, tienen como objetivo mejorar los conocimientos de los cuidadores sobre la enfermedad y su cuidado; aumentar el sentido de competencia de los cuidadores y su capacidad para afrontar situaciones difÃƒÂ­ciles; aliviar los sentimientos de aislamiento y permitir que los cuidadores atiendan sus propias necesidades emocionales y fÃƒÂ­sicas. Estas intervenciones son heterogÃƒÂ©neas y varÃƒÂ­an en su marco teÃƒÂ³rico, sus componentes y sus formatos de administraciÃƒÂ³n. Las intervenciones que se realizan a distancia, utilizando material impreso, el telÃƒÂ©fono o las tecnologÃƒÂ­as de vÃƒÂ­deo, pueden ser particularmente adecuadas para los cuidadores que tienen dificultades para acceder a los servicios de forma presencial debido a sus propios problemas de salud, al escaso acceso al transporte o a la falta de un cuidado alternativo. Durante la pandemia de covidÃ¢â‚¬Â19, las medidas de contenciÃƒÂ³n en muchos paÃƒÂ­ses exigÃƒÂ­an que las personas estuvieran aisladas en sus hogares, incluidas las personas con demencia y sus familiares cuidadores. En tales circunstancias, no hay alternativa a la realizaciÃƒÂ³n de intervenciones a distancia. Evaluar la eficacia y la aceptabilidad de las intervenciones realizadas a distancia con el fin de reducir la carga y mejorar el estado de ÃƒÂ¡nimo y la calidad de vida de los cuidadores informales de personas con demencia. MÃƒâ€°TODOS DE BÃƒÅ¡SQUEDA: El 10 de abril de 2020 se realizaron bÃƒÂºsquedas en el Registro especializado del Grupo Cochrane de Demencia y trastornos cognitivos (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE, Embase y otras cuatro bases de datos, asÃƒÂ­ como en dos registros internacionales de ensayos. TambiÃƒÂ©n se examinaron las bibliografÃƒÂ­as de documentos de revisiÃƒÂ³n pertinentes y de ensayos publicados. CRITERIOS DE SELECCIÃƒâ€œN: SÃƒÂ³lo se incluyeron los ensayos controlados aleatorizados que evaluaron la administraciÃƒÂ³n a distancia de intervenciones estructuradas para los cuidadores informales que atendÃƒÂ­an a personas con demencia que vivÃƒÂ­an en el domicilio. Los cuidadores debÃƒÂ­an ser adultos no remunerados (parientes o miembros de la comunidad de la persona). Las intervenciones se podÃƒÂ­an realizar utilizando materiales impresos, el telÃƒÂ©fono, la internet o una mezcla de estos, pero no podÃƒÂ­an implicar un contacto presencial con profesionales. Los componentes de la intervenciÃƒÂ³n se clasificaron como informaciÃƒÂ³n, formaciÃƒÂ³n o apoyo. Las intervenciones de informaciÃƒÂ³n incluyeron dos elementos clave: i) proporcionaron informaciÃƒÂ³n estandarizada, y ii) el cuidador desempeÃƒÂ±aba un papel pasivo. Las intervenciones de apoyo promovieron la interacciÃƒÂ³n con otras personas (profesionales o iguales). Las intervenciones de formaciÃƒÂ³n entrenaron a los cuidadores en habilidades prÃƒÂ¡cticas para proporcionar la atenciÃƒÂ³n. Se excluyeron las intervenciones que consistieron principalmente en psicoterapia individual. Los desenlaces principales fueron la carga del cuidador, el estado de ÃƒÂ¡nimo, la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud y el abandono por cualquier motivo. Los desenlaces secundarios fueron los conocimientos y aptitudes de los cuidadores, la utilizaciÃƒÂ³n de los recursos de atenciÃƒÂ³n sanitaria y social, el ingreso de la persona con demencia en una instituciÃƒÂ³n y la calidad de vida de la persona con demencia. OBTENCIÃƒâ€œN Y ANÃƒÂLISIS DE LOS DATOS: Dos autores de la revisiÃƒÂ³n realizaron de forma independiente la selecciÃƒÂ³n de los estudios, la extracciÃƒÂ³n de los datos y la evaluaciÃƒÂ³n del riesgo de sesgo de los estudios incluidos. Se utilizÃƒÂ³ la Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) para describir las intervenciones. Los metanÃƒÂ¡lisis se realizaron mediante un modelo de efectos aleatorios para obtener las estimaciones del tamaÃƒÂ±o del efecto. Se utilizaron los mÃƒÂ©todos GRADE para describir el grado de certeza sobre las estimaciones del efecto. En esta revisiÃƒÂ³n se incluyeron 26 estudios (2367 participantes). Se compararon (1) las intervenciones que incluyeron formaciÃƒÂ³n, apoyo o ambos, con o sin informaciÃƒÂ³n (intervenciones experimentales) con el tratamiento habitual, una lista de espera o el control de la atenciÃƒÂ³n (12 estudios, 944 participantes); y (2) las mismas intervenciones experimentales con el suministro de informaciÃƒÂ³n solamente (14 estudios, 1423 participantes). La calidad de la evidencia se redujo por las limitaciones de los estudios y, en el caso de algunos desenlaces, por la falta de consistencia entre los estudios. Hubo un riesgo frecuente de sesgo debido a la autocalificaciÃƒÂ³n de los desenlaces subjetivos por parte de participantes que no estaban cegados a la intervenciÃƒÂ³n. Los mÃƒÂ©todos de asignaciÃƒÂ³n al azar no siempre se informaron bien y hubo un posible sesgo de desgaste en algunos estudios. Por lo tanto, toda la evidencia fue de certeza moderada o baja. En la comparaciÃƒÂ³n de las intervenciones experimentales con el tratamiento habitual, una lista de espera o el control de la atenciÃƒÂ³n, se encontrÃƒÂ³ que las intervenciones experimentales probablemente tienen poco o ningÃƒÂºn efecto sobre la carga del cuidador (nueve estudios, 597 participantes; diferencia de medias estandarizada [DME] Ã¢â‚¬Â0,06; intervalo de confianza [IC] del 95%: Ã¢â‚¬Â0,35 a 0,23); los sÃƒÂ­ntomas depresivos (ocho estudios, 638 participantes; DME Ã¢â‚¬Â0,05; IC del 95%: Ã¢â‚¬Â0,22 a 0,12) o la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud (dos estudios, 311 participantes; DME 0,10; IC del 95%: Ã¢â‚¬Â0,13 a 0,32). Las intervenciones experimentales probablemente dan lugar a poca o ninguna diferencia en el abandono por cualquier motivo (ocho estudios, 661 participantes; razÃƒÂ³n de riesgos [RR] 1,15; IC del 95%: 0,87 a 1,53). En la comparaciÃƒÂ³n de las intervenciones experimentales con una condiciÃƒÂ³n control de informaciÃƒÂ³n sola, se encontrÃƒÂ³ que las intervenciones experimentales pueden dar lugar a una leve reducciÃƒÂ³n de la carga del cuidador (nueve estudios, 650 participantes; DME Ã¢â‚¬Â0,24; IC del 95%: Ã¢â‚¬Â0,51 a 0,04); probablemente dan lugar a una leve mejorÃƒÂ­a de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas depresivos (11 estudios, 1100 participantes; DME Ã¢â‚¬Â0,25; IC del 95%: Ã¢â‚¬Â0,43 a Ã¢â‚¬Â0,06); podrÃƒÂ­an dar lugar a poca o ninguna diferencia en la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud de los cuidadores (dos estudios, 257 participantes; DME Ã¢â‚¬Â0,03; IC del 95%: Ã¢â‚¬Â0,28 a 0,21); y probablemente dÃƒÂ© lugar a un aumento de los abandonos por cualquier motivo (12 estudios, 1266 participantes; RR 1,51; IC del 95%: 1,04 a 2,20). Las intervenciones realizadas a distancia, como el apoyo, la formaciÃƒÂ³n o ambas, con o sin informaciÃƒÂ³n, podrÃƒÂ­an reducir ligeramente la carga del cuidador y mejorar los sÃƒÂ­ntomas depresivos del cuidador en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con el suministro de informaciÃƒÂ³n ÃƒÂºnicamente, pero no en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con el tratamiento habitual, una lista de espera o el control de la atenciÃƒÂ³n. Parecen dar lugar a poca o ninguna diferencia en la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud. Los cuidadores que recibieron formaciÃƒÂ³n o apoyo tuvieron mÃƒÂ¡s probabilidades de abandonar los estudios que los que recibieron sÃƒÂ³lo informaciÃƒÂ³n, lo que podrÃƒÂ­a limitar la aplicabilidad. La eficacia de esas intervenciones puede depender de la naturaleza y la disponibilidad de los servicios habituales en los ÃƒÂ¡mbitos de estudio.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Fraile, Ballesteros, Rueda, Santos-ZorrozÃƒÂºa, SolÃƒÂ , McCleery","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006440.pub3","20210108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9202,""
"Fighting Words in the Antipodes","In this commentary, written in two bursts-the first completed in April 2020, and the second at the end of July-we explore how media metaphors of COVID-19 constitute the pandemic in Australia and New Zealand. We argue that the media's rhetorical strategies play an important role not only in describing the illness, but in influencing and shaping individual and collective responses to the pandemic, with significant consequences for mental health and well-being in the context of crisis. We align this commentary with the tenets of the sociology of diagnosis, which argue that even though there are material realities of disease, their social form and consequence cannot be separated from the tangible nature of illness and its management. We also lean on Derrida's approach to metaphor, which underlines how even observable viral entities such as COVID-19 are simultaneously material, abstract, and in flux. We describe the metaphors used by local media to describe the pandemic-including combat, bush fires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters-and we explore how and why these metaphors construct the pandemic locally and farther afield.","Lacey, Kelly, Jutel","https://doi.org/10.1353/pbm.2020.0054","20210108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9203,""
"Resilience and the Role of Depressed and Anxious Mood in the Relationship Between Perceived Social Isolation and Perceived Sleep Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of the study was to examine the mediating role of depressed and anxious mood in the relationship between perceived social isolation and perceived sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to investigate the moderating role of psychological resilience in this mediation. A cross-sectional study of adults (18+Ã‚Â years old) was conducted using an online, multi-language, international survey between March 31 and May 15, 2020. Simple and moderated mediation analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS, with perceived social isolation as an independent variable, change in perceived sleep quality (during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic) as a dependent variable, depressed and anxious mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-4, PHQ-4) as a mediator, and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, BRS) as a moderator. A convenience sample of 3816 participants (2692Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°female) from 94 countries (47.4% USA) met criteria for inclusion in the analyses. Results showed that depressed and anxious mood mediated the relationship between perceived social isolation and change in perceived sleep quality. This mediation was moderated by resilience; the indirect effect of perceived social isolation on change in perceived sleep quality through depressed and anxious mood decreased as the level of resilience increased (index of moderated mediationÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.008, SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003, 95%CI [0.001; 0.014]). The study findings indicate benefits of psychological resilience in buffering negative effects of perceived isolation, suggesting potential benefits of developing targeted strategies to enhance resilience during times of significant crises.","Ben Salah, DeAngelis, al'Absi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09945-x","20210108","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Resilience; Sleep; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9204,""
"Parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions","The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents recruited through schools, patient organizations and social media platforms (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the UK (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°508), Sweden (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1436), Spain (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1491), Belgium (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°508), the Netherlands (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°324), Germany (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1662) and Italy (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°794). Many parents reported negative effects of homeschooling for themselves and their child, and many found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools. In most countries, contact with teachers was limited, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing homeschooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some negative experiences were more common in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, differences between countries and between families with and without a mental health condition were generally small, indicating that many parents across countries reported negative experiences. Some parents also reported positive experiences of homeschooling. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures may be less effective than other interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","Thorell, Skoglund, de la PeÃƒÂ±a, Baeyens, Fuermaier, Groom, Mammarella, van der Oord, van den Hoofdakker, Luman, de Miranda, Siu, Steinmayr, Idrees, Soares, SÃƒÂ¶rlin, Luque, Moscardino, Roch, Crisci, Christiansen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-020-01706-1","20210108","COVID-19; Homeschooling; Mental health problems; Parental experiences; Special education needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9205,""
"Prioritized Research for the Prevention, Treatment, and Reversal of Chronic Disease: Recommendations From the Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit","Declining life expectancy and increasing all-cause mortality in the United States have been associated with unhealthy behaviors, socioecological factors, and preventable disease. A growing body of basic science, clinical research, and population health evidence points to the benefits of healthy behaviors, environments and policies to maintain health and prevent, treat, and reverse the root causes of common chronic diseases. Similarly, innovations in research methodologies, standards of evidence, emergence of unique study cohorts, and breakthroughs in data analytics and modeling create new possibilities for producing biomedical knowledge and clinical translation. To understand these advances and inform future directions research, The Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit was convened at the University of Pittsburgh on December 4-5, 2019. The Summit's goal was to review current status and define research priorities in the six core areas of lifestyle medicine: plant-predominant nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, addictive behaviors, and positive psychology/social connection. Forty invited subject matter experts (1) reviewed existing knowledge and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many cancers, inflammatory- and immune-related disorders and other conditions; and (2) discussed the potential for applying cutting-edge molecular, cellular, epigenetic and emerging science knowledge and computational methodologies, research designs, and study cohorts to accelerate clinical applications across all six domains of lifestyle medicine. Notably, federal health agencies, such as the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration have begun to adopt &quot;whole-person health and performance&quot; models that address these lifestyle and environmental root causes of chronic disease and associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Recommendations strongly support leveraging emerging research methodologies, systems biology, and computational modeling in order to accelerate effective clinical and population solutions to improve health and reduce societal costs. New and alternative hierarchies of evidence are also be needed in order to assess the quality of evidence and develop evidence-based guidelines on lifestyle medicine. Children and underserved populations were identified as prioritized groups to study. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacts people with chronic diseases that are amenable to effective lifestyle medicine interventions, makes the Summit's findings and recommendations for future research particularly timely and relevant.","Vodovotz, Barnard, Hu, Jakicic, Lianov, Loveland, Buysse, Szigethy, Finkel, Sowa, Verschure, Williams, Sanchez, Dysinger, Maizes, Junker, Phillips, Katz, Drant, Jackson, Trasande, Woolf, Salive, South-Paul, States, Roth, Fraser, Stout, Parkinson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.585744","20210108","chronic disease; epigenetics; in silico modeling; inflammation; lifestyle medicine; nutrition; physical activity; research methodologies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9206,""

"Arts-Based Interventions for Professionals in Caring Roles During and After Crisis: A Systematic Review of the Literature","Crisis events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can have a devastating effect on communities and the care professionals within them. Over recent years, arts-based interventions have helped in a wide range of crisis situations, being recommended to support the workforce during and after complex crisis but there has been no systematic review of the role of arts-based crisis interventions and whether there are cogent themes regarding practice elements and outcomes. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review to (i) define the arts-based change process used during and after crisis events, and (ii) explore the perceptions of intermediate and long-term mental health benefits of arts-based interventions for professionals in caring roles. Our search yielded six studies (all qualitative). All data were thematically aggregated and meta-synthesized, revealing seven practice elements (a safe place, focusing on strengths and protective factors, developing psychosocial competencies to support peers, emotional expression and processing, identifying and naming the impact of the crisis, using an integrative creative approach, and cultural and organizational sensitivity) applied across all six studies, as well as a range of intermediate and long-term benefits shared common features (adapting, growing, and recovering; using the community as a healing resource; reducing or preventing symptoms of stress or trauma reactions, psychophysiological homeostasis). The ways in which these studies were designed independently from one another and yet used the same practice elements in their crisis interventions indicates that there is comparability about how and why the arts-based practice elements are being used and to what effect. Our findings provide a sound basis and meaningful parameters for future research incorporating quantitative and qualitative approaches to firmly establish the effectiveness of art-based interventions, and how arts can support cultural sensitivity, acceptability and indicated outcomes, particularly those relating to stress and trauma during or following a crisis.","Havsteen-Franklin, Tjasink, Kottler, Grant, Kumari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.589744","20210108","arts therapies; care professionals; crisis; pandemic; stress; systematic review; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9208,""
"SARS-CoV-2 and Asbestos Exposure: Can Our Experience With Mesothelioma Patients Help Us Understand the Psychological Consequences of COVID-19 and Develop Interventions?","Since its emergence, the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has had enormous physical, social, and psychological impacts worldwide. The aim of this article was to identify elements of our knowledge on asbestos exposure and malignant mesothelioma (MM) that can provide insight into the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and be used to develop adequate interventions. Although the etiology of Covid-19 and MM differs, their psychological impacts have common characteristics: in both diseases, there is a feeling of being exposed through aerial contagion to an &quot;invisible killer&quot; without boundaries that can strike even the strongest individuals. In both cases, affected persons can experience personality dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms; helplessness, hopelessness, and projection of destructive thoughts onto external forces often emerge, while defense mechanisms such as denial, splitting, repression, and reduced emotional expression are used by individuals to contain their overwhelming anxieties. We believe that in both diseases, an integrated multidimensional intervention offered by hospitals and other public health services is the most effective approach to alleviating patients' and caregivers' psychological distress. In particular, we emphasize that in the context of both MM and COVID-19, Brief Psychoanalytic Group therapy can help patients and caregivers attribute meaning to the significant changes in their lives related to the experience of the disease and identify adaptive strategies and more realistic relational modalities to deal with what has happened to them. We also highlight the importance of developing a surveillance system that includes individual anamnestic evaluation of occupational risk factors for COVID-19 disease.","Granieri, Bonafede, Marinaccio, Iavarone, Marsili, Franzoi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.584320","20210108","COVID-19; asbestos; mesothelioma; occupational risk; psychological intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9209,""
"Comparing the Impact of COVID-19-Related Social Distancing on Mood and Psychiatric Indicators in Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) and Non-SGM Individuals","Empirical evidence demonstrates mental health disparities between sexual and gender minority individuals (SGM) compared with cisgender heterosexual individuals. SGM individuals report elevated rates of emotional distress, symptoms related to mood and anxiety disorders, self-harm, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Social support is inversely related to psychiatric symptoms, regardless of SGM status. The COVID-19 pandemic-with its associated limited social interactions-represents an unprecedented period of acute distress with potential reductions in accessibility of social support, which might be of particular concern for SGM individuals' mental well-being. In the present study, we explored the extent to which potential changes in mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, worry, perceived stress, positive and negative affect) throughout the duration of the pandemic were related to differences in perceptions of social support and engagement in virtual social activity, as a function of SGM status. Utilizing a large sample of US adults (<i>N</i> = 1,014; 18% reported SGM status), we assessed psychiatric symptoms, perceptions of social isolation, and amount of time spent socializing virtually at 3 time windows during the pandemic (between March 21 and May 21). Although SGM individuals reported greater levels of depression compared with non-SGM individuals at all 3 time points, there was no interaction between time and SGM status. Across all participants, mental health outcomes improved across time. Perceived social isolation was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Further, time spent engaging in virtual socialization was associated with reduced depression, but only for those in self-reported quarantine. We discuss these results in terms of the nature of our sample and its impact on the generalizability of these findings to other SGM samples as well as directions for future research aimed at understanding potential health disparities in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rodriguez-Seijas, Fields, Bottary, Kark, Goldstein, Kensinger, Payne, Cunningham","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.590318","20210108","COVID-19; depression; gender; mood; sexual orientation; social isolation; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9210,""
"Early Psychiatric Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the General Population and Healthcare Workers in Italy: A Preliminary Study","<b>Introduction:</b> Since February 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread to several countries worldwide, including Italy. In this study, we aimed to assess the psychopathological impact of the pandemic across the general population of Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, and to compare the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms between the general public and healthcare workers. <b>Methods:</b> Four hundred and thirty-two participants completed an online survey including: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI). Healthcare workers were also asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). <b>Results:</b> At the DASS-21, 33.3% of the responders presented pathological levels of stress, 25.5% of anxiety, and 35.9% of depression. At the IES-R, 13.9% appeared at risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the PSQI, 57.6% presented sleep disturbances. Female gender and younger age predicted higher scores of distress. Healthcare workers presented higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than the general public. Moreover, working in contact with COVID-19 patients predicted higher scores at the IES-R subscale Intrusion. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results showed that about a third of our sample presented symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Lombardy; more than half of the responders presented sleep disturbances, and 13% appeared at risk of PTSD. Italian authorities should develop specific strategies to guarantee psychological support to the population of Lombardy, with particular attention to women, young people, and healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients.","Demartini, NisticÃƒÂ², D'Agostino, Priori, Gambini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.561345","20210108","COVID-19; PTSD; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; healthcare workers; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9211,""
"COVID-19 quarantine measures are associated with negative social impacts and compromised follow-up care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Brazil","COVID-19 has affected the entire world. We aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on the daily life and follow up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During May 2020, we evaluated 179 (79.6%) patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 (20.4%) with ulcerative colitis (UC) by telephone, using a structured questionnaire to gather information on social impact and IBD follow up. Some kind of social distancing measure was reported by 95.6% of our patients, self-quarantine (64.9%) being the most frequent. Depressive mood was the most prevalent social impact (80.2%), followed by anxiety/fear of death (58.2%), insomnia (51.4%), daily activity impairment (48%), sexual dysfunction (46.2%), and productivity impairment (44%). The results were similar when we compared patients with active disease to those in remission and patients with UC to those with CD. Analysis of IBD follow up showed that 83.1% of all patients missed an IBD medical appointment, 45.5% of the patients missed laboratory tests, 41.3% missed the national flu vaccination program, 31.3% missed any radiologic exam, 17.3% missed colonoscopy, and 16.9% failed to obtain biologic therapy prescriptions. Biologics were discontinued by 28.4% of the patients. UC patients had higher rates of missed vaccination than CD patients (56.5% vs. 37.4%, P=0.02) and more failures to obtain a biologic prescription (28.3% vs. 14.0%, P=0.02).

"Telepsychiatry and the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health in Post-COVID-19 India: A Scoping Review on Opportunities","COVID-19 has a profound impact on people with existing mental disorders, augmenting the prevailing inequalities in mental health. In order to understand the status of telepsychiatry in India and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health and its potential applications, a scoping review was done between March 2020 and May 2020. The literature review revealed 253 papers, which were used to derive the primary framework for analysis. The information was then reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were integrated with evidence from gray literature and categorized under broader themes based on the insights derived. Finally, a thematic framework was developed for discussion to tailor scientific information for decision-makers' needs. Review findings are summarized under the following headings: changing patterns of health-seeking behavior, origin and evolution of telepsychiatry, possible applications of telepsychiatry and AI, technological features, and AI models in mental health. Though there are several potential opportunities, the time is not yet ripe for telepsychiatry and AI to be adopted fully in the field of mental health care. But it is time that we develop indigenous proprietary technology and test and validate it. With many solutions offered by telepsychiatry and AI, psychiatrists must choose an appropriate tool based on their requirements, availability of resources, and feasibility of deployment. Harmony between conventional care and technology-based care must be reached gradually.","M, Annamalai","https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620952160","20210108","COVID-19; India; Telepsychiatry; artificial intelligence in mental health; e-mental health; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9213,""
"Mass Disasters and Burnout in Nephrology Personnel: From Earthquakes and Hurricanes to COVID-19 Pandemic","Mass disasters result in extensive health problems and make health care delivery problematic, as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID-19 was initially considered a pulmonary problem, it soon became clear that various other organs were involved. Thus, many care providers, including kidney health personnel, were overwhelmed or developed burnout. This review aims to describe the spectrum of burnout in mass disasters and suggests solutions specifically for nephrology personnel by extending previous experience to the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout (a psychologic response to work-related stress) is already a frequent part of routine nephrology practice and, not surprisingly, is even more common during mass disasters due to increased workload and specific conditions, in addition to individual factors. Avoiding burnout is essential to prevent psychologic and somatic health problems in personnel as well as malpractice, understaffing, and inadequate health care delivery, all of which increase the health care burden of disasters. Burnout may be prevented by predisaster organizational measures, which include developing an overarching plan and optimizing health care infrastructure, and <i>ad hoc</i> disaster-specific measures that encompass both organizational and individual measures. Organizational measures include increasing safety, decreasing workload and fear of malpractice, optimizing medical staffing and material supplies, motivating personnel, providing mental health support, and enabling flexibility in working circumstances. Individual measures include training on coping with stress and problematic conditions, minimizing the stigma of emotional distress, and maintaining physical health. If these measures fall short, asking for external help is mandatory to avoid an inefficient disaster health care response. Minimizing burnout by applying these measures will improve health care provision, thus saving as many lives as possible.","Sever, Ortiz, Maggiore, Bac-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Vanholder","https://doi.org/10.2215/CJN.08400520","20210108","COVID-19; burnout; earthquake; hurricane; massive disaster; nephrology; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9214,""
"Disentangling depression in Belgian higher education students amidst the first COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020)","The surge of COVID-19 infections has prompted many countries to take unprecedented policy measures. In Belgium, the authorities implemented a nation-wide stay-at-home order for several months. Evidence of the mental health effect of such measures is scarce. A recent review by Brooks et al. has compiled a defined list of stressors affecting people's mental health under quarantine during previous epidemic settings. This study aims to test the association between these stressors and the mental health of students attending higher education during the stay-at-home order in Belgium. In this cross-sectional study, 18,301 students from 13 higher education institutions (HEI) participated in an online survey between 26 April and 11 May 2020. We assessed the association between potential stressors and depressive symptoms severity scores and structural equation modeling was used to assess how stressors may mediate the association between duration of exposure and depressive symptoms severity. The stressors proposed by Brooks et al. were found to be associated with depressive symptoms severity. The stressors 'perceived academic stress', 'institutional dissatisfaction' and 'fear of being infected' were associated with substantially higher depressive symptoms severity scores. The association between duration of exposure and depressive symptoms severity was mediated by 'academic stress'. Being in a steady relationship and living together with others were both associated with a lower depressive symptoms severity. Findings underline the need for a student-centered approach and mental health prevention. Authorities and HEIs should consider whether and if so, how a stay-at-home order should be implemented.","De Man, Buffel, van de Velde, Bracke, Van Hal, Wouters, Gadeyne, Kindermans, Joos, Vanmaercke, van Studenten, Nyssen, Puttaert, Vervecken, Van Guyse","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-020-00522-y","20210108","Academic stress; Belgium; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Fear of infection; Higher education students; Institutional dissatisfaction; Mental health; Stay-at-home order","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9215,""
"Conceptualizing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with opioid use disorder: an application of the social ecological model","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unparalleled societal disruption with wide ranging effects on individual liberties, the economy, and physical and mental health. While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic's broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.","Cowan, Khan, Shastry, Edelman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-020-00210-w","20210108","COVID-19; Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; People who use drugs; Social ecological model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9216,""
"Effects of sources of social support and resilience on the mental health of different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic","A pandemic is a very stressful event, especially for highly vulnerable people (e.g., older adults). The purpose of the current study was to investigate the main and interactive relationships of social support and resilience on individual mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic across three age groups: emerging adults, adults, and older adults. A survey was conducted with 23,192 participants aged 18-85. Respondents completed a questionnaire, including items on the COVID-19-related support they perceived from different sources, the abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Mental Health Inventory. Latent profile analysis identified five profiles of social support, and the patterns of potential profiles were similar in all groups. However, category distribution in the five profiles was significantly different among the age groups. Furthermore, analysis using the BCH command showed significant differences in mental health among these profiles. Lastly, interactive analyses indicated resilience had a positive relationship with mental health, and social support served as a buffer against the negative impact of low resilience on mental health. This study provides quantitative evidence for socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and enables several practical implications for helping different age groups protecting mental health during pandemic.","Li, Luo, Mu, Li, Ye, Zheng, Xu, Ding, Ling, Zhou, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03012-1","20210108","Age difference; COVID-19; Mental health; Resilience; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9217,""
"The effect of anxiety levels of elderly people in quarantine on depression during covid-19 pandemic","This study aims to determine the effect on depression of elderly people's anxiety levels in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a descriptive study, in which data were collected using the online survey method, an introductory information form, a semistructured data form for COVID-19, the Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Data were collected during the period when a curfew was imposed for the elderly. Data were analyzed using a structural equation model. According to the structural equation model, anxiety was determined as a predictor of depression. The anxiety levels of the elderly who were 65-74Ã‚Â years old, female, single; had insufficient knowledge about the pandemic; and had not encountered a similar outbreak before considered that family relationships were affected negatively so they became lonely and reported that they became bored, exhausted, and distressed during the pandemic, which increased their depression levels. Anxiety affects depression in the elderly. Therefore, it is recommended to provide them with appropriate psychological support interventions and understandable information about the pandemic so that their anxiety and depression levels can be reduced during the pandemic.","Yildirim, IÃ…Å¸ik, Aylaz","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2020.1868372","20210108","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; elderly; quarantine; structural equation model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9218,""
"The effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on physicians' psychological resilience levels","Health care workers exposed to coronavirus19 disease could be psychologically stressed. The objective of this study is to assess the anxiety, depression levels, and psychological resilience of physicians working during the Covid-19 outbreak and to evaluate the related factors that are associated with their psychological resilience. The sample of this descriptive study was composed of medical doctors and dentists. The data was obtained online between April 13-23, 2020 through a survey prepared by the researchers. In addition, a questionnaire about the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, the Psychological Resilience Scale and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD-A/HAD-D) was given. The average age of the 671 participants was 44.0Ã‚Â±9.0 years. Psychological resilience scores were significantly higher in those who had children, who had worked for 15 years or more, and who had received training about COVID-19 (p&lt;0.05). Depression scores were higher among women and in those who reported having a chronic disease, whose workload increased after the outbreak, and who had physical contact with COVID-positive patients. The anxiety scores were also higher among women and in those whose workload had increased and who had contact with COVID-positive patients (p&lt;0.05). The physicians with scores below the cut-off point on the HAD-D/HAD-A had significantly higher scores on the Psychological Resilience Scale (p&lt;0.05). Depression and anxiety levels were found to be significantly lower in physicians with greater psychological resilience. Psychological and social support of all health care workers, especially physicians, is important in the struggle with the pandemic. It is thought that determining the variables related to psychological resilience in health care workers will be a guide for psychosocial services.","Arslan, Karabekiroglu, Terzi, Dundar","https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1874166","20210108","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; physician; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9219,""
"[COVID-19 and mental health services in Europe]","The area of mental health is directly affected by the pandemic and its consequences, for various reasons: 1-the pandemic triggered a global lockdown, with dramatic socioeconomic and therefore psychosocial implications; 2-mental health services, which treat by definition a fragile population from the psychological, biological and social points of view, have a complex organizational frame, and it was expected that this would be affected (or overwhelmed) by the pandemic; 3-mental health services should, at least in theory, be able to help guide public health policies when these involve a significant modification of individual behaviour. It was conducted a narrative review of the publications produced by European researchers in the period February-June 2020 and indexed in PubMed. A total of 34 papers were analyzed, which document the profound clinical, organizational and procedural changes introduced in mental health services following this exceptional and largely unforeseen planetary event.Among the main innovations recorded everywhere, the strong push towards the use of telemedicine techniques should be mentioned: however, these require an adequate critical evaluation, which highlights their possibilities, limits, advantages and disadvantages instead of simple triumphalist judgments. Furthermore, should be emphasized the scarcity of quantitative studies conducted in this period and the absence of studies aimed, for example, at exploring the consequences of prolonged and forced face-to-face contact between patients and family members with a high index of &quot;expressed emotions&quot;.","Meloni, de Girolamo, Rossi","https://doi.org/10.19191/EP20.5-6.S2.142","20210108","COVID-19; mental health services; organization; mental disorders; Europe","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9220,""
"A screening and treatment programme to deal with perinatal anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","During a pandemic, pregnancy and the postnatal period are complicated by multiple factors. On the one hand, worries about one's own health and the health of loved ones, in particular of the newborn child, can increase the risk of some mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety in the pregnant woman. On the other hand, as happened for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, given the need for physical distancing, the maintenance of the social and family network, so important for new parents in the perinatal period, is lacking. In addition, health services are forced to reorganize their offerings to ensure maximum safety for their operators and patients.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in a highly burdened area of north-east Italy","Healthcare workers exposed to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients could be psychologically distressed. This study aims to assess the magnitude of psychological distress and associated factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large tertiary hospital located in north-east Italy. All healthcare and administrative staff working in the Verona University Hospital (Veneto, Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic were asked to complete a web-based survey from 21 April to 6 May 2020. Symptoms of post-traumatic distress, anxiety and depression were assessed, respectively, using the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Personal socio-demographic information and job characteristics were also collected, including gender, age, living condition, having pre-existing psychological problems, occupation, length of working experience, hospital unit (ICUs and sub-intensive COVID-19 units vs. non-COVID-19 units). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with each of the three mental health outcomes. A total of 2195 healthcare workers (36.9% of the overall hospital staff) participated in the study. Of the participants, 35.7% were nurses, 24.3% other healthcare staff, 16.4% residents, 13.9% physicians and 9.7% administrative staff. Nine per cent of healthcare staff worked in ICUs, 8% in sub-intensive COVID-19 units and 7.6% in other front-line services, while the remaining staff worked in hospital units not directly engaged with COVID-19 patients. Overall, 63.2% of participants reported COVID-related traumatic experiences at work and 53.8% (95% CI 51.0%-56.6%) showed symptoms of post-traumatic distress; moreover, 50.1% (95% CI 47.9%-52.3%) showed symptoms of clinically relevant anxiety and 26.6% (95% CI 24.7%-28.5%) symptoms of at least moderate depression. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that women, nurses, healthcare workers directly engaged with COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing psychological problems were at increased risk of psychopathological consequences of the pandemic. The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare staff working in a highly burdened geographical of north-east Italy is relevant and to some extent greater than that reported in China. The study provides solid grounds to elaborate and implement interventions pertaining to psychology and occupational health.","Lasalvia, Bonetto, Porru, Carta, Tardivo, Bovo, Ruggeri, Amaddeo","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796020001158","20210108","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; health workers; mental health; post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-10","",9222,""
