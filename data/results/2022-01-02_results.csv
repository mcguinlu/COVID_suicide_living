"Social isolation and psychological distress among southern US college students in the era of COVID-19","Objective: To examine the prevalence of psychological distress and its association with social isolation among University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) students. Methods A cross-sectional survey was emailed to all students in June 2020. Students reported self-isolating none, some, most, or all of the time and were screened for clinically significant symptoms of depression (CSSD). Data were weighted to the UNC-CH population. Results: 7,012 students completed surveys-64% reported self-isolating most or all of the time and 64% reported CSSD. Compared to those self-isolating none of the time, students self-isolating some of the time were 1.78 (95% CI 1.37-2.30) times as likely to report CSSD, and students self-isolating most and all of the time were 2.12 (95% CI 1.64-2.74) and 2.27 (95% CI 1.75-2.94) times as likely to report CSSD, respectively. Conclusions: Universities should prioritize student mental health and prepare support services to mitigate mental health consequences of the pandemic.","Danielle Giovenco; Bonnie E Shook-Sa; Bryant Hutson; Laurie Buchanan; Edwin B Fisher; Audrey Pettifor","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.31.21268596","20220101","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24450,""
"Subjective Well-being Among Migrant Workers Residing in a Shelter Home During Lockdown: A Pilot Survey From North India","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To explore the impact of lockdown due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the subjective well-being of migrant workers staying in a shelter home in India. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A total of 54 residents of the shelter home participated in this exploratory survey study. Baseline assessments included sociodemographic profile, the Subjective Well-Being Inventory (SUBI), and the Perceived Stress Scale. The participants were reassessed with the SUBI after 2 weeks of staying in the shelter home. The survey was administered April 11 to May 10, 2020. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD age of the participants was 23.54Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.68 years, and the majority were men and in the age group 21-30 years (45%). At baseline assessments, the meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD stress level score was 17.39Ã‚Â±4.62. The meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD SUBI score was 81.44Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.62 at baseline and increased to 100.65Ã‚Â±5.95 after 2 weeks of staying in the shelter home. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The survey findings demonstrate that the levels of subjective well-being among participants improved after their physical and mental health needs were met during their stay in the shelter home. The findings could help policy planners and senior public health administrators minimize gaps to better understand the multiple issues related to the subjective well-being of this population.","Singh, Arun","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21m02991","20211230","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24451,""
"Factors associated with county-level mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this study is to determine county-level factors associated with anxiety, depression, and isolation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study used daily data from 23,592,355 respondents of a nationwide Facebook-based survey from April 2020 to July 2021, aggregated to the week-county level to yield 212,581 observations. Mental distress prevalences were modeled using weighted linear mixed-effects models with a county random effect. These models revealed that weekly percentages of mental distress were higher in counties with higher unemployment rates, populations, and education levels; higher percentages of females, young adults, individuals with a medical condition, and individuals very worried about their finances and COVID-19; and lower percentages of individuals who were working outside the home, living with children, without health insurance, and Black. Anxiety peaked in April 2020, depression in October 2020, and isolation in December 2020. Therefore, United States counties experienced the mental health effects of the pandemic differently dependent upon their characteristics, and mental distress prevalence varied across time.","Lupton-Smith, Badillo-Goicochea, Chang, Maniates, Riehm, Schmid, Stuart","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22785","20211230","COVID-19; anxiety; counties; depression; education; isolation; sociodemographics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24452,""
"Validation of the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scales","The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scales (CEFIS) were developed in Spring 2020 to assess effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and caregivers. Initial psychometric properties were promising. The current study examined the factor structure and evaluated convergent and criterion validity of the CEFIS in a new sample. In October and November 2020, caregivers (N = 2,531) of youth (0-21 years) scheduled for an ambulatory care visit at Nemours Children's Hospital, Delaware completed the CEFIS and measures of convergent (PROMIS Global Mental Health Scale, Family Assessment Device) and criterion validity (PTSD Checklist-Civilian). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the CEFIS. Bivariate correlations and logistic regression were used to examine convergent and criterion validity. Factor analysis supported the original six- and three-factor structures for the Exposure and Impact scales, respectively. Second-order factor analyses supported the use of Exposure, Impact, and Distress total scores. Higher scores on the CEFIS Exposure, Impact, and Distress scales were associated with increased mental health concerns and poorer family functioning. Higher scores on all CEFIS scales were also associated with greater odds of having clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms. The CEFIS is a psychometrically sound measure of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family and caregiver functioning and may also be useful in identifying families who would benefit from psychological supports.","Enlow, Phan, Lewis, Hildenbrand, Sood, Canter, Vega, Alderfer, Kazak","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab136","20211230","COVID-19; measure validation; parents; posttraumatic stress; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24453,""
"Risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 recovered patients A cross-sectional study","High rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms have been found among patients with more severe COVID-19-related symptoms, and hospitalization is generally recognized as a risk factor for developing PTSD. Furthermore, other personality characteristics may increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms following a COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to assess personality traits, alexithymia, dissociation, anxiety, and depression in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and the impact of these variables on the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Five hundred and six participants completed a battery of standardized questionnaires. All the scales used in this study are valid and reliable measures of their respective constructs. Results showed that high levels of alexithymia, dissociation, anxiety, and depression statistically significantly predicted the three main clusters of PTSD symptoms (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Furthermore, negative affectivity and psychoticism significantly predicted PTSD symptoms in our sample. Finally, individuals hospitalized by COVID-19 are more at risk of developing intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than those who never needed hospital care. Our findings are a valuable contribution in identifying the main risk factors of psychological distress related to COVID-19 to address the long-term mental health needs of people who have experienced the disease.","Craparo, La Rosa, Marino, Vezzoli, CinÃƒÂ , Colombi, Arcoleo, Severino, Costanzo, Mangiapane","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114353","20220101","Alexithymia; COVID-19; Dissociation; Mental health; Personality traits; Trauma; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24454,""

"Nurses' Knowledge and Anxiety Levels toward COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia","<i>Background:</i> In the battle against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical care staff, especially nurses, are at a higher risk of encountering psychological health issues and distress, such as stress, tension, burdensome indications, and, most importantly, fear. They are also at higher risk of becoming infected and transmitting this virus. In Saudi Arabia, it was noticed that the healthcare workforce suffered from anxiety, and that this more evident in women than men. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to assess the knowledge of nurses regarding COVID-19 and the level of anxiety toward the COVID-19 outbreak in the current pandemic situation. <i>Design:</i> A cross-sectional design was used and a validated self-administered online questionnaire with a set of questions related to COVID-19 was distributed to 87 participating nurses. <i>Results:</i> The results showed that more than half of the nurses (71.90%) had an adequate and good knowledge about the causes, transmission, symptoms, treatment, and death rate of COVID-19. The main sources of information for the nurses were social media (51.7%) and the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health (36.8%). <i>Conclusions:</i> The results allowed the conclusion that, though the nurses had satisfactory knowledge about COVID-19, more than 50% of them experienced mental health issues such as anxiety. To address this, along with providing more knowledge about COVID-19, nurses should be supported in managing their anxiety.","Alsharif","https://doi.org/10.3390/nursrep11020034","20220101","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; anxiety; coronavirus; epidemic; mental health; nurse; psychiatry; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24457,""
"Evaluating the Factors (Stress, Anxiety and Depression) Affecting the Mental Health Condition of Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to determine the depression, anxiety and stress levels that have negatively impacted nurses' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample group of 826 nurses working in Turkey were asked to fill in an online questionnaire in order to evaluate their psychological responses and the related factors that have adversely affected their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 696 nurses (84.3%) showed symptoms of depression, 644 (78%) reported anxiety and 543 (65.74%) reported stress. This study also highlighted that the most concerning factor for the nurses was the risk of transmitting the COVID-19 infection to their household members (89.2%). The most important problems faced by the nurses during COVID-19 included equipment shortages (50.7%), administrative problems (38.5%) and issues such as accommodation and nutrition (27.4%). These were found to have a statistically significant correlation with the nurses' levels of depression, anxiety and stress. The fear of losing a household member, the inability to their household's social needs and the fear of death were among the factors that concerned nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly affecting their levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Taking the necessary measures to deal with the aforementioned problems and fears is important to protect the health, productivity and efficiency of nurses during the pandemic period.","IÃ…Å¸Ã„Â±k, TengilimoÃ„Å¸lu, Tosun, ZekioÃ„Å¸lu, TengilimoÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.1177/01632787211062660","20211230","COVID-19; Turkey; mental health; nurses; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24458,""
"Development and cross-sectional evaluation of a text message protocol to support mental health well-being","Coping with stressors related to the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic has caused major mental health challenges. Text message interventions are identified as helpful for promoting health behavior self-management. Drawing from cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT), U.S. Veterans Health Administration staff developed a 20-week automated text messaging protocol called ""Coping During COVID"" to support veterans' self-care during the pandemic. This project evaluated attitudes about and perceived helpfulness of the protocol among 651 veterans. A cross-sectional evaluation quantitatively assessed COVID-related stressors as well as reported use, acceptability, attitudes, and perceived helpfulness of the protocol via a self-administered online questionnaire. Open-ended questions assessed perceived helpfulness/unhelpfulness of the protocol. Of the 651 veterans (22% of those enrolled in the protocol) who responded to the survey, 73.1% were male and 88.5% were 50 years or over. Ninety percent found the protocol messages helpful and about half endorsed various additional benefits, including feeling better, being more educated about coping behaviors, and being better able to focus on positive thoughts. Qualitative feedback was overwhelmingly positive. For example, veterans stated that the protocol ""was like having a personal coach giving hints and tips to cope with the boredom every day,"" that it ""gave me reminders of skills I was not using. It helped me focus on the positives,"" and brought relief from ""many hopeless and sad thoughts Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the messages from Annie have been a Godsend to me."" Overall results suggested that the Coping During COVID text messaging protocol successfully supported the majority of respondents' self-care efforts during the COVID pandemic.

"Well-being trajectories of middle-aged and older adults and the corona pandemic: No ""COVID-19 effect"" on life satisfaction, but increase in depressive symptoms","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to profound changes in individuals' lives and might have meaningful implications for well-being. We investigated if and how two major indicators of well-being (life satisfaction and depressive symptoms) changed in Germany from a prepandemic measurement occasion (2017) to June/July 2020, the time of the fading first wave of COVID-19. This change was compared with prepandemic change between 2014 and 2017. We also analyzed whether change in well-being varied according to age, self-rated health, corona-specific attitudes, and subjective standard of living. Ten thousand seven-hundred and ninety three individuals had taken part in at least one of the measurement occasions between 2014 and 2020 (mean age in 2014: 64.30 years; <i>SD</i> = 11.58 years). Based on latent change score models controlling for baseline well-being and sociodemographic indicators, we found, across both time intervals (2014-2017, 2017-2020) and independent of individuals' age, a small mean-level increase in life satisfaction. In contrast, depressive symptoms increased from 2017 to 2020, particularly among older participants, whereas they remained, on average, stable between 2014 and 2017. Individuals with a poorer self-rated health, who felt more threatened by the pandemic and whose subjective standard of living was lower revealed a decrease in life satisfaction and a steeper increase in depressive symptoms between 2017 and 2020. Our findings thus suggest that whereas life satisfaction remained quite stable, the pandemic was, already 3-4 months after its onset in Germany, accompanied by an increase in depressive symptoms, particularly among adults who were older, felt less healthy and were more concerned about COVID-19.

"Investing for keeps: Firms' prepandemic investments in human capital decreased workforce reductions associated with COVID-19 financial pressures","We examine how firms' prepandemic investments in human capital influence their use of workforce reductions and layoffs (hereafter, workforce reductions) as a response to financial pressures during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We contend that workforce reductions must be examined in the context of firms' broader financial and resource orchestration environments. First, we suggest that firms' relative exposure to pandemic financial pressures (PFPs) will determine their need to cut costs during the pandemic. Second, we argue that a firm's prior investments in employees' human capital will reduce the attractiveness of workforce reductions as a cost-cutting response to PFPs, as human capital investment (HCI) increases the value of employees' knowledge, skills, and abilities and motivation, thus inducing firms to seek alternative measures to reduce costs. We then argue that the attenuating influence of HCI on the effect of PFPs on workforce reductions will be stronger when HCI is matched with greater investments in physical capital, as employees' human capital will create more value-and will translate to a bigger loss following employee departures-in such circumstances. We demonstrate support for our hypotheses in a sample of 1,364 U.S. banks using data from quarterly Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reports, news articles, and Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications (WARN) Act filings through the fourth quarter of 2020. We discuss implications for our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on organizations and employees and for research on resource orchestration and human capital.

"Mental health and aging in the 2020s","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought age bias and the unmet mental health needs of older adults into bold relief. Even before the pandemic, the psychological needs of older adults often went unaddressed, or were poorly addressed by a system that lacks an adequate number of providers and insufficiently integrates geropsychological services across care settings. In the decade ahead, the number of older adults in the United States will continue to grow, with the potential for expanded demand and contracted service options. Life changes that typically occur with aging will interact with societal upheavals (pandemic, civil unrest, economic inequality) to exacerbate the mental health needs in the current cohort of older adults and the ""near old."" At the same time, ageism, inequitable access, and financial and policy constraints may limit health care access. Following a review of current demographic and epidemiological data, we describe several trends that will affect the prevalence of mental health issues among older adults and how mental health care is delivered, and we discuss their implications for education, research, and practice. For both personal and professional reasons, all psychologists can benefit from understanding these trends in aging.

"Health Promotion, Functional Abilities, and Quality of Life Before and During COVID-19 in People with Multiple Sclerosis","Because multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease, and many individuals with MS take disease-modifying drugs that suppress immune response, serious concerns have been expressed about the potential effct of COVID-19 on those with this chronic condition. The purpose of this research was to utilize the most recent 5 years of data from an ongoing longitudinal study of health promotion and quality of life (QoL) among people with long-standing MS to investigate changes across time in functional limitations, health promotion, and health-related QoL. Participants are mailed an annual survey to complete about their health promotion, depressive symptoms, health status, social support, MS-related functional limitations, and QoL. Differences across time were analyzed with repeated measures of analysis of variances and planned contrasts. In 2021, the 141 participants had a mean age of 69 years and had been diagnosed with MS for 34 years on average. Most had attended college, were married/partnered females, and reported adequate economic resources. Thirty-seven percent reported they were in poor to fair health. Physical activity and health responsibility scores decreased significantly during 2020-2021 compared with 2017-2019. Significant changes in depressive symptoms, social support, and functional limitations scores followed a different pattern with the largest changes occurring between 2018 and 2019. QoL and other health promotion scores did not change significantly across time. The relatively small changes in health indicators revealed here suggest that older people with long-standing MS may have generally been able to maintain their health promotion, functional abilities, and QoL from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, nurses and other providers should support them to resume their physical activity and regular provider contact as COVID-19 restrictions are eased. The patterns observed here demonstrate the importance of examining changes across an extended period, rather than simply looking at 1 year before and 1 year after a major event, such as COVID-19. These findings can help nurses understand how to help their patients with chronic health conditions maximize their health as they move forward.","Becker, Stuifbergen, Lim, Kesler","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNR.0000000000000573","20211230","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24463,""
"Depression and anxiety among College Students in Slovakia - Comparison of the Year 2018 and during COVID-19 pandemic","The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among university students during the peak of COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic in the Slovak Republic in December 2020. The secondary goal was to compare results with a study from 2018 at the same university. A web-based cross-sectional study was administered at the Comenius University in Bratislava. The final sample consisted of 1,786 participants (approx. 80 % females) with the mean age and standard deviation of M=21.15 and SD=3.53. An online battery of self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, loneliness, and resilience was administered. The prevalence rates of moderately severe toÃ¢â‚¬â€˜severe depression and anxiety were 34.3 % and 20.1 %, respectively. Depression and anxiety were associated with younger age, higher perception of stress, higher loneliness, and lower resilience. In comparison with 2018, we found a two-fold increase in depression and anxiety. The increase was present across most of the depression and anxiety symptoms. The result of the study revealed elevated rates of depression and anxiety during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. Various demographic and psychological factors were associated with more severe depression and anxiety among university students. Some subgroups of students are at the higher risk of mental health problems (Tab. 4, Ref. 26).","Hajduk, Dancik, Januska, Strakova, Turcek, Heretik, Pecenak","https://doi.org/10.4149/BLL_2022_007","20211231","COVID-19 pandemics.; anxiety; college students; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24464,""
"Platelet mitochondrial function and endogenous coenzyme Q10 levels are reduced in patients after COVID-19","After an acute treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), some symptoms may persist for several weeks, for example: fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint pain, cough, loss of taste and smell, sleep and memory disturbances, depression. Many viruses manipulate mitochondrial function, but the exact mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virus effect remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect mitochondrial energy production and endogenous biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Ten patients after COVID-19 and 15 healthy individuals were included in the study. Platelets isolated from peripheral blood were used as an accessible source of mitochondria. High-resolution respirometry for the evaluation of platelets mitochondrial function, and HPLC method for CoQ10 determination were used. Oxidative stress was evaluated by TBARS concentration in plasma. Platelet mitochondrial respiratory chain function, oxidative phosphorylation and endogenous CoQ10 level were reduced in the patients after COVID-19. We assume that a reduced concentration of endogenous CoQ10 may partially block electron transfer in the respiratory chain resulting in a reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the patients after COVID-19. Targeted mitochondrial therapy with CoQ10 supplementation and spa rehabilitation may improve mitochondrial health and accelerate the recovery of the patients after COVID-19. Platelet mitochondrial function and CoQ10 content may be useful mitochondrial health biomarkers after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Tab. 3, Fig. 3, Ref. 46).","Sumbalova, Kucharska, Palacka, Rausova, Langsjoen, Langsjoen, Gvozdjakova","https://doi.org/10.4149/BLL_2022_002","20211231","OXPHOS; SARS-CoV-2; coenzyme Q10 oxidative stress.; mitochondria; platelet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24465,""
"Nurses' mental health from early COVID-19 pandemic to vaccination","The influence of the COVID-19 vaccine and the evolution of the pandemic over time on nurses' mental health have not been thoroughly examined. This study aimed to explore the changes in nurses' mental health from the early pandemic to the early vaccination period over a 1-year time span and examine vaccination and coping mechanisms as predictors of nurses' poor mental health and burnout. Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted: Early-pandemic (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 320), pre-vaccination (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 228), and early-vaccination cohorts (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 292). About 72% of nurses in the early-vaccination cohort were fully vaccinated with two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. There were significant decreases in moderate/severe anxiety and moderate/severe depression for the early-vaccination cohort compared to the other cohorts. In multivariate analyses, vaccination had almost three-fold higher odds of moderate/severe anxiety (Odds Ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.87; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.28-6.44). High resilience, family functioning, and spirituality were associated with two- to five-fold lower odds of poor mental health and burnout. Although nurses in the early-vaccination cohort had lower anxiety and depression than earlier cohorts, COVID-19 vaccination had minimal associations with nurses' mental health. Coping mechanisms and organizational support appear to be important predictors of nurses' poor mental health and burnout. The evidence gathered over 1Ã‚Â year of the pandemic may be helpful for a better understanding of the challenges facing frontline nurses and preparing for future healthcare crises. As a part of the preparedness plan for the future, evidence-based interventions that raise frontline nurses' resilience, as well as family and spiritual support, should be considered.","Kim, Rankin, Ferguson","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12760","20211230","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coping mechanisms; depression; stress; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24466,""
"A survey of mental health status of obstetric nurses during the novel coronavirus pneumonia pandemic","To investigate the mental health status of obstetric nurses and its influencing factors during the novel coronavirus epidemic period, so as to provide theoretical reference for hospital decision-makers and managers.From February 25 to March 20, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey through online questionnaire, and selected obstetric nurses from Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces as the research objects by convenience sampling.Three hundred eighteen valid questionnaires were collected; the results of Symptom Checklist 90 showed that the scores of ""obsessive-compulsive"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""hostility"", ""phobia"", and ""psychosis"" were higher than the Chinese norm (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .01). There were 107 people whose total score of Symptom Checklist 90 was more than 160, and 83 people whose number of positive items was more than 43. Logistic regression results showed that married, temporary employment, lack of support and communication from family and relatives, onerous task, and unbearable responsibility were independent risk factors for mental disorder.There is a great psychological burden for obstetric nurses during the epidemic period. Decision makers should focus on necessary psychological intervention for those that are married, temporarily employed, and those lacking family supports including communication. At the same time, managers should distribute tasks reasonably to avoid psychological burdens caused by overwork.","Li, Chai, Wang, Wang, Dong, Xu, Wu, Binnay, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000028070","20211230","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24467,""

A total of 51 ICU HCWs working at a tertiary care hospital were included in this cross-sectional study conducted before (January 2019-January 2020) and during (January 2021-April 2021) COVID-19 pandemic. Data on sociodemographic and work-related characteristics, COVID 19 history and current mental health issues via Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), Suicidal Ideation Scale (SIS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were recorded.

Quantitatively there was evidence of anxiety, PTSD and depression amongst the staff. Qualitatively, seven themes were identified: Poor working conditions; Lack of skills and knowledge; Psychological/Mental health concerns; Feeling undervalued and abandoned; Fears of contagion; Support and the positive impacts of COVID. The intervention study recommended employing needs-based approaches, including educational and wellbeing components.<b>Conclusion:</b> Recommendations are made in terms of how to work with staff, both practically and clinically. There are also suggestions about how to deal with similar situations if they were to reoccur. It is evident that lessons need to be learned because errors were made.

"Psychological trauma and depression in recovered COVID-19 patients: A telecommunication based observational study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is adversely affecting the mental health of the patients infected with the virus and the psychological impact on recovered COVID-19 patients is not clear. The study aimed to assess Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among COVID-19 patients post recovery from the disease. The cross-sectional study was conducted from November 09, 2020, to December 23, 2020. The study enrolled recovered COVID-19 patients through telemedicine mode from the database of patients provided by the health authorities. National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale [NSESSS] for adults was used for assessing PTSD symptoms and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used for assessing depression. The study enrolled 503 recovered COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 41.90 years. The majority were asymptomatic (64.6%) while 21.5% developed moderate to severe form of the disease. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms and depression was found to be 56.9% and 29.0% respectively. COVID-19 patients with severe form of disease were significantly more affected with PTSD symptoms [vs mild, Odds Ratio (OR)= 18.7, Confidence Interval (CI)= 9.9-35.5] and depression (vs mild, OR= 19.8, CI= 9.9-39.5).

"Teaching psychiatry in a low-income country during the COVID-19 pandemic: A hybrid collaborative psychiatry course","Amoud University in Borama is located in the self-declared state of Somaliland, in the Horn of Africa. Past conflicts and resulting economic hardship have led to a lack of local academic psychiatry faculty and resources. Amoud has been for some years partnering with voluntary faculty in the United Kingdom to teach psychiatry to its medical students through in-person ""teaching missions."" This was recently led by a Borama-native psychiatry resident in Ethiopia. COVID-19 added further hardships due to restrictions to travel and in-person gatherings. These challenges also created the opportunity for the development of an innovative, international, hybrid (online onsite), self-sustaining partnership model which has been successful in improving psychiatry teaching for undergraduate students in 2020-2021 and will continue in 2021-2022. An international, 'online-connected' department of psychiatry comprising a primary care physician in Somaliland, three postgraduate trainees in Ethiopia and the United States, and three senior psychiatrists in the United Kingdom developed a local faculty-led, hybrid-delivered, dynamic curriculum (bedside teaching, in person and online lecturing) that adapted to the needs, resources, faith and culture of Somaliland. While 2020-2021 has been the pilot year for the program, the overall experience has been enriching for students and faculty, leading to valuable cross-cultural conversations with impact on teaching and research. While learning about Somalilanders' and trauma, the program leads, also the authors of this article, have identified ways to harness the resilience and faith of students to bring about improvements in global mental health.","Virani, Handuleh, Pereira-Sanchez, Wolde-Giorgis","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12503","20211231","Academic psychiatry; Somaliland; global mental health; low and low middle-income countries; medical students; teaching psychiatry; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24471,""
"The changing dynamics of neutralizing antibody response within ten months of SARS-CoV-2 infections","There are limited data on how long neutralizing antibody (NAb) response elicited via primary SARS-CoV-2 infection will last. Eighty-four serum samples were obtained from a prospective cohort of 42 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients at the time of discharge from hospital and in the late convalescent phase. Virus neutralization assay was performed to determine the presence and titers of NAbs with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Long-term dynamics of NAbs and factors that may have an impact on humoral immunity were investigated. Mild and moderate/severe patients were compared. The mean sampling time was 11.12Ã‚Â±5.02 days (4-28) for the discharge test and 268.12Ã‚Â±11.65 days (247-296) for the follow-up test. NAb response was present in 83.3% of the patients about 10 months after infection. The detectable long term NAb rate was significantly higher in mild patients when compared to moderate/severe patients (95.7% vs. 68.4%, p=0.025). In the follow-up, Nab-positive and -negative patients were compared to determine the predictors of the presence of long-term humoral immunity. The only significant factor was disease severity. Patients with mild infections have more chance to have NAbs for longer time. Age, gender, and comorbidity did not affect long term NAb response. NAb titers decreased significantly over time, with an average rank of 24.0 vs. 19.1 (p=0.002). Multivariate GEE analysis revealed that no parameter has an impact on the change of NAb titers over time. The majority of the late convalescent patients still had detectable low levels of neutralizing antibodies. The protective effect of these titers of NAbs from re-infections needs further studies.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Physical Performance and Mental Health-A Retrospective Case Series of Belgian Male Professional Football Players","<b>Rationale:</b> As every season, physical performance of players of Royal Antwerp FC's first team was regularly tested and mental well-being and mood were assessed during football season 2020-2021. Just like in the general population, several professional athletes were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during that season. COVID-19 is a complex disorder affecting multiple body systems, potentially damaging lungs, affecting the cardiovascular system or causing muscle weakness. Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 on performance was a major concern for the affected football players and their entourage. <b>Objectives:</b> To retrospectively examine the influence of COVID-19 on physical performance and mental health in professional football athletes during the season 2020-2021. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-three professional athletes (age: 25.37 Ã‚Â± 4.11 years; height: 182.75 Ã‚Â± 7.62 cm; weight: 78.90 Ã‚Â± 8.97 kg) of a Belgian first division football club were assessed weekly during the 2020-2021 season. Weekly assessments comprised strength values of the hamstrings, hip abductors and hip adductors, jump performance, a modified Hooper questionnaire to assess mental status and nose swab PCR tests for COVID-19. Data analysis was performed from 2 weeks prior to COVID-19 contamination up to 8 weeks after the first positive test. <i>Post-hoc</i> Bonferroni correction was applied when performing statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> Eleven players tested positive for COVID-19. Duration of contamination was 13 Ã‚Â± 7 days. There was no statistically significant difference before and after COVID-19 infection for jump performance, and adductor and abductor muscle strength (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05).

"Reductions in the Frequency of Going Out Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Negatively Affect Patients with Spinal Disorders","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly changed the lifestyles of individuals due to the need to prevent disease spread. Globally, governments have enforced various policies, including travel bans, quarantine, home confinement, and lockdowns, as safety measures. Consequently, the frequency of individuals going out has decreased. This survey aimed to assess how decreasing the frequency of going out due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts patients with spinal disorders. This multicenter cross-sectional questionnaire survey included patients who visited four private spine clinics for any symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires pre- and post-pandemic that assessed the following topics: frequency of leaving home, exercise habits, locomotive syndrome, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Patients were divided into decreased and non-decreased frequency of going out groups, according to observed changes in their frequencies of leaving home. Both groups were statistically compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with the frequency of going out. Among 855 patients, 160 (18.7%; the decreased group) reported that they went out less frequently, and 695 (81.3%; the non-decreased group) reported that they left home equally frequently post- versus pre-pandemic. Multivariate analyses showed that exercise habits significantly decreased (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.67, p = 0.004), the incidence of locomotive syndrome significantly increased (aOR = 2.86, p = 0.012), and HRQOL significantly deteriorated (aOR = 4.14, p &lt; 0.001) in the decreased group compared to the non-decreased group. Restrictions regarding leaving home due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly decreased exercise frequency, increased the occurrence of locomotive syndrome, and were associated with deterioration of HRQOL in patients with spine disorders. It may be beneficial for spine surgeons to encourage patients with spinal disorders to leave home at a frequency similar to what they did pre-pandemic while avoiding crowded areas, despite the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Terai, Iwamae, Tamai, Takahashi, Hori, Ohyama, Yabu, Hoshino, Nakamura","https://doi.org/10.22603/ssrr.2021-0088","20211231","COVID-19; exercise habit; frequency of going out; locomotive syndrome; pandemic; quality of life; spinal disorder; staying at home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24474,""

"Components of Unrealistic Optimism of College Students: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic","College students are among the most strongly affected populations by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of uncertainty regarding academic success, future careers, and social life during their study period. Their mental health and behavior may dramatically be impacted. The study examined an unrealistic optimism of Israeli college students in assessing the health, security, and economic risks during the pandemic, and the contributions of these perceived risks to the prediction of psychological coping responses, such as well-being, and coping suppressing response of anxiety, expressed during this pandemic. Using social networks, a questionnaire was disseminated to students during the third lockdown that was implemented in Israel because of the pandemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived threats, resilience, well-being, hope, and morale were measured using a structured quantitative questionnaire. First, we hypothesized that the three perceived risks would be inversely rated, so perceived health risk would be rated lowest, and perceived economic risk would be rated highest. The second and third hypotheses claimed that psychological coping responses articulated along this pandemic would be predicted by all these perceived risks, as well as the observance of pandemic precaution rules. The fourth hypothesis suggested that the three investigated perceived risks will positively and significantly correlate with each other. The results generally supported the hypotheses and indicated that the unrealistic optimism process was employed quite consistently by the participating students.","Eshel, Kimhi, Marciano, Adini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.763581","20211231","COVID-19; college students; distress symptoms; individual resilience; perceived risks; unrealistic optimism; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24476,""
"Physical and Psychosocial Well-Being of Hospitalized and Non-Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 Compared to the General Population in Qatar","<b>Background:</b> Many studies have shown a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in COVID-19 patients and the general population. However, very few studies directly examined the potential impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and none compared HRQoL in COVID-19 patients to the general population amid the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> We carried out a cross-sectional study comparing HRQoL (as measured using the RAND Short Form 36 or SF-36 Health Survey) in randomly selected individuals from three different groups: hospitalized COVID-19 patients, quarantined COVID-19 patients, and controls from the general population in Qatar. We constructed a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to compare the SF-36 scores between the three groups and control for various covariates. <b>Results:</b> Our sample consisted of 141 COVID-19 inpatients, 99 COVID-19 quarantined patients, and 285 healthy controls. Surprisingly, we found that HRQoL was higher in COVID-19 hospitalized than in COVID-19 non-hospitalized patients than in controls. The main components where COVID-patients scored higher than controls were physical functioning and role limitations due to emotional problems. In COVID-19 patients, the female gender, older age, and past psychiatric history were associated with lower HRQoL. <b>Conclusions:</b> It seems that COVID-19 patient's HRQoL might be better than expected.

The mental health of international students studying abroad has been neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially Chinese students who have been unfairly targeted. <b>Objective:</b> To explore and document the positive and negative experiences of a group of Hong Kong Chinese international students studying in the U.K. and U.S. from an insider perspective in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> The qualitative study used four 1.5-h online focus group interviews of 20 Chinese international students from Hong Kong aged 18 or older studying in universities in the United Kingdom or the United States, from 3 May to 12 May 2020. A framework approach with a semi-structured interview guide was used to reflect students' stressors, cognitive appraisals, coping, and outcomes (negative impacts and positive gains), in the early stages of COVID-19. Different strategies were used to ensure the credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability of the study. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic content analysis. <b>Results:</b> Twenty full-time international University students (60% female, 90% aged 18-25 years and 65% undergraduates) were recruited. Students reported (i) stress from personal (e.g., worries about health and academic attainment), interpersonal (e.g., perceived prejudice and lack of social support), and environmental factors (e.g., uncertainties about academic programme and unclear COVID-19-related information); (ii) significant differences in culture and cognitive appraisal in the levels of perceived susceptibility and severity; (iii) positive thinking and using alternative measures in meeting challenges, which included effective emotion and problem coping strategies, and the importance of support from family, friends and schools; and (iv) negative psychological impact (e.g., worries and stress) and positive personal growth in crisis management and gains in family relationships. <b>Conclusions:</b> With the rise in sinophobia and uncertain developments of the pandemic, proactive support from government and academic institutions are urgently needed to reduce stress and promote the well-being of international students, especially Chinese students in the U.K. and U.S. Clear information, public education and policies related to the pandemic, appropriate academic arrangements from universities and strong support systems play important roles in maintaining students' psychological health. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> The study was registered with the National Institutes of Health (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier: NCT04365361).","Lai, Sit, Lam, Choi, Yiu, Lai, Ip, Lam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.738474","20211231","COVID-19; Chinese; coping; international; phenomenological study; positive and negative experience; stress; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24478,""
"The adverse impact of COVID-19 on men's health","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to devastating health outcomes across the world. Initially thought to primarily affect the respiratory system, there is now clear and abundant evidence that COVID-19 can impact upon the male genitourinary system and overall men's health. In this review article, we explore the potential mechanisms by which COVID-19 specifically affects men and we review the literature examining the adverse effects of the disease on men's health. Studies suggest that men are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and death. COVID-19 infection has a negative impact on men's health including worsening semen parameters, potentially lower testosterone levels, and an increased risk of erectile dysfunction. COVID-19 is a highly pathogenic virus that exerts adverse effects upon the male genitourinary system in myriad ways. The COVID-19 infection can impact serum testosterone, fertility, sexual function, and mental health. Fortunately, the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 infection and many of these sequelae.","Dubin, Bennett, Halpern","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOU.0000000000000966","20211230","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24479,""
"Leveraging Innovation to Design a Psychiatric Mental Health Simulation for Undergraduate Nursing Students During the COVID-19 Global Pandemic","Undergraduate nursing students experience challenges integrating didactic knowledge into the clinical care of clients living with psychiatric mental illness. Simulation can be a successful teaching strategy to mitigate some of these challenges. The aim of this pilot simulation experience was to understand how academic technology and telehealth competencies could be leveraged to support the success of standardized patient simulations for nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from debriefings found that students had greater confidence in their technical skills than their ability to manage their emotional responses to simulation scenarios.","Hudgins, Camp-Spivey, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.NEP.0000000000000922","20211230","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24480,""
"The profile of musculoskeletal pain and its associations with sleep quality and depression during the COVID-19 in Turkey","The current pandemic has affected people's health multidimensionally. This study aims to investigate musculoskeletal pain, sleep quality, depression levels, and their relationships in individuals belonging to different age groups during COVID-19 in Turkey. A web-based self-administered survey that consisted of demographic questions, The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and scores of musculoskeletal pain was sent to participants. Pearson correlation analysis was used for determining the statistical relationship between variables. The study includes 1,778 participants. The highest percentage for mild, moderate, and severe pain was in the head (49.8%), back (15.5%), and head (11.5%), respectively. The PSQI-total had shown a weak correlation with pain levels in all body parts. The highest correlation for sleep quality and pain levels was between the PSQI-5 and lower back pain. There was a weak correlation between PSQI- 2 and the BDI score, and a moderate correlation between the PSQI-1, PSQI-5, PSQI- 7, PSQI-total, and BDI score. Pain in all body parts showed a weak correlation with depression level. This study showed that musculoskeletal pain was varied in body parts with different intensities according to age groups in Turkey during the pandemic. The most common pain was in the head, back, and lower back. Headache was found correlated with the parameters of sleep quality. Pain of the head, neck, back, lower back, and shoulder were correlated with sleep latency. Sleep quality was associated with depression and musculoskeletal pain, while musculoskeletal pain was correlated with depression.","Karatel, Bulut, Sari, Pelin, Yakut","https://doi.org/10.3344/kjp.2022.35.1.78","20211230","COVID-19; Depression; Headache; Low Back Pain; Musculoskeletal Pain; Pain; Pandemics; Sleep; Surveys and Questionnaires.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24481,""
"GP consultation rates for sequelae after acute covid-19 in patients managed in the community or hospital in the UK: population based study","To describe the rates for consulting a general practitioner (GP) for sequelae after acute covid-19 in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and those managed in the community, and to determine how the rates change over time for patients in the community and after vaccination for covid-19. Population based study. 1392 general practices in England contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database. 456Ã¢â‚¬â€°002 patients with a diagnosis of covid-19 between 1 August 2020 and 14 February 2021 (44.7% men; median age 61 years), admitted to hospital within two weeks of diagnosis or managed in the community, and followed-up for a maximum of 9.2 months. A negative control group included individuals without covid-19 (n=38Ã¢â‚¬â€°511) and patients with influenza before the pandemic (n=21Ã¢â‚¬â€°803). Comparison of rates for consulting a GP for new symptoms, diseases, prescriptions, and healthcare use in individuals admitted to hospital and those managed in the community, separately, before and after covid-19 infection, using Cox regression and negative binomial regression for healthcare use. The analysis was repeated for the negative control and influenza cohorts. In individuals in the community, outcomes were also described over time after a diagnosis of covid-19, and compared before and after vaccination for individuals who were symptomatic after covid-19 infection, using negative binomial regression. Relative to the negative control and influenza cohorts, patients in the community (n=437Ã¢â‚¬â€°943) had significantly higher GP consultation rates for multiple sequelae, and the most common were loss of smell or taste, or both (adjusted hazard ratio 5.28, 95% confidence interval 3.89 to 7.17, P&lt;0.001); venous thromboembolism (3.35, 2.87 to 3.91, P&lt;0.001); lung fibrosis (2.41, 1.37 to 4.25, P=0.002), and muscle pain (1.89, 1.63 to 2.20, P&lt;0.001); and also for healthcare use after a diagnosis of covid-19 compared with 12 months before infection. For absolute proportions, the most common outcomes Ã¢â€°Â¥4 weeks after a covid-19 diagnosis in patients in the community were joint pain (2.5%), anxiety (1.2%), and prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (1.2%). Patients admitted to hospital (n=18Ã¢â‚¬â€°059) also had significantly higher GP consultation rates for multiple sequelae, most commonly for venous thromboembolism (16.21, 11.28 to 23.31, P&lt;0.001), nausea (4.64, 2.24 to 9.21, P&lt;0.001), prescriptions for paracetamol (3.68, 2.86 to 4.74, P&lt;0.001), renal failure (3.42, 2.67 to 4.38, P&lt;0.001), and healthcare use after a covid-19 diagnosis compared with 12 months before infection. For absolute proportions, the most common outcomes Ã¢â€°Â¥4 weeks after a covid-19 diagnosis in patients admitted to hospital were venous thromboembolism (3.5%), joint pain (2.7%), and breathlessness (2.8%). In patients in the community, anxiety and depression, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, general pain, nausea, chest tightness, and tinnitus persisted throughout follow-up. GP consultation rates were reduced for all symptoms, prescriptions, and healthcare use, except for neuropathic pain, cognitive impairment, strong opiates, and paracetamol use in patients in the community after the first vaccination dose for covid-19 relative to before vaccination. GP consultation rates were also reduced for ischaemic heart disease, asthma, and gastro-oesophageal disease. GP consultation rates for sequelae after acute covid-19 infection differed between patients with covid-19 who were admitted to hospital and those managed in the community. For individuals in the community, rates of some sequelae decreased over time but those for others, such as anxiety and depression, persisted. Rates of some outcomes decreased after vaccination in this group.","Whittaker, Gulea, Koteci, Kallis, Morgan, Iwundu, Weeks, Gupta, Quint","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-065834","20220101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24482,""
"Thymoma type B2 progression, due to fear of contamination, in association with hydrocephalus: A case report of avoidant behavior during COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus pandemic outbreak caused extreme public fear, health concerns, and psychological distress, especially in oncology patients. The presented rare case is of a 40-year-old female with thymoma type B, with rapid progression, due to fear from the COVID-19 pandemic. Biopsy and histological verification of the tumor show a B-type thymoma with a high proliferative index. The fear of infection is causing avoidant behavior and leads to suboptimal therapy in some oncology patients that will have severe consequences. We can conclude that adequate, personalized, and most importantly, active psychological care is necessary and should be implemented for cancer patients. To be prepared for a future lockdown, it may be helpful to urge patients to seek alternative forms of social contact, such as online and mobile communications, to combat depression lockdown effects.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2021.12.028","20220301","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-02","",24483,""
