"Challenges posed by COVID-19 to people who inject drugs and lessons from other outbreaks","INTRODUCTION: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, considerable effort is going into identifying and protecting those at risk  Criminalization, stigmatization and the psychological, physical, behavioural and economic consequences of substance use make people who inject drugs (PWID) extremely vulnerable to many infectious diseases  While relationships between drug use and blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections are well studied, less attention has been paid to other infectious disease outbreaks among PWID  DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is likely to disproportionally affect PWID due to a high prevalence of comorbidities that make the disease more severe, unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions, stigmatization, common incarceration, homelessness and difficulties in adhering to quarantine, social distancing or self-isolation mandates  The COVID-19 pandemic also jeopardizes essential for PWID services, such as needle exchange or substitution therapy programmes, which can be affected both in a short- and a long-term perspective  Importantly, there is substantial evidence of other infectious disease outbreaks in PWID that were associated with factors that enable COVID-19 transmission, such as poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions and communal ways of using drugs  CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 crisis might increase risks of homelessnes, overdoses and unsafe injecting and sexual practices for PWID  In order to address existing inequalities, consultations with PWID advocacy groups are vital when designing inclusive health response to the COVID-19 pandemic","Vasylyeva, Tetyana I.; Smyrnov, Pavlo; Strathdee, Steffanie; Friedman, Samuel R.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25583","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society;23(7):e25583-e25583, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society;23(7):e25583-e25583, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-26","",3400,""

"Retraction and republication: cardiac toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (The Lancet, (S0140673620311740), (101016/S0140-6736(20)31174-0))","A recent Lancet Article by Mandeep Mehra and colleagues, which reported adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment in patients with COVID-19, has been retracted by three of the authors,1 along with our linked Comment that provided a commentary on the Article and its findings,2 because the veracity of the data underlying this observational study could not be assured by the study authors  Subsequently, an article that used data from the same Surgisphere database, and which was authored by some of the same individuals, was retracted from the New England Journal of Medicine  Nevertheless, the debate about hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 continues  Here, we provide a discussion of what is currently known about its proven and potential harms  Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline that prolongs ventricular repolarisation, as evidenced by prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) on the electrocardiogram 3 QTc prolongation can be associated with a specific ventricular arrhythmia called torsade de pointes, which, although often self-terminating, can degenerate into ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, leading to death  Torsade de pointes is a rare event, with an estimated annual crude rate of 3Â·2 per million population;the incidence is almost doubled in women compared with men and increases with age 4 Drug-induced torsade de pointes mostly occurs by blockade of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier channels in the presence of several risk factors, including high drug concentration, simultaneous exposure to multiple QTc-prolonging drugs, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypokalaemia, bradycardia, or congenital long-QT syndrome, among others 5 Severe proarrhythmic events with hydroxychloroquine were first reported in 1992 in the WHO pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase  Although under-reporting is expected in pharmacovigilance databases, the incidence of cardiac adverse events remained very low during decades of prescription, and previous reports were mainly concerned with overdose situations  We recently analysed cases of prolonged QT interval, cardiac conduction disorders, and torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia associated with hydroxychloroquine in VigiBase before the COVID-19 pandemic 6 Using disproportionality analysis, we found a significant association between hydroxychloroquine and the reporting of prolonged QT interval or torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia versus the same adverse events with all other drugs in the database  However, the number of cases was small: 85 for prolonged QT interval and 83 for torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia  Seven (8%) of the 83 cases of torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia were fatal  The risks of cardiac adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic might increase for several reasons  Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have multiple risk factors for drug-induced proarrhythmia: hypokalaemia, in the 3Â·0-3Â·4 mmol/L range, is common;fever amplifies drug-induced blockade of cardiac rapid delayed rectifier channels;and an increase in interleukin-6 concentrations, as seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been suggested as a mechanism of the QT prolongation associated with inflammation 7 Also, high doses of hydroxychloroquine are often administered in COVID-19, many patients receive co-prescriptions with QT-prolonging drugs, including azithromycin,7,8 and about 30% of patients with COVID-19 have myocardial injury 9 These are risk factors for torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia 5 QTc prolongation associated with hydroxychloroquine is amplified in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 patients, with 10â€“20% of patients with COVID-19 having QTc values of more than 500 ms 10 However, QTc prolongation is not the only mechanism that might be associated with an increased incidence of cardiac adverse events with hydroxychloroquine  QRS interval duration, a sodium-channel-dependent ventricul r conduction parameter, is increased in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine 10 Sodium-channel blockade is amplified in depolarised cardiomyocytes, as is seen in myocardial ischaemia, and by rapid heart rates, two conditions that are associated with hypoxia and COVID-19 9,11 This mechanism is known to be associated with re-entrant ventricular tachycardia, heart failure, and mortality 5 Recent randomised clinical trials have confirmed that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce mortality of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 12 The hydroxychloroquine arm of the RECOVERY trial, which used high doses of hydroxychloroquine, was stopped with preliminary results showing possible excess mortality with hydroxychloroquine (25Â·7% with hydroxychloroquine vs 23Â·5% with usual care;hazard ratio 1Â·11 [95% CI 0Â·98â€“1Â·26];p=0Â·10) 13 The same trend was found in an observational study in which the adjusted odds ratio of cardiac arrest with hydroxychloroquine alone compared with no hydroxychloroquine was 1Â·91 (95% CI 0Â·96â€“3Â·81)and was significantly increased if hydroxychloroquine was combined with azithromycin (2Â·13 [1Â·12â€“4Â·05]);8 however, mortality was not increased  Several arguments support the hypothesis that hydroxychloroquine, in addition to having no beneficial effect in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, might have potentially fatal cardiac effects  We declare no competing interests","Funck-Brentano, C.; Nguyen, L.

"Poor quality of sleep and its consequences on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected all Italy. The extreme virulence, the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. Methods Through an internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole COVID-19 lockdown (from 10thMarch â€“ 1st phase - to 4th May â€“ 2nd phase). We investigated the socio-demographic and COVID-19 related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study - sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales â€“ 21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. Results 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers reveal several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died due to COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythm characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, extremely severe levels of stress, of anxiety, and of depression. Conclusions This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole lockdown in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population have had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be taken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 health emergency.","Christian Franceschini et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46228-DDF-9E6","20200725","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Sleep-wake Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; sleep habits; sleep quality; depression; italian lockdown; clinical psychology; stress; anxiety; risk factor; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-26","",3429,""
"Understanding the lived experiences of Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interpretative phenomenological analysis","Background: Little research has examined mental health and well-being in the context of healthcare professionals (HCP) working during the COVID-19 pandemic within the UK. To our knowledge, no research has employed qualitative methodologies in order to examine this. We therefore aim to address this gap in research by qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to qualitatively examine the lived experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one broadly captured present and future challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic. Theme two captured the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs and theme three captured HCPsâ€™ perceptions of the attitudes of the general public towards HCPs. Conclusions: To the authorsâ€™ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort.","Emily Mcglinchey et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032","20200724","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; mental health; healthcare professionals; psychological wellbeing; qualitative research; covid-19; key workers","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-26","",3430,""
