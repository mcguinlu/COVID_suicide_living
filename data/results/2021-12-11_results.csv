"COVID-19-Related Stigma and Mental Health of Children and Adolescents During Pandemic","This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms of the children/grandchildren of COVID-19 patients, children/grandchildren of healthcare workers who have not infected COVID-19, and children/grandchildren of the control group. Parent and children's perception about COVID-19-related stigma is also investigated and compared between groups. The perception about COVID-19-related stigma between different age and gender groups among children also investigated and compared. The mental health of the 71 participants aged 6-18Ã‚Â years was evaluated <i>via</i> a telemedicine-based semi-structured interview between March and April 2020. Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), and COVID-19-Related Stigma Form were administered to the participants. A significant negative correlation was found between age and separation anxiety disorder (<i>p</i> = .005) and a significant positive correlation was found between age and generalized anxiety disorder (<i>p</i> = .035) in the SCARED-Child report. Generalized anxiety disorder was found to be higher in females compared to males. A significant difference was found between the groups of parents in the COVID-19-Related Stigma Form. Patients infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, and the control group have different perceptions about COVID-19-related stigma. The age of the children have an impact on stigma perceptions. Anxiety symptoms of children affected by age and gender. Future studies are recommended to determine the other factors associated with perceptions about COVID-19-related stigma among children and parents.","Ozbaran, Turer, Yilancioglu, Kose, Senturk Pilan, Guzel, Baskol, Polat, Bildik, Sertoz, Arda, Ozhan","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211059408","20211208","COVID-19; Stigma; anxiety; child psychiatry; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23488,""

"[Suicide in the police crime statistics]","Although suicide is not aÃ‚Â criminal offence and the person who commits suicide is neither aÃ‚Â victim nor aÃ‚Â perpetrator in the classic police sense, suicides are the subject of police investigations and sometimes even recorded in the police crime statistics. In the state of Bavaria, available data go back to 1986. The present analysis provides information about the development of suicides registered by the police, the social characteristics of the individuals who commit suicide, and the methods and circumstances for suicide. In particular, the extent to which the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on suicide risk is examined. Descriptive statistical analysis of completed and attempted suicides based on the Bavarian police crime statistics from 1986-2020. The number of suicide deaths has continuously declined over the decades. This positive trend is also visible in the reporting year 2020, which is profoundly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the persons who commit suicide are male and older than the age ofÃ‚Â 60. Hanging is the most commonly used method to commit suicide and the circumstances for doing so are often aÃ‚Â mental or physical illness. Prevention of danger is an important duty of police. Data generated by the police, experience-based knowledge, and police intervention and influence can help prevent suicides. The statistical recording of suicides in the police crime statistics is aÃ‚Â valuable addition to the causes of death statistics and provides aÃ‚Â basis for optimizing prevention and emergency care. HINTERGRUND UND ZIEL: Obwohl der Suizid keinen Straftatbestand erfÃƒÂ¼llt und der Suizident weder Opfer noch TÃƒÂ¤ter im klassischen polizeilichen Sinne ist, sind Suizide Gegenstand polizeilicher Ermittlungen und werden mitunter in der Polizeilichen Kriminalstatistik (PKS) erfasst. Im Bundesland Bayern reichen verfÃƒÂ¼gbare Daten bis in das Jahr 1986 zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Die Auswertungen sollen Aufschluss geben ÃƒÂ¼ber die Entwicklung der polizeilich registrierten Suizide, soziale Merkmale der Suizidenten sowie ÃƒÂ¼ber Suizidmethoden und -auslÃƒÂ¶ser. Insbesondere wird betrachtet, inwieweit sich die ersten Monate der COVID-19-Pandemie auf die SuizidgefÃƒÂ¤hrdung ausgewirkt haben. Deskriptive statistische Analyse der vollendeten und versuchten Suizide anhand der bayerischen PKS der Jahre 1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2020. Die Zahl der Suizidtoten ist ÃƒÂ¼ber die Jahrzehnte konstant rÃƒÂ¼cklÃƒÂ¤ufig. Diese positive Entwicklung hat auch im Berichtsjahr 2020 Bestand, das durch die weitreichenden Folgen der COVID-19-Pandemie gezeichnet ist. Der GroÃƒÅ¸teil der Suizidenten ist mÃƒÂ¤nnlich und ÃƒÂ¼ber 60Ã‚Â Jahre alt. Als Suizidmethode dominiert das ErhÃƒÂ¤ngen. Als AuslÃƒÂ¶ser fÃƒÂ¼r den Suizid wird zumeist eine (psychische) Erkrankung ermittelt. Die Gefahrenabwehr ist eine wichtige Aufgabe der Polizei. Polizeilich generierte Daten, Erfahrungswissen sowie Eingriffs- und EinflussmÃƒÂ¶glichkeiten der Polizei kÃƒÂ¶nnen zur Verhinderung von Suiziden beitragen.

"Effectiveness of live health professional-led group eHealth interventions for adult mental health: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse impacts on adult mental health and substance use worldwide. Systematic reviews suggest eHealth interventions can be effective at addressing these problems. However, strong positive eHealth outcomes are often tied to the intensity of online therapist guidance, which has cost implications that can make the population scale-up of more effective interventions difficult. A way to offset cost while maintaining the intensity of therapist guidance is to offer eHealth programs to groups rather than more standard one-on-one or asynchronous formats. To examine randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for health professional-led group interventions delivered entirely live by videoconference, teleconference, or online chat on mental health, substance use, or bereavement among community-based adults. Within articles selected for our primary aim, we also examined the impact of eHealth interventions that encouraged physical activity on mental health outcomes relative to those that did not. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library) were searched in July 2020. Eligible studies included RCTs of eHealth interventions targeting mental health, substance use, or bereavement as primary outcomes among community-dwelling adults. Post-intervention data was used to calculate effect size by study. Results were summarized by outcome, eHealth platform, and intervention length. Results were summarized using the SWiM (Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Of the 4,099 identified studies, 21 RCTs representing 20 interventions met inclusion criteria. The 21 studies examined mental health outcomes among 2,438 participants (sample size range: 47 to 361 participants per study) across seven countries. When effects sizes were pooled, live group eHealth interventions led by health professionals had a medium effect on anxiety compared to passive (d = 0.57) or active control (d = 0.48), a medium to small effect on depression compared to passive (d = 0.61) or active control (d = 0.21), and mixed effects on mental distress and coping. No eligible RCTs that had examined intervention effects on substance use or bereavement were found. When eHealth platforms were compared, interventions led by videoconference had the most robust effects on mental health. When intervention length was examined, those that provided 8-12 hours of live health professional-led group contact had more robust effects on adult mental health than longer programs. Risk of bias was high in 90.5% (19/21) of studies chiefly due to problems blinding participants in behavioral trials. Heterogeneity across interventions was significant, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence. Live eHealth group interventions led by health professionals can foster moderate improvements in anxiety, and moderate to small improvements in depression among community-based adults, particularly those delivered by videoconference, and those providing 8-12 contact hours of synchronous engagement.

"Posttraumatic stress disorders and influencing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study of frontline nurses","To assess the extent of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and severity, factors motivating work continuation, and factors influencing PTSD development among frontline nurses caring for patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has an emotional toll on nurses. Exposure to traumatic events associated with the pandemic places frontline nurses at risk for developing PTSD. Cross-sectional study. Frontline nurses (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 370) who cared for COVID-19 patients in three governmental hospitals in the United Arab Emirates were recruited from November 2020 to January 2021. The self-reported Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) was used to assess PTSD. The motivational factors for work continuation explored were: work-related factors (e.g., availability of personal protective equipment and management recognition), family support, and obligation to care. We used correlation and multiple regression analyses to investigate factors that influenced PDS score, including sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, exercising status, and general health status), work factors (e.g., hospital type [COVID vs non-COVID], prior work experience, and encountering deaths), and factors motivating work continuation. The reporting of this study was consistent with STROBE guidelines. In total, 36.2% participants had a probable PTSD diagnosis (PDS score Ã¢â€°Â¥28) with most reporting unwanted memories. Family support (95.9%) and management recognition (90.8%) were the most frequently reported motivating factors. Factors significantly associated with higher PDS score were smoking, lack of management recognition, not exercising, and encountering COVID-19 deaths; the correlation and regression coefficients (b) were significant (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Policy makers must expand healthcare policies to address frontline nurses' mental health as a priority during the pandemic.

"A cross-sectional study on perceived workplace health support and health-related quality of life","Many companies in Japan have been increasingly interested in ""health and productivity management (H&amp;PM)."" In terms of H&amp;PM, we hypothesized that companies can enhance their employees' perceived workplace health support (PWHS) by supporting workers' lively working and healthy living. This could then improve their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by increasing PWHS. Consequently, this study explored the relationship between PWHS and HRQOL. In December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an Internet-based nationwide health survey of Japanese workers (CORoNaWork study). A database of 27Ã‚Â 036 participants was created. The intensity of PWHS was measured using a four-point Likert scale. We used multilevel ordered logistic regression to analyze the relationship between PWHS intensity and the four domains of the Centers for Disease Control's HRQOL-4 (self-rated health, number of poor physical health days, number of poor mental health days, and activity limitation days during the past 30Ã‚Â days). In the sex- and age-adjusted and multivariate models, the intensity of PWHS significantly affected self-rated health and the three domains of unhealthy days (physical, mental, and activity limitation). There was also a trend toward worse HRQOL scores as the PWHS decreased. We found that the higher the PWHS of Japanese workers, the higher their self-rated health and the fewer their unhealthy days. Companies need to assess workers' PWHS and HRQOL and promote H&amp;PM. H&amp;PM is also necessary to maintain and promote the health of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kurogi, Ikegami, Eguchi, Tsuji, Tateishi, Nagata, Matsuda, Fujino, Ogami","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12302","20211208","COVID-19; health and productivity management; health-related quality of life; perceived workplace health support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23495,""
"In the Face of Potential Harm: The Predictive Validity of Neural Correlates of Performance Monitoring for Perceived Risk, Stress, and Internalizing Psychopathology During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major life stressor posing serious threats not only to physical but also to mental health. To better understand mechanisms of vulnerability and identify individuals at risk for psychopathological symptoms in response to stressors is critical for prevention and intervention. The error-related negativity (ERN) has been discussed as a neural risk marker for psychopathology, and this study examined its predictive validity for perceived risk, stress, and psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 113 individuals who had participated as healthy control participants in previous electroencephalography studies (2014-2019) completed a follow-up online survey during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany. Associations of pre-pandemic ERN and correct-response negativity (CRN) with perceived risk regarding COVID-19 infection, stress, and internalizing symptoms during the pandemic were examined using mediation models. Pre-pandemic ERN and CRN were associated with increased perceived risk regarding a COVID-19 infection. Via this perceived risk, the ERN and CRN were associated with increased stress during the pandemic. Furthermore, risk perception and stress mediated indirect effects of ERN and CRN on internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, while controlling for the effects of pre-pandemic symptom levels. In summary, heightened pre-pandemic performance monitoring showed indirect associations with increases in psychopathological symptoms during the first COVID-19 wave via effects on perceived COVID-19 risk and stress. These results further strengthen the notion of performance monitoring event-related potentials as transdiagnostic neural risk markers and highlight the relevance of stress as a catalyst for symptom development.","Riesel, HÃƒÂ¤rpfer, Kathmann, Klawohn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.08.004","20211208","Biological risk markers; COVID-19 pandemic; Event-related potentials; Mediation models; Psychopathology; Vulnerability pathways","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23496,""
"Potential molecular link between the ÃŽÂ²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt) enzyme in Lesch-Nyhan disease and cancer","Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked inherited neurogenetic disorders of purine metabolic in which the cytoplasmic enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt) is defective. Despite having been characterized over 60 years ago, however, up to now, there is no satisfactory explanation of how deficits in enzyme HGprt can lead to LND with the development of the persistent and severe self-injurious behavior. Recently, a role for epistasis between the mutated hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (<i>HPRT1</i>) and the ÃŽÂ²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes affecting the regulation of alternative APP pre-mRNA splicing in LND has been demonstrated. Furthermore, there were also some reported cases of LND developing thrombosis while APP is an important regulator of vein thrombosis and controls coagulation. Otherwise, the surface expression of HGprt enzyme was also observed in several somatic tissue cancers while APP and the APP-like protein-2 (APLP2) are deregulated in cancer cells and linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The present review provides a discussion about these findings and suggests a potential molecular link between APP and HGprt via epistasis between <i>HPRT1</i> and <i>APP</i> genes affecting the regulation of alternative APP pre-mRNA splicing. As a perspective, expression vectors for HGprt enzyme and APP are constructed as described in Ref. # 24 (Nguyen KV, Naviaux RK, Nyhan WL (2020) Lesch-Nyhan disease: I. Construction of expression vectors for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt) enzyme and amyloid precursor protein (APP). <i>Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids</i> 39: 905-922), and they could be used as tools for clarification of these issues. In addition, these expression vectors, especially the one with the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor can be used as a model for the construction of expression vectors for any protein targeting to the cell plasma membrane for studying intermolecular interactions and could be therefore useful in the vaccines as well as antiviral drugs development (studying intermolecular interactions between the spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, as well as its variants and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2, in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [43],[44], for example).","Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.3934/Neuroscience.2021030","20211208","APP gene; COVID-19; Lesch-Nyhan disease; alternative splicing; antisense drugs; cancer; epigenetics; epistasis; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) gene; hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt) enzyme; thrombosis; ÃŽÂ²-amyloid precursor protein (APP)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23497,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the perception of home meals and meal-related variables: a large-scale study within the Italian population during the acute phase of the pandemic","Italy was the first European country struck by the COVID-19 epidemic and experienced a national lockdown. This study explored the effect of lockdown on the perception of any meals prepared and/or conducted at home (home meals) and investigated which variables played a role in this. A group of Italians (n=3,060) not suspected/diagnosed as having COVID-19 (18-91 years old; 33% males) completed an online survey during the first lockdown (April 2020). Liking for home meals either increased (51% of the population) or did not vary (43%), while it decreased for only 6% of respondents. Total meal intake similarly either increased (51%) or remained unchanged (33%). Core variables describing meal perception (Liking for meal, Pleasure in meal preparation, Meal duration, Meal Time, Overall food intake, Snack intake) were positively associated with each other. Two clusters with different perceptions of home meals were found, characterised by an increased appreciation (Cl1, 61%) and an unchanged appreciation (Cl2, 39%), respectively. In the acute phase of lockdown, increased meal pleasure was associated with home togetherness (not living alone), cooking with others more often, having high cooking dynamism (use of different kitchen tools, engaging in online food-related activities like using online recipe/website for cooking, use of ready-to-eat meal delivery), and being young, a student or a worker (Cl1). Conversely, Cl2 showed an unchanged meal pleasure, and it was mostly associated with living alone (before and during lockdown), being elderly, retired, widowed, having a low degree of cooking-related activities and dedicating a small weekly budget to food. Variables strictly describing the meal were discussed. Lockdown did not homogenously affect the population in terms of meal pleasure, and high enjoyment of meals was related to high meal involvement. Younger subjects seemed to be more resilient and appreciated meals more due to high cooking dynamism, food-related activities and togetherness. Public health policies could consider these outputs to set up interventions that use meal-dedication activities to increase meal pleasure in vulnerable targets or in subjects experiencing poorly appreciated diets in similar future stressful situations.","Piochi, Buonocore, Spampani, Torri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.104488","20211208","COVID-19; conviviality; cooking dynamism; food engagement; liking; meal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23498,""

"Effectiveness of a Videoconferencing-Delivered Psychological Intervention for Mental Health Problems during COVID-19: A Proof-of-Concept Randomized Clinical Trial","Anxiety and depression have increased markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a lack of evidence-based strategies to address these mental health needs during the pandemic. We aim to conduct a proof-of-concept trial of the efficacy of a brief group-based psychological intervention delivered via videoconferencing for adults in Australia distressed by the pandemic. In this single-blind, parallel, randomised controlled trial, adults who screened positive for COVID-related psychological distress across Australia were randomly allocated to either a 6-session group-based program based on behavioural principles (n = 120) or enhanced usual care (EUC, n = 120). Primary outcome was total score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) anxiety and depression subscales assessed at baseline, 1 week posttreatment, 2 months (primary outcome time point), and 6 months after treatment, as well as secondary outcome measures of worry, sleep impairment, anhedonia, mood, and COVID-19-related stress.

Relative to EUC, at 2 months participants receiving intervention showed greater reduction on anxiety (mean difference, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.3 to 2.6], p = 0.01; effect size, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.7]) and depression (mean difference, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.4 to 2.8], p = 0.009; effect size, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.2 to 0.7]) scales. These effects were maintained at 6 months. There were also greater reductions of worry, anhedonia, COVID-19-related fears, and contamination fears. This trial provides initial evidence that brief group-based behavioural intervention delivered via videoconferencing results in moderate reductions in common psychological problems arising during the COVID-19 pandemic. This program may offer a viable and scalable means to mitigate the rising mental health problems during the pandemic.","Bryant, Dawson, Keyan, Azevedo, Yadav, Tran, Rawson, Harvey","https://doi.org/10.1159/000520283","20211207","Anxiety; Behaviour therapy; COVID-19; Controlled trial; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23501,""

"A brief psycho-social intervention for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among perinatal women in low-and middle-income countries: Need of the hour","COVID-19 vaccines are one of the most effective strategies for preventing COVID-19 infection, as well as the associated mortality and morbidity. Despite the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine acceptance among perinatal women is challenging in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Further, the vaccine hesitancy among perinatal women may have an impact on their children's vaccinations. The purpose of this paper is to briefly discuss the existing research on COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, psychosocial aspects, measures, and the individual level interventions for vaccine hesitancy among perinatal women. In our opinion, there is a need for further research with a specific focus on developing effective and feasible individual-level interventions to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among perinatal women in LMICs.","Ransing, Kukreti, Raghuveer, Puri, Paranjape, Patil, Hegde, Padma, Kumar, Kishore, Deshpande","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102929","20211207","Children; Mental health; Post-partum; Pre-natal; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23503,""
"Trends of depression and anxiety during massive civil unrest and COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 2019-2020","Both COVID-19 and unrest are posing a significant threat to population mental health across the globe. This study examined trends of probable depression and anxiety during a time of civil unrest and concurrent COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Four random digit dialing telephone surveys were conducted in July 2019 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1112), February-March 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2003), April-May 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2008), and July-August 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2034). The prevalence of probable depression increased from 25.7% (95% CI: 23.2-28.3) in July 2019 to 28.2% (95% CI: 26.2-30.1) in February-March 2020, and then decreased to 15.3% (95% CI: 14.0-17.0) in April-May 2020 and 13.7% (95% CI: 12.2-15.2) in July-August 2020. The prevalence of probable anxiety was 19.2% (95% CI: 17.5-20.9) in February-March 2020 and then stabilized in April-May 2020 and July-August 2020 (14.1%, 95% CI: 12.0-15.8). Probable depression and anxiety were more prevalent among persons with high relative to low daily routine disruptions. Combined high unrest-COVID-19 stress was associated with probable depression and anxiety across all persons; high unrest stress alone was associated with probable mental disorders at high daily routine disruptions. Civil unrest and COVID-19 are jointly associated with depression and anxiety among Hong Kong citizens. While population mental health improved, daily routine disruptions is a risk factor of mental disorders at every time-point.","Hou, Li, Liang, Liu, Ettman, Hobfoll, Lee, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.11.037","20211207","Anxiety; COVID-19; Civil unrest; Daily routines; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23504,""
"Exploring American Parents' Lived Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Ramifications for Well-Being","The objective of this study was to document the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on parents and families in the United States. Parents' experiences during the pandemic were examined using an online survey (N = 564) collected during May and June 2020. Parents reported experiencing a high frequency of COVID-19-related events (e.g., job loss and health concerns) and impact on their lives. Parents' experiences with COVID-19, as well as self-reported perceived increase in home labor, experiences with assisting children with remote schooling, and work-life conflict were all significantly associated with higher levels of parental role overload. COVID-19-related events and impact, as well as parental role overload, significantly predicted parents' anxiety and depression, even after controlling for demographic factors. The findings suggest the importance of providing support for parents and families through direct services and public policy changes.","Kaugars, Holly, Tait, Oswald","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab120","20211207","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23505,""
"An age-structured SEIR model for COVID-19 incidence in Dublin, Ireland with framework for evaluating health intervention cost","Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 have primarily involved lockdown measures with substantial economic and social costs with varying degrees of success. Morbidity patterns of COVID-19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe COVID-19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted. This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios, which could assist policy makers with regard to minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective suppression strategies. Our work originates from an Irish context and we use disease monitoring data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish governmental agencies. We demonstrate how Irish lockdown scenarios can be constructed using the proposed model formulation and show results of retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with relevant ""what if / instead of"" lockdown counterfactuals. Uncertainty quantification for the predictive approaches is described. Our formulation is agnostic to a specific locale, in that lockdown strategies in other regions can be straightforwardly encoded using this model.","Jaouimaa, Dempsey, Van Osch, Kinsella, Burke, Wyse, Sweeney","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260632","20211207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23506,""
"Are smokers scared by COVID-19 risk? How fear and comparative optimism influence smokers' intentions to take measures to quit smoking","Research suggests that smoking may compound the risk of serious health problems to smokers who contract COVID-19. This study examines whether and how exposure to news stories reporting the severe COVID-19 risk to smokers may influence smokers' emotional responses (fear, anxiety, and sadness) and intentions to take measures to quit smoking. Current smokers in the US participated in an online experiment (N = 495) and were randomized to read smoking risk news stories or news stories reporting the combined risk of smoking and COVID-19. We found that combined risk news stories lead to participants feeling more fearful and sadder than when they viewed smoking risk news stories (M = 5.74; SD = 2.57 vs. M = 5.20; SD = 2.74; p &lt; .05). Fear fully mediated the effect of news exposure on intentions to take measures to quit smoking (ÃƒÅ¸ = .09; SE = 05; 95% CI [.010, .200]). Moreover, moderated-mediation analyses revealed that the mediating effect of fear was conditioned on the levels of comparative optimism, such that the association between fear and intentions to take measures to quit smoking was only significant among smokers whose comparative optimism was at the mean score (ÃƒÅ¸ = .16; SE = 05; 95% CI [.071, .250]), and for those whose comparative optimism was high (ÃƒÅ¸ = .27; SE = .06; 95% CI [.146, .395]). These results suggest that fear of the pandemic and optimism might play important roles in predicting and explaining the association between exposure to news stories and intentions to take measures to quit smoking. Messages about heightened risk of COVID-19 complications for smokers that increase fear might be an effective strategy to motivate smokers to quit. Such messages should be used to turn the adversity of COVID-19 pandemic into an intervention opportunity to reduce tobacco-related disease.","Duong, Massey, Churchill, Popova","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260478","20211207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23507,""
"Post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients with primary SjÃƒÂ¶gren's syndrome after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection","To analyse the frequency and characteristics of post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients with primary SjÃƒÂ¶gren's syndrome (pSS) affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. By the first week of April 2021, all centres included in the Big Data SjÃƒÂ¶gren Consortium were contacted asking for patients included in the Registry diagnosed with SARSCoV-2 infection according to the ECDC guidelines. According to the NICE definitions, symptoms related to COVID-19 were classified as acute COVID-19 (signs and symptoms for up to 4 weeks), ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (presence of signs and symptoms from 4 to 12 weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (signs and symptoms that continue for &gt; 12 weeks not explained by an alternative diagnosis after a protocolized study). We identified 132 patients who were followed a mean follow-up of 137.8 days (ranging from 5 days to 388 days) after being diagnosed with COVID-19. In the last visit, 75 (57%) patients remained symptomatic: 68 (52%) remained symptomatic for more than 4 weeks fulfilling the NICE definition for ongoing symptomatic post-COVID-19, and 38 (29%) remained symptomatic for more than 12 weeks fulfilling the definition of post-COVID-19 syndrome. More than 40% of pSS patients reported the persistence of four symptoms or more, including anxiety/depression (59%), arthralgias (56%), sleep disorder (44%), fatigue (40%), anosmia (34%) and myalgias (32%). Age-sex adjusted multivariate analysis identified raised LDH levels (OR 10.36), raised CRP levels (OR 7.33), use of hydroxychloroquine (OR 3.51) and antiviral agents (OR 3.38), hospital admission (OR 8.29), mean length of hospital admission (OR 1.1) and requirement of supplemental oxygen (OR 6.94) as factors associated with a higher risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome. A sensitivity analysis including hospital admission in the adjusted model confirmed raised CRP levels (OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.33-104.44) and use of hydroxychloroquine (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.00-6.47) as the key independent factors associated with an enhanced risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome. This is the first study that analyses the frequency and characteristics of post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients affected by a systemic autoimmune disease. We found that 57% of patients with pSS affected by COVID-19 remain symptomatic after a mean follow-up of 5 months. The risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients who required hospitalisation was 8-times higher than in non-hospitalised patients, with baseline raised CRP levels and the use of hydroxychloroquine being independent risk factors for post-COVID-19.","Brito-ZerÃƒÂ³n, Acar-Denizli, RomÃƒÂ£o, Armagan, Seror, Carubbi, Melchor, Priori, Valim, Retamozo, Pasoto, Trevisani, Hofauer, SzÃƒÂ¡ntÃƒÂ³, Inanc, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Molina, Sebastian, Bartoloni, Devauchelle-Pensec, Akasbi, Giardina, Bandeira, SisÃƒÂ³-Almirall, Ramos-Casals","https://www.google.com/search?q=Post-COVID-19+syndrome+in+patients+with+primary+SjÃƒÂ¶gren's+syndrome+after+acute+SARS-CoV-2+infection.","20211207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23508,""
"Trends in the Incidence of New-Onset Anorexia Nervosa and Atypical Anorexia Nervosa Among Youth During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable mental health consequences for children and adolescents, including the exacerbation of previously diagnosed eating disorders. Whether the pandemic is a factor associated with the concomitant increase in new-onset anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa remains unknown. To assess the incidence and severity of newly diagnosed anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa in a national sample of youth before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This repeated cross-sectional study analyzed new eating disorder assessments that were conducted at 6 pediatric tertiary-care hospitals in Canada between January 1, 2015, and November 30, 2020. Patients aged 9 to 18 years with a new anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis at the index assessment were included. COVID-19-associated public health confinement measures during the first wave of the pandemic (March 1 to November 30, 2020). Primary outcomes were the incidence and hospitalization rates within 7 days of de novo anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Event rate trends during the first wave were compared with trends in the 5-year prepandemic period (January 1, 2015, to February 28, 2020) using an interrupted time series with linear regression models. Demographic and clinical variables were compared using a Ãâ€¡2 test for categorical data and t tests for continuous data. Overall, 1883 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa (median [IQR] age, 15.9 [13.8-16.9] years; 1713 female patients [91.0%]) were included. Prepandemic anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa diagnoses were stable over time (mean [SD], 24.5 [1.6] cases per month; ÃŽÂ² coefficient, 0.043; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.33). New diagnoses increased during the first wave of the pandemic to a mean (SD) of 40.6 (20.1) cases per month with a steep upward trend (ÃŽÂ² coefficient, 5.97; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Similarly, hospitalizations for newly diagnosed patients increased from a mean (SD) of 7.5 (2.8) to 20.0 (9.8) cases per month, with a significant increase in linear trend (ÃŽÂ² coefficient, -0.008 vs 3.23; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). These trends were more pronounced in Canadian provinces with higher rates of COVID-19 infections. Markers of disease severity were worse among patients who were diagnosed during the first wave rather than before the pandemic, including more rapid progression (mean [SD], 7.0 [4.2] months vs 9.8 [7.4] months; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), greater mean (SD) weight loss (19.2% [9.4%] vs 17.5% [9.6%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), and more profound bradycardia (mean [SD] heart rate, 57 [15.8] beats per minute vs 63 [15.9] beats per minute; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). This cross-sectional study found a higher number of new diagnoses of and hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa in children and adolescents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.

"How COVID-19 Affected Healthcare Workers in the Hospital Locked Down due to Early COVID-19 Cases in Korea","The healthcare workers (HCWs) were exposed to never-experienced psychological distress during the early stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of HCWs during the hospital lockdown period due to mass healthcare-associated infection during the early spread of COVID-19. A real-time online survey was conducted between April 14-18, 2020 among HCWs who worked at the university hospital where COVID-19 was confirmed in a patient, and the hospital was shut down for 3 weeks. Along with demographic variables and work-related information, psychological distress was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey scale, and the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9. The HCWs working in the cohort ward and those who have experienced social discrimination had significantly higher level of depression (PHQ-9 score; 5.24 Ã‚Â± 4.48 vs. 4.15 Ã‚Â± 4.38; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01 and 5.89 Ã‚Â± 4.78 vs. 3.25 Ã‚Â± 3.77; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively) and anxiety (GAD-7 score; 3.69 Ã‚Â± 3.68 vs. 2.87 Ã‚Â± 3.73; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 and 4.20 Ã‚Â± 4.22 vs. 2.17 Ã‚Â± 3.06; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively) compared to other HCWs. Worries regarding the peer relationship and the skepticism about job were associated with depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.79; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 and OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.31-2.17; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively) and anxiety (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21-2.49; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01 and OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.17; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, respectively), while fear of infection or worsening of health was not. Path analysis showed that work-related stress associated with the viral epidemic rather than anxiety about the viral epidemic mainly contributed to depression. The present observational study indicates that mental health problems of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 are associated with distress in work and social relationship. Early intervention programs focusing on these factors are necessary.","Lee, Ahn, Byun, Lee, Kweon, Chung, Shin, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e325","20211207","COVID-19; Healthcare Workers; Psychological Distress; Social Discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23510,""
"Emotional Distress of the COVID-19 Cluster Infection on Health Care Workers Working at a National Hospital in Korea","Frontline healthcare workers responding to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inevitably face tremendous psychological burden. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the psychological impact and the factors contributing to the likely increase in emotional distress of healthcare workers. The participants include a total of 99 healthcare workers at Bugok National Hospital. Psychometric scales were used to assess emotional distress (12-item General Health Questionnaire; GHQ-12), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9), and post-traumatic stress disorder-related symptoms (Impact of Events Scale-Revised; IES-R). A supplementary questionnaire was administered to investigate the experience of healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19-infected patients. Based on the results of GHQ-12 survey, participants were categorized into two groups: distress and non-distress. All the assessed scores were compared between the two groups. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors associated with emotional distress. Emotional distress was reported by 45.3% (n = 45) of all participants. The emotionally distressed group was more likely to be female, manage close contacts, have higher scores on PHQ-9 and IES-R, feel increased professional risk, and report that proper infection control training was not provided. Female gender, managing close contacts, higher scores on PHQ-9, and a feeling that proper infection control training was not provided were associated with emotional distress in logistic regression. Frontline healthcare workers face tremendous psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, appropriate psychological interventions should be provided to the HCWs engaged in the management of COVID-19-infected patients.","Jang, Chung, Lee, Kim, Seo","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e324","20211207","COVID-19; Depression; Distress; Healthcare Worker; PTSD; Psychological Impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23511,""

"Training the trainers: Finding new educational opportunities in the virtual world","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted scientific gatherings and conferences, opening up opportunities for virtual learning platforms. Realizing the potential of online academic exchanges, the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) also developed virtual avenues and information systems for capacity building of mental health professionals across the world. Among its first such initiatives, the WPA organized a virtual Train the Trainers workshop, where 123 psychiatrists, psychiatric trainees, and educators from 45 countries participated. The innovative and interactive workshop allowed participants to get to know each other, exchange educational and professional experiences, and ask questions or receive advice from experts. Keynote speakers, including WPA President Prof. Afzal Javed and Prof. Norman Sartorius, stressed upon the importance of finding innovative solutions in psychiatry training and the need to improve teaching and training in the field of psychiatry, especially in the provision of leadership and communication skills. Online training methods can provide easy access to academics and students while reducing the organizational and logistical costs. They have the potential to improve educational equality and allow the voice of the underprivileged scientists to be heard across the globe. The devastating impact on access to mental health services during COVID-19 underscores the urgent need for online training, particularly in countries where the ratio of psychiatrists to patients is inadequate and doctors concentrate more on treatment than on research and education. Virtual educational interventions could prove incredibly useful in the future just as they are being successfully utilized in local and regional contexts during the pandemic.","Baessler, Sartorius, Javed, Tasman, Coskun, Frydecka, Kazakova, Sampogna, Zhabenko, Koelkebeck, Hepdurgun, Zafar, Fiorillo","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12499","20211207","COVÃ„Â°D-19; academic exchange; medical education; online training; virtual teaching","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23513,""
"Social Needs Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Millions of Americans lost their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing immeasurable stress on families and making it difficult for parents to support their children's basic needs. Research shows that screening for social determinants of health is an important part of a child's well visit, noting that awareness of these factors leads to more holistic and improved quality of care. Due to increased precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant decrease in well-child visits and in-person appointments, there was a marked decrease in the number of face-to-face opportunities for these screenings. In a time of increased need, methods such as telephone screenings represent an opportunity to assess needs and connect patients and families with helpful resources. This study occurred in Baltimore, Maryland at the University of Maryland Pediatrics at Midtown outpatient practice (PAM). Five pediatric resident physicians and 17 medical students developed a telephone welfare screening tool and called families receiving primary care at the clinic over a 9-week period. The team documented identified needs and used a community resources database to provide resources to families over the phone. Data regarding the identified needs was collected and analyzed throughout the screening process. Volunteers contacted 671 families using our finalized screening tool. Of those, 349 answered the telephone call (52%) and 328 (49%) agreed to participate in the screening. Results showed that families commonly identified food insecurity (20%) and symptoms of depression (18%). This was consistent across families' home locations as analyzed by postal ZIP code. This study suggests that telephone screening is a feasible and informative method for identifying and addressing the social needs of pediatric primary care patients and their families. Furthermore, our study supports the notion that there are significant and widespread social needs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mayo, Kliot, Weinstein, Onigbanjo, Carter","https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12942","20211207","COVID-19 Pandemic; Needs Assessment; Psychosocial Factors; Social Support; Well-Being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23514,""
"The Relationship Between Pre-pandemic Measures of Religiosity and Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Secondary Analysis of Data From a Multi-Country Study","Background The uncertainty and socioeconomic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been frequently associated with negative affective responses, particularly depression and anxiety. People from countries across the globe have frequently resorted to religious coping to deal with these emotions. However, there are conflicting results in the literature about the impact of prior patterns of religious belief and practice on emotional responses to COVID-19. Methods In this cross-sectional, country-level study, the association between pre-pandemic measures of religious affiliation and practice, obtained from prior survey data and self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress across 29 countriesÃ‚Â from a recent multi-country study, were examined while correcting for potential confounders. Results There was a trend towards a positive association between pre-pandemic religious belief and practice and anxiety in response to the pandemic (r = .36, p = .057), but this was not significant on multivariate analysis (ÃŽÂ² = .08, p = .691). Cultural individualism and urbanization were negatively associated with anxiety during the pandemic. There was also preliminary evidence of a non-linear relationship between religiosity and pandemic-related anxiety. Conclusions The relationship between religiosity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to be a direct one and can be influenced by demographic and cultural factors.","Rajkumar","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.20013","20211208","anxiety; covid-19; culture; depression; epidemiology; religiosity; stress; urbanization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23515,""
"Social Contact, Academic Satisfaction, COVID-19 Knowledge, and Subjective Well-being Among Students at Turkish Universities: a Nine-University Sample","Adverse effects of COVID-19 are seen not only on the physical health of infected individuals but also on their subjective well-being. Sudden changes in social lives, lockdowns, and shifts towards online education have had a negative impact on many people, especially university students. As part of an international study, the current study focused on the well-being of students at Turkish universities in relation to social contact, academic satisfaction, and COVID-19 knowledge. A total of 7363 students from nine universities (86.6% from state universities, 71.04% female, and 73.52% at bachelor's level) participated in an online survey. Results revealed that females had lower levels of subjective well-being and academic satisfaction. According to a mediation model in the study, the relationship between social contact and well-being was mediated by academic satisfaction and COVID-19 knowledge. Our findings can guide future researchers, mental health professionals, universities, and policymakers to understand and improve subjective well-being of university students.","Erden, Ãƒâ€“zdoÃ„Å¸ru, Ãƒâ€¡oksan, Ãƒâ€“gel-Balaban, Azak, AltÃ„Â±noÃ„Å¸lu-Dikmeer, ErgÃƒÂ¼l-TopÃƒÂ§u, Yasak, KÃ„Â±ral-UÃƒÂ§ar, Oktay, Karaca-DinÃƒÂ§, Merdan-YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±z, Eltan, KumpasoÃ„Å¸lu, Baytemir","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11482-021-10019-7","20211208","Academic satisfaction; COVID-19; Social contact; Subjective well-being; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23516,""
"Global validation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS)","The five-item Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) was found to be a useful and valid mental health screener. Participants in the respective surveys were mostly from single countries such as the US, Turkey, Mexico, or Brazil. However, a cross-cultural re-examination is lacking. This study fills this gap. In several multigroup confirmatory factor analyses with 25 countries from five continents as groups, sex and age as groups, and different stages of concern with COVID-19 infection, CAS was found to be invariant across all groups; this indicates that CAS is appropriate for meaningfully comparing the results across different groups. On a global basis, Coronavirus anxiety did not differ between female and male participants. Regarding age, however, younger individuals suffered more from anxiety of the pandemic. Individualistic cultures and those with low power distance such as in the Western hemisphere had higher COVID-19 anxiety. CAS values were also higher for those individuals who had been infected by COVID-19, those whose relatives had been infected, and those who experienced COVID-19-related death in the family. Overall, CAS is a parsimonious, valid, and reliable mental health screener on a global basis.","Lieven","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02583-w","20211208","Coronavirus Anxiety Scale; cross-cultural; model invariance; multigroup analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23517,""
"The hotspots and trends of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and physical therapy: a bibliometric and visual analysis","[Purpose] With the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more articles have been published to explore the role of physical therapy on COVID-19. In order to analyze the research hotspots and the trends of physical therapy and COVID-19, we conducted bibliometric and visual analysis. [Methods] Data were collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of the Web of Science Core Collect (WoSCC) from 2019 to 2021. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to perform the visual analysis of keywords and references to help quickly get key information. [Results] A total of 466 publications were retrieved. Exercise, sedentary behavior, and mental health were research hotspots. The relationship between exercise and immunity, as well as the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge were the research trends. [Conclusion] This study provided relevant information for future research. Findings suggested that physical therapy is beneficial for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during isolation. It is hoped that academic exchanges can be quickly established in the face of infectious diseases. And in the future, we should focus on the rehabilitation of discharged patients.","Li, Li, Guo, Yang, Liu, Wang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1589/jpts.33.903","20211208","Bibliometrics; Coronavirus disease 2019; Physical therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23518,""

"Disparities in COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death in people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder: a cohort study of the UK Biobank","People with severe mental illness (SMI; including schizophrenia/psychosis, bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD)) experience large disparities in physical health. Emerging evidence suggests this group experiences higher risks of infection and death from COVID-19, although the full extent of these disparities are not yet established. We investigated COVID-19 related infection, hospitalisation and mortality among people with SMI in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort study. Overall, 447,296 participants from UKB (schizophrenia/psychosisÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1925, BDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1483 and MDDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41,448, non-SMIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°402,440) were linked with healthcare and death records. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine differences in COVID-19 outcomes by diagnosis, controlling for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. In unadjusted analyses, higher odds of COVID-19 mortality were seen among people with schizophrenia/psychosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.00-7.34), BD (OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.00-6.35), and MDD (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.69-2.33) compared to people with no SMI. Higher odds of infection and hospitalisation were also seen across all SMI groups, particularly among people with schizophrenia/psychosis (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.32-1.96; OR 3.47, 95% CI 2.47-4.72) and BD (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.85; OR 3.31, 95% CI 2.22-4.73). In fully adjusted models, mortality and hospitalisation odds remained significantly higher among all SMI groups, though infection odds remained significantly higher only for MDD. People with schizophrenia/psychosis, BD and MDD have higher risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality. Only a proportion of these disparities were accounted for by pre-existing demographic characteristics or comorbidities. Vaccination and preventive measures should be prioritised in these particularly vulnerable groups.","Hassan, Peek, Lovell, Carvalho, Solmi, Stubbs, Firth","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01344-2","20211207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23520,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and unemployment, 1 subsistence needs and mental health among adults with HIV in the United States","To evaluate whether reported prevalence of unemployment, subsistence needs, and symptoms of depression and anxiety among adults with diagnosed HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic were higher than expected. The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is a complex sample survey of adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States. We analyzed 2015-2019 MMP data using linear regression models to calculate expected prevalence, along with corresponding prediction intervals (PI), for unemployment, subsistence needs, depression, and anxiety for June-November 2020. We then assessed whether observed estimates fell within the expected prediction interval for each characteristic, overall and among specific groups. Overall, the observed estimate for unemployment was higher than expected (17% vs 12%) and exceeded the upper limit of the PI. Those living in households with incomes &gt;Ã¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 400% of FPL were the only group where the observed prevalence of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 period was higher than the PIs; in this group, the prevalence of depression was 9% compared with a predicted value of 5% (75% higher) and the prevalence of anxiety was 11% compared with a predicted value 5% (137% higher). We did not see elevated levels of subsistence needs, although needs were higher among Black and Hispanic compared with White persons. Efforts to deliver enhanced employment assistance to persons with HIV and provide screening and access to mental health services among higher income persons may be needed to mitigate the negative effects of the US COVID-19 pandemic.","Beer, Tie, Dasgupta, McManus, Chowdhury, Weiser","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000003142","20211207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23521,""
"Residency training amid the COVID-19 pandemic: exploring the impact on mental health and training, a lesson from Iran","COVID-19 has affected the training programs and the clinical schedules of surgical wards in many countries, including Iran. Also, the continuous involvement with COVID-19 patients has caused stress in health care workers; among them, residents are on the frontlines of care delivery. Therefore, we designed a study to assess the mental effects of these circumstances, and the effects on General Surgery and Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology residency training in the busiest surgical departments of our university. Participants of this cross-sectional study were residents of General Surgery and Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and the conventional sampling method was used. We used a questionnaire consisting of 47 questions (mostly using multiple choice questions and answers on the Likert scale) about personal, familial, and demographic characteristics; training activities, and mental effects of COVID-19. The response rate was 63.5%. (127 filled questionnaires). Around 96% of the residents had emotional problems, 85.9% were highly stressed about contracting COVID-19, 81.3% were worried about transferring it to their families; and 78% believed that their residency training had been impaired. Overall, our study shows the negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health and the training of residents. We propose that appropriate emotional support and suitable planning for compensation of training deficits is provided for residents.","Moini, Maajani, Omranipour, Zafarghandi, Aleyasin, Oskoie, Alipour","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-03029-4","20211207","Coronaphobia; General surgery; Gynecology; Mental health; Obstetrics; Residency; Stress; Training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-11","",23522,""
