"The Effects of Persistent Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunctions on Quality of Life in Long-COVID-19 Patients","(1) Background: Persistent olfactory (POD) and gustatory (PGD) dysfunctions are one of the most frequent symptoms of long-Coronavirus Disease 2019 but their effect on the quality of life (QoL) of patients is still largely unexplored. (2) Methods: An online survey was administered to individuals who reported to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 6 months prior with persisting COVID-19 symptoms (using the COVID symptom index), including ratings of POD and PGD, and their physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components of quality of life were assessed using the standardized short form 12 questionnaire (SF-12). (3) Results: Responses from 431 unique individuals were included in the analyses. The most frequent persistent symptoms were: fatigue (185 cases, 42.9%), olfactory dysfunction (127 cases, 29.5%), gustatory dysfunction (96 cases, 22.3%) and muscle pain (83 cases, 19.3%). Respondents who reported persisting muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, and dyspnea had significantly worse PCS. Those experiencing persistent fatigue and dyspnea also showed significantly lower MCS. Respondents reporting POD or PGD showed significantly worse QoL, but only pertaining to the MCS. Multiple regressions predicted MCS based on olfactory and marginally on gustatory ratings, but not PCS. Age significantly affected the prediction of PCS but not MCS, and gender and temporal distance from the COVID-19 diagnosis had no effect. (4) Conclusions: POD and PGD are frequent symptoms of the long-COVID-19 syndrome and significantly reduce QoL, specifically in the mental health component. This evidence should stimulate the establishment of appropriate infrastructure to support individuals with persistent CD, while research on effective therapies scales up.","Vaira, Luigi Angelo, Gessa, Claudia, Deiana, Giovanna, Salzano, Giovanni, Maglitto, Fabio, Lechien, Jerome R.; Saussez, Sven, Piombino, Pasquale, Biglio, Andrea, Biglioli, Federico, Boscolo-Rizzo, Paolo, Hopkins, Claire, Parma, Valentina, De Riu, Giacomo","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12020141","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Life; 12(2):141, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25769,""
"Policy windows for drug consumption rooms in Finland","Background: Use of drug consumption rooms is a novel harm reduction approach to reach marginalised and isolated people who used drugs, under the high risk of overdose deaths and infectious diseases. The aim of this article was to evaluate the policy opportunities and barriers of the Helsinki City initiative for establishing the first drug consumption room (DCR) in Finland from the multiple streams framework. Method: A qualitative interview research method is used to evaluate the perspectives of stakeholders. By including 23 participants, we analysed the political, social and policy level advantages and disadvantages of the current initiative. Findings: Our results show that the cost of DCRs, the COVID-19 burdens on public resources, the requirement of legislative change, public unawareness, potential policy failure of DCRs, and its impacts on electoral votes constitute the main policy barriers. On the other hand, an increase in drug-related deaths, economic benefits of DCR for society, its effects on street safety and public order, being a local initiative, prospectus change in national drug strategy plans and motivation to catch up with EU standards were underlined as policy opportunities. Four issues, leadership, moral perspective, social change and generational differences, act as mediating factors, which are fluctuated according to public opinions and political environment. Conclusion: By applying the multiple streams framework, our results show that experts? DCR problematisation is still beyond the public and political interest, which needs additional effort around problem identification and prioritisation. Besides public unawareness, the COVID-19 situation seems to be postponing policy progress since the primary attention and available funds have already been dedicated to public health. Already having a local initiative and an upcoming drug strategy plan might be good formal leverage, but unexpected events might also trigger discussions.","Unlu, Ali, Tammi, Tuukka, Hakkarainen, Pekka","https://doi.org/10.1177/14550725211069287","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Nordic Studies on Alcohol and Drugs;: 14550725211069287, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25770,""
"The Association between COVID-19-Related Wellbeing with Materialism and Perceived Threat","The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on people&rsquo;s wellbeing. Here, we proposed that an individual characteristic might be associated with wellbeing;that is, materialism. Specifically, we conducted three studies (total N = 3219) to examine whether people with high levels of materialism would experience poorer wellbeing (i.e., anxiety and depression, in the current case). The results showed that materialism was positively associated with depression (Studies 1A, 1B and 2) and anxiety (Study 2). Moreover, such a relationship was mediated by people&rsquo;s perceived threat of COVID-19 (Study 2). These findings were observed in both Chinese and American people. The findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical contributions.","Teng, Fei, Shi, Jiaxin, Wang, Xijing, Chen, Zhansheng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020912","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):912, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25771,""
"Leisure Engagement during COVID-19 and Its Association with Mental Health and Wellbeing in US Adults","Leisure engagement has risen as a salient societal issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only because it provides a pathway for people to continue meeting their physical, cognitive, and social-emotional needs, but also due to the phenomenal juxtaposition of general increases in leisure time and unparalleled constraints. This study reports the results of the first investigation of U.S. adults&rsquo;overall leisure engagement and its association with mental health amidst the major disruptions and sustained stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through an online survey in February 2021 through Prolific from a sample representative of the U.S. adult population in age, gender, and race (n = 503) and analyzed using a mixed-method approach. A total of 104 unique leisure activities in 19 categories and 3 domains were identified through iterative thematic coding. Participants reported general increases in home-based traditional leisure and digital/online activities and decreases in physical and nature-based activities. A multiple regression analysis controlling for socio-demographic and context-specific covariates revealed distinct associations between changes in leisure engagement and different aspects of mental health (perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and mental wellbeing), supporting leisure&rsquo;s dual role in facilitating stress alleviation and wellbeing enhancement during taxing events, such as COVID-19.","Shen, Xiangyou, MacDonald, Megan, Logan, Samuel W.; Parkinson, Colby, Gorrell, Lydia, Hatfield, Bridget E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031081","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1081, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25772,""
"Predictors of the Intention to Be Vaccinated against COVID-19 in a Sample of Italian Respondents at the Start of the Immunization Campaign","COVID-19 vaccines are the most promising means of limiting the pandemic. The present study aims at determining the roles of several psychological variables in predicting vaccination intention in Italy. An online questionnaire was disseminated between 9 March and 9 May 2021. The sample included 971 participants. Results showed that most of the participants were willing to vaccinate. Acceptance rates were correlated with age, marital status, and area of residence. Intention to be vaccinated was positively correlated with perceived risk, pro-sociality, fear of COVID-19, use of preventive behaviors, and trust in government, in science, and in medical professionals. Intention to be vaccinated was negatively associated with belief in misinformation. The degree of acceptance is likely to be a result of the campaign tailored to address people&rsquo;s negative attitudes towards vaccines. Trust in government and trust in science were among the strongest psychological predictors of vaccination intention. Fear of COVID-19, but not perceived risk, was associated with increased vaccine uptake, suggesting that the affective component of risk perception was more important than the cognitive component in predicting participants&rsquo;behaviors. Belief in misinformation was associated with reduced vaccination intention. Future studies will take into consideration these variables, to better understand the multifaceted process underlying vaccination intention.","Santirocchi, Alessandro, Spataro, Pietro, Costanzi, Marco, Doricchi, Fabrizio, Rossi-Arnaud, Clelia, Cestari, Vincenzo","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12010111","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(1):111, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25773,""
"Mental, Physical and Socio-Economic Status of Adults Living in Spain during the Late Stages of the State of Emergency Caused by COVID-19","Research has shown that the confinement measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19 can have negative effects on people&rsquo;s lives at multiple levels. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to better understand the mental, physical, and socio-economic status of adults living in Spain during the late stages of the state of emergency caused by COVID-19. Five hundred and forty-four individuals responded to an online survey between 3 June and 30 July 2020. They were asked to report data about their mental and physical health, financial situation, and satisfaction with the information received about the pandemic. Means, percentages, t-test, ANOVAs, and logistic regressions were computed. A third of the participants reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, and worries about their health and the future. Participants also described mild levels of fatigue and pain during lockdown (66%), and a reduction in household income (39%). Respondents that were female, younger, single, and with lower levels of education reported experiencing a greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that the negative effects of lockdown were present in the late stages of the state of emergency. The findings can be used to contribute to the development of programs to prevent or mitigate the negative impact of confinement measures.","SÃ¡nchez-RodrÃ­guez, Elisabet, Ferreira-Valente, Alexandra, Pimenta, Filipa, Ciaramella, Antonella, MirÃ³, Jordi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020854","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):854, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25774,""
"Effects of a Reminiscence Program on Meaning of Life, Sense of Coherence and Coping in Older Women Living in Nursing Homes during COVID-19","Aging is a dynamic process that can bring well-being but also physical and cognitive decline. Older adults can draw on their personal resources to help them cope and thrive through the aging process. Having personal resources to cope and ensure older adults&rsquo;well-being is important. Psychological strengths such as a sense of coherence, resilience, and coping are protective against the adversity associated with health problems such as those stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study&rsquo;s purpose was to investigate the usefulness of reminiscence therapy for older women living in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample composed of 29 older women was evaluated with the Purpose-in-Life Test (PIL), Sense of Coherence (SOC-13) and Brief Cope Inventory (COPE-28). Our reminiscence program consisted of 10 sessions lasting 60 min each. Reminiscence therapy is a psychological intervention for older adults to assist in remembering and interpreting the life events, feelings, and thoughts that define and give meaning to the person&rsquo;s life. Reminiscence can lead to positive mental health and other elements of particular relevance to older adults. In each session, we worked on a different theme that promoted the memory of positive emotions: optimal experience, decisive moment, stresses, tensions, problems and solutions, memories of childhood, adolescence, maturity, significant people in life, sense of life, and future script. We compared an intervention group (n = 12) with a control group (n = 17) using a pre-post, single-blind design. Significant results were obtained and showed that reminiscence therapy was effective in increasing meaning of life, sense of coherence, and coping in older women. The reminiscence therapy applied yielded positive effects in older female participants living in a nursing home during COVID-19 pandemic.","Sales, Alicia, Pinazo-Hernandis, Sacramento, Martinez, Dolores","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020188","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(2):188, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25775,""
"Gamification as a Teaching Method to Improve Performance and Motivation in Tertiary Education during COVID-19: A Research Study from Mexico","Gamification is usually understood as a pedagogical strategy that favors student engagement and motivation. Traditionally it is composed of dynamics, mechanics, and components. The purpose of this study was to compare Engineering and Economics and Social Sciences undergraduate students in their performance (grades), motivation, quality of assignments, participation, and emotion when their teachers used gamification as an innovative teaching method during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mann&ndash;Whitney test were conducted. Additionally, four students were interviewed to describe the emotional downside of the lockdown. The main results indicate that there are higher positive relationships among variables in the Engineering undergraduate students rather than in Economics and Social Sciences and show that emotion poorly correlates with performance, especially for the Economics and Social Sciences students, as many have a negative attitude toward learning mathematics. Additionally, gender and scholarship status are not differential factors. Gamification proved to be a useful pedagogical strategy to promote participation and enhance motivation among undergraduate students, particularly in a context of academic confinement. This study gives teachers an idea of the benefits and extent to which gamification can be used in the classroom.","Rincon-Flores, Elvira G.; Mena, Juanjo, LÃ³pez-Camacho, Eunice","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12010049","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(1):49, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25776,""
"The Impact of Migration Status on Adolescents&rsquo;Mental Health during COVID-19","The purpose of this study was to compare mental health in adolescents with and without migration background after a semester of remote schooling and almost a year of social distancing in Austria. An online survey, supported by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, was conducted from 3rd February to 28th February 2021 measuring well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep quality (ISI), stress (PSS-10), and disordered eating (EAT-8). A matched-pairs analysis with and without migration background was conducted and was checked with whole sample analysis. From a total of 3052 participants, N = 508 had a migration background (first or second generation) and N = 479 could be matched according to age, gender, region, and education with adolescents without migration background. Matched-pairs analyses showed that migration background is associated with poorer mental health concerning well-being, depression, anxiety, and insomnia scores (all p-values &lt; 0.05). Prevalence of depressive symptoms (64.5% vs. 56.5%), anxiety symptoms (53.5% vs. 46.0%), as well as insomnia (31.9% vs. 21.0%) is higher in adolescents with migration background (all p-values &le;0.02). Comparison of the whole sample (N = 3052) confirmed these results. Results suggest that migration status is a risk factor for mental health problems among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need to implement easily accessible culture- and language-specific health promotion and prevention strategies.","Pieh, Christoph, Dale, Rachel, Jesser, Andrea, Probst, Thomas, Plener, Paul L.; Humer, Elke","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010176","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(1):176, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25777,""
"Mental Health Symptoms and Workplace Challenges among Australian Paramedics during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Paramedics are vital to the health system response to the COVID-19 pandemic;however, the pressures on this workforce have been intense and challenging. This study reports on mental health symptoms and the working environment among Australian paramedics during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores their experiences of work and wellbeing during this time. Methods: An anonymous, online survey of frontline healthcare workers examined work environment, psychological wellbeing, and contained four open-ended qualitative items. Using a mixed method approach, quantitative data were analysed descriptively and qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results: This paper reports findings from 95 paramedics who provided complete quantitative data and 85 paramedics who provided free-text responses to at least one qualitative item. Objectively measured mental health symptoms were common among paramedics, and almost two thirds of paramedics self-reported experiencing burnout. Qualitative analysis highlighted key issues of safety and risk in the workplace, uncertainty and upheaval at work and at home, and lack of crisis preparedness. Qualitative analysis revealed four themes;'the pervasiveness of COVID-19 disruptions across all life domains&rsquo;;'the challenges of widespread disruption at work&rsquo;;'risk, uncertainty and feeling unsafe at work&rsquo;, and 'the challenges of pandemic (un)preparedness across the health system&rsquo;. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in considerable occupational disruption for paramedics and was associated with significant negative impacts on mental health. Findings emphasise the need for more adaptive working conditions, mental health support for paramedics, and enhanced crisis preparedness across the health system for future crises.","Petrie, Katherine, Smallwood, Natasha, Pascoe, Amy, Willis, Karen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19021004","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):1004, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25778,""
"Mathematical Approach to Investigate Stress due to Control Measures to Curb COVID-19","COVID-19 is a world pandemic that has affected and continues to affect the social lives of people. Due to its social and economic impact, different countries imposed preventive measures that are aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease. Such control measures include physical distancing, quarantine, hand-washing, travel and boarder restrictions, lockdown, and the use of hand sanitizers. Quarantine, out of the aforementioned control measures, is considered to be more stressful for people to manage. When people are stressed, their body immunity becomes weak, which leads to multiplying of coronavirus within the body. Therefore, a mathematical model consisting of six compartments, Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infectious-Hospitalized-Recovered (SEQIHR) was developed, aimed at showing the impact of stress on the transmission of COVID-19 disease. From the model formulated, the positivity, bounded region, existence, uniqueness of the solution, the model existence of free and endemic equilibrium points, and local and global stability were theoretically proved. The basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) was derived by using the next-generation matrix method, which shows that, when R 0 &lt; 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whereas when R 0 &gt; 1 the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Moreover, the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method was used to study the correlation between model parameters and R 0 . Numerically, the SEQIHR model was solved by using the Rung-Kutta fourth-order method, while the least square method was used for parameter identifiability. Furthermore, graphical presentation revealed that when the mental health of an individual is good, the body immunity becomes strong and hence minimizes the infection. Conclusively, the control parameters have a significant impact in reducing the transmission of COVID-19.

"How Does the Involuntary Choice of Self-Employment Affect Subjective Well-Being in Small-Sized Business Workers? A Cross-Sectional Study from the Fifth Korean Working Conditions Survey","In South Korea, self-employed workers comprise 24.6% of the working population&mdash;among which 99.7% were found to operate with less than 50 employees. However, few studies have investigated the effects of an involuntary choice of self-employment. In this study, based on the fifth Korean Working Conditions Survey, the factors affecting subjective well-being and mental health in small business owners with less than 50 employees among service/sales workers, who account for more than half of the self-employed population in Korea, were analyzed by the World Health Organization&mdash;Five Well-Being Index, using the Student&rsquo;s t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis. Results showed that the well-being level for those who opted for self-employment involuntarily was lower than those who chose it voluntarily. Then, participants were separated into two groups according to sex;the degree corresponding to the poor well-being score group was compared, and that of the group who chose self-employment because they could not find any other work was significantly higher than that of the group who chose it voluntarily, in both men and women, and this was similar even after correcting for covariance. As the number of people being forced to choose self-employment is expected to further increase after the outbreak of COVID-19, future studies should be conducted to improve subjective well-being of such workers.","Park, SangJin, Park, Chulyong, Sung, Joo Hyun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19021011","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):1011, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25780,""
"An Explainable Machine Learning Approach for COVID-19&rsquo;s Impact on Mood States of Children and Adolescents during the First Lockdown in Greece","The global spread of COVID-19 led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. To decelerate this spread, countries have taken strict measures that have affected the lifestyles and economies. Various studies have focused on the identification of COVID-19&rsquo;s impact on the mental health of children and adolescents via traditional statistical approaches. However, a machine learning methodology must be developed to explain the main factors that contribute to the changes in the mood state of children and adolescents during the first lockdown. Therefore, in this study an explainable machine learning pipeline is presented focusing on children and adolescents in Greece, where a strict lockdown was imposed. The target group consists of children and adolescents, recruited from children and adolescent mental health services, who present mental health problems diagnosed before the pandemic. The proposed methodology imposes: (i) data collection via questionnaires;(ii) a clustering process to identify the groups of subjects with amelioration, deterioration and stability to their mood state;(iii) a feature selection process to identify the most informative features that contribute to mood state prediction;(iv) a decision-making process based on an experimental evaluation among classifiers;(v) calibration of the best-performing model;and (vi) a post hoc interpretation of the features&rsquo;impact on the best-performing model. The results showed that a blend of heterogeneous features from almost all feature categories is necessary to increase our understanding regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mood state of children and adolescents.","Ntakolia, Charis, Priftis, Dimitrios, Charakopoulou-Travlou, Mariana, Rannou, Ioanna, Magklara, Konstantina, Giannopoulou, Ioanna, Kotsis, Konstantinos, Serdari, Aspasia, Tsalamanios, Emmanouil, Grigoriadou, Aliki, Ladopoulou, Konstantina, Koullourou, Iouliani, Sadeghi, Neda, Oâ€™Callaghan, Georgia, Stringaris, Argyris, Lazaratou, Eleni","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010149","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(1):149, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25781,""

"Air Pollution in Poland: A 2022 Narrative Review with Focus on Respiratory Diseases","According to the World Bank Group, 36 of the 50 most polluted cities in the European Union are in Poland. Thus, ambient air pollution and its detrimental health effects are a matter of immense importance in Poland. This narrative review aims to analyse current findings on air pollution and health in Poland, with a focus on respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, as well as the Poles&rsquo;awareness of air pollution. PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were searched. In total, results from 71 research papers were summarized qualitatively. In Poland, increased air pollution levels are linked to increased general and respiratory disease mortality rates, higher prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, lung cancer and COVID-19 infections, reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The proximity of high traffic areas exacerbates respiratory health problems. People living in more polluted regions (south of Poland) and in the winter season have a higher level of air pollution awareness. There is an urgent need to reduce air pollution levels and increase public awareness of this threat. A larger number of multi-city studies are needed in Poland to consistently track the burden of diseases attributable to air pollution.","Nazar, Wojciech, Niedoszytko, Marek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020895","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):895, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25783,""
"The Effect of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Maternal Mental Health and Parenting Practices Moderated by Urban Green Space","Stress generates difficulties in parenting, which affects child development. We aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on maternal mental health and parenting practices. We also explored to what extent green space is a protective factor in the aforementioned relationship. We explored heterogeneous lockdown effects using longitudinal georeferenced data for 985 families (mothers and 24- to 30-month-olds) and exploiting localized lockdowns in Chile. Controlling for observed and unobserved fixed characteristics, on average, we did not find an association between lockdown duration and maternal mental health or parenting practices. However, the previous nonsignificant association is heterogeneous across access to green space. Although lockdown duration increased dysfunctional interactions with children for mothers with little access to green space, we did not see the previous effect on mothers who live close to green space. Mothers who do not comply with the lockdown mandate are the ones who drive this heterogeneous effect.","Narea, Marigen, Asahi, Kenzo, Abufhele, Alejandra, Telias, Amanda, Gildemeister, DamiÃ¡n, AlarcÃ³n, Samanta","https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211068871","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211068871, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25784,""
"How Many Times Can One Go Back to the Drawing Board before the Accurate Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment of Glucagonoma?","Glucagonomas are neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that arise from the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. They are typically slow-growing tumors associated with abnormal glucagon secretion, resulting in one or more non-specific clinical features, such as necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes, diarrhea, deep vein thrombosis, weight loss, and depression. Here, we report the case of a 44-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, presenting with a pruritic and painful disseminated cutaneous eruption of erythematous plaques, with scales and peripheral pustules, misdiagnosed as disseminated pustular psoriasis and treated for 2 years with oral retinoid and glucocorticoids. During this period, the patient complained of weight loss of 32 kg and diarrhea and developed deep vein thrombosis. These symptoms, together with an inadequate response to therapy of the skin lesions, led to the reassessment of the initial diagnosis. Laboratory tests confirmed elevated plasma glucagon levels (&gt;1000 pg/mL) and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a 35/44 mm tumor in the pancreatic tail. Due to considerable disease complications and the COVID-19 pandemic, the surgical removal of the tumor was delayed for nearly 2 years. During this time, somatostatin analogue therapy efficiently controlled the glucagonoma syndrome and likely prevented tumor progression. As in other functional pancreatic NETs, the early clinical recognition of hormonal hypersecretion syndrome and the multidisciplinary approach are the keys for best patient management.","Martin, Carmen Sorina, Parfeni, Ovidiu Dumitru, Popa, Liliana Gabriela, Mihai, Mara Madalina, Terzea, Dana, Herlea, Vlad, Gherghe, Mirela, Adam, Razvan, Alnuaimi, Osama, Calu, Valentin, Miron, Adrian, Negoita, Silvius, Nitipir, Cornelia, Fica, Simona","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12010216","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Diagnostics; 12(1):216, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25785,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence and Characteristics of Patients with Psychiatric Illnesses Visiting Emergency Departments in Korea","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had wide-ranging effects on the mental health of the public. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the characteristics of psychiatric patients who visited emergency departments (ED) during this time. A cross-sectional study was conducted including patients visiting 402 nationwide EDs from 27 January 2020 to 29 June 2020 (22 weeks;during-COVID) and the corresponding period in 2019 (28 January 2019 to 30 June 2019, 22 weeks;before-COVID) to control for seasonal influences. Among the 6,210,613 patients who visited the ED, 88,520 (2.5%) patients who visited before the pandemic and 73,281 (2.7%) patients who visited during the pandemic had some kind of psychiatric illness. The incidence rates of psychiatric self-harm increased from 0.54 before the pandemic to 0.56 during the pandemic per 1,000,000 person-days (p = 0.04). Age- and sex-standardized rates of psychiatric illnesses per 100,000 ED visits increased during the pandemic (rate differences (95% CIs);45.7 (20.1&ndash;71.4) for all psychiatric disorders and 42.2 (36.2&ndash;48.3) for psychiatric self-harm).

"Does fear mediate the neuroticism-psychopathology link for adults living through the COVID-19 pandemic?","Background: COVID-19 has globally increased psychological distress. Although research has shown a clear link between neuroticism and psychopathology, pandemic fearsâ€”manifesting as fear of death and coronavirus anxiety, have not been examined as mediating factors for explaining this connection during the pandemic. Methods: Therefore, to fill this void in the literature, this study examined 259 U.S. MTurk adult workers in May 2020 using an online questionnaire. The study used the Patient Health Questionnaire, the 8-item Big Five Inventory neuroticism subscale, a single-item fear of death measure, and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale as well as collected demographic information to perform correlational and meditation analyses. Results: The results showed that both coronavirus anxiety and fear of death partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. The results also found that those high in trait neuroticism who were fearful of death or had coronavirus anxiety showed heightened levels of depression and general anxiety. Conclusion: This study's findings were consistent with previous research and current work on pandemic-related distress. In addition, the results of these findings can help bring to light the connectedness of these psychopathological constructs with fears surrounding the pandemicâ€”which can be useful to both researchers and mental health professionals alike.","Lee, Sherman A.; Jobe, Mary C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/11795573211069912","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Clinical Medicine Insights: Psychiatry;: 1-5, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25787,""
"The Impact of Career Plateau on Job Burnout in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderating Role of Regulatory Focus","This study reviewed the mental health problems experienced by office workers exposed to new kinds of work stress, career plateau, and job burnout, due to no-contact teleworking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Human beings tend to evaluate their own qualities to determine their own superiority by comparing themselves with others. Appropriate social comparison helps to promote self-understanding and boost self-esteem. However, in the case of no-contact remote working, where the amount of time spent alone is drastically increased, the information obtained from such social comparisons is naturally insufficient, resulting in the perception of reaching a career plateau. Prolonged anxiety and a sense of helplessness have been shown to cause job burnout;however, so far, few studies have examined career plateau as an antecedent factor for job burnout. This study also considered the moderating effect of regulatory focus in order to closely examine the effect of career plateau on job burnout. According to the regulatory focus theory, differences appear in various psychological processes, such as human choices, judgments, motivations, and attitudes, determined by whether individuals adopt a promotion focus or a prevention focus. This study aimed to verify whether regulatory focus operates in a conditional context, in the process of job burnout following career plateau, to change the magnitude and direction of the influence of career plateau. To this end, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed by collecting data from 202 people working for three Korean companies. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the career plateau had a significant effect on job burnout. This direct effect was still significant even after considering the interaction with regulatory focus. In addition, promotion focus was found to have a negative moderating effect, while prevention focus had no effect on the influence of career plateau on job burnout. This study demonstrated that the negative effects of career plateau, which have been presented in various ways in academia, lead to job burnout under the non-face-to-face teleworking systems implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggested that promotion focus can play a positive role in alleviating this dynamic.","Kwon, Jung Eon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031087","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1087, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25788,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Exacerbation of Depressive Symptoms for Social Frailty from the ORANGE Registry","Background: Recent longitudinal studies have reported proportion of frailty transition in older individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aimed at clarifying the impact of social frailty in community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and at identifying factors that can predict transition to social frailty. Methods: We performed this study from 2019 (before declaration of the state of emergency over the rising number of COVID-19 cases) to 2020 (after declaration of the emergency). We applied Makizako&rsquo;s social frail index to our study subjects at the baseline and classified into robust, social prefrailty, and social frailty groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using robust, social prefrailty, or social frailty status as dependent variable. Results: Analysis by the Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test revealed significant differences in the score on the GDS-15 among the robust, social prefrailty, and social frailty groups (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis identified a significant association between the social frailty status and the score on GDS-15 (odds ratio, 1.57;95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.15&ndash;2.13;p = 0.001). Conclusion: The increase in the rate of transition of elderly individuals to the social frailty group could have been related to the implementation of the stay-at-home order as part of the countermeasures for COVID-19. Furthermore, the increased prevalence of depressive symptoms associated with the stay-at-home order could also have influenced the increase in the prevalence of social frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kodama, Ayuto, Kume, Yu, Lee, Sangyoon, Makizako, Hyuma, Shimada, Hiroyuki, Takahashi, Tomoko, Ono, Tsuyoshi, Ota, Hidetaka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020986","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):986, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25789,""
"Moving Forward: Understanding Correlates of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour during COVID-19 in Children and Adolescents&mdash;An Integrative Review and Socioecological Approach","Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions have negatively impacted physical activity (PA) and sedentary time/behaviour. This integrative review systematically explored the socioecological factors that impacted and influenced these movement behaviours in children and adolescents during the pandemic. Five electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2021, with data extracted from 16 articles (n = 18,352;5&ndash;17 years;12 countries). Risk-of-bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT), with correlates identified, coded, and themed via thematic analysis. A socioecological model of during-pandemic PA and sedentary time/behaviour was conceptualised and mapped to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour-change mechanisms, illustrating influences over five levels: Individual (biological)&mdash;age and sex;Individual (psychological)&mdash;mental health, and cognition, motivation, and behaviour;Social&mdash;family factors, and structured support;Environmental&mdash;area of residence and resources;and Policy&mdash;COVID-19-related rules. For sedentary time/behaviour, individual-(age and sex), social-(family factors) and policy-(COVID-19-related rules) level factors may be important correlates. There were no age or sex associations with PA levels, though there was some indication that sedentary time/behaviour increased with age. Interventions seeking to enhance young people&rsquo;s movement behaviours during periods of enforced restrictions should focus on enhancing opportunities on a social and environmental level.","Knight, Rachel L.; McNarry, Melitta A.; Runacres, Adam W.; Shelley, James, Sheeran, Liba, Mackintosh, Kelly A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031044","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1044, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25790,""
"Predictors of the Development of Mental Disorders in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients without Previous Psychiatric History: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in South Korea","The objective of this study was to investigate the predictors for new-onset mental disorders among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness during hospitalization. A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a nationally designated hospital between 1 February and 30 June 2020. Demographic, clinical, psychological assessments, and psychiatric outcomes were obtained from electronic medical record review. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of new-onset mental disorders. Among 185 patients, 130 had no history of mental disorders or cognitive impairment at the time of admission. Of 130 patients, 29 (22.3%) were newly diagnosed with mental disorders during hospitalization. The following factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of a psychiatric diagnosis: Charlson comorbidity index core &ge;1 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.115, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.737&ndash;15.058), length of stay (aOR per 1-day increase = 1.067, 95% CI: 1.035&ndash;1.100), and self-reported depressive symptoms at the time of admission (aOR = 5.357, 95% CI: 1.745&ndash;16.444). The predictive accuracy of combining these risk factors was relatively high (area under curve = 0.851, 95% CI: 0.778&ndash;0.923). These potential risk factors could help to predict the new-onset mental disorder among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Kim, Jangrae, Seo, Yae Eun, Sung, Ho Kyung, Park, Hye Yoon, Han, Myung Hwa, Lee, So Hee","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031092","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1092, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25791,""
"Approaches for effective negative pressure isolation space control to minimize airborne transmission of contaminants in residential homes","Controlling airborne transmission of contaminants including respired viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is necessary to protect occupants living in the same house with a contagious person. The effectiveness of interventions requiring minor efforts that create a negative pressure isolation zone (IZ) for a contagious person has yet to be systematically tested for residential homes. In this study, ASHRAE Standard 170, which offers guidance for negative pressure isolation space control in healthcare facilities, was used in developing practical and attainable recommendations for residential single-family homes. The relative effectiveness of several control strategies was evaluated through experimentally conducting 17 different test cases in a manufactured single-family house laboratory. These cases were designed based on various heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) operating scenarios, intervention measures including closing the IZ door and/or sealing over supply and return air grilles in the IZ, and utilization of bathroom exhaust or portable window fans for pressure control. Four out of 17 test cases were identified as having the potential for strong containment with adequate depressurization in the IZ. The most effective IZ depressurization was achieved through continuously operating the exhaust fan in the bathroom attached to the IZ, by installing a portable window fan that extracted air out of the IZ, and a portable room air conditioner with the AC unit exhaust duct installed in one of the IZ windows.","Khan, Tanvir, Withers, Charles, Martin, Eric, Bonilla, Nicolas","https://doi.org/10.1177/1420326X211062421","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Indoor and Built Environment;: 1420326X211062421, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25792,""

"Post-COVID-19 Condition and Health Status","Background: Observational studies of the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection generally focus on individual symptoms rather than health status. Objective: Longitudinal assessment of general health status following COVID-19 infection. Design: Observational study, with data collected from two telephone surveys at 32 &plusmn;10 and 89 &plusmn;25 days after discharge from the hospital or emergency department (ED) for a COVID-19 infection. Medicaid or no insurance was our marker of low socioeconomic status (SES). Acute disease severity was determined by summing 10 severity markers (yes-no) from the health encounter. Baseline comorbidity was a modified Charlson Index. Participants: 40 patients. Mean age was 54 &plusmn;15 years, 50% were female, and 40% had low socioeconomic status. Main Measures: (1) the 20-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20);(2) Dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council);(3) Psychological symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire for Anxiety and Depression);(4) Cognitive function (Cognitive Change Questionnaire);(5) Fatigue (Short Fatigue Questionnaire);(6) A 10-item review of systems (ROS) questionnaire. Key Results: Percentages with abnormal symptoms at the first and second surveys were (respectively): Dyspnea (40, 33), Fatigue (53, 50), Anxiety (33, 18), Depression (20, 10), PHQ-4 Composite (25, 13), and Cognitive (18, 10). Mean scores on the SF-20 subscales, Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Social Functioning, Health Perception, Mental Health, and Pain were numerically lower than means from a published study of elderly outpatients. With the exception of Pain, all SF-20 subscale scores improved significantly by the second survey. In multivariable analyses, dyspnea was predictive of impairment in all SF-20 subscales at the second survey. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection causes persistent abnormality across multiple patient-reported outcome areas, including health status.

"Loneliness, Complaining and Professional Burnout of Medical Personnel of Psychiatric Wards during COVID-19 Pandemic&mdash;Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Professional burnout in the medical community has been present for a long time, also among mental health professionals. The aim of the study was to examine the links between loneliness, complaining and professional burnout among medical personnel in psychiatric care during a pandemic. Loneliness and complaining of the medical staff are not documented in the literature well enough. Methods: Oldenburg Burnout Questionnaire, the Loneliness Scale, the Complaint Questionnaire and author&rsquo;s questionnaire. The respondents: 265 medical employees&mdash;doctors (19.2%), nurses (69.8%), paramedics (4.9%), medical caregivers (5.7%). Results: Loneliness and complaining are significant predictors of exhaustion. The model explains 18% of exhaustion variance. Loneliness, complaining and job seniority are also predictors of disengagement;the model allows to predict 10% of the variance of disengagement. Women are more prone to complain. Complaining significantly correlates with direct support from management. A high rate of loneliness correlates, in a statistically significant way, with worse work organization, less management support, worse atmosphere in the team and with more irresponsible attitudes of colleagues. Conclusions: Loneliness and complaining can be used to predict occupational burnout. Women and people without management support complain more often. Loneliness is connected with bad work organization and bad cooperation in a team.","Karcz, Edyta, Zdun-Ryzewska, Agata, Zimmermann, Agnieszka","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010145","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(1):145, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25795,""

We then extend this discussion to physical health, drawing upon a wealth of theoretical and empirical work demonstrating that threats to belonging are a risk factor for longer term health problems and premature mortality. We also highlight potential mechanisms linking threats to belonging and health, with a focus on sleep and immune function.

"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Comparison between Caregivers of Autistic and Non-Autistic Individuals in Italy","The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted the daily routine of the population worldwide, including autistic people and their caregivers, with severe consequences on mental health. On one hand, the reduced social contacts and the interruption of outpatient and daycare services during the lockdown have represented a real challenge for autistic people and their caregivers. On the other hand, confinement has allowed individuals to spend more time pursuing their interests and stay home with their family members without feeling the pressure of social expectations. The present study aimed to compare the levels of personal wellbeing, family distress, insomnia, and resilience between caregivers of autistic people and caregivers of people with other neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, or relational disabilities. A web survey was completed by 383 participants, of which 141 were primary caregivers of autistic people. We did not find any significant difference between caregivers of autistic and non-autistic people in any of the considered psychological variables. Lower age of the autistic family member and lower resilience levels were significantly associated with higher individual distress in the group of caregivers of autistic people. Our findings do not corroborate the hypothesis that caregivers of autistic individuals have had more severe consequences than other caregivers during the lockdown. However, they confirm the importance of promoting resilient coping strategies in autistic people and their caregivers.","Fusar-Poli, Laura, Martinez, Miriam, Surace, Teresa, Meo, Valeria, Patania, Federica, Avanzato, Chiara, Signorelli, Maria Salvina, Aguglia, Eugenio","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12010116","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 12(1):116, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25798,""

Clinical and hospitalization data were collected from hospital medical records in a sample of individuals recovered from COVID-19 at five public hospitals in Spain. A predefined list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically assessed, but patients were free to report any symptom. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were also assessed. Adjusted multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the association of sex with post-COVID related-symptoms. A total of 1969 individuals (age: 61, SD: 16 years, 46.4% women) were assessed 8.4 months after discharge. No overall significant sex differences in COVID-19 onset symptoms at hospital admission were found.

"The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on services for substance use in Denmark: Implications for meeting usersâ€™ needs and recommendations for the future","Background: The aim of this study was to document employees? experiences of changes in service provision for substance use disorders (SUDs) during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark (spring 2020), as well as to examine their relation to challenges in meeting the service users? needs. Methods: Employees (N?=?373) working in SUD treatment and harm reduction services completed an online survey soon after the first national lockdown. The survey included questions about changes in service provision during the lockdown, perceived concerns of the service users, and challenges in meeting the users? emerging needs. Results: Employees reported some positive changes in service provisions, such as increased flexibility in appointments, administering medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and use of telehealth. Negative changes were related to reduced contact with practitioners and harm reduction facilities. Approximately one third of employees reported significant challenges in meeting the users? emerging needs. This was particularly so when users? concerns were about physical and mental well-being, and substance use. In regression models, negative changes in the access to practitioners and MAT administration (but not other changes) predicted difficulties meeting the users? needs. Conclusion: Employees in SUD treatment and harm reduction services in Denmark experienced both positive and negative changes as a result of the first lockdown. However, not all the provision changes were linked to challenges in meeting the users? needs. We discuss practical and research implications of our findings with a focus on the users? physical and mental health, use of telehealth, MAT, and overall service reorganisation.","del Palacio-Gonzalez, Adriana, Thylstrup, Birgitte, Houborg, Esben","https://doi.org/10.1177/14550725211069229","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Nordic Studies on Alcohol and Drugs;: 14550725211069229, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25800,""
"Relationships between Occupational Stress, Change in Work Environment during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms among Non-Healthcare Workers in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study aims to clarify the effect of occupational stress and changes in the work environment on non-healthcare workers&rsquo;(HCWs) mental health during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. A web-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from 16 to 17 December 2020. Data from 807 non-HCWs were included. We evaluated occupational stress using the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire (GJSQ). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Japanese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, respectively. We collected demographic variables, work-related variables, and the variables associated with COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratios for depressive and anxiety groups were estimated using multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusted for all the demographic variables, work-related variables, COVID-19-related variables, and the six subdivided GJSQ subscales. The results confirm a relationship between variance in workload, job future ambiguity, social support from coworkers, having contact with COVID-19 patients, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Paying attention to job future ambiguity, the variance in workload at the workplace and individual perspectives, promoting contact and support among coworkers using online communication tools, and reducing contact with COVID-19 patients, will be useful for decreasing the depressive and anxiety symptoms among non-HCWs.","Deguchi, Yasuhiko, Iwasaki, Shinichi, Niki, Akihiro, Kadowaki, Aya, Hirota, Tomoyuki, Shirahama, Yoshiki, Nakamichi, Yoko, Okawa, Yutaro, Uesaka, Yuki, Inoue, Koki","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020983","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(2):983, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25801,""
"Psychological Flexibility Mediates Wellbeing for People with Adverse Childhood Experiences during COVID-19","Background: The psychological impact of COVID-19 is multifaceted, both acute and chronic, and has not affected everyone equally. Method: This longitudinal study compared those with and without Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on measures of psychological distress and wellbeing over time. Results: All groups (No ACE, Low ACE, and High ACE) had similar levels of distress at Time 1, with significant increases in psychological distress for those with ACEs over time, but not for those without. Psychological Flexibility was strongly and significantly associated with decreases in psychological distress and improved wellbeing. It significantly mediated the relationship between ACE and wellbeing. Conclusions: Those with ACEs report significantly increased psychological distress over time, compared to those without ACE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions using Psychological Flexibility may improve mental health and wellbeing to help further mediate its effects.","Browne, Angela, Stafford, Owen, Berry, Anna, Murphy, Eddie, Taylor, Laura K.; Shevlin, Mark, McHugh, Louise, Carr, Alan, Burke, Tom","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11020377","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(2):377, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25802,""
"Development of a Web-App for the Ecological Momentary Assessment of Dietary Habits among College Students: The HEALTHY-UNICT Project","The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a critical period for the development of healthy behaviors. Yet, it is often characterized by unhealthy food choices. Considering the current pandemic scenario, it is also essential to assess the effects of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) on lifestyles and diet, especially among young people. However, the assessment of dietary habits and their determinants is a complex issue that requires innovative approaches and tools, such as those based on the ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Here, we describe the first phases of the &ldquo;HEALTHY-UNICT&rdquo;project, which aimed to develop and validate a web-app for the EMA of dietary data among students from the University of Catania, Italy. The pilot study included 138 students (mean age 24 years, SD = 4.2;75.4% women), who used the web-app for a week before filling out a food frequency questionnaire with validation purposes. Dietary data obtained through the two tools showed moderate correlations, with the lowest value for butter and margarine and the highest for pizza (Spearman&rsquo;s correlation coefficients of 0.202 and 0.699, respectively). According to the cross-classification analysis, the percentage of students classified into the same quartile ranged from 36.9% for vegetable oil to 58.1% for pizza. In line with these findings, the weighted-kappa values ranged from 0.15 for vegetable oil to 0.67 for pizza, and most food categories showed values above 0.4. This web-app showed good usability among students, assessed through a 19-item usability scale. Moreover, the web-app also had the potential to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on students&rsquo;behaviors and emotions, showing a moderate impact on sedentary activities, level of stress, and depression. These findings, although interesting, might be confirmed by the next phases of the HEALTHY-UNICT project, which aims to characterize lifestyles, dietary habits, and their relationship with anthropometric measures and emotions in a larger sample of students.","Barchitta, Martina, Maugeri, Andrea, Favara, Giuliana, Magnano San Lio, Roberta, Riela, Paolo Marco, Guarnera, Luca, Battiato, Sebastiano, Agodi, Antonella","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14020330","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(2):330, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25803,""
"The Mental Health and Social Media Use of Young Australians during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Young people may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may also be more likely to use social media at this time. This study aimed to explore young people&rsquo;s mental health and social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined their use of social media to seek and provide support for suicidal thoughts and self-harm during this period. Young people aged 16&ndash;25 (n = 371, M = 21.1) from the general population in Australia completed an anonymous, cross-sectional online survey advertised on social media from June to October 2020. Participants reported high levels of psychological distress, with over 40% reporting severe levels of anxiety and depression, and those with a mental health diagnosis were more likely to perceive the pandemic to have had a negative impact on their mental health. Gender-diverse participants appeared the most negatively impacted. Social media use was high, with 96% reporting use at least once a day, and two-thirds reporting an increase in social media use since the start of the pandemic. One-third had used social media to seek support for suicidal thoughts or self-harm, and half had used it to support another person. This study adds to a growing literature suggesting social media can provide an opportunity to support young people experiencing psychological distress and suicide risk. Uniquely, this study points to the utility of using social media for this purpose during high-risk periods such as pandemics, where access to face-to-face support may be limited. To promote the quality and safety of support provided on social media, resources for help-seekers and help-givers should be developed and disseminated. Social media companies must consider the vulnerability of some users during pandemics and do what they can to promote wellbeing and safety.","Bailey, Eleanor, Boland, Alexandra, Bell, Imogen, Nicholas, Jennifer, La Sala, Louise, Robinson, Jo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031077","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1077, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25804,""
"Inclusion Scenarios and Conformational Flexibility of the SSRI Paroxetine as Perceived from Polymorphism of &beta;-Cyclodextrin&ndash;Paroxetine Complex","Depression, a global mental health problem, is prevalent during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and can be efficiently treated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Our study series aims at forwarding insights on the &beta;-cyclodextrin (&beta;-CD)&ndash;SSRI inclusion complexes by X-ray crystallography combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Here, we report a new crystal form (II) of the 1:1 &beta;-CD&ndash;paroxetine (PXT) complex, which is inspired by the reported 2:1 &beta;-CD&ndash;PXT complex (crystal form I), reflecting an elusive phenomenon of the polymorphism in CD inclusion complexes. The &beta;-CD&ndash;PXT polymorphism stems from the PXT conformational flexibility, which is defined by torsion angles &kappa;, &epsilon;around the -CH2&ndash;O- group bridging the A- and C&ndash;D-rings, of which those of PXT in I and II are totally different. While PXT (II) in an open V-shaped conformation that has the B-ring shallowly inserted in the &beta;-CD cavity, PXT (I) in a closed U-shaped structure is mostly entirely embedded in the &beta;-CD dimeric cavity, of which the A-ring is deeply inserted in the main &beta;-CD cavity. However, PXT molecules in both crystal forms are similarly maintained in the CD cavity via host&ndash;guest N&ndash;H&middot;&middot;&middot;O5/O6 H-bonds and C/O&ndash;H&middot;&middot;&middot;&pi;(B/C) interactions and &beta;-CDs have similar 3D arrangements, channel (II) vs. screw-channel (I). Further theoretical explorations on the &beta;-CD&ndash;PXT thermodynamic stabilities and the PXT conformational stabilities based on their potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been completed by DFT calculations. The 2:1 &beta;-CD&ndash;PXT complex with the greater presence of dispersion interactions is more energetically favorable than the unimolar complex. Conversely, whereas free PXT, PXT (II) and PXT in complex with serotonin transporter are more energetically stable, PXT (I) is least stable and stabilized in the &beta;-CD cavity. As SSRIs could lessen the COVID-19 severity, the CD inclusion complexation not only helps to improve the drug bioavailability, but also promotes the use of antidepressants and COVID-19 medicines concurrently.","Aree, Thammarat","https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15010098","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals; 15(1):98, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25805,""
"Cardiac Rehabilitation in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease&mdash;A Literature Review in COVID-19 Era","Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an integral part of the management of various cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), or chronic heart failure (CHF), with proven morbidity and mortality benefits. This article aims to review and summarize the scientific literature related to cardiac rehabilitation programs for patients with PAD and how they were adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of CR programs has been problematic since the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing and work-related restrictions. One of the main challenges for physicians and health systems alike has been the management of PAD patients. COVID-19 predisposes to coagulation disorders that can lead to severe thrombotic events. Home-based walking exercises are more accessible and easier to accept than supervised exercise programs. Cycling or other forms of exercise are more entertaining or challenging alternatives to exercise therapy. Besides treadmill exercises, upper- and lower-extremity ergometry also has great functional benefits, especially regarding walking endurance. Supervised exercise therapy has a positive impact on both functional capacity and also on the quality of life of such patients. The most effective manner to acquire this seems to be by combining revascularization therapy and supervised exercise. Rehabilitation programs proved to be a mandatory part of the integrative approach in these cases, increasing quality of life, and decreasing stress levels, depression, and anxiety.","Anghel, Razvan, Adam, Cristina Andreea, Marcu, Dragos Traian Marius, Mitu, Ovidiu, Mitu, Florin","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11020416","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(2):416, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25806,""
"Massive Nonfatal Hydroxychloroquine Ingestion in a Pediatric Patient","Background Hydroxychloroquine overdose is rare but potentially lethal. Hydroxychloroquine overdose symptoms are characterized by central nervous system toxicity, cardiac toxicity, and hypokalemia. Recommended treatment consists of epinephrine, high-dose diazepam, and careful potassium repletion. Few pediatric hydroxychloroquine overdoses have been reported. Case Report We describe a 14-year-old girl who ingested 10 g (172 mg/kg) of hydroxychloroquine. She developed tachycardia, hypotension, and hypokalemia. She was intubated and treated with diazepam and epinephrine infusions and potassium supplementation. Her serum hydroxychloroquine concentration obtained 10 h after ingestion was 13,000 ng/mL (reference range 500â€“2000 ng/mL). The patient made a full medical recovery. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Pediatric hydroxychloroquine overdoses are reported rarely, and the toxic and lethal doses of hydroxychloroquine ingestion have not been established. This case of a teenaged patient who ingested 10 g of hydroxychloroquine and survived provides additional information that may be used to help establish toxic and lethal doses of ingestion.","Srihari, Priya, Minns, Alicia B.; Gao, Han T.; Kreshak, Allyson A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.10.043","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The Journal of Emergency Medicine;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25807,""
"Understanding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on families involved in the child welfare system: Technological capital and pandemic practice","Child-welfare practices transformed drastically in 2020 after governments instituted quarantining and social-distancing measures. Child visitation, mental health evaluations and treatment, and court hearings either ceased or only accessible via information communication technologies (ICTs). Peer-reviewed published scholarship about technology use in child welfare is limited to voluntary, supplemental contexts and insufficient to understand the nuanced effects of this transition on vulnerable populations. We used a critical case study ethnography to name this phenomenon, 'pandemic practice', and describe how case-management challenges were compounded and/or masked by pandemic practice. Mandatory ICT use in case management contributed to injustices for some families in the child-welfare system, including children spending extended time in foster care, families receiving superficial treatment services and irreparable harm to timely case progression. We used technology adoption theory and technological capital framework to identify and understand the complexities of pandemic practice beyond a simple digital divide perspective. We present a hierarchy of technological capital necessary to participate in pandemic practice, suggestions to create sufficient capital and implications for policy and practice.","Conrad, J.

Forty-five individuals (ages 25-65) participated in two ecological momentary assessments (EMA): pre-pandemic and during-pandemic (Fall, 2020). Participants reported how much they felt 6 negative emotions several times each day for 10 days (resulting up to 91 EMA â€œeventsâ€). Each eventâ€™s NED was computed and then averaged using an adaptation of Shannonâ€™s entropy. Participants with higher levels of average NED had higher levels of concurrent depression and anxiety. When adjusting for average levels of negative emotion and other covariates, NED was a significant predictor of depression and anxiety only during the pandemic. These findings, which did not vary by age, suggest that having more diverse negative emotions on a moment-to-moment basis may hold greater significance for mental illness outcomes during times of extreme chronic stress.","Urban-Wojcik, Emily, Barnes, Alexandra, Fitch, Dan, Kirvin-Quamme, Andrew, Nord, Elizabeth, Gresham, Lauren, Davidson, Richard, Schaefer, Stacey","https://www.google.com/search?q=More+Negative+Emodiversity+Is+Associated+With+Worse+Mental+Illness+During+(but+Not+Before)+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):19-19, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25813,""
"COVID-19 in Assisted Living: Evidence on Policies, Provider Experiences, and Resident Mortality","The devastating effects of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among older adults residing in long-term care settings has been well documented. Assisted living settings in the U.S. have 811,000 residents;most are 80 years or older, and many have one or more chronic illnesses, making them highly susceptible to poor outcomes if exposed to COVID-19. This symposium highlights five studies that focus on various levels of COVID-19 response in assisted living: national organizations, states, assisted living operators and healthcare providers, and residents. The first study compares the sometimes conflicting guidance provided by national long-term care industry-related organizations and recommends assisted living-specific actions for the future. The second study describes the state regulatory response to COVID-19 in assisted living, identifying the themes and implications for the function of the care networks of assisted living residents. The third study presents findings from interviews with key stakeholders, including policymakers and industry leaders, that reflect on the challenges responding to changing recommendations and policies. The fourth study reports results from a survey with administrators and medical and mental health care providers who treat their residents that illustrates the care practices that were implemented in response to COVID-19 in assisted living. The fifth presentation documents the national excess assisted living resident mortality that was attributable to COVID-19.

"The Role of Intersectionality in Access to Technology Among Older Adults","In the era of COVID-19, technology has become a primary means of connecting with the world while maintaining physical distance, which is crucial for older adults who are at disproportionately high risk of infection and death. Throughout the pandemic, there has been increased emphasis on using telehealth to access medical and mental health care, and technology (e.g., apps, social media, video calls) for social interactions/communication to mitigate loneliness/isolation. Thus, COVID-19 has increased the need for older adults to access technology, and widened disparities experienced by those with limited access. This study used data from the 2018 National Health and Aging Trends Study, an annual longitudinal panel survey of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ in the U.S, to explore the association between the interaction of race/ethnicity and sex, and access to both a working cell phone and laptop/computer. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted. The sample (N=2,442) was 83.7% white, 8.5% Black, and 7.8% Hispanic. After accounting for other explanatory variables, logistic regression analysis indicated significantly higher odds of not having both a working cell phone or computer/laptop among White women (OR=1.518, CI=.1.510-1.527), Black men (OR=.1.741, CI= 1.720-1.763), Black women (OR=2.567, CI= 2.545-2.589), Hispanic men (OR=1.036, CI=1.022-1.050), and Hispanic women (OR=2.265, CI=.2.243-2.287) compared to White men. Overall, Hispanic and Black women were the least likely to have access to technology compared to other groups. Addressing technological equity remains a need. Future research should consider how the provision of devices along with technological literary programs can improve well-being among BIPOC women.","Suntai, Zainab, Beltran, Susanny","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Role+of+Intersectionality+in+Access+to+Technology+Among+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):259-260, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25816,""
"COVID-19 Perspectives of Assisted Living and Health Care Providers in Seven States","Thirty percent of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care were in assisted living (AL), indicating challenges providing care. This project recruited AL administrators and medical and mental health care providers in a seven-state stratified random sample of 250 communities;it asked what was most challenging responding to COVID-19, what was successful, how to have better dealt with COVID-19, and how others could have helped. The most common challenge was addressing residentsâ€™ psychosocial needs, explained as â€œNo contact - no hugging. The seniors require touch. It's something we've always done, and we can't do;we're required not to do it.â€ Successes included infection prevention, and in hindsight, administrators discussed staffing. Related to external entities, one commented, â€œCome in the building and see what we're doing. Don't sit behind a freaking screen and act like you know what we're doing.â€ Providers stressed patient access to care and social isolation.

"Persistence, Magnitude and Patterns of Post-acute Symptoms and Quality of Life Following Onset of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Cohort Description and Approaches for Measurement","BACKGROUND There is mounting evidence for the presence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), but there is limited information on the spectrum, magnitude, duration, and patterns of these sequelae as well as their influence on quality of life. METHODS We assembled a cohort of adults with documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity who were = 2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first positive test. At 4-month intervals, we queried physical and mental health symptoms and quality of life. RESULTS Of the first 179 participants enrolled, 10 were asymptomatic during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were most common through 8 months of observation. Symptoms were typically at least somewhat bothersome and sometimes exhibited a waxing-and-waning course. Some participants experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months compared to pre-COVID-19. Two clusters of symptom domains were identified. CONCLUSION Many participants report bothersome symptoms following onset of COVID-19 with variable patterns of persistence and impact on quality of life. The substantial variability suggests the existence of multiple sub-phenotypes of PASC. A rigorous approach to the prospective measurement of symptoms and functional manifestations sets the stage for the next phase of research focusing on the pathophysiologic causes of the various sub-groups of PASC.","Peluso, Michael J.; Kelly, J.

"Loneliness and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Cognitively Impaired Older Adults during COVID-19 Pandemic","Background Cognitively impaired older adults living in the community have been vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 confinement. The current studyâ€™s objectives were to examine the prevalence of loneliness in such adults along with impact of COVID-19 on neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional status. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in community dwelling cognitively impaired older Veterans (N=41). Demographic data such as age, gender, race, and rurality were collected. Loneliness data were collected with the 3-item Loneliness Questionnaire. Cognition was assessed with the Tele-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) and functional status of instrumental activities of daily living was assessed with the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Neuropsychiatry symptoms including severity and distress were collected using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and change during COVID was also recorded for each symptom. Results Demographic characteristics included: mean age of 71.9 (Â±8.6) years, 95.1% male, 46.3% rural, 75.6% Caucasian, and 19.5% African American. Loneliness was prevalent in most participants (62.5%). T-MoCA and FAQ mean scores were 15.1 (Â±4.5) and 10.0 (Â±8.6), respectively. Mean NPI total severity and total distress were 8.4 (Â±5.9) and 11.4 (Â±8.5), respectively. Irritability was most frequently reported symptom (65%), followed by agitation (57.5%), anxiety (55%), depression (50%), and night-time behavior (50%). A majority of the participants reported worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms during COVID (71.1%). Among those that reported worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms, 70.4% noted an increase in = two symptoms. Conclusion Older adults with pre-existent cognitive impairment may be at high risk for loneliness and worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms during the COVID pandemic.","Padala, Prasad, Padala, Kalpana, Jendro, Ashlyn, Gauss, Clinton, Wilson, Kerrie, Das, Aparna, House, Samuel, Mooney, Scott","https://www.google.com/search?q=Loneliness+and+Neuropsychiatric+Symptoms+in+Cognitively+Impaired+Older+Adults+during+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):743-743, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25819,""

Participants included 1260 adults (45% women) ages 18 to 97 from the May and June 2020 nationally representative Survey of Consumers and 562 who completed a 6 month follow up in November/December. A total of 76% were White, 10% were Black, 3% were Asian, and 11% were Hispanic. Participants reported experiences of pandemic-related stress, social isolation and depressive symptoms in the last month. Analyses showed that minority groups reported greater pandemic related stress that had negative implications for depressive symptoms over time.

"Current Research on Suicide in Older Adults","Rates of suicide are elevated in middle- and late-life, yet studies focusing on suicidal ideation and behavior in older adults are limited compared to research in younger adults. The studies included in the present symposium offer valuable findings on suicide in older adults across the span of late-life. Owsiany et al. focus on age differences between older and younger adults in the association between anxiety symptoms and suicide risk. In Heisel et al., an online intervention is assessed for improving the outcomes of psychological well-being and suicide risk in older adult men who are transitioning into retirement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Crnek-Georgeson and Wilson reviewed the link between retirement patterns and psychological effects, including suicidal behaviors, among older adults. Additionally, this review includes recommendations for policy makers and employers in an effort to assist older adults with the transition into retirement. Utilizing baseline data from the Helping Older Adults Engage study, Fenstermacher et al. research the association between volunteering and suicidal ideation in a predominantly lonely older adult sample across the span of late-life. Together, these studies provide foundation for future research on suicide in late-life to build upon. Future studies should continue to focus on risk and protective factors for suicide in older adults and aim to improve screening and intervention for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this population.

"Challenges with Pain Treatment for Rural Older Adults: Family Caregivers' Views","Family caregivers face various challenges in assisting older adults experiencing pain and difficult symptoms. Living in rural areas poses additional obstacles to their caregiving. The purpose of this study was to explore family caregiversâ€™ lived experiences in caring for older adults with pain and discomfort in rural communities. A qualitative research design was adopted to capture the common essence of participantsâ€™ experiences through a phenomenological method. Purposeful sampling was used, and the participant criteria was: age 18+, have good thinking skills, resident of Alabama, provide unpaid assistance to a family/relative who has chronic/serious health conditions and experienced pain/discomfort in the last 3 months. Ten participants were recruited from rural counties of Alabama. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted via phone and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive, thematic analysis of the data revealed themes in five categories: 1) impact of pain (physical and psychological/emotional toll), 2) coping strategies (faith/contentment with life/logistical adaptation), 3) impact of Covid-19 (physical health/social interaction/mental health/added caregiving), 4) challenges in pain treatment (transportation (time/distance/driver/cost) and non-transportation related problems (healthcare provider issues/health insurance/financial burden)), and 5) suggestions (transportation-related (more transportation options/tailored services) and non-transportation-related support (home-based services/better health insurance coverage)). Findings of this study highlight rural family caregiversâ€™ unique experiences in assisting older adultsâ€™ access to pain treatment, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Policy- and program-level intervention is called for to increase individualized transportation options, improve health insurance coverage, and expand financial support for rural older adults experiencing pain and their caregivers.","Noh, Hyunjin, Won, Cho Rong, Suntai, Zainab","https://www.google.com/search?q=Challenges+with+Pain+Treatment+for+Rural+Older+Adults:+Family+Caregivers'+Views","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):893-894, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25822,""
"Rural Older Adultsâ€™ Experiences With Pain From Chronic Illnesses and Its Treatment","Although pain control is an essential factor in promoting quality of life, pain is undertreated among certain sub-populations, such as older adults and rural residents. The purpose of this study was to explore pain experiences and its treatment among rural older adults. A qualitative research design was adopted to capture the common essence of participantsâ€™ experiences through a phenomenological method. Purposeful sampling was used, and the participant criteria was: age 55+, have good thinking skills, resident of Alabama, have chronic/serious health conditions, and experienced pain or discomfort in the last 3 months. Twenty-three participants were recruited from rural counties of West and South Alabama through the local Area Agency on Aging and health and senior service centers. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted via phone and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify emerging themes and repeated patterns from the data. Our results revealed themes in four categories: 1) impact of pain: physical limitations and coping strategies, 2) Impact of Covid-19: physical health, social, and mental health impact, 3) challenges in pain treatment: transportation (driver/time/cost/Covid-19 exposure) and non-transportation related problems (lacking resources/mistrust/limited health insurance coverage), and 4) suggestions: transportation-related (more transportation options/financial assistance) and non-transportation-related support (improved insurance coverage/non-pharmacological care) . Findings of this study highlight rural older adultsâ€™ unique needs in access to pain treatment, further amplified during the Covid-19 pandemic. Increase in sustainable, funded transportation programs and the supply of local pain specialists is critical to meet such needs and improve their quality of life.","Noh, Hyunjin, Suntai, Zainab, Won, Cho Rong","https://www.google.com/search?q=Rural+Older+Adultsâ€™+Experiences+With+Pain+From+Chronic+Illnesses+and+Its+Treatment","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):290-291, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25823,""
"Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Roles of Age, Race, and Gender","In the early months of COVID-19, behavioral modifications (i.e., social distancing) were the only means available to ameliorate contagion. These had widespread ramifications for well-being, although older adults showed relatively less disruption and high resilience than their younger counterparts (Carney et al., 2021). Early findings highlight the need for a life course perspective when examining reactions to COVID-19, based on social structure, personal agency, and individual differences such as age, gender, and personality (Settersten et al., 2020). The presentations in this symposium contribute to a developing body of research that delves deeper into individual lived experiences during COVID-19. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, Ryan examines cohort and age differences in pandemic-related social contact, communication, loneliness, and well-being for women in the US, revealing that the impact of pandemic-attributed psychosocial experiences on well-being differed by age group. Newton et al. examine associations between perceptions of future time, COVID-19 disruption, and psychological well-being among older Canadian women, finding that COVID-19 disruption moderated the relationship between constrained time horizons and well-being. Birditt and colleagues assessed racial disparities in relationships between COVID-related stress, social isolation, and depression among adults aged 18-97 from the Survey of Consumers, and found ethnic/racial minorities reported greater pandemic-related stress and that stress and social isolation had detrimental effects on well-being. A discussion by Lodi-Smith will emphasize the necessity to include individual differences â€“ age, race, gender, cohort, cultural context â€“when examining pandemic-related well-being in order to provide a more nuanced body of research.","Newton, Nicky, Lodi-Smith, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=Well-Being+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+The+Roles+of+Age,+Race,+and+Gender","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):512-512, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25824,""
"â€œIt isnâ€™t Going to Last Forever!â€ The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Older Adults","The media puts a spotlight on older adultsâ€™ vulnerability to COVID-19 with limited consideration on how they view and cope with this crisis. This study is to give older adults voices to share their experiences of this pandemic. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 46 adults between the ages of 66 and 97 from the midwestern United States. Participants were asked to share how the pandemic affects them, their vision for the future, and how they cope during the pandemic. Although they worried about their health, felt isolated and missed seeing family and friends, most participants shared an optimistic view for the future. Some said that they are looking forward to receiving the vaccine, some believed that the effects of the pandemic are just temporary, and others compared that of the pandemic to the wars and other types of hardships which were much worse. Strategies for coping during the pandemic vary from spiritual practices to positive thinking, from exercises to new hobbies, and from calling family members to cutting down on the news. The results also show that the oldest-old and old-old participants seem to be better at regulating their negative effects compared to the young-old. One female participant in her 90s shared that she does not worry about the pandemic because there is nothing that she can do about it. Older adultsâ€™ adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic should be better understood to reverse the image of their vulnerabilities and promote late-life coping during crises.","Liou, Chih-ling","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œIt+isnâ€™t+Going+to+Last+Forever!â€+The+Effects+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):601-601, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25825,""
"Coping With Uncertainty: Use of Contemplative Practices Amid a Pandemic","Contemplative practices have been used as coping resources to reduce the negative influences of adverse life situations on mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted older adults, causing immense uncertainty, stress, and anxiety. By using data from our â€œCoping with Pandemicâ€ nationwide web-based survey (n=1861), we examine the utilization of practices such as meditation, prayer, and yoga across social, economic, and health status during the pandemic. Consistent with studies conducted before the pandemic, we find significantly greater utilization of meditation and yoga among women and higher educated individuals. Findings showed significantly greater usage of prayer among women and Blacks. Unlike previous studies, we documented greater usage of meditative practices among Blacks than Whites. Older adults with higher anxiety were significantly more likely to practice meditation and yoga. Our study offers much needed guidance for future intervention studies aimed at improving mental health among diverse groups of older adults.","Lekhak, Nirmala, Bhatta, Tirth, Goler, Tim, Kahana, Eva","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+With+Uncertainty:+Use+of+Contemplative+Practices+Amid+a+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):132-132, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25826,""
"Diversity of Activities, Emotions, and Pleasant Events and Their Associations With Mental and Cognitive Health","The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the structure of our daily lives. One of the most significant changes is a limited opportunity to engage in face-to-face social interactions and enjoy diverse daily activities. This raises a public health concern, because diverse experiences are critical sources of health by increasing social integration, cognitive reserve, and psychological resources. Recently, two lines of research have consistently shown that activity diversity or emodiversity is associated with multiple health outcomes. However, still more integrated efforts are needed to better understand diversity of daily experiences in various aspects and their contributions to health. This symposium brings together different endeavors towards understanding how diversity of daily experiences â€“ activity diversity, emodiversity, and variety in positive experiences â€“ are associated with health and well-being across adulthood. The topic of this symposium is timely to discuss potential prevention approaches to protect population well-being as the pandemic evolves. Paper 1 examines activity diversity (breadth and evenness of daily activity participation) and how it is related to positive and negative emodiversity (rich and balanced emotional experiences) differently by age groups. Paper 2 investigates the longitudinal relationship between activity variety across cognitive, physical, and social domains and cognitive functioning. Paper 3 examines variety in pleasant events and its associations with mental health outcomes. Paper 4 examines whether and how negative emodiversity is associated with mental illness during COVID-19.

"Longitudinal Effects of Coping Strategies on Mental Health of Older Adults Living Alone During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing measures have posed a significant threat to the mental health of older adults, particularly those living alone. Accordingly, the World Health Organization implemented the #HealthyAtHome program, encouraging people to keep in regular contact with loved ones, stay physically active, and keep a regular routine. The current study aims to examine a micro-longitudinal link between positive coping strategies (e.g., exercise, meditation, relaxation, and virtual social contacts) and depressive symptoms among older adults who live alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used 21 biweekly waves of longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between April 2020 and February 2021 (N=839, observation= 16,256). The multilevel models with correlated random effects were estimated to examine lagged effects of coping strategies (t-1) on depressive symptoms (t). The analysis used the xthybrid command with clustered standard errors in Stata 15.1. The results show that exercise (b=-.10, p=0.02), relaxation (b=-02, p=0.01), and virtual social contacts (b=-.01, p=0.01) were predictive of lower depressive symptoms even after controlling for time-invariant and time-varying covariates. Meditation, however, was associated with higher depressive symptoms (b=.01, p=0.02). The results show that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as taking time to exercise or relax, may enhance mental health and well-being for older adults living alone. Virtual social contacts such as video calls could be an effective way to keep older adults socially connected and emotionally healthy.","Kim, Seoyoun, Yoon, Hyunwoo, Jang, Yuri","https://www.google.com/search?q=Longitudinal+Effects+of+Coping+Strategies+on+Mental+Health+of+Older+Adults+Living+Alone+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):440-441, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25829,""

Although income decline and financial difficulty rates were both statistically significantly higher among those financially strained before COVID-19 (19% and 34%, respectively), income decline was more common among those with incomes =200% of the poverty threshold (9%) whereas financial difficulty was more common among those with incomes &lt;200% poverty (10%). Adjusting for sociodemographic, health and depressive symptoms before COVID-19, financial difficulty was associated with worse mental health (b= -2.39, p&lt;0.001) and sleep quality (b=-0.820, p&lt;0.001), but income loss was not (b= -0.685, p=0.092 and b= -0.405, p=0.082, respectively). Timely interventions are needed for older adults reporting COVID-19 financial difficulty.","Hladek, Melissa, Cudjoe, Thomas, Drazich, Brittany, Li, Qiwei, Szanton, Sarah, Samuel, Laura","https://www.google.com/search?q=Financial+Changes+and+Health+During+COVID-19+in+the+National+Health+and+Aging+Trends+Study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):566-566, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25831,""
"Social Connectivity in the Context of COVID-19 and Long-Term Care","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted older adults, particularly those residing in long-term care homes (LTCHs), causing immense loss of life and resulting in overall health declines in LTCH residents. These vulnerable older adults have also experienced extreme loneliness, anxiety and depression. Social connectedness is an important contributor to well-being and quality of life of older adults in LTCHs and family members are an essential component to this. However, restrictions driven by policies to protect resident safety, have constrained family membersâ€™ access to long-term care homes and limited in-person contact between residents and their families. In their absence, health providers have been integral to supporting connections between residents and their families within LTCHs. This study aimed to understand the experiences of social connectedness between residents and family members who have been physically separated due to the current pandemic and, to examine LTCH health providersâ€™ experiences and responses to support social connectedness. Using a qualitative descriptive design, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 family members and 11 healthcare providers. Emergent themes from qualitative content analysis are: (a) all-encompassing impacts of separation;(b) advocacy became my life;(c) the emotional toll of the unknown;4) the burden of information translation;5) precarious balance between safety and mistrust for the healthcare system;and (d) a formulaic approach impedes connectivity. A more comprehensive understanding of the experiences and support needs of LTCH residents and their family members within the context of a pandemic can inform practice approaches to support social connections going forwards.","Garnett, Anna, Pollock, Hannah, Floriancic, Natalie, Donelle, Lorie, Babenko-Mould, Yolanda, Oudshoorn, Abe, Hand, Carri, Forchuk, Cheryl","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+Connectivity+in+the+Context+of+COVID-19+and+Long-Term+Care","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):410-410, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25832,""
"An International Perspective on the Impacts of COVID-19 on Adult Education and Training","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused one of the worst economic crises since the Great Depression and the current recession has been more detrimental to older workers compared to other age groups. Not only has it forced more older workers out of their jobs, but it has also made it much harder for jobless older workers to find a new job. Furthermore, due to increased automation and digitalization in the workplace, older workers will likely need upskilling or reskilling to improve their employment prospects in the changed labor market. This situation brings the importance of offering training and continuous education programs that target older workers to the forefront of adult education policy and practice. This qualitative study examines measures taken in response to COVID-19 in adult education and training (AET) in seven countries including Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Canada, and the United States. The findings are based on key informant interviews with international policy experts and scholars in the field of AET in addition to information gathered from written materials (e.g., government and organizational reports). To expedite their economic recovery and improve labor market outcomes for their workers, some countries have increased government funding for vocational and continuing education or offered financial support for post-secondary students while others have provided funds to employers to offer training and retraining for their employees. Some of these measures have the potential to expand adult educational opportunities in the post-pandemic world. Implications for policy and practiced are discussed.","Dikhtyar, Oksana, Helsinger, Abigail, Cummins, Phyllis, Hicks, Nytasia","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+International+Perspective+on+the+Impacts+of+COVID-19+on+Adult+Education+and+Training","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):147-147, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25833,""
"COVID-19 Related Media Consumption and Mental Health in Older Adults","At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, consuming media was critical to identify precautionary behaviors to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly for older adults. Media consumption leads to heightened awareness, but may also negatively affect mental health. We examined whether non-social and social media consumption impacted anxiety and depression relative to pre-COVID-19 symptoms. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional survey in May and June 2020. Participants (n=1,168, 73.2 years, 56.8% women, 94.9% White), were asked to estimate their amount of time spent consuming pandemic-related media each day, and to report on anxiety and depressive symptoms both before and after the pandemic onset. We characterized change in anxiety and depression by subtracting scores on current anxiety and depressive symptoms from their recalled symptoms prior to the pandemic. Respondents with high pandemic-related media consumption (&gt;3hrs) were more likely to have increased anxiety, compared to those with low (&lt;1hr) media consumption (OR:1.57, 95%CI:1.09-2.23). Similarly, respondents with increased social media consumption during the pandemic were 64% more likely to have depression, compared to those who did not use social media. This association was bi-directionalâ€” those who reduced their social media use were 45% less likely to have depression and 26% less likely to have anxiety, compared to those who never used social media. Older adults consuming more pandemic-related media had increased anxiety. Increased social media consumption was associated with elevated depression symptoms. The potential benefits of media consumption about the COVID-19 pandemic may have unintended negative consequences on mental health.","Cenko, Erta, Kaufmann, Christopher, Manini, Todd","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+Related+Media+Consumption+and+Mental+Health+in+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1006-1006, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25834,""
"How Has COVID-19 Impacted Older Adults and Their Needs for Services?","COVID-19 has had profound effects on older adults and will have lasting impacts on their preferences and needs for services, including those offered by Meals on Wheels and other community organizations. Organizations serving older adults would benefit from insights about how to prioritize resources and services to address older adultsâ€™ needs during the pandemic and beyond. On behalf of Meals on Wheels America, NORC at the University of Chicago conducted a study to explore COVID-19â€™s impacts on older adults and older adultsâ€™ needs during the pandemic. We conducted two data collection activities with adults age 60 and older: a nationally representative survey with 1,535 respondents and 24 interviews. Results indicated that COVID-19 has affected older adultsâ€™ physical and mental health, social connectedness, employment, and use of services and technology. Informal networks of family members and friends are a source of assistance for 50% of older adults during the pandemic. Impacts of COVID-19 differed by income, rurality, disability status, and living situation. Findings documented the extent to which older adults had unmet needs during the pandemic, such as activities to help keep busy at home and affordable food to meet dietary needs. Survey respondents who have a lower income, are 75 and older, live alone, and who are Black were more likely to have unmet needs. Findings suggested a need to strengthen partnerships among organizations that serve older adults to address diverse needs, conduct ongoing assessments of older adultsâ€™ needs and preferences, and enhance assistance for informal support networks.","Bayne, Alycia, Kennedy, Mallory, Alvarez, Emily, Wright, Bernadette, Theilheimer, Lucy, Benz, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+Has+COVID-19+Impacted+Older+Adults+and+Their+Needs+for+Services?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):440-440, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25835,""
"Worsening Mental Health and Self-Rated Health in Older Incarcerated Persons During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Incarcerated persons age 50 and older comprise one of societyâ€™s most vulnerable groups given high rates of chronic illness, estrangement from family/friends, and suicide. Consequently, the mental health impact of COVID-19 on this population may be especially salient. Using data from the ongoing Aging Inmatesâ€™ Suicidal Ideation and Depression study (Aging INSIDE), we determined change in older incarcerated personsâ€™ mental health (anxiety and depression symptoms) and change in self-rated health (SRH) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluated how these variables were related. Of the 202 still-incarcerated Aging INSIDE participants, 157 (77%) completed Check-In Surveys between August-September 2020. Participants were 96% male, racially diverse (41% White, 41% Black, 18% Hispanic/Other) and average age was 56.0(Â±5.8) years. From before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, average anxiety symptom scores, assessed by the GAD-7, increased (worsened) (from 6.4Â±5.7 to 7.8Â±6.6;p&lt;0.001), average depressive symptoms scores, measured by the PHQ-8, increased (worsened) (from 5.5Â±6.0 to 8.1Â±6.5;p&lt;0.001), and average SRH decreased (worsened) (from 3.0Â±0.2 to 2.6Â±0.2;p&lt;0.001). Worsening anxiety led to worsening depressive symptoms (direct effect = 0.339;p&lt;0.05). A mediation model controlling for age, race, chronic conditions, years until release, and change in social support score found a total effect of change in anxiety on SRH change of -0.04 (p&lt;0.001), of which 34.2% flows indirectly through change in depression (p&lt;0.001). Older incarcerated persons experienced worsening mental health and SRH during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research will determine if mental health and SRH improve following vaccination and return to â€œnormalâ€ procedures.","Barry, Lisa, Noujaim, Deborah, DePalma, Alexandra, Coman, Emil, Wakefield, Dorothy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Worsening+Mental+Health+and+Self-Rated+Health+in+Older+Incarcerated+Persons+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):484-484, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25836,""
"Presidential Symposium: Social Engagement, Isolation, and Loss During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed social life across the globe and had a particularly profound impact on older people. In this BSS Presidential Symposium, we address the annual meetingâ€™s themeâ€”Disruption to Transformation: Aging in the â€œNew Normalâ€â€”by inviting noted experts to address implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for social engagement and isolation. The speakers address this theme from sociological, psychological, demographic, and public health perspectives with attention to racial disparities and the impact of the pandemic on patterns of isolation and loneliness in the population, methods for conducting research with older populations, patterns of bereavement and loss of family ties, and caregiver mental health.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Undergraduate Students' Academic Performance, Social Life, and Mental Health in the United States","Background: COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. This led most students to move out of campus housing and live in a worldwide lockdown with uncertainty over employment and other future prospects. This study aims to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate studentsâ€™ academic performance, social life, and mental health and evaluates potential predictors of stress, anxiety, and depression in relation to COVID-19. Methods: Participant data was collected as part of a survey that consisted of demographic questions, a DASS-21 questionnaire, and an open-ended question about general feelings and life adjustments during the pandemic. The final sample consisted of 1077 full-time students who were at least 18 years old and attending an undergraduate university or community college in the United States. Results: 19%, 20%, and 28% of participants met the cutoff for â€œsevereâ€ and â€œextremely severeâ€ levels of stress, anxiety, and depression according to the DASS-21 scale. Significantly higher scores in stress (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), and depression (p < 0.001) were observed for participants who claimed that remote learning had a negative impact on their school performance. During the pandemic, a significant increase in the hours of sleep (p < 0.001), and a significant decrease in hours spent on extracurricular activities (p < 0.001), and studying (p < 0.001) were observed. To manage stress, talking to a family member was a significant predictor of stress (p < 0.05), anxiety (p < 0.05), and depression (p < 0.05), and engaging in favorite hobbies was only a predictor of depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant increases in the severity of stress, anxiety, and depression among undergraduate students. Unique predictors of stress, anxiety, and depression relating to studentsâ€™ academic performance, social life, and mental health have been identified to inform future interventions in improving overall student mental health. COVID-19 has influenced daily life for the foreseeable future and adaptations to these changes are still being actively researched.","Joseph Nano et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01E4-A24-B4D","20220119","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; social life; stress; depression; undergraduate students; academic performance; mental health; united states; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25839,""
"Time to Get Social: Adaptive Social Processes in the Daily Lives of Youth (Full PhD thesis)","To better understand the development of mental health problems, it is of fundamental importance to focus on both adolescence â€“ as this is the age period where most psychopathology develops â€“ and social processes â€“ as psychological distress is largely interpersonal in nature. In addition, certain parenting styles are strong predictors of both social and mental health outcomes. However, relatively little is known about how these different factors interrelate in adolescent day-to-day life. Within this dissertation, we draw on data collected with the Experience Sampling Method to gain a greater, more ecologically valid insight into the relationship between parenting, social processes, and psychopathology in adolescents. In Chapter 3, we present the case for why assessments of social processes require a greater consideration of ecological validity â€“ and of daily life. Social cognition assessments in psychosis are discussed, but the arguments posited here are relevant for all types of social assessments in mental health research. In Chapters 4 to 6, the interrelationships between parenting, psychopathology, and daily-life social interactions are studied in three empirical studies using two large adolescent experience sampling data sets. In Chapter 4, we find how parental care and control are largely related to the experienced quality of daily-life social interactions rather than to its quantity. A similar finding is reported in Chapter 5, where we see consistent associations between the quality of daily-life social interactions and mean psychopathology level â€“ and less consistent relationships between the quantity of social interactions and psychopathology. Finally, in Chapter 6, these relationships are investigated in one comprehensive model, including more specific parenting styles, and daily social interactions in different companies. In this model, paternal autonomy support and an altered quality of daily social interactions have unique associations with psychopathology levels. Taken together, these findings indicate a particular relevance of the quality of day-to-day social interactions for better understanding psychopathological development. As the social lives of contemporary adolescents are happening largely online as well as offline, in Chapter 7, we assess how adolescents experience online vs. face-to-face social interactions at the moment that they engage in them. We find how participants report more affective benefits when engaging in face-to-face interactions compared to online interactions, and, in contrast to our hypotheses, we report no moderating effects of social resources on the strength of these benefits. The investigation of adolescents` social lives and their relation with mental health became much more relevant as COVID-19 hit, when restrictions prevented people from interacting with each other. In the last study, presented in Chapter 8, we investigate differences in young peopleâ€™s mental health and day-to-day social interactions, from before the pandemic to early in the pandemic (May 2020). We find how face-to-face interactions decreased and online interactions increased, but more surprisingly, that general psychopathology levels were lower than expected and that anxiety levels had even decreased. Moreover, the relationship between the quality of social interactions and psychopathology had become stronger during the pandemic, indicating the relevance of high-quality social interaction during times of social deprivation. In sum, in this thesis, I target the uniquely relevant momentary social interaction to better understand the social development of young people â€“ and to assess when this might go awry. Across all studies, the quality of social interactions seems fundamentally important. Cross-level relationships seem to exist between general parenting perceptions and how social interactions are experienced in the moment, and between those daily-life social experiences and psychopathology levels. Future research should further disentangle these processes longitudinally to gain greater insight into the temporal ordering of these relationships. Finally, for the development of momentary interventions aimed at relieving social distress, a focus on the quality rather than the quantity of social behaviors is likely most helpful.","Robin Achterhof","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E024B-25D-48B","20220121","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","",25840,""
