"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, anxiety, and depressive disorders in German primary care: A cross-sectional study","Several studies revealed that mental disorders' prevalence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in young and female individuals. Such studies represent individuals' subjective perceptions and not the number of mental health cases treated in primary care. Thus, this study aimed to describe the changes in depression, anxiety, and stress disorder diagnoses in General Practitioner (GP) practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than three million patients of 757 German GP practices were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to assess changes in the number of incident depression, anxiety disorders, and reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders documented by GPs in 2020 compared to the average of the years 2017-2019. There was a tremendous decrease in mental health diagnoses during the first lockdown that was only slightly compensated later. Overall populations and the entire year 2020, there was no change in documented depression (0%) and stress disorders (1%), but anxiety disorders were more often documented (+19%), especially for the elderly population (&gt;80 years; +24%). This population group also received more frequently new depression (+12%) and stress disorder diagnoses (23%). The younger population was diagnosed more frequently at the end of 2020, nine months after the first lockdown. Anxiety disorders but not depression and stress diagnoses were elevated, which is not in line with previously published studies. We speculate that the elderly population was affected most by the pandemic immediately after the first lockdown was announced. The younger population has probably become more and more affected the longer the pandemic lasts.","Bohlken, Kostev, Riedel-Heller, Hoffmann, Michalowsky","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.08.016","20210827","Covid-19; Elderly; Healthcare utilization; Lockdown; Mental health; Recognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17413,""
"Better together: How group-based physical activity protects against depression","Against the backdrop of evidence that physical activity can protect against depression, there has been growing interest in the mechanisms through which this relationship operates (e.g., biological adaptations), and the factors that might moderate it (e.g., physical activity intensity). However, no attempt has been made to examine whether, or through what mechanisms, depression-related benefits might arise from belonging to groups that engage in physical activity. Across two studies, we addressed these shortcomings by (a) examining whether engaging in physical activity specifically in the context of sport or exercise groups protects against depression and (b) testing two pathways through which benefits might arise: greater physical activity and reduced loneliness. Study 1 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4549) used data from three waves of a population study of older adults residing in England. Sport or exercise group membership predicted fewer depression symptoms four years later. This relationship was underpinned by sport or exercise group members engaging in physical activity more frequently and feeling less lonely. Clinical depression rates were almost twice as high among non-group members than group members. Study 2 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 635) included Australian adults who were members of sport and exercise groups, recruited during the enforced suspension of all group-based sport and exercise due to COVID-19 restrictions. The more sport or exercise groups participants had lost physical access to, the more severe their depression symptoms. Clinical depression rates were over twice as high among those who had lost access to &gt;2 groups compared to those who had lost access to &lt;2 groups. The relationship between number of groups lost and depression symptom severity was mediated by greater loneliness, but not by overall physical activity. Overall, findings suggest that belonging to groups that engage in physical activity can protect against depression, and point to the value of initiatives that aim to promote people's engagement in such groups.","Stevens, Lieschke, Cruwys, CÃƒÂ¡rdenas, Platow, Reynolds","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114337","20210827","Depression; Exercise; Group membership; Loneliness; Mental health; Social identity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17414,""
"Psychological Effects of Screen Time in Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is the first pandemic to occur in the modern smartphone era, people universally rely on their electronic devices to stay current on the rapidly evolving circumstances. The objective of this study was to examine how daily screen time levels affect the mental health of health care workers attempting to stay up to date on the ever-changing COVID-19-related information available to them. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Health care workers at an academic teaching hospital were asked to participate in a 12-question online-based survey between the dates of May 30, 2020, and June 3, 2020. The questions included their sex, age range, occupation, department, daily screen time, changes in screen time in the last 4 weeks, and mental health outcomes such as sleep, mood, anxiety, and difficulty controlling worry. <b><i>Results:</i></b> No association was found between age, sex, occupation, and screen time. There was a statistically significant association between the type of department and daily screen time hours (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.012). A positive trend was noted between screen time and sleep disruption (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.09). An increase in hours in the last 4 weeks was associated with age (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03). A positive trend was also noted for an increase in screen hours and sleep disruption (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.11) and anxiety (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.10). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> A possible explanation for our finding of screen time not being associated with mental health outcomes could be that the knowledge that information was readily available through technology provided comfort to people as the pandemic evolved and brought changes to their daily lives.","Le, Khalid, Avramut, Lam, Ragina, Zyzanski","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21m02959","20210827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17415,""
"An Evaluation of the Psychological Impact of Covid-19 and the Precautionary Measure of Social Isolation on Adults in the Asir Region, Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 outbreak is worrying for people and society. The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measure of social isolation on adults in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was carried out in the Asir region for a period of five months from May 2020 to September 2020 to assess the psychological response of the adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic using an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted from previous research and involved three sections, namely sociodemographic data, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the generalised anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7 Scale). A total score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10 indicates depression and anxiety. Data was analysed using SPSS V.25. Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety. The findings of the study clearly show that depression and anxiety are highly prevalent among adults. Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression and anxiety than males. The findings from this study show that implementing a strategy for the prevention and management of depression and anxiety is highly recommended to minimise the impact of these disorders.","Kandasamy, Almaghaslah, Almanasef, Vasudevan, Easwaran, Chinnadhurai","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14756","20210827","Anxiety; COVID-19; GAD-7; PHQ-9; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17416,""
"Is there an association between ABO blood types and depressive symptoms among Japanese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic?","ABO blood types could be a biological predisposition for depression. The present cross-sectional analysis was conducted amid the second wave of COVID-19 in Japan during July 2020. We wanted to investigate the association between ABO blood types and depressive symptoms among workers (352 men and 864 women, aged 21-73 years) of a medical institution in Tokyo, Japan, which took a leading role in the response to COVID-19 in the country. A Poisson regression model with a robust variance estimator was used to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for depressive symptoms associated with ABO blood types. Overall, the prevalence of depressive symptoms (using two questions employed from a Two-question case-finding instrument) was 22.0%. The adjusted PRs (95% CI) for depressive symptoms, comparing the carriers of blood type O, A, and AB with those of type B, were 0.88 (0.66, 1.18), 0.81 (0.62, 1.07), and 1.07 (0.74, 1.53), respectively. There was no difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms between non-B and B carriers.

"Investigating Community Pharmacy Take Home Naloxone Dispensing during COVID-19: The Impact of One Public Health Crisis on Another","A recent report found that the number of opioid-related deaths in Ontario in the first 15 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic was 38.2% higher than in the 15 weeks before the pandemic. Our study sought to determine if pharmacy professionals self-reported an increase or decrease in naloxone provision due to the pandemic and to identify adjustments made by pharmacy professionals to dispense naloxone during the pandemic. A total of 231 Ontario community pharmacy professionals completed an online survey. Pharmacy professionals' barriers, facilitators, and comfort level with dispensing naloxone before and during the pandemic were identified. The sample consisted of mostly pharmacists (99.1%). Over half (51.1%) reported no change in naloxone dispensing, while 22.9% of respondents reported an increase and 24.7% a decrease. The most common adjustments made during the pandemic were training patients how to administer naloxone over video or phone, delivering naloxone kits, and pharmacy technicians offering naloxone at prescription intake. Over half (55%) of participants said the top barrier for dispensing was that patients did not request naloxone. Naloxone distribution through pharmacies could be further optimized to address the increased incidence of overdose deaths during the pandemic. Future research should investigate the reasons for changes in naloxone dispensing.","Daskalakis, Cid, Grindrod, Beazely","https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9030129","20210827","community pharmacy; harm reduction; naloxone; overdose; pharmacy services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17418,""
"Role of Social Media in Psychiatry During Pandemic: A Potential Risk for Suicidal Ideation","The COVID-19 pandemic brought with itself significant mental health challenges owing not only to the morbidity and mortality from the infection but also to mitigation strategies of social distancing and self-isolation. Indeed, in the absence of adequate pharmaceutical aids, quarantine and social distancing measures are taken to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, living in the world of social media, the average usage of social media could be expected to show a sharp rise as measures of social distancing and quarantine are adopted to contain the pandemic. In this context, social media could be thought of as an additional preventative resource aiding the containment of the pandemic by being a key network for communication during a crisis.Because social media usage cannot be brought down to null considering the fact that it does have some positive aspects to it in terms of disposition of useful information, we could alternatively modify the reporting to be more responsible.In conclusion, we could hypothesize that social media might surge responses for some adverse mental health conditions, increasing fear, anxiety, and panic responses, even spreading suicidal ideation and therefore impacting incidence of suicide in some way. Moreover, social media should be carefully handled, particularly during the pandemic, as social media engagement spiked. Indeed, suicide news, when not reported adequately, and most dangerous social media challenges could have devastating effects among youngest users.","Memon, Ullah, Shoib, Qudrat, de Filippis","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001380","20210827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17419,""
"What Ever Happened to Nostalgia (the Diagnosis)?","Nostalgia and homesickness are not currently regarded as mental disorders. The psychic pain associated with longing to return home had been considered a mental disorder for centuries, especially in Europe, where it was a sign of moral weakness between nations. Nostalgia's effects on American Civil War soldiers-anxiety, depression, and sleep and appetite disturbances, for example-were described by clinicians and linked to significant morbidity and mortality. Since then, although these effects of combat have been of interest, focus has shifted to psychic trauma, relegating the concept of nostalgia to an unclassified but commonly encountered condition. Besides wartime trauma, symptomatic conditions related to nostalgia have been described among displaced persons and refugees living in the diaspora longing for their homelands (e.g., social displacement syndrome). More recently, nostalgia has pervaded culture as a benign pastime, with no implications for psychopathology. Finally, the longing for return to an idyllic or imagined lifestyle has returned amid worldwide quarantining and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this new sense, nostalgia has become a remedy rather than a disease. We identify four major iterations of nostalgia: the medical condition of homesickness, the condition studied in wartime, the application to migration and social displacement, and as a remedy for existential anxiety. We conclude that nostalgia per se is neither pathological nor normative, but a consistent phenomenon in human existence that should not be overlooked in cultural assessment and psychotherapy.","Weiss, Dube","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001349","20210827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17420,""
"Telemental Health For Youth With Chronic Illnesses: Systematic Review","Children, adolescents, and young adults with chronic conditions experience difficulties coping with disease-related stressors, comorbid mental health problems, and decreased quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global mental health crisis, and telemental health has necessarily displaced in-person care. However, it remains unknown whether such remote interventions are feasible or efficacious. We aimed to fill this research-practice gap. In this systematic review, we present a synthesis of studies examining the feasibility and efficacy of telemental health interventions for youth aged Ã¢â€°Â¤25 years with chronic illnesses. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from 2008 to 2020. We included experimental, quasiexperimental, and observational studies of telemental health interventions designed for children, adolescents, and young adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¤25 years with chronic illnesses, in which feasibility or efficacy outcomes were measured. Only English-language publications in peer-reviewed journals were included. We excluded studies of interventions for caregivers or health care providers, mental health problems not in the context of a chronic illness, disease and medication management, and prevention programs for healthy individuals. We screened 2154 unique study records and 109 relevant full-text articles. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, and they represented seven unique telemental health interventions. Five of the studies included feasibility outcomes and seven included efficacy outcomes. All but two studies were pilot studies with relatively small sample sizes. Most interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy. The subset of studies examining intervention feasibility concluded that telemental health interventions were appropriate, acceptable, and satisfactory to patients and their parents. Technology did not create barriers in access to care. For the subset of efficacy studies, evidence in support of the efficacy of telemental health was mixed. Significant heterogeneity in treatment type, medical diagnoses, and outcomes precluded a meta-analysis. The state of the science for telemental health interventions designed for youth with chronic illnesses is in a nascent stage. Early evidence supports the feasibility of telehealth-based delivery of traditional in-person interventions. Few studies have assessed efficacy, and current findings are mixed. Future research should continue to evaluate whether telemental health may serve as a sustainable alternative to in-person care after the COVID pandemic.","Lau, Colt, Waldbaum, O'Daffer, Fladeboe, Yi-Frazier, McCauley, Rosenberg","https://doi.org/10.2196/30098","20210827","child; chronic disease; mental health; psychiatry; psychology; psychosocial issues; telehealth care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17421,""
"Impact of resilience on college student mental health during COVID-19","The aim of this study was to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted college student mental health and alcohol use and to determine how resilience could alleviate negative outcomes. Students attending an Appalachian university during spring 2020 were surveyed shortly after on-campus activities stopped. Survey items included resilience, demographics, self-rated health, and depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and alcohol use before and since COVID-19. There was a significant increase in prevalence of severe depression, severe anxiety, and high stress, and a significant decrease in prevalence high risk for problem drinking before and since COVID-19. Four separate standard least squares regression models were conducted with each of the dependent variables. Self-rated health was the strongest predictor for changes in depression, anxiety, and stress in each of the models, displaying a negative relationship.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine residency training","Family physicians have played a unique clinical role during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that the pandemic would be associated with significant deleterious effects on clinical activity, educational training, personal safety and well-being. We conducted a national survey to obtain preliminary data that would assist in future targeted data collection and subsequent evaluation of the impact of the pandemic on family medicine residents and teaching faculty. An anonymous online survey of residents and faculty was distributed via the Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors list serve between 5/21/2020 and 6/18/2020. Survey questions focused on clinical and educational activities, safety and well-being. One hundred and fifty-three residents and 151 teaching faculty participated in the survey. Decreased clinical activity was noted by 81.5% of residents and 80.9% of faculty and the majority began conducting telehealth visits (97.9% of residents, 91.0% of faculty). Distance learning platforms were used by all residents (100%) and 39.6% noted an overall positive impact on their education. Higher levels of burnout did not significantly correlate with reassignment of clinical duties (residents P = 0.164; faculty P = 0.064). Residents who showed significantly higher burnout scores (P = 0.035) and a decline in levels of well-being (P = 0.031) were more likely to participate in institutional well-being support activities.

"COVID-19-related worries, social disruptions, and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults with disabilities: What makes the difference?","This study explores how home- and community-based services use, COVID-19-related worries and social disruptions are related to the depressive symptoms of community-dwelling older adults with disabilities, and whether the associations differ by month of interview. Data on a sample of 593 older individuals in Taiwan were collected between April and July 2020. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test the hypothesized relationships. As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan continuously declined from April 2020, participants who were interviewed in May, June and July experienced significantly fewer COVID-19-related worries and social disruptions than those interviewed in April. The month interviewed, representing the pandemic development phase of COVID-19, moderated the relationships between home-based service (HBS) use and COVID-19 worries. Month interviewed also moderated the association between COVID-19-related social disruptions and depressive symptoms. Differences in the level of COVID-19-related worries between HBS users and non-users were greatest in April, followed by May, and least in June and July, suggesting that the disparities between HBS users and non-users attenuated over time. Perceived high COVID-19-related social disruptions was weakly and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in April, but the relationship became moderately positive in May, and strongly positive in June and July. These results supported the claim that the associations between COVID-19-related social disruptions and depressive symptoms can vary over time. Professionals who serve disabled older individuals in communities should be aware of their unstated needs and adopt strategies that are appropriate for the current stage of the COVID-19 pandemic to respond better to their needs and emotional state.","Chao, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab157","20210827","community-based services; home-based services; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17425,""

"Risk and Protective Factors for Changes in Adolescent Psychosocial Adjustment During COVID-19","The current study examined (1) changes in psychosocial adjustment among adolescents completing two surveys before COVID-19 and those completing the final survey during COVID-19 and (2) related risk/protective factors. Participants were 208 US adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 15.09, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.50, 48.8% female, 86.1% White; 40.9% COVID group) who completed longitudinal surveys assessing psychosocial adjustment and related risk/protective factors (e.g., emotion regulation, well-being pursuits). Only adolescents completing Wave 3 during COVID-19 experienced increases in depressive symptoms, negative affect, and isolation and decreases in positive affect and friendship. Several variables served as risk (i.e., dampening) and protective (i.e., eudaimonic and hedonic motives) factors of these changes. Findings highlight the range of factors that are distinctly associated with negative changes in adolescent adjustment during COVID-19.","Romm, Park, Hughes, Gentzler","https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12667","20210827","COVID-19; adolescence; longitudinal; protective factors; psychosocial adjustment; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17429,""
"Egyptian and Roma Adolescents' Perspectives on Their Developmental Assets in Albania During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This mixed-method study explores the accessibility of developmental assets among Egyptian and Roma minority youth in Albania during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Challenges Faced by Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Inquiry From Bangladesh","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused increasing challenges for healthcare professionals globally. However, there is a dearth of information about these challenges in many developing countries, including Bangladesh. This study aims to explore the challenges faced by healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) during COVID-19 in Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted qualitative research among healthcare professionals of different hospitals and clinics in Khulna and Dhaka city of Bangladesh from May 2020 to August 2020. We conducted 15 in-depth telephone interviews using a snowball sampling technique. We used an in-depth interview guide as data were collected, audiotaped, and transcribed. The data were analyzed both manually and using QDA Miner software as we used thematic analysis for this study. <b>Results:</b> Seven themes emerged from the study. Participants experienced higher workload, psychological distress, shortage of quality personal protective equipment (PPE), social exclusion/stigmatization, lack of incentives, absence of coordination, and proper management during their service. These healthcare professionals faced difficulty coping with these challenges due to situational and organizational factors. They reported of faith in God and mutual support to be the keys to adapt to adversities. Adequate support to address the difficulties faced by healthcare professionals is necessary for an overall improved health outcome during the pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings highlight the common challenges faced by healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. This implies the need to support adequate safety kits, protocols, and support for both physical and mental health of the healthcare professionals.","Razu, Yasmin, Arif, Islam, Islam, Gesesew, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.647315","20210827","Bangladesh; COVID-19; health professionals; mental health; workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17434,""
"The Impact of Face Masks on the Emotional Reading Abilities of Children-A Lesson From a Joint School-University Project","Wearing face masks has become a usual practice in acute infection events inducing the problem of misinterpreting the emotions of others. Empirical evidence about face masks mainly relies on adult data, neglecting, for example, school kids who firmly are dependent on effective nonverbal communication. Here we offer insights from a joint school-university project. Data indicate that emotional reading of 9 to 10 years old pupils (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°57) was similarly impaired as adults on an overall performance level, but that their selective performance on specific emotions was quite different. Kids showed extreme problems in reading the emotion disgust, strong effects on fear and sadness, and only mild effects on happiness, but also even better performances for emotional states anger and neutral when faces were masked. This project did gain not only relevant data about children's perception but also made clear how fruitful seriously conducted school projects can be to encourage the interest and commitment for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)-relevant topics.","Carbon, Serrano","https://doi.org/10.1177/20416695211038265","20210827","COVID-19; STEM; children; emotional states; face masks; intersectional schoolÃ¢â‚¬â€œuniversity projects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17435,""
"Social Isolation, Loneliness and Well-Being: The Impact of WeChat Use Intensity During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","This study is aimed to examine the impact of WeChat use intensity on social isolation, loneliness, and well-being during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on the regulatory loop model of loneliness, the notions of Internet Paradox, the Time Displacement hypothesis and previous literature on WeChat use intensity, we propose that lockdown loneliness (partially) mediates the relationship between lockdown WeChat use intensity and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction). Moreover, we assume that lockdown WeChat use intensity moderates the relationship between lockdown social isolation and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction) in both a direct and in an indirect way, that is through lockdown loneliness. The results from our Structural Equation Modeling analyses, using a sample of 1,805 Chinese respondents, indicate that all of our research hypotheses are confirmed. From this empirical work, it becomes clear that online social interactions, which are believed by many people to be able to compensate for the lack of offline social interactions during the COVID-19 lockdown period, in fact are endangering their mental health and life satisfaction instead. This article concludes with theoretical and practical implications of our study, followed by its limitations and recommendations for future research.","Li, Zhou, Van Der Heijden, Li, Tao, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.707667","20210827","COVID-19; lockdown WeChat use intensity; lockdown loneliness; lockdown social isolation; well-being (lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17436,""
"Emotional states and coping methods in nursing and non-nursing students responding to COVID-19: a cross-sectional study in China","To evaluate the emotion, coping strategy, dealing methods and their correlation in the COVID-19 outbreak among nursing and non-nursing students. A cross-sectional online survey. Full-time nursing and non-nursing undergraduate students. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to determine the emotional status in the COVID-19 pandemic among nursing and non-nursing students. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) was used to measure the emotion regulation strategies and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) was used to evaluate the coping methods among nursing and non-nursing students. In total, 746 students including 366 nursing students and 380 non-nursing students participated in the survey. Compared with the non-nursing students, a significant decrease was noticed in GAD-7 score (p&lt;0.01) and PHQ-9 (p&lt;0.01) in the nursing students. The cognition re-evaluation score in the nursing students was significantly lower than that of the non-nursing students (p&lt;0.05). In the nursing students, the score of anxiety was positively correlated with ERQ expression inhibition (p&lt;0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p&lt;0.01), while the score of depression was also positively correlated with ERQ expression inhibition (p&lt;0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p&lt;0.01). There was a negative correlation between SCSQ and the scores of anxiety (p&lt;0.05) and depression (p&lt;0.05). In the non-nursing students, the anxiety score was positively correlated with the SCSQ negative coping (p&lt;0.01), while the depression score was positively correlated with the ERQ expression inhibition (p&lt;0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p&lt;0.01). COVID-19 affected the emotional status of nursing and non-nursing students. The emotional status was correlated with the emotional regulation and coping methods.

"Food insecurity and the nutritional health and well-being of women and children in high-income countries: protocol for a qualitative systematic review","Since the global financial crises of 2008, there has been a rise in the number of people experiencing food insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this. Many more are unable to afford or access food of sufficient quality and quantity to enable good health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable are mothers with young children, pregnant women and lone parents (the majority of whom are women). This review aims to understand experiences of food insecurity and how it affects women and children's nutritional health and well-being, focusing on experiences explicitly related to nutrition. Findings will help guide health policy and practice to support food-insecure women and children from high-income countries.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unmet healthcare needs in Seoul, South Korea: a cross-sectional study","This study investigated the factors influencing unmet healthcare needs of people during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Seoul, South Korea. The findings help to identify people who have difficulty accessing healthcare services during a pandemic situation. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a proportionate quota sampling method according to five major districts, sex and age, using an online survey. We analysed the key characteristics of influencing factors of unmet healthcare needs based on the Andersen behavioural model of healthcare utilisation: predisposing factors (eg, sex, age), need factors (eg, health status, illness) and enabling factors (eg, income, efficacy belief). The questionnaire was sent via email and mobile text messages from the end of April to the beginning of May 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 813 respondents was used, and the respondent information was anonymised in the analysis process. For the predisposing factors, sex, age, education level and occupational cluster were associated with unmet needs for healthcare. Chronic diseases and mental health were the influencing factors as an enabling factor that exerted an influence on the unmet need for healthcare in South Korea. Women, younger persons, those with lower education and persons with white-collar jobs were more likely to experience unmet healthcare needs. In addition, the more chronic diseases people had, the more COVID-19 negatively affected them mentally; and the more people felt fear of COVID-19, the higher chances they experienced unmet healthcare needs. Government and policymakers are guided to draw out measures such as health communication and telemedicine to reduce the unmet healthcare needs during the pandemic and to recognise the different influencing factors.","Kim, You, Shon","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045845","20210827","COVID-19; health policy; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17440,""
"Gender-Specific Changes in Life Satisfaction After the COVID-19-Related Lockdown in Dutch Adolescents: A Longitudinal Study","The purposes of this study were to assess whether mental well-being has changed after introduction of the lockdown measures compared with that before, whether this change differs between boys and girls, and whether this change is associated with COVID-19-related concerns. This is a two-wave prospective study among Dutch adolescents using data collected up to one year before the COVID-19 pandemic (nÃ‚Â = 224) and 5-8Ã‚Â weeks after the first introduction of lockdown measures (nÃ‚Â = 158). Mental well-being was assessed by three indicators: life satisfaction, internalizing symptoms, and psychosomatic health. General linear model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess whether mental well-being has changed and if this differed by sex. Univariate linear regressions were used to assess associations between COVID-19-related concerns and a change in mental well-being. Life satisfaction decreased (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>Ã‚Â = .079, p &lt; .001), but no change in internalizing symptoms was observed (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>Ã‚Â = .014, pÃ‚Â = .14), and psychosomatic health increased (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>Ã‚Â = .194, p &lt; .001) after the introduction of lockdown measures. Boys scored significantly better on all mental health indicators compared with girls at baseline and follow-up. However, boys' life satisfaction significantly decreased at the follow-up (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>Ã‚Â = .038, pÃ‚Â = .015), whereas girls' life satisfaction did not change. Concerns about COVID-19 were significantly associated with a lower life satisfaction and more internalizing symptoms. Adolescents', especially boys', life satisfaction decreased during the lockdown. TheyÃ‚Â reported no change in internalizing symptoms and an improved psychosomatic health. Adolescents' mental well-being is expected to vary during the COVID-19 pandemic and should continue to be monitored.","van der Laan, Finkenauer, Lenters, van Harmelen, van der Ent, Nijhof","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.013","20210827","Adolescents; COVID-19 pandemic; Mental well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17441,""
"What can we learn from the online learning experiences of medical students in Poland during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic?","In March 2020, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Polish government ordered the closing of all medical faculties, with an obligatory shift to online learning. This lockdown continued, with a short period of blended learning, over the time of summer 2020. Distance learning had previously been rarely used within Polish medical schools, so such a sudden transfer was a major challenge. The aim of the study was to explore undergraduates' perception of online teaching provided at Polish medical faculties during the pandemic and to analyze how these experiences may inform future curriculum development. The online survey was addressed to undergraduates at Polish medical faculties in November 2020. The questions captured demographics, epidemiological data and students' perception of various aspects of online teaching. Responses were subjected to thematic analysis and their distribution compared considering demographic parameters . Six hundred twenty students from thirteen medical faculties responded to the survey. Major benefits from online teaching perceived by respondents included increased convenience, enhanced quality, a sense of comfort and safety. Major complaints were associated with unsatisfactory content, technical issues, difficulties engaging, poor organization and lack of social life. Students claimed that online teaching required more self-directed learning and discipline and 57.9% considered this impact as negative. 44.5% of respondents took part in educational online activities beyond their scheduled classes. For 49.2% online examinations were reported as more stressful and for 24.8% - less stressful than traditional ones. Differences in the opinions on online teaching were found between men and women, students in early and senior years, Polish and non-Polish ones. The sudden move online inevitably was problematic for students. Their perspective afforded us the opportunity to consider shortcomings of pre-pandemic undergraduate curriculum. Online education requires a more self-directed learning, which was challenging for many students, so further enhancement of more autonomous study skills seems necessary. Distress expressed by students indicates the need for urgent support with mental health issues.","Pokryszko-Dragan, Marschollek, Nowakowska-Kotas, Aitken","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02884-5","20210827","Medical education; Online teaching; SARS-COV-2 pandemic; Undergraduates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17442,""
"Gender differences in the reaction to COVID-19","Since December 2019, COVID-19, has affected many aspects of people's lives - women and men alike. The current study examined gender differences due to the pandemic-resultant-lockdown in psychiatric symptomatology (depression, anxiety, and somatization), coping strategies, levels of resilience, and belief in a just world (BJW). One-thousand-and-sixty-five Israeli adults (309 men and 756 women) were interviewed online during the time Israel was under its first mandatory lockdown (March 2020). Results indicated higher levels of anxiety, depression, and somatization among women (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (635.238) = -8.86,<i>Ã‚Â p</i>Ã‚Â &lt; .001;<i>Ã‚Â t</i>Ã‚Â (606.414) = -5.31,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt; .001;Ã‚Â <i>t</i>Ã‚Â (743.856) = -6.80<i>; p</i>Ã‚Â &lt; .001;Ã‚Â respectively). More women stopped working due to the lockdown (<i>Z</i>Ã‚Â = 2.08,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .037), and fewer women reported their jobs being considered ""essential"" (<i>Z</i>Ã‚Â = 2.76,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .006).Ã‚ Women were more concerned than men regarding the health of others (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (1063) = -2.71,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .007) and regarding finances (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (1062) = -2.99,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .003), but no gender differences were found regarding concerns for one's own health.Ã‚ Women used more coping tactics, both emotion-focused (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (1062) = -8.20,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt; .001) and problem-focused (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (1062) = -5.21,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt; .001), than did men. Higher levels of resilience (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (1057) = 3.11,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .002)Ã‚Â and BJW (<i>t</i>Ã‚Â (1047) = 5.19,Ã‚Â <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt; .001)Ã‚Â were found among men than among women. Being a woman, younger age, use of emotion-focused coping, lower levels of resilience, worries about the economic situation, and worries about family members' health explained 43% of the variance in psychological distress. No significant interactions between gender, study variables, and psychological distress were found. These findings indicate that gender differences in psychological reactions may be due to the heavier toll taken by the pandemic and lockdown on the lives of women rather than to gender differences in coping tactics or resilience.","Laufer, Bitton-Shechory","https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2021.1970083","20210827","COVID-19; Coping; gender; resiliency; symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17443,""
"[Research progress on the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and early warning system from a community health perspective]","The continuously spreading of SARS-CoV-2 poses a threat not only to public health but also to all aspects of socio-economics. Current public health measures are costly and have potential health risks, thus, it is imminent that developing efficient and economical early warning surreillance tools from a public health perspective. In this review, we summarized the current COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance measures and the efficiency, economic, and cutting edge of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The WBE-based surveillance is organized and reviewed from three aspects: early warning system for the timing of epidemic, routine epidemic surveillance, and parameters determination of predicting epidemiological models of COVID-19. It reveals the application value of WBE as an early warning and surveillance system of public health, and then, discussing its current weakness and strength, adding literature for a WBE-based surveillance system for COVID-19 epidemic in China.

"Putative Role of Vitamin D for COVID-19 Vaccination","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a new, highly pathogenic virus that has recently elicited a global pandemic called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is characterized by significant immune dysfunction, which is caused by strong but unregulated innate immunity with depressed adaptive immunity. Reduced and delayed responses to interferons (IFN-I/IFN-III) can increase the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and extensive immune cell infiltration into the airways, leading to pulmonary disease. The development of effective treatments for severe COVID-19 patients relies on our knowledge of the pathophysiological components of this imbalanced innate immune response. Strategies to address innate response factors will be essential. Significant efforts are currently underway to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines, such as inactivated DNA, mRNA, and protein subunit vaccines, have already been applied in clinical use. Various vaccines display different levels of effectiveness, and it is important to continue to optimize and update their composition in order to increase their effectiveness. However, due to the continuous emergence of variant viruses, improving the immunity of the general public may also increase the effectiveness of the vaccines. Many observational studies have demonstrated that serum levels of vitamin D are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. Extensive evidence has shown that vitamin D supplementation could be vital in mitigating the progression of COVID-19 to reduce its severity. Vitamin D defends against SARS-CoV-2 through a complex mechanism through interactions between the modulation of innate and adaptive immune reactions, ACE2 expression, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, it remains unclear whether Vit-D also plays an important role in the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccines. Based on analysis of the molecular mechanism involved, we speculated that vit-D, via various immune signaling pathways, plays a complementary role in the development of vaccine efficacy.","Chiu, Tsai, Wu, Zheng, Yang, Hu, Hou, Lu, Chao","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168988","20210827","COVID-19; adaptive immunity; innate immunity; vaccine; vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17445,""
"Impacts of Digital Healthy Diet Literacy and Healthy Eating Behavior on Fear of COVID-19, Changes in Mental Health, and Health-Related Quality of Life among Front-Line Health Care Workers","We aimed to examine the impacts of digital healthy diet literacy (DDL) and healthy eating behaviors (HES) on fear of COVID-19, changes in mental health, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). An online survey was conducted at 15 hospitals and health centers from 6-19 April 2020. Data of 2299 front-line HCWs were analyzed-including socio-demographics, symptoms like COVID-19, health literacy, eHealth literacy, DDL, HES, fear of COVID-19, changes in mental health, and HRQoL. Regression models were used to examine the associations. HCWs with higher scores of DDL and HES had lower scores of FCoV-19S (regression coefficient, B, -0.04; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, -0.07, -0.02; <i>p</i> = 0.001; and B, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.15, -0.06; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); had a higher likelihood of stable or better mental health status (odds ratio, OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.05; <i>p</i> = 0.029; and OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.07; <i>p</i> = 0.043); and HRQoL (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.03; <i>p</i> = 0.006; and OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.06; <i>p</i> = 0.001), respectively.

"Drinking Trajectories and Factors in Koreans","This study aimed to explore the drinking culture in Korea by sex, age, household type, occupation, and income level to identify demographic groups with prominent drinking behaviors and factors affecting their drinking. Furthermore, we evaluated recent changes, including those due to COVID-19, in drinking behavior, using data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study from 2010 to 2020. Panel analysis was performed to reveal the effects of material deprivation, depression, and sociodemographic factors on drinking behavior. We used the AUDIT 3 scale including frequency of drinking, average amount of drinking, and frequency of excessive drinking. The two characteristics of Korean drinking are consistent with the claim of the ecological system theory that humans, as social beings, drink to facilitate social communication or promote problematic drinking when social communication is difficult. Drinking among Koreans is characterized by a pattern that alternates between social drinking and problem drinking. Our study recognizes drinking as a social problem that should be managed at social as well as national levels.","Kim, Park, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168890","20210827","alcohol and culture; ecological system theory; problematic drinking; social drinking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17447,""
"Emotional Intelligence as a Mediator between Subjective Sleep Quality and Depression during the Confinement Due to COVID-19","In March of 2020, as a consequence of the health crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus, the State of Alarm and home confinement of the entire population was imposed in Spain. It is foreseeable that this exceptional situation will have psychological effects on citizens. In this work, the impact of confinement on perceived sleep quality and depression is evaluated through questionnaires, as well as the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence (EI) in this relationship. Our results show, firstly, higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in women and young people associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, and secondly, that Emotional Intelligence intervenes as a mediator in this relationship through three different pathways. Worse perceived quality of sleep causes a greater number of depressive symptoms. In addition, this direct relationship may be enhanced by the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence, which we can express in three different ways: low perceived sleep quality and high emotional attention lead to greater depression; low perceived sleep quality and low emotional clarity increase greater symptoms of depression; and low perceived sleep quality together with low clarity and low emotional repair increase levels of depression. Therefore, we can conclude that improving the skills involved in Emotional Intelligence might increase perceived sleep quality, and thus reduce depressive symptoms, which in turn may improve the quality of life.","Salguero-AlcaÃƒÂ±iz, MerchÃƒÂ¡n-Clavellino, Alameda-BailÃƒÂ©n","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168837","20210827","confinement; depression; emotional intelligence; perceived sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17448,""
"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among the Public in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Vaccine hesitancy (uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations) is a major barrier to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the public in Kuwait, to understand their attitudes towards vaccines in general, and to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 4147 adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years. The snowball sampling strategy was used for data collection through social media and e-mails. A total of 3061 (73.8%) respondents indicated that they were vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 infection, while 1086 (26.2%) expressed their vaccine hesitancy. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the concerns about the vaccine's possible side effects, its rushed development, and its efficacy in preventing the infection. Over half (57.2%) of respondents expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitude towards vaccines in general. On the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the findings revealed that vaccine hesitancy was significantly more prevalent among respondents aged 30-64 years; females; married or divorced; residents of Hawalli, Al-Farwaniyah, Al-Jahra, and Mubarak Al-Kabeer; had intermediate monthly average income; non-smokers; not feeling worried about catching the infection; do not know whether any of their family members have been infected or died because of COVID-19 infection; do not have a large extent of confidence in the Kuwait health system's ability to handle the pandemic; did not receive influenza vaccine during the last year; refused or elected to forego a doctor-recommended vaccine; did not receive adequate information from the public health authorities/healthcare providers about the COVID-19 vaccines; none of their first-degree family members received or were intending to receive the vaccine; and expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitudes towards vaccines in general. The present findings provide a steer as to the groups that most need to be reached to increase the rates of vaccine uptake.","Alibrahim, Awad","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168836","20210827","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; Kuwait; coronavirus disease; general population; vaccine; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17449,""
"The Ethics of Dying: Deciphering Pandemic-Resultant Pressures That Influence Elderly Patients' Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) Decisions","The objective of medicine is to provide humans with the best possible health outcomes from the beginning to the end of life. If the continuation of life becomes unbearable, some may evaluate procedures to end their lives prematurely. One such procedure is Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD), and it is hotly contended in many spheres of society. From legal to personal perspectives, there are strong arguments for its implementation and prohibition. This article intends to add to this rich discourse by exploring MAiD in the context of our current pandemic-ridden society as new pressures from social isolation and guilt threaten the autonomy of vulnerable elderly patients. Although autonomy is of chief importance, variables within our current context undermine otherwise independent decisions. Many older individuals are isolated from their social network, resulting in a decline in their mental health. Individuals in such a state are more likely to request a MAiD outcome. Furthermore, overwhelmed healthcare systems may not adequately address this state, which would normally have prompted a mental health intervention. The future of MAiD is far from settled and careful consideration must be given as new contexts come to light, such as those outlined in this paper.","Khawaja, Khawaja","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168819","20210827","COVID-19; access to resources; beneficence; bioethics; non-maleficence; patient autonomy; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17450,""
"Self-Compassion and Rumination Type Mediate the Relation between Mindfulness and Parental Burnout","The COVID-19 lockdown increased the day-to-day challenges faced by parents, and thereby may have increased parental burnout risk. Therefore, identifying parental burnout protection factors is essential. This study aimed to assess the protective role of the following factors which can be increased through mindfulness practice: trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and concrete vs. abstract ruminations. A total of 459 parents (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 40; 98.7% female) completed self-reported questionnaires at two-time points to assess the predictive role of mindfulness on parental burnout, self-compassion and rumination type, and the mediating role of self-compassion and rumination type in the relation between mindfulness and parental burnout. Results showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination type at Time 1 predicted levels of parental burnout at Time 2. Self-compassion (indirect effects: b = -Ã¢â‚¬â€°22, 95% CI = [-38, -05], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), concrete ruminations (indirect effects: b = -20, 95% CI = [-32, -09], <i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and abstract ruminations (indirect effects: b = -0.54, 95% CI = [-71, -37], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) partially mediated the relation between trait-mindfulness and parental burnout. These findings showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and concrete (vs. abstract) ruminations may help prevent parental burnout in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results contribute to the field of research on parental burnout prevention and will allow for the development of effective approaches to mental health promotion in parents.","Paucsik, Urbanowicz, Leys, Kotsou, Baeyens, Shankland","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168811","20210827","lockdown; mindfulness; parental burnout; ruminations; self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17451,""
"Long-Term Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health among the General Public: A Nationwide Longitudinal Study in China","COVID-19 might have long-term mental health impacts. We aim to investigate the longitudinal changes in mental problems from initial COVID-19 peak to its aftermath among general public in China. Depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed among a large-sample nationwide cohort of 10,492 adults during the initial COVID-19 peak (28 February 2020 to 11 March 2020) and its aftermath (8 July 2020 to 8 August 2020) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Insomnia Severity Index. We used generalized estimating equations and linear mixed models to explore factors associated with long-term mental health symptoms during COVID-19. During the five months, mental health symptoms remained consistently elevated (baseline 46.4%; follow-up 45.1%). Long-term depression, anxiety and insomnia were associated with several personal and work-related factors including quarantine (adjusted OR for any mental health symptoms 1.31, 95%CI 1.22-1.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), increases in work burden after resuming work (1.77, 1.65-1.90, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), occupational exposure risk to COVID-19 (1.26, 1.14-1.40, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and living in places severely affected by initial COVID-19 peak (1.21, 1.04-1.41, <i>p</i> = 0.01) or by a COVID-19 resurgence (1.38, 1.26-1.50, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Compliance with self-protection measures, such as wearing face masks (0.74, 0.61-0.90, <i>p</i> = 0.003), was associated with lower long-term risk of mental problems.

"Social Support and Dietary Habits as Anxiety Level Predictors of Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency concern and a challenge to students' mental health due to changes in education and social isolation. The aim of this research was to expand knowledge about the relations that shape the level of anxiety amongst men and women who are studying during the pandemic in terms of the relations towards their sense of social support and their nutritional behaviors. A State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure anxiety level, alongside supplementary questions such as the feeling of support from close ones, concentration of attention on nutrition during the pandemic and externally derived factors (university, specialization). Analysis of the regression was applied to the examination of the dependency between the anxiety level (in both forms of its occurrence-as state-anxiety and as trait-anxiety). We observed that the pandemic situation affected a level of state-anxiety above average (mean value of 46-48 points) even when students felt social support. Nutrition habits and chosen education type are associated with trait-anxiety level, which was also elevated (mean values of 49-50 points). Chosen factors had a partial influence on the anxiety level of students, therefore their mental health should concern shaping positive nutrition habits and social support.","Ortenburger, Mosler, Pavlova, WÃ„â€¦sik","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168785","20210827","STAI; anxiety; nutrition habits; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17453,""
"Changes in Depressive Symptoms, Stress and Social Support in Mexican Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to examine changes in depression, stress and social support levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in women living in Mexico City. We studied 466 women enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) study who completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) questionnaire prior (2018-2019) and during the lockdown period of the pandemic (May-November 2020). Psychosocial stress and social support for both time periods were ascertained using the Crisis in Family Systems (CRISYS) questionnaire and the Social Support Network (SSN) Scale, respectively. Associations between stress, social support and change in EDS score/depression were analyzed using generalized linear models adjusting for covariates. Higher stress (&gt;median) during the pandemic was associated with an increase in EDS score (ÃŽÂ²: 2.13; 95% CI (1.06, 3.19), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and higher odds of depression (OR: 3.75; 95% CI (2.17, 6.50), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while social support was associated with lower odds of depression (OR: 0.56, 95% CI (0.32, 0.97), <i>p</i> = 0.037). Higher levels of stress during the pandemic were associated with depression. Social support may act as a buffer for the effects of psychosocial stress.

"Changes in Adolescents' Psychosocial Functioning and Well-Being as a Consequence of Long-Term COVID-19 Restrictions","This work studied self-reports from adolescents on how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed their behaviors, relationships, mood, and victimization. Data collection was conducted between September 2020 and February 2021 in five countries (Sweden, the USA, Serbia, Morocco, and Vietnam). In total, 5114 high school students (aged 15 to 19 years, 61.8% females) responded to our electronic survey. A substantial proportion of students reported decreased time being outside (41.7%), meeting friends in real life (59.4%), and school performance (30.7%), while reporting increased time to do things they did not have time for before (49.3%) and using social media to stay connected (44.9%). One third of the adolescents increased exercise and felt that they have more control over their life. Only a small proportion of adolescents reported substance use, norm-breaking behaviors, or victimization. The overall COVID-19 impact on adolescent life was gender-specific: we found a stronger negative impact on female students. The results indicated that the majority of adolescents could adapt to the dramatic changes in their environment.

"Health-Related Quality of Life and Risk Factors among Chinese Women in Japan Following the COVID-19 Outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected individuals' physical and mental health, including that of immigrant women. This study aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), identify the demographic factors and awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to physical and mental health, and examine the risk factors associated with poor physical and mental health of Chinese women in Japan following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Using an electronic questionnaire survey, we collected data including items on HRQoL, awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, and demographic factors. One hundred and ninety-three participants were analyzed. Approximately 98.9% of them thought that COVID-19 affected their daily lives, and 97.4% had COVID-19 concerns. Married status (OR = 2.88, 95%CI [1.07, 7.72], <i>p</i> = 0.036), high concerns (OR = 3.99, 95%CI [1.46, 10.94], <i>p</i> = 0.007), and no concerns (OR = 8.75, 95%CI [1.17, 65.52], <i>p</i> = 0.035) about the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly associated with poor physical health.

"Objective Behavioral Measures in Children before, during, and after the COVID-19 Lockdown in Israel","Studies using questionnaires report that COVID-19 restrictions resulted in children spending significantly less time outdoors. This study used objective measures to assess the impact of pandemic-related restrictions on children's behavior. A total of 19 healthy 8-12-year-old boys were observed before and during social restriction periods. Of these, 11 boys were reassessed after restrictions were lifted. For each session, Actiwatches were dispensed for measures of time outdoors, activity, and sleep. Changes overall and by school status were assessed using signed-rank test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. During restrictions, children spent significantly less time outdoors (<i>p</i> = 0.001), were less active (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and spent less time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Sleep duration was not significantly different between sessions (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.99), but bedtime and wake time shifted to a later time during restrictions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for both). Time outdoors and activity returned close to pre-pandemic levels after restrictions were lifted (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05 for both). Children's behaviors significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction in outdoor light exposure is of importance due to the role of light in the etiology of myopia and vitamin D production. The reduction in physical activity may have negative health effects in terms of obesity and depression, although further research is required to ascertain the long-term effects.","Shneor, Doron, Levine, Zimmerman, Benoit, Ostrin, Gordon-Shaag","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168732","20210827","COVID-19; myopia; pandemic; physical activity; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17457,""
"The Psychological Restorative Effects of Campus Environments on College Students in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study at Northwest A&amp;F University, Shaanxi, China","During the COVID-19 outbreak, college students experienced different periods of isolation on campus, which has had an impact on students' mental health. Based on ART theory, this study randomly selected students at Northwest A&amp;F University, Shaanxi, China and distributed questionnaires in order to evaluate the psychological recovery effect of campus environment during the epidemic. The results showed that: (1) There were significant differences in the psychological restoration of four types of campus environments. Blue space had the greatest effect, followed by green space and sports grounds, while grey space had the least. (2) Time of stay had a very significant impact on psychological restoration. Longer time of exposure is not necessarily correlated with a better recovery experience. (3) In the different campus environments, extent is easier to be perceived followed by fascination and compatibility, and the weakest is being away. At the time of stay level, no significant difference was found in the perception of compatibility. Time of stay was negatively correlated with fascination and compatibility.

"Psychosomatic Symptoms and Neuroticism following COVID-19: The Role of Online Aggression toward a Stigmatized Group","The present study investigated the effect of interpersonal mistreatment on the perpetrators' mental health. We proposed that the threat of COVID-19 will increase people's mental health problems through their on-line aggression toward stigmatized groups accused of spreading the disease and that there might be potential gender differences in such effects. We tested our predictions among a sample of U.S. residents (Study 1) and a large sample of Chinese residents living out of Hubei province (Study 2) during a heightened period of concern about COVID-19, February 2020. Specifically, we measured U.S. residents' on-line aggressive behaviors toward Chinese people (Study 1) and Chinese non-Hubei residents' on-line aggressive behaviors toward Hubei residents (Study 2) as well as their neuroticism (Study 1) and mental health states (Study 2). In line with our predictions, both studies showed that perceived infection of COVID-19 can induce on-line aggression toward stigmatized groups, thereby increasing people's mental health problems. Moreover, the relationship between COVID-19 vulnerability, on-line aggression, and psychosomatic symptoms was more prominent in men than in women. These results offer insights into people's responses toward COVID-19 and add to the understanding of people's mental and physical health during the epidemic stage of contagious diseases.","Teng, Wang, Shi, Chen, Huang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168672","20210827","COVID-19; mental health; neuroticism; on-line aggression; psychosomatic symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17459,""
"Traditional Gender Differences Create Gaps in the Effect of COVID-19 on Psychological Distress of Japanese Workers","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused Japanese workers psychological distress through crises of health, economics, and social relationships. To assess whether these effects are amplified by the gender bias that exists in Japan, we examined male and female worker's psychological distress and difficulties during the pandemic. An online ""COVID-19-related difficulties"" questionnaire, based on item response theory, gathered responses from 3464 workers in October and November 2020. The workers' psychological distress was found concerned to be significantly worse than before the pandemic. Basic stressors related to infection anxiety, economic anxiety, and restrictions on social interactions and outings. Men's and women's experiences of difficulties were consistent with traditional gender roles in Japan: men were more likely to face job-related stressors, such as economic insecurity and work-style changes; women were more likely to face non-job-related stressors, such as increased living costs and reduced social interactions. Policymakers and employers should consider the association between gender differences and industry types, and implement measures to strengthen the acceptability of mental health care.","Kobayashi, Maeda, Takebayashi, Sato","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168656","20210827","gendered vulnerability; health care work; item response theory; mental health; social interaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17460,""
"Enhancing Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) with Parenting Skills: RCT of TRT + Parenting with Trauma-Affected Syrian Refugees in Lebanon Utilising Remote Training with Implications for Insecure Contexts and COVID-19","Child psychosocial recovery interventions in humanitarian contexts often overlook the significant effect that caregivers can have on improving children's future trajectory. We enhanced the well-established, evidenced-based child trauma recovery programme Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) intervention with parenting sessions, i.e., TRT + Parenting (TRT + P), which aims to improve parent mental health and their ability to support their children's mental health. We describe the findings of a three-arm randomised controlled trial comparing enhanced TRT + P vs. TRT and waitlist. The primary aim was to test if children in the enhanced arm of the programme show improved child and caregiver mental health. We recruited 119 Syrian refugee children and one of their caregivers in Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. They were randomised to the TRT, TRT + P, or waitlist control group. Data were collected at baseline and 2 weeks and 12 weeks post intervention. Training of facilitators was via remote training from the United Kingdom. Results showed a highly consistent pattern, with children in the enhanced TRT + P group showing the greatest levels of improvement in behavioural and emotional difficulties compared to children in the TRT or waitlist control groups. Caregivers in the TRT + P group also reported significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress. Findings indicate that the addition of the evidence-based parenting skills components has the potential to enhance the effects of interventions designed to improve children's mental health in contexts of trauma, conflict, and displacement. Implications for COVID-19 remote learning are also discussed.","El-Khani, Cartwright, Maalouf, Haar, Zehra, Ãƒâ€¡okamay-YÃ„Â±lmaz, Calam","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168652","20210827","conflict; displaced population; family skills; parenting; refugee; war","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17461,""
"A Qualitative Analysis of UK Wetland Visitor Centres as a Health Resource","The health benefits associated with spending time in natural environments have been highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and restrictions to safeguard public health have exacerbated the pre-existing mental health crisis and rise of non-communicable diseases. Thus, the importance of nature as a health resource has been elevated, hastening calls for a better understanding of how health benefits might differ across user groups and nature provisions. In this regard, urban green spaces have become the greatest research focus; however, blue spaces, especially inland freshwater (e.g., wetlands), remain less studied. First-hand user experiences are also under-represented. This exploratory study examines the motivations and benefits of active wetland centre users in the UK, both during and after visits. Responses to three open-ended questions were collated online from 385 participants, and a qualitative content analysis was conducted based on an existing taxonomy from users of urban green spaces. The results showed strong motivations to visit due to the biodiversity at the site (mainly the birdlife), while less tangible nature (e.g., fresh air) and amenities were also important. In contrast to other studies on natural environments, physical activity was a less influential motivation. Salient derived effects included positive and intensely positive emotions, relaxation and mental restoration. After visits to wetland centres, feelings of vitality and satisfaction were the most prominent effects that emerged. For decision-makers looking to leverage inland blue spaces for public health benefit, our results highlight the broad range and relative prominence of the reasons for use and the associated perceived health benefits derived by users of UK wetland centres. They highlight how biodiversity, abiotic nature and good amenities are important qualities to consider when planning, managing and encouraging people to use natural environments for health benefit, qualities that may also provide important environmental co-benefits.","Reeves, John, Wood, Maund","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168629","20210827","attention restoration; biodiversity; blue space; connection to nature; green space; motivation; pro-environmental behaviours; relaxation; spiritual wellbeing; wildlife tourism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17462,""
"Post-Lockdown Effects on Students' Mental Health in Romania: Perceived Stress, Missing Daily Social Interactions, and Boredom Proneness","The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide was accompanied by intense fears, confusion, worries, anger, and stress threatening people's mental health. Unprecedented measures to slow down and prevent the transmission of COVID-19 have had various impacts on the population's health behaviour and mental health. The main purpose of the present study is to investigate the lockdown's effects on university students' mental health in Romania. Based on a cross-sectional design, the survey data were collected from a sample of 722 participants (247 males; M = 21.1 years; SD Ã‚Â± 1.73). A path analysis was performed to verify the hypothesised direct and indirect effects included in the multiple mediation model. The findings showed a positive association between stress and boredom proneness, missing daily social interactions, spending more time on phone conversations, and the increasing interest in following news about the pandemic. The path analysis revealed an excellent fit between the proposed multiple mediation model and the sample data. Boredom proneness and missing daily social interactions both affected stress, directly and indirectly, through more time spent on phone conversations. In addition, it was found that the increased interest in following news about the pandemic mediated the relationship between boredom proneness and perceived stress. In terms of gender differences, our findings revealed that female students experienced significantly higher stress levels than male students, perceived to a greater extent the lack of daily social interactions, and spent more time on phone conversations. Overall, the findings further extend the empirical evidence on university students' mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, universities need to organise support programmes focused on developing university students' coping strategies to maintain their mental health even in adverse contexts.","Dumitrache, StÃ„Æ’nculescu, Nae, DumbrÃ„Æ’veanu, Simion, TaloÃˆâ„¢, Mareci","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168599","20210827","COVID-19; Romania; gender differences; mental health; perceived stress; post-lockdown; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17463,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Licensed Full-Time Practicing Nurses Undertaking Part-Time Studies in Higher Education: A Cross-Sectional Study","Frontline nurses face an unpreceded situation with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and many report suffering from physical and psychological stress. This online, cross-sectional survey used questionnaires, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, stress-related questions, and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE), to determine the psychological impact of COVID-19 on licensed full-time practicing nurses undertaking part-time studies in higher education. Recruitment commenced from August to September 2020; 385 students were approached, and 124 completed the survey (response rate: 32%). Most of the respondents were frontline nurses working in public sectors (89.5%), 29% of whom reported symptoms of depression, and 61.3% reported mild to severe levels of anxiety.

"Psychosocial Health of K-12 Students Engaged in Emergency Remote Education and In-Person Schooling: A Cross-Sectional Study","As online classes became the norm in many countries as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the concern for child and adolescent mental health became an issue of concern. This study evaluates the differences in the psychosocial status of school children based on engagement in in-person or Emergency Remote Education (ERE) and assessed the prevalence and predictors of symptom-derived risk levels for anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). Cross-sectional data were collected from students at a Florida K-12 school and their household members through an online survey conducted in October 2020 (<i>n</i> = 145). No significant difference was found between ERE and in-person learning for risk of anxiety, depression, or OCD. Prevalence of students presenting as at risk for anxiety, depression, and OCD was 42.1%, 44.8%, and 41.4%. Several student factors (e.g., child sex, school level) and parental factors (e.g., parental COVID-19 attitudes) were associated with students presenting as at risk for anxiety, depression, or OCD; child's participation in sports was protective against all three outcomes. Participation in sports was found to be protective against risk of anxiety (aOR = 0.36, CI = 0.14-0.93), depression (aOR = 0.38, CI = 0.15-0.93), and OCD (aOR = 0.31, CI = 0.11-0.85).","Acosta, Fujii, Joyce-Beaulieu, Jacobs, Maurelli, Nelson, McKune","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168564","20210827","COVID-19; OCD; anxiety; depression; environment; psychosocial health; students; virtual learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17465,""
"Analysis of the Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People with Severe Mental Disorders","For people with severe mental disorders (SMDs) the COVID-19 pandemic may pose a number of risks. These include the loss of needed care, a higher probability of infection, and the worsening of their mental health. To analyze the pandemic's impact on care received, relapses, loss of employment, and adherence to preventive guidelines in SMD sufferers, a multicenter retrospective cohort study was carried out comparing 185 patients diagnosed with SMD and 85 with common disorders. The results showed that during lockdown, there was a significant reduction in face-to-face psychotherapeutic, nursing, and occupational therapy interventions. In the same period, telematic interventions were introduced which, although subsequently reduced, now continue to be used to a greater extent than before the pandemic. Employment decreased significantly (13% vs. 9.2%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 126.228 <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The percentage of people with SMD following preventive guidelines was significantly lower for both hand washing (56.2% vs. 75.3%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 9.360, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and social distancing (47% vs. 63.5; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 6.423 <i>p</i> = 0.011). In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in the interventions that are needed for the recovery of people with SMDs, together with a significant loss of employment and an increased risk of contagion due to less adherence to preventive guidelines.

"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms among Journalists Repeatedly Covering COVID-19 News","The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in many journalists repeatedly covering stories related to human suffering. This study investigates whether these journalists experienced higher rates of psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms than those who have been working during the pandemic yet covering stories other than COVID-19 and aims to identify what factors may protect journalists from developing trauma-related symptoms. We assessed journalists (<i>n</i> = 120) working during the COVID-19 pandemic using self-report measures. Journalists repeatedly covering COVID-19 stories had significantly higher psychological distress (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> = 0.04) and PTSD symptoms (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> = 0.08), but not depression, compared to journalists who did not report on COVID-19. Rumination and numbing in response to unwanted memories predicted PTSD symptoms (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.53) and may be risk factors for PTSD in this population. Unhelpful resilience appraisals distinguished journalists who reported on COVID-19 and who developed distressing re-experiencing symptoms from those who similarly reported on distressing material and who did not develop symptoms.

"COVID-19-Associated Mortality in US Veterans with and without SARS-CoV-2 Infection","We performed an observational Veterans Health Administration cohort analysis to assess how risk factors affect 30-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects relative to those uninfected. While the risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been extensively studied, these have been seldom compared with uninfected referents. We analyzed 341,166 White/Black male veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to September 10, 2020. The relative risk of 30-day mortality was computed for age, race, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol use disorder in infected and uninfected subjects separately. The difference in relative risk was then evaluated between infected and uninfected subjects. All the analyses were performed considering clinical confounders. In this cohort, 7% were SARS-CoV-2-positive. Age &gt;60 and overweight/obesity were associated with a dose-related increased mortality risk among infected patients relative to those uninfected. In contrast, relative to never smoking, current smoking was associated with a decreased mortality among infected and an increased mortality in uninfected, yielding a reduced mortality risk among infected relative to uninfected. Alcohol use disorder was also associated with decreased mortality risk in infected relative to the uninfected. Age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol use disorder affect 30-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects differently from uninfected referents. Advanced age and overweight/obesity were associated with increased mortality risk among infected men, while current smoking and alcohol use disorder were associated with lower mortality risk among infected men, when compared with those uninfected.","Suzuki, Efird, Redding, Thompson, Press, Williams, Hostler, Hunt","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168486","20210827","COVID-19; mortality; risk factor; smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17468,""

"Psychiatry in the Digital Age: A Blessing or a Curse?","Social distancing and the shortage of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of population aging on the healthcare system, as well as the rapid pace of digital innovation are catalyzing the development and implementation of new technologies and digital services in psychiatry. Is this transformation a blessing or a curse for psychiatry? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and eHealth services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that eHealth services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor-patient relationships. The transformation of traditional clinics into digital ones is outlined, and the challenges associated with the successful deployment of digitalization in psychiatry are highlighted.","Roth, Papassotiropoulos, BrÃƒÂ¼hl, Lang, Huber","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168302","20210827","app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy; digitalization; electronic health records; machine learning; omics; precision psychiatry; psychiatry; telemedicine; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17471,""
"The Impact of US Housing Type and Residential Living Situations on Mental Health during COVID-19","Residential environments could be associated with the mental health of residents, in general, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited studies have investigated the relationship between these two. This study used data from the Household Pulse Survey, collected between 23 April 2020 and 23 November 2020 to explore the relationship between mental health status as perceived by the residents and housing tenure (own or rent), building type, and the number of household members, while accounting for sociodemographic characteristics, general health-related variables, and week-specific unobserved heterogeneities. The findings suggest that renters had higher odds of experiencing mental health issues than homeowners. Residents in multifamily housing units had higher odds of experiencing mental health problems than single-family units. Further, more people in the household were associated with lower odds of experiencing mental health episodes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ghimire, Carswell, Ghimire, Turner","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168281","20210827","COVID-19; apartments; housing; mental health; property management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17472,""
"Validation and Cultural Adaptation of Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) in Assessing Stigma among Recovered Patients with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia","Stigma is a negative feeling affecting many patients with various health conditions, especially the contagious ones such as COVID-19. The Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) is one of the valid and reliable stigma-measuring tools; however, it has not been translated and validated in Arabic. Therefore, the aim of this study was to translate and validate the EMIC in Arabic among a sample of Arabic-speaking adults who recently recovered from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The 12 items of the EMIC scale were forward- and backward-translated and reviewed by all authors to check the face and content validity prior to approving the final version of the Arabic 12-item EMIC. A total of 174 participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years who contracted COVID-19 and recovered as of 29 July 2020 were interviewed. The Cronbach's alpha of the Arabic version of the 12-item EMIC was 0.79, indicating an acceptable level of internal consistency. Using principal component analysis with varimax rotation, two factors explained more than 60% of the variance of the translated EMIC scale. The mean EMIC score was 5.91, implying a low level of stigma among participants. Married participants (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 2.93; 95%CI 0.88 to 4.98, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and those with a family history of mental illness (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 2.38; 95%CI 0.29 to 4.46, <i>p</i> = 0.025) were more likely to have higher EMIC scores in comparison to their counterparts who were unmarried and had no family history of mental illness. On the contrary, older adults were less likely to have high EMIC scores (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.11; 95%CI -0.21 to -0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Future studies with larger samples of patients with COVID-19 and various health conditions should be conducted to examine the validity and reliability of the Arabic version of the EMIC among different patient populations and to unveil the factors that may play a role in patients' feelings of stigmatization in this part of the world.","Al-Zamel, Al-Thunayan, Al-Rasheed, Alkathiri, Alamri, Alqahtani, Alali, Almohammed, Asiri, Bashatah, AlRuthia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168261","20210827","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; mental health; social stigma; surveys and questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17473,""
"Face Covered and Six Feet Apart: Behavioral Awareness Predicts Greater Adherence to Public Health Guidelines during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has deleteriously impacted physical and mental health. Guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19 include wearing a face covering in public, limiting close contacts, and physical distancing. In combatting this and future pandemics, it is essential to understand predictors of adherence, such as psychological flexibility. We hypothesized higher psychological flexibility would relate to greater adherence to public health guidelines. Participants (<i>n</i> = 265) were English-reading/speaking adults in the United States and were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Included in the present analyses are data from June (<i>n</i> = 360) and July 2020 (<i>n</i> = 265). Measures included the Comprehensive Assessment of ACT Processes (CompACT), which measured psychological flexibility. Outcome measures included mask-wearing and number of close contacts, which were operationalized categorically (100% mask-wearing in public, Ã¢â€°Â¤10 close contacts in past week). Two logistic regression models examined psychological flexibility and distress as predictors of adherence to mask-wearing and limiting close contacts, while controlling for demographic correlates. Results indicated that greater behavioral awareness predicted greater odds of mask-wearing and limiting close contacts. Psychological flexibility, and behavioral awareness specifically, should be investigated in future research as targets for intervention amidst global disasters.","Schneider, Kroska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168247","20210827","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy; COVID-19; behavioral awareness; masks; psychological flexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17474,""
"Active Coping and Anxiety Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spanish Adults","The features of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social operations to contain the spread of the virus might have limited or altered coping, including healthy habits such as exercise, this contributing to a myriad of negative consequences for the mental health of the global population. We explored the contribution of coping and physical activity to the management of anxiety in Spanish adults during an active phase of the epidemic, as well as the relationship between these strategies. A total of 200 young and adult individuals (70% women) voluntarily completed an anxiety inventory, a coping skills self-report and a personal data section including exercise practice. The participants reported in average a mild yet existing level of anxiety symptoms; a third reported noticeable symptoms. At the time of the study, the participants used more adaptive than maladaptive coping styles. Participants' anxiety was inversely correlated with an active coping style, and positively with an avoidant style; physical activity correlated positively with an active coping style, and regular exercisers used more frequently active coping. Controlling for confounders, active coping, avoidant coping and exercise during the pandemic predicted anxiety symptoms. Other findings indicated that exercise was used as a coping strategy for dealing with emotional distress. Our results highlight the positive impact of functional coping and exercise for the management of negative states such as anxiety during the pandemic, and underline the importance of developing interventions aimed at enhancing coping skills for promoting physical and mental well-being of the population during health and social crises.","Lara, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Daza, Zabarain-Cogollo, Olivencia-CarriÃƒÂ³n, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Torres, Olivencia-CarriÃƒÂ³n, Ogallar-Blanco, Godoy-Izquierdo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168240","20210827","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; exercise; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17475,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Women with Perinatal Anxiety Symptoms in Pakistan: A Qualitative Study","The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on people with existing mental health conditions is likely to be high. We explored the consequences of the pandemic on women of lower socioeconomic status with prenatal anxiety symptoms living in urban Rawalpindi, Pakistan. This qualitative study was embedded within an ongoing randomized controlled trial of psychosocial intervention for prenatal anxiety at a public hospital in Rawalpindi. The participants were women with symptoms of anxiety who had received or were receiving the intervention. In total, 27 interviews were conducted; 13 women were in their third trimester of pregnancy, and 14 were in their postnatal period. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed using framework analysis. Key findings were that during the pandemic, women experienced increased perinatal anxiety that was linked to greater financial problems, uncertainties over availability of appropriate obstetric healthcare, and a lack of trust in health professionals. Women experienced increased levels of fear for their own and their baby's health and safety, especially due to fear of infection. COVID-19 appears to have contributed to symptoms of anxiety in women already predisposed to anxiety in the prenatal period. Efforts to address women's heightened anxiety due to the pandemic are likely to have public health benefits.","Rauf, Zulfiqar, Mumtaz, Maryam, Shoukat, Malik, Rowther, Rahman, Surkan, Atif","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168237","20210827","COVID-19; anxiety symptoms; low- and middle-income countries; mental health; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17476,""
"Psychosocial Well-Being of Patients with Kidney Failure Receiving Haemodialysis during a Pandemic: A Survey","Living with kidney failure and undergoing hospital haemodialysis (HD) is associated with a high prevalence of mental health problems and poor quality of life. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional challenges for this patient population. To understand the impact on mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in people receiving HD. An online survey using a cross-sectional study design. Two validated assessment tools (General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12); Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI)), binary, Likert and free-text qualitative questions were included. Individuals with kidney failure receiving HD, over 18 years of age, were recruited online between July and August 2020. Forty-four participants were recruited. Approximately, 54% of respondents were tested for COVID-19; however, no positive results were reported by patients or associated family members. Scores of GHQ-12 and PWI were compared with those from previous studies. Mental health distress was higher in prevalence (68.2%) and severity (M = 18.3) in this study when compared to that of the general population in Northern Ireland during COVID-19 (April 2020). In addition, well-being (M = 37.16, SD = 18.19) was poorer when compared to that of a pre-COVID-19 dialysis patient population. During the current pandemic, individuals receiving hospital HD have heightened mental health distress, and their well-being is impacted negatively. This study reinforces the need to provide appropriate psychosocial care as well as supportive interventions for mental distress to patients with kidney failure during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","McKeaveney, Noble, Carswell, Johnston, Reid","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081087","20210827","COVID-19; haemodialysis; kidney failure; mental health; survey; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17477,""
"Korean Nursing Students' Emotional Response Types to Pandemic: Application of Q-Methodology","The aim of this study is to investigate the emotional responses of nursing students to the COVID-19 pandemic and the characteristics of these responses using the Q-methodology. The focus of the Q-methodology is to discover research participants' subjective viewpoints. In May 2021, 50 Korean nursing students from first year to fourth year were selected to participate in the study, and data were collected by asking them to classify 37 selected Q-statements in a normal distribution on a 9-point scale. In the final analysis, a P-sample of 38 nursing students was used. The emotional responses of the Korean nursing students were categorized into four types: self-protection (Type 1), pessimism about the current situation (Type 2), realistic optimism (Type 3), and developmental-seeking (Type 4). The four factors accounted for 39% of the total variance. The individual explanatory powers of the four factors were 8%, 12%, 13%, and 6%, respectively. Thus, the study explored the subjectivity of emotional responses of Korean nursing students to the pandemic.

"Performance, Health, and Psychological Challenges Faced by Students of Physical Education in Online Learning during COVID-19 Epidemic: A Qualitative Study in China","The spread of COVID-19 has led students to take classes online (rather than face-to-face) worldwide, including in China. For this study, we conducted qualitative focus group discussions to identify the experience of and difficulties faced by online physical education students in higher education taking online classes, including the impact on their physical activity performance, as well as some health problems they face while taking online classes during the quarantine period, such as weight gain, depression, and anxiety. Finally, utilizing Mayer's learning model as a conceptual framework, we propose a method that addresses how to effectively manage an optimal future learning system for physical education students, both during and after the COVID-19 outbreak situation. During the isolation period of COVID-19, the required equipment for the participants was rarely available at home while attending the online classes, which inevitably reduced the number of physical education units that could be conveyed. This resulted in a transfer of attention from competition to underperformance, weight gain, and adverse psychological conditions. We conclude that it is important to review and systematize the methods of online physical education learning, particularly highlighting the cultural and educational characteristics of different countries, and to investigate the effectiveness of online physical education as a whole.","Laar, Ashraf, Ning, Ji, Fang, Yu, Khan","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081030","20210827","COVID-19; health issues; online classes; physical education students; poor performance; psychological issues; quarantine; weight gain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17479,""
"Assessing the Impact of Social Media Use on Everyday Emotion in Health Crises: A Study of International Students in China during COVID-19","Social media has become a valuable tool in providing an opportunity to stay in touch with one's social networks, providing reassurance and practical advice to individuals to pre-empt panic and rumors in COVID-19. However, the implications of social media use on the everyday emotion (anxiety and depression) of users especially, international students, are not well understood. Thus, this study sought to examine the impact of social media use on the everyday emotion of international students in China during COVID-19. Using a structured online questionnaire based on modified questions from the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and social media use instruments, data were collected from 480 participants. Of the total responses received, 474 were further analyzed employing the Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM). This study showed a significant positive relationship between social media use and everyday emotion (B = 0.34, 95% CI (0.26, 0.44)). Additionally, self-rated anxiety and depression associated with social media use among international students were generally mild (<i>n</i> = 249, 52.50% and <i>n</i> = 350, 73.80%, respectively). Moderating effects revealed that age and sex do not significantly moderate the relationship between social media use and everyday emotion in COVID-19. Given the nature of social media among international students, who are also prone to suffering from anxiety and depression associated with social media use, the positive effect of social media use and everyday emotion, especially in COVID-19, has important implications for international students' education stakeholders. Thus, gaining a deeper understanding of this relationship could enable them to harness social media and use it as a valuable tool to overcome the social distancing constraints in COVID-19.","Larnyo, Dai, Nutakor, Ampon-Wireko, Appiah, Larnyo, Akey-Torku, Nkrumah","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081011","20210827","COVID-19; adult depression; everyday emotion; generalized anxiety; international students; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17480,""
"Who Is the Most Vulnerable to Anxiety at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China? A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Survey","(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only changed people's health behavior, but also induced a psychological reaction among the public. Research data is needed to develop scientific evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse mental health effects. The aims of this study are to evaluate the anxiety reaction of Chinese people and the related determinants during the earliest phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Evidence from this survey will contribute to a targeted reference on how to deliver psychological counseling service in the face of outbreaks. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted from 28 January to 5 February 2020 using an open online questionnaire for people aged 18 years or above, residing in China and abroad. The socio-demographic information of the respondents was collected, and anxiety scores were calculated. A direct standardization method was used to standardize anxiety scores and a general linear model was used to identify associations between some factors (e.g., sex, age, education, etc.) and anxiety scores. (3) Results: A total of 10,946 eligible participants were recruited in this study, with a completion rate of 98.16% (10,946/11,151). The average anxiety score was 6.46 Ã‚Â± 4.12 (total score = 15); women (6.86 Ã‚Â± 4.11) scored higher than men (5.67 Ã‚Â± 4.04). The age variable was inversely and significantly associated with the anxiety score (ÃŽÂ² = -2.12, 95% CI: -2.47--1.78). People possessing higher education (ÃŽÂ² = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88-1.41) or a higher awareness of cognitive risk (ÃŽÂ² = 4.89, 95% CI: 4.33-5.46) reported higher levels of anxiety. There was a close association between poor subjective health and anxiety status (ÃŽÂ² = 2.83, 95% CI: 2.58-3.09). With the increase of confidence, the anxiety of the population exhibited a gradual decline (ÃŽÂ² = -2.45, 95% CI: -2.77--2.13). (4) Conclusion: Most people were vulnerable to anxiety during the earliest phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Younger women, individuals with high education, people with high cognitive risk and subjective poor health were vulnerable to anxiety during the epidemic. In addition, increasing confidence in resisting this pandemic is a protective determinant for individuals to develop anxiety.

"COVID-19 in Pregnancy-Perinatal Outcomes and Vertical Transmission Preventative Strategies, When Considering More Transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Variants","The COVID-19 pandemic affected the physical and mental health of people around the world and left unprepared health care systems struggling to mount an adequate response. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy in terms of perinatal and fetal outcomes is essential to propose strategies for mminimising viral transmission. Overall, 91 pregnant women in labour, or with indication for induction of labour, with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital. On the day of admission, each pregnant woman underwent a nasopharyngeal swab to validate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whenever delivery was by caesarean section, an amniotic fluid sample was collected after uterus incision. Neonates were tested twice: first by nasopharyngeal swab at birth and secondly either at 24 h after (when babies were isolated) or at discharge (when rooming-in). All samples underwent rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests by nasopharyngeal swab of the pregnant women produced positive results in 47 patients. This cohort gave birth to 48 infants who were double tested by nasopharyngeal swab and included in the prospective observational study. Moreover, in this same cohort, 39 amniotic fluid samples were taken during caesarean section. All samples underwent rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and came back negative.

"Cardiovascular Disease Complicating COVID-19 in the Elderly","SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA coronavirus, causes an illness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The highly transmissible virus gains entry into human cells primarily by the binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is expressed not only in lung tissue but also in cardiac myocytes and the vascular endothelium. Cardiovascular complications are frequent in patients with COVID-19 and may be a result of viral-associated systemic and cardiac inflammation or may arise from a virus-induced hypercoagulable state. This prothrombotic state is marked by endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation in both macrovasculature and microvasculature. In patients with subclinical atherosclerosis, COVID-19 may incite atherosclerotic plaque disruption and coronary thrombosis. Hypertension and obesity are common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients that may significantly raise the risk of mortality. Sedentary behaviors, poor diet, and increased use of tobacco and alcohol, associated with prolonged stay-at-home restrictions, may promote thrombosis, while depressed mood due to social isolation can exacerbate poor self-care. Telehealth interventions via smartphone applications and other technologies that document nutrition and offer exercise programs and social connections can be used to mitigate some of the potential damage to heart health.","Dayaramani, De Leon, Reiss","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080833","20210827","COVID-19; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; cytokines; hypertension; inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17484,""
"Psychosocial Impacts of the COVID-19 Quarantine: A Study of Gender Differences in 59 Countries","<i>Background and Objectives</i>: There is strong evidence in the literature that women experience psychological disorders at significantly higher rates than men. The higher rates of psychological disorders in women may partly be attributable to gender differences in response to stressors and coping styles. The objective of this study was to contribute to the growing body of literature investigating gender differences in mental health outcomes and coping styles during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in a large sample of individuals from 59 countries with variable demographic and socio-cultural characteristics. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Survey data were collected from the general population following a snowball sampling method, and the survey was promoted through social media platforms and mailing lists. Participants included 6882 individuals from the general population from 59 countries around the world. A combination of both standardized and adapted measures was used to create a survey, originally in English and then translated to Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Turkish. <i>Results</i>: Compared with men, women presented with higher levels of trauma-related distress; had a harder time decompressing; were more depressed, anxious and stressed; showed decreased frustration tolerance and reported lower quality of sleep and an increased likelihood of taking sleep medication or other natural sleep remedies. Overall, women tended to be more vulnerable during the pandemic in developing symptoms consistent with various forms of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress. However, they also were more likely than men to use a variety of adaptive coping strategies, including concentrating on doing something about the situation and getting emotional support from others. <i>Conclusions</i>: A high prevalence of mood symptoms was noted among women. In addition to meeting the physical health needs of the population, emphasis needs to be given to mental health and the prevention of psychiatric disorders, particularly in women.","Kolakowsky-Hayner, Goldin, Kingsley, Alzueta, Arango-Lasprilla, Perrin, Baker, Ramos-Usuga, Constantinidou","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080789","20210827","anxiety; coping; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); depression; exposure; gender; sleep quality; stress; trauma-related distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17485,""
"The Immune System Throws Its Traps: Cells and Their Extracellular Traps in Disease and Protection","The first formal description of the microbicidal activity of extracellular traps (ETs) containing DNA occurred in neutrophils in 2004. Since then, ETs have been identified in different populations of cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Much of the knowledge has been obtained from in vitro or ex vivo studies; however, in vivo evaluations in experimental models and human biological materials have corroborated some of the results obtained. Two types of ETs have been described-suicidal and vital ETs, with or without the death of the producer cell. The studies showed that the same cell type may have more than one ETs formation mechanism and that different cells may have similar ETs formation mechanisms. ETs can act by controlling or promoting the mechanisms involved in the development and evolution of various infectious and non-infectious diseases, such as autoimmune, cardiovascular, thrombotic, and neoplastic diseases, among others. This review discusses the presence of ETs in neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and recent evidence of the presence of ETs in B lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Moreover, due to recently collected information, the effect of ETs on COVID-19 is also discussed.","ConceiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o-Silva, Reis, De Luca, Leite-Silva, Santiago, Morrot, Morgado","https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10081891","20210827","COVID-19; basophil ETs; dendritic cell ETs; eosinophil ETs; extracellular traps (ETs); lymphocyte ETs; macrophage ETs; mast cell ETs; neutrophils ETs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17486,""
"""Stay at Home"" in Italy during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Longitudinal Study on Individual Well-Being among Different Age Groups","The restrictions imposed by the Italian government because of the coronavirus outbreak have been shown to be demanding on the Italian population. Data were collected at four different time points from 29 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and during the final follow-up survey on 12 October 2020. In the present study, we provided longitudinal evidence on the relationship between the lockdown and mental health dimensions, such as emotional state, perceived stress, and time perspective, for three age groups. The results allowed us to observe their psychological status from different perspectives at five different time points. Notably, a negative effect of the lockdown individual well-beings emerged as a trend, and differences in individual adaptation strategies to a prolonged stressful situation were observed at the follow-up. Indeed, pairwise comparisons between age groups showed that the young adult group (18-23 years old) seemed to be the most psychologically affected by the lockdown. The findings are discussed according to the most recent literature on the topic. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first longitudinal studies carried out in Italy concerning the general psychological effects of the coronavirus lockdown.","Quaglieri, Lausi, Fraschetti, Burrai, Barchielli, Pizzo, Cordellieri, De Gennaro, Gorgoni, Ferlazzo, Sdoia, Zivi, Giannini, Mari","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11080993","20210827","coronavirus; emotional state; perceived stress; social distance; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17487,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on a Long-Term Care Facility: The Role of Social Contact","(1) Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been harmed by the coronavirus, and older adults have remained isolated for a long time with many restrictions. The aim of this study was to measure the decline in cognitive, functional, and affective status in a care facility after the lockdown in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with previous measures in order to determine if this decline was accelerated. (2) Methods: Ninety-eight participants were recruited. Data from three retrospective pre-lockdown assessments and an additional post-lockdown assessment were analyzed. Mixed ANOVA analyses were performed according to the Clinical Dementia Rating levels, considering social-contact frequency during the lockdown as a covariate. (3) Results: The cognitive and functional scores were lower and depression scores were higher after the strict lockdown, accelerating a general pattern of decline that was already present in LTCF residents. The frequency of social contact eliminated the measurement differences in the cognitive and functional scores and the group differences in depression scores. (4) Conclusions: The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in an LTCF were mediated by the frequency of contact. Clinical implications: Preventive measures must be taken to ensure social contact with relatives and friends and reduce the negative consequences of social isolation in LTCFs.","Pereiro, Dosil-DÃƒÂ­az, Mouriz-Corbelle, Pereira-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Nieto-Vieites, Pinazo-Hernandis, Pinazo-ClapÃƒÂ©s, Facal","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11080986","20210827","SARS-CoV-2; crisis; nursing homes; older adults; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17488,""
"The Human Aspect of Horse Care: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Impacted the Wellbeing of Equestrian Industry Stakeholders","During the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, equestrian stakeholders faced a dilemma whereby they were required to balance caring for the welfare of horses with adapting to the restrictions imposed to protect public health. The present study investigated the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of a sample of industry stakeholders, including horse owners, equine veterinarians, farriers and welfare centre managers (<i>n</i> = 26) using a qualitative methodology. Findings from the interviews indicated that the mental health and wellbeing of veterinarians and horse owners was negatively affected by pandemic-related obstacles to communication and limitations to horse-owner interactions. However, this study also identified several positive outcomes for wellbeing during lockdown resulting from pro-social activities that were engaged with by horse owners to overcome social isolation, the separation of the community and loneliness. These findings provide accounts of ways in which those caring for horses might be challenged during national emergency scenarios, pointing to areas that would benefit from future mental health and wellbeing interventions.","Ward, Stephen, Argo, Watson, Harris, Neacsu, Russell, Grove-White, Morrison","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11082163","20210827","equine; interviews; mental health; pandemic; qualitative; welfare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","",17489,""
