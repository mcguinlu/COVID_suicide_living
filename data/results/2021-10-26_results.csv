"The effect of social restrictions, loss of social support, and loss of maternal autonomy on postpartum depression in 1 to 12-months postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: This study focuses on postpartum women, who are one of the most vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to reveal mental health consequences of social restrictions, loss of social support, or loss of autonomy. Methods: A cross-sectional study for postpartum women was conducted in October 2020 (N = 600). The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure postpartum depression. The prevalence ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression models, adjusting for age, education, household income, residence area, parity, the timing of delivery, and a prior history of depression. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression was 28.7% (EPDS [&ge;]), 18.6% ([&ge;]11), and 13.1% ([&ge;]13). Social restrictions including cancellation of home visits by health care professionals, or cancellation of infant checkups or vaccinations, loss of support during pregnancy or after delivery including loss of opportunities to consult with health care professionals or friends, or cancellation of parents or other family member visits to support, and loss of autonomy about delivery or breastfeeding, were associated with postnatal depression. Conclusion: About 30% of women who delivered and raised a baby during the COVID-19 pandemic had postpartum depression, which is much higher than a pre-pandemic meta-analysis. COVID-19 related social restrictions or loss of social support from healthcare professionals, family, and friends were significantly associated with postpartum depression. Also, loss of maternal autonomy in delivery and breastfeeding is associated with postpartum depression. The results indicate that both formal and informal support should not be limited to prevent postpartum depression during the pandemic.","Kanami Tsuno; Sumiyo Okawa; Midori Matsushima; Daisuke Nishi; Yuki Arakawa; Takahiro Tabuchi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.21.21265354","20211025","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19174,""
"Psychological Distress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Sociodemographic Inequalities in 11 UK Longitudinal Studies","Background: How population mental health has evolved across the COVID-19 pandemic under varied lockdown measures is poorly understood, with impacts on health inequalities unclear. We investigated changes in mental health and sociodemographic inequalities from before and across the first year of the pandemic in 11 longitudinal studies. Methods: Data from 11 UK longitudinal population-based studies with pre-pandemic measures of psychological distress were analysed and estimates pooled. Trends in the prevalence of poor mental health were assessed across the pandemic at three time periods: initial lockdown (TP1, Mar-June 20); easing of restrictions (TP2, July-Oct 20); and a subsequent lockdown (TP3, Nov 20-Mar 21). Multi-level regression was used to examine changes in psychological distress compared to pre-pandemic; with stratified analyses by sex, ethnicity, education, age, and UK country. Results: Across the 11 studies (n=54,609), mental health had deteriorated from pre-pandemic scores across all three pandemic time periods (TP1 Standardised Mean Difference (SMD): 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.23); TP2 SMD: 0.18 (0.09, 0.27); TP3 SMD: 0.20 (0.09, 0.31)). Changes in psychological distress across the pandemic were higher in females (TP3 SMD: 0.23 (0.11, 0.35)) than males (TP3 SMD: 0.16 (0.06, 0.26)), and slightly lower in below-degree level educated persons at some time periods (TP3 SMD: 0.18 (0.06, 0.30)) compared to those who held degrees (TP3 SMD: 0.26 (0.14, 0.38)). Increased distress was most prominent amongst adults aged 35-44 years (TP3 SMD: 0.49 (0.15, 0.84)). We did not find evidence of changes in distress differing by ethnicity or UK country. Conclusions: The substantial deterioration in mental health seen in the UK during the first lockdown did not reverse when lockdown lifted, and a sustained worsening is observed across the pandemic. Mental health declines have not been equal across the population, with females, those with higher degrees, and younger adults more affected.","Kishan Patel; Elaine Robertson; Alex Siu Fung Kwong; Gareth J Griffith; Kathryn Willan; Michael J Green; Giorgio Di Gessa; Charlotte Huggins; Eoin McElroy; Ellen J Thompson; Jane Maddock; Claire L Niedzwiedz; Morag Henderson; Marcus Richards; Andrew Steptoe; George B Ploubidis; Bettina Moltrecht; Charlotte Booth; Emla Fitzsimons; Richard Silverwood; Praveetha Patalay; David Porteous; Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.22.21265368","20211025","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19175,""
"Osteoarthritis year in review 2021: epidemiology &amp; therapy","This ""Year in review"" presents a selection of research themes and individual studies from the clinical osteoarthritis (OA) field (epidemiology and therapy) and includes noteworthy descriptive, analytical-observational, and intervention studies. The electronic database search for the review was conducted in Medline, Embase and medRxiv (15th April 2020 to 1st April 2021). Following study screening, the following OA-related themes emerged: COVID-19; disease burden; occupational risk; prediction models; cartilage loss and pain; stem cell treatments; novel pharmacotherapy trials; therapy for less well researched OA phenotypes; benefits and challenges of Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analyses; patient choice- balancing benefits and harms; OA and comorbidity; and inequalities in OA. Headline study findings included: a longitudinal cohort study demonstrating no evidence for a harmful effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in terms of COVID-19 related deaths; a Global Burden of Disease study reporting a 102% increase in crude incidence rate of OA in 2017 compared to 1990; a longitudinal study reporting cartilage thickness loss was associated with only a very small degree of worsening in pain over 2 years; an exploratory analysis of a non-OA randomised controlled trial (RCT) finding reduced risk of total joint replacement with an Interleukin -1ÃŽÂ² inhibitor (canakinumab); a significant relationship between cumulative disadvantage and clinical outcomes of pain and depression mediated by perceived discrimination in a secondary analysis from a RCT; worsening socioeconomic circumstances were associated with future arthritis diagnosis in an innovative natural experiment (with implications for unique research possibilities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic context).","Quicke, Conaghan, Corp, Peat","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2021.10.003","20211025","COVID-19; Clinical; epidemiology; osteoarthritis; review; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19176,""
"Mental health and economic stressors associated with high-risk drinking and increased alcohol consumption early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","Physical distancing measures to curb COVID-19 transmission introduced mental health and economic stressors, possibly impacting problematic drinking. This cross-sectional study examines mental health and economic stressors early in the COVID-19 pandemic which may be associated with heavy alcohol use and increased alcohol use. We administered an online survey of U.S. adults via social media April 5 to May 5, 2020. High-risk drinking was defined by WHO risk drinking levels, a daily average of Ã¢â€°Â¥4 drinks for men and Ã¢â€°Â¥3 drinks for women. Participants reported retrospective assessments of increased alcohol use if their past-week alcohol consumption exceeded their past-year average weekly alcohol consumption. We used logistic regression to assess possible covariates of high-risk drinking and increased alcohol use. Among 2175 participants, 10% (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯222) reported high-risk drinking, and 36% (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯775) reported increased alcohol consumption. In multivariable analysis, high-risk drinking was significantly associated with household job loss (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.41, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯(1.06, 1.88)) and depressive symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.05, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯(1.02, 1.07)), and women had higher odds of high-risk drinking than men (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.37, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯(1.32, 4.69)). Previous mental health diagnosis was not significantly associated with high-risk drinking during the pandemic (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.31, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯(0.98, 1.76)) in univariable analysis. High-risk drinkers were more almost six times as likely to report retrospective assessments of increased alcohol consumption, controlling for mental health and economic stressors (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯5.97, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯(4.35, 8.32)). Findings suggest a need for targeted interventions to address the complex mental health and economic stressors that may increase alcohol consumption and high-risk drinking during and after the pandemic.","Nesoff, Gutkind, Sirota, McKowen, Veldhuis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106854","20211025","Alcohol; Alcohol use disorder; COVID-19; High-risk drinking; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19177,""
"The Association between Sleep and Psychological Distress among New York City Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Healthcare workers (HCWs) treating patients with COVID-19 report psychological distress. We examined whether disturbed sleep was associated with psychological distress in New York City (NYC) HCWs during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). HCWs completed a survey screening for acute stress (4-item Primary Care PTSD screen), depressive (Patient Health Questionaire-2), and anxiety (2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale) symptoms. Insomnia symptoms (modified item from the Insomnia Severity Index) and short sleep (SS, sleep duration &lt;6 hours/day) were assessed. Poisson regression analyses predicting psychological distress from SS and insomnia symptoms, adjusting for demographics, clinical role/setting, redeployment status, shifts worked, and multiple comparisons were performed. Among 813 HCWs (80.6% female, 59.0% white) mean sleep duration was 5.8Ã‚Â±1.2 hours/night. Prevalence of SS, insomnia, acute stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were 38.8%, 72.8%, 57.9%, 33.8%, and 48.2%, respectively. Insomnia symptoms was associated with acute stress (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.35, 1.69), depressive (PR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.78, 2.33), and anxiety (PR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.55, 1.94) symptoms. SS was also associated with acute stress (PR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.29), depressive (PR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.233, 1.51), and anxiety (PR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.50) symptoms. Our cross-sectional analysis may preclude the identification of temporal associations and limit causal claims. In our study, SS and insomnia were associated with psychological distress symptoms in NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep may be a target for interventions to decrease psychological distress among HCWs.","Diaz, Cornelius, Bramley, Venner, Shaw, Dong, Pham, McMurry, Cannone, Sullivan, Lee, Schwartz, Shechter, Abdalla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.033","20211025","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Distress; Insomnia; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19178,""
"Noise complaint patterns in New York City from January 2010 through February 2021: Socioeconomic disparities and COVID-19 exacerbations","Excessive environmental noise exposure and noise annoyance have been linked to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Although socioeconomic disparities in acoustically measured and geospatially estimated noise have been established, less is known about disparities in noise complaints, one of the most common sources of distress reported to local municipalities. Furthermore, although some studies have posited urban quieting during the COVID-19 pandemic, little empirical work has probed this and probed noise complaints during the pandemic. Using over 4 million noise complaints from the New York City (NYC) 311 database, we quantified census tract-level socioeconomic disparities in noise complaints since 2010 and examined how such disparities changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from January 2010 through February 2020, we fit linear mixed-effects models, estimating monthly tract-level noise complaints by the proportion of residents who were low-income, time in months since January 2010, categorical month, their interactions, and potential confounds, such as total population and population density. To estimate COVID-19 pandemic effects, we included additional data from March 2020 through February 2021 and additional interactions between proportion low-income, month of year, and an indicator variable for COVID-19 pandemic onset in March 2020. Census tracts with a higher proportion of low-income residents reported more monthly noise complaints and this increased over time (timeÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Â¯monthÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Â¯proportion low-income interaction p-values &lt; .0001 for all months), particularly in warmer months. Socioeconomic disparities in noise complaints were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic (monthÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Â¯proportion low-incomeÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Â¯pandemic era interaction p-values &lt; .0001 for March through November), also in a seasonal manner. Since 2010, noise complaints have increased the most in the most economically distressed communities, particularly in warmer seasons. This disparity was particularly exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, contrary to some theories of urban quieting. Community-based interventions to ameliorate noise and noise annoyance, both public health hazards, are needed in underserved communities.","Ramphal, Dworkin, Pagliaccio, Margolis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112254","20211025","COVID-19 pandemic; Noise; Noise annoyance; Noise complaints; Socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19179,""
"Audit of acute psychiatric presentations during New Zealand's first COVID-19 national lockdown","In this study, we aimed to identify service user demographic and clinical characteristics of an acute mental health service in South Auckland during the first New Zealand coronavirus-related lockdown. We conducted a clinical audit of a sample of service users presenting to a district health board's acute adult mental health service during New Zealand's level-4 lockdown in 2020 and made comparisons to a sample from 2019. We identified demographic factors, living situation, mode of referral, mode of assessment, diagnosis, substance use, risks, stressors, use of mental health act legislation and follow-up. During the first level-4 lockdown fewer MaÃ‚Â¯ori were assessed, police referrals increased, specific stressors related to confinement were identified and there was an increase in risks relating to self-harm and harm to others. Service users had unique stressors and changing patterns of presentation during the level-4 New Zealand lockdown. In response to the changing needs of service users during a pandemic, we recommend optimising telehealth, enhancing connections with other essential services, development of digital interventions and care for frontline staff.","Ng, Narayanan, Diamond, Pitigala","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211052918","20211025","COVID-19; audit; coronavirus; mental health services; service user","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19180,""

"Experiences of Safety-Net Practice Clinicians Participating in the National Health Service Corps During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly harsh for low-income and racial and ethnic minority communities. It is not known how the pandemic has affected clinicians who provide care to these communities through safety-net practices, including clinicians participating in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). In late 2020, we surveyed clinicians who were serving in the NHSC as of July 1, 2020, in 20 states. Clinicians reported on work and job changes and their current well-being, among other measures. Analyses adjusted for differences in subgroup response rates and clustering of clinicians within practices. Of 4263 surveyed clinicians, 1890 (44.3%) responded. Work for most NHSC clinicians was affected by the pandemic, including 64.5% whose office visit numbers fell by half and 62.5% for whom most visits occurred virtually. Fewer experienced changes in their jobs; for example, only 14.9% had been furloughed. Three-quarters (76.6%) of these NHSC clinicians scored in at-risk levels for their well-being. Compared with primary care and behavioral health clinicians, dental clinicians much more often had been furloughed and had their practices close temporarily. The pandemic has disrupted the work, jobs, and mental health of NHSC clinicians in ways similar to its reported effects on outpatient clinicians generally. Because clinicians' mental health worsens after a pandemic, which leads to patient disengagement and job turnover, national programs and policies should help safety-net practices build cultures that support and give greater priority to clinicians' work, job, and mental health needs now and before the next pandemic.","Pathman, Sonis, Harrison, Sewell, Fannell, Overbeck, Konrad","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211054083","20211025","COVID-19; National Health Service Corps; dental and behavioral health clinicians; education loan repayment; health care worker management; primary care; safety-net practices; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19183,""
"Diatomaceous earth/zinc oxide micro-composite assisted antibiotics in fungal therapy","As the second wave of COVID-19 hits South Asia, an increasing deadly complication 'fungal infections (such as Mycosis, Candida and Aspergillus) outbreak' has been raised concern about the insufficient technologies and medicals for its diagnosis and therapy. Biosilica based nano-therapy can be used for therapeutic efficacy, yet their direct role as antibiotic agent with biocompatibility and stability remains unclear. Here, we report that a diatomaceous earth (DE) framework semiconductor composite conjugated DE and in-house synthesized zinc oxide (DE-ZnO), as an antibiotic agent for the enhancement of antibiotic efficacy and persistence. We found that the DE-ZnO composite had enhanced antibiotic activity against fungi (A. fumigatus) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, S. enterica). The DE-ZnO composite provides enhancing large surface areas for enhancement of target pathogen binding affinity, as well as produces active ions including reactive oxygen species and metal ion for breaking the cellular network of fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the toxicity of DE-ZnO with 3 time less amount of dosage is 6 times lower than the commercial SiO<sub>2</sub>-ZnO. Finally, a synergistic effect of DE-ZnO and existing antifungal agents (Itraconazole and Amphotericin B) showed a better antifungal activity, which could be reduced the side effects due to the antifungal agents overdose, than a single antibiotic agent use. We envision that this DE-ZnO composite can be used to enhance antibiotic activity and its persistence, with less-toxicity, biocompatibility and high stability against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria which could be a valuable candidate in medical science and industrial engineering.","Liu, Qiao, Jang, Kim, Zou, Lee, Koo, Kim, Yun, Kim, Shin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40580-021-00283-6","20211025","Antibiotic efficacy; Antifungal therapy; Biocompatibility; Persistent therapy; Synergistic effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19184,""
"How the COVID-19 Pandemic Can and Must Expand Social Worker e-Interventions for Mental Health, Family Wellness, and Beyond","Both media and academic reports have highlighted COVID-19's negative impacts on mental health and safety in the United States, yet care and service gaps persist. Evidence suggests that a default to in-person service delivery did not meet clients' needs before the pandemic, and that unmet needs have ballooned since COVID-19 spread throughout the United States due to a combination of increased stress, social isolation, and fewer available services during lockdowns. This article reviews literature on online interventions' utility and effectiveness in preventing and treating problems likely exacerbated under pandemic conditions, including mental health conditions, anger, couple dynamics, parenting, and alcohol misuse. The article also describes barriers to evidence-based e-interventions' wider and more consistent use, highlights some vulnerable populations' unique service needs, outlines service gaps that online programs might effectively mitigate, and offers a path by which social workers can lead an interdisciplinary charge in researching, developing, and implementing e-interventions during the current pandemic and beyond.","King, Spencer, Meeks","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swab043","20211025","COVID-19; e-intervention; internet-based services; prevention; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19185,""
"Smoking enhances suicide risk-a significant role in the COVID-19 pandemic?","The COVID-19 outbreak has severely affected the whole world. Considerable evidence suggests that tobacco smoking is associated with increased severity of COVID-19 and death in COVID-19 patients. Tobacco smoking cessation is necessary to decrease COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. In this commentary, I suggest that tobacco smoking cessation is also needed to reduce suicidal behavior during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic leads to increased tobacco consumption as smokers use more tobacco to cope with pandemic related stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Multiple studies have demonstrated that tobacco smoking is associated with suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide death, and a contributing factor in the pathophysiology of suicide. Smoking may increase the probability of development of post-COVID syndrome because it increases severity of COVID-19. Suicide risk may be increased in individuals with post-COVID syndrome. Smoking prevention and cessation should be a target of suicide prevention interventions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic enhances the need to act to integrate tobacco smoking cessation in the health care as a standard of patient care.","Sher","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcab271","20211025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19186,""

The records of 17Ã¢â‚¬Â¯255Ã¢â‚¬Â¯033 adults (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [19.5] years; 51.3% female) were examined in 2018, 17Ã¢â‚¬Â¯340Ã¢â‚¬Â¯731 adults (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [19.7] years; 51.6% female) in 2019, 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯916Ã¢â‚¬Â¯910 adults (mean [SD] age, 53.7 [19.8] years; 51.9% female) in 2020, and 15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯135Ã¢â‚¬Â¯998 adults (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [19.8] years; 52.5% female) in 2021. Compared with men, women had a higher rate of prescriptions for all 3 drugs classes and had larger changes in prescription rates over time. Benzodiazepine prescribing decreased from January 2018 (women: 5.61%; 95% CI, 5.60%-5.63%; men: 3.03%; 95% CI, 3.02%-3.04%) to March 2021 (women: 4.91%; 95% CI, 4.90%-4.93%; men: 2.66%; 95% CI, 2.65%-2.67%), except for a slight increase in April 2020 among women. Z-hypnotic prescribing increased from January 2020 for women (1.39%; 95% CI, 1.38%-1.40%) and February 2020 for men (0.97%; 95% CI, 0.96%-0.98%) to October 2020 (women: 1.46%; 95% CI, 1.46%-1.47%; men: 1.00%; 95% CI, 0.99%-1.01%). Prescribing of SSRIs and SNRIs increased from January 2018 (women: 12.77%; 95% CI; 12.75%-12.80%; men: 5.56%; 95% CI, 5.44%-5.58%) to April 2020 for men (6.73%; 95% CI, 6.71%-6.75%) and October 2020 for women (15.18%; 95% CI, 15.16%-15.21%). In this cohort study, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset was an increase in Z-hypnotic as well as SSRI and SNRI prescriptions in both men and women along with an increase in benzodiazepine prescriptions in women, findings that suggest a substantial mental health impact of COVID-19-associated mitigation measures.","Milani, Raji, Chen, Kuo","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.31012","20211025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19187,""
"Understanding COVID-19 through a Complex Trauma Lens: Implications for Effective Psychosocial Responses","The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on individuals, families, and communities will likely persist for years to come. While briefing notes informed by disaster psychology and crisis management have been released to guide social workers and other mental health professionals in their work during the pandemic, the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 may require inclusion of additional theories of trauma and resilience. Thus, this article first examines the application of complex trauma theory as an effective framework for assessing the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic, especially among individuals with prior trauma exposure, those with preexisting mental illness, and communities affected by marginalization and historical trauma. Authors then discuss the importance of using trauma-informed practice to address the effects of the pandemic on both individual and community levels during this unprecedented moment in history.","Alessi, Hutchison, Kahn","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swab045","20211025","COVID-19; PTSD; complex trauma; trauma-informed practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19188,""
"Evaluating the Clinical Feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence-Powered, Web-Based Clinical Decision Support System for the Treatment of Depression in Adults: Longitudinal Feasibility Study","Approximately two-thirds of patients with major depressive disorder do not achieve remission during their first treatment. There has been increasing interest in the use of digital, artificial intelligence-powered clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to assist physicians in their treatment selection and management, improving the personalization and use of best practices such as measurement-based care. Previous literature shows that for digital mental health tools to be successful, the tool must be easy for patients and physicians to use and feasible within existing clinical workflows. This study aims to examine the feasibility of an artificial intelligence-powered CDSS, which combines the operationalized 2016 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments guidelines with a neural network-based individualized treatment remission prediction. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was adapted to be completed entirely remotely. A total of 7 physicians recruited outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. Patients completed a minimum of one visit without the CDSS (baseline) and 2 subsequent visits where the CDSS was used by the physician (visits 1 and 2). The primary outcome of interest was change in appointment length after the introduction of the CDSS as a proxy for feasibility. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected through self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Data were collected between January and November 2020. A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the study; of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in appointment length between visits (introduction of the tool did not increase appointment length; F<sub>2,24</sub>=0.805; mean squared error 58.08; P=.46). In total, 92% (12/13) of patients and 71% (5/7) of physicians felt that the tool was easy to use; 62% (8/13) of patients and 71% (5/7) of physicians rated that they trusted the CDSS. Of the 13 patients, 6 (46%) felt that the patient-clinician relationship significantly or somewhat improved, whereas 7 (54%) felt that it did not change. Our findings confirm that the integration of the tool does not significantly increase appointment length and suggest that the CDSS is easy to use and may have positive effects on the patient-physician relationship for some patients. The CDSS is feasible and ready for effectiveness studies.

Nevertheless, data on long-term symptoms of COVID-19 in healthcare workers are scarce. We assessed frequency and risk factors of persisting symptoms in a retrospective cohort of healthcare workers infected with SARS-CoV-2. Persistent symptoms at 3 and 12 months were reported by 26.5% and 13.5% of participants, respectively. Most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, impaired sense of taste or smell and general weakness. A history of depression or state of exhaustion, pre-existing lung disease and older age were associated with persisting symptoms. Our study shows that a relevant proportion of healthcare workers with mild COVID-19 report persisting symptoms over 3 and 12 months.

"Impact of coronavirus of 2019 on the delivery of pharmacy services to patients with cancer: An international survey of oncology pharmacy practitioners","The coronavirus of 2019 pandemic has necessitated vast and rapid changes in the way oncology pharmacy services are delivered around the world. An international survey of oncology pharmacists and technicians was conducted via the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners and collaborating global pharmacy organisations to determine the impact that the coronavirus of 2019 has had on pharmacy service delivery, pharmacy practitioners and oncology practice. The survey received 862 responses from 40 different countries from September to October 2020. The majority of respondents were pharmacists (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°841, 97.6%), with 24% involved in the direct care of patients with the coronavirus of 2019. Of the survey participants, 55% increased their time working remotely, with remote activities including dispensing, patient assessment/follow-up and attending multi-disciplinary rounds. Respondents reported a 72% increase in the use of technology to perform remote patient interaction activities and that participation in educational meetings and quality improvement projects was reduced by 68% and 44%, respectively. Workforce impacts included altered working hours (50%), cancelled leave (48%) and forced leave/furloughing (30%). During the pandemic, respondents reported reduced access to intensive care (19%) and anti-cancer (15%) medications. In addition, 39% of respondents reported reduced access to personal protective equipment, including N95 masks for chemotherapy compounding. Almost half of respondents (49%) reported that cancer treatments were delayed or intervals were altered for patients being treated with curative intent. A third of practitioners (30%) believed that patient outcomes would be adversely impacted by changes to pharmacy services. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported impacts on their mental health, with 12% utilising support services. The coronavirus of 2019 pandemic has altered the way oncology pharmacy services are delivered. These results demonstrate the adaptability of the oncology pharmacy profession and highlight the importance of formal evaluation of the varied practice models to determine the evidence-based practices that enhance pharmacy services and, thus, should be reinstated as soon as practical and reasonable.","Chazan, Jupp, Bauters, Duncan, Weddle, Nomura, O'Connor, Chan, Alkhudair, Alshamrani, Buie, Chambers, Chieh, DeRemer, Duvivier, Katabalo, McFarlane, Mckavanagh, Mensah, Martinez, Rowan, Sae-Teaw, Tadesse, Weru, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.1177/10781552211048892","20211025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19191,""
"Actor-partner association of work-family conflict and parental depressive symptoms during COVID-19 in China: Does coparenting matter?","Parental depressive symptoms and their related factors have not been widely examined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the current study examined the actor and partner associations of work-family conflict and parental depressive symptoms. Considering the new demands and challenges for families during the COVID-19 pandemic, we further explored the moderation effect of coparenting. A cross-sectional online survey with 985 paired fathers and mothers was conducted in Mainland China. In 11.6% of families, only mothers reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; in 10.6% families, only fathers reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; in 9.5% families, the mother and father reported mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Results of the actor-partner interdependence model showed that parental family-to-work conflict was negatively associated with their own depressive symptoms. The negative actor association of maternal family-to-work conflict and depressive symptoms was moderated by undermining coparenting. The partner effects of maternal family-to-work and work-to-family conflicts on paternal depressive symptoms were moderated by undermining coparenting. Moreover, supportive coparenting moderated the actor association of work-to-family conflict and the depressive symptoms of fathers. Results highlight the importance of family-to-work conflict and family function for parental depressive symptoms.

"Activities, time-use and mental health during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave: Insight from Greece","The COVID-19 pandemic shocked the global society and caused significant disruptions on various levels of economic and social activity, apart from the purely humanitarian and health perspective. International community and national goverments introduced a series of restrictions and other measures to minimize the spread of the virus. This paper provides insight from Greece, focusing on activities and time-use, statements towards mental health and overall wellbeing of citizens during the spring lockdown period of 2020. The analysis is based on data from more than 400 individuals collected through an online survey, which included psychometric attitudes and mental health scales, activity participation and time-use, as well as socio-economic variables and reactions to COVID-19 measures and overall situation. We present results and a respondent segmentation, by employing a latent class cluster analysis, which provides useful insight into the mental health, wellbeing of individuals during the restrictions period and information regarding the activities of the various segments of the population before and during the lockdown. Main findings include the identification of three distinct clusters of the respondents, ""Relaxed"", ""Worried"" and ""Cautious"" which demonstrated some heterogeneity time-use allocation and activity patterns and feelings/mental health during the lockdown. This is one of the first papers to present activity and time-use data for the 2020 lockdown period in Greece by developing a segmentation approach of the participants based on mental health scales and indicators. Such exploratory efforts are useful in identifying different population segments that may react to government restrictions in a heterogenous way and may exhibit varying mental health statuses.","Tsouros, Tsirimpa, Pagoni, Polydoropoulou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100442","20211025","Activities during lockdown; Boredom scale; COVID-19; Mental health during the pandemic; Time-use; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19193,""

"Financial hardship and social assistance as determinants of mental health and food and housing insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","While social assistance through the U.S. federal CARES Act provided expanded unemployment insurance benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic until the summer of 2020, it is unclear whether social assistance was sufficient in subsequent months to meet everyday spending needs and to curb the adverse health-related sequelae of financial hardship. Using multivariable Poisson log-binomial regression and repeated cross-sectional Household Pulse Survey data between September and December 2020 on 91,222 working-aged U.S. adults and 28,842 adult housing renters, this study explored the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance. Financial hardship rose progressively from September to December 2020, and disproportionately affected Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic Americans and lower-income households. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted nearly 3-fold higher risks of anxiety and depressive symptoms (e.g., adjusted prevalence ratio, PR of depressionÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.75, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.54-2.98, <i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), a 23-fold higher risk of food insufficiency (PRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 22.71, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15.62-33.01, <i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), and a 27-fold higher risk of a likely eviction (PRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 27.20, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10.63-69.59, <i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship (all <i>P</i> values for linear trend &lt;0.001), and more than offset benefits from social assistance. Even after accounting for social assistance receipt, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater risks of anxiety and depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. These findings point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance to mitigate the pandemic's adverse impacts on the well-being of millions of Americans, including vulnerable minority and low-income populations.","Kim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100862","20211025","COVID-19 pandemic; Financial hardship; Food security; Housing security; Mental health; Social assistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19195,""

Previous research indicated that programs and interventions using social networks can play a positive role in promoting mental health. Nevertheless, current evidence is largely derived from high-income regions, reflecting an urgent need for more studies in low- and middle-income settings. <b>Objectives:</b> This paper aims to (a) describe the potential value of a hybrid health carnival in promoting mental health and increasing access to screening services; (b) assess the level of community engagement with the digital platform. <b>Methods:</b> A mental health carnival was conducted with the theme of ""Mind Your Mental Health"" <i>(Cakna Kesihatan Mental)</i> in conjunction with the World Mental Health Day in Malaysia. This was a hybrid carnival that combined elements of face-to-face interactions and virtual learning. Free online therapy sessions were offered to high-risk groups identified during the screening process. Social media metrics were utilized to report the levels of community engagement and participants completed pre-and post-assessments to measure the program's impact on their knowledge. <b>Results:</b> The carnival was attended by 515 participants (78.8% virtual participants).

"The Prevalence of Mental Problems for Chinese Children and Adolescents During COVID-19 in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused mental problems among the public and medical staff in China, especially for children and adolescents, a vulnerable group that might present with more mental problems. It seems that there is a rapid growth in the mental problems (such as depression or anxiety) of Chinese children and adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19. Although several studies reported the prevalence of depression or anxiety problems for children and adolescents, the results are different across different age groups and sex groups. Moreover, the sample size of these studies was small. In the present study, we aim to perform a meta-analysis to identify the confirmed prevalence of depression and anxiety problems for Chinese children and adolescents during home confinement. Five databases were searched including PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and both inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed. Finally, a total of 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The protocol of this systematic review was registered with INPLASY (protocol ID: INPLASY202150032). It found that the pooled prevalence of mental problems was 28% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.22-0.34), and the depression and anxiety problem for children and adolescents in China was 22% (95% CI: 0.16-0.30) and 25% (95% CI: 0.20-0.32) based on a random effect model, separately. Subgroup analysis was used to identify that there are no differences between different age groups (primary and middle school vs. high school) (<i>p</i> = 0.26). Meta-regression analysis was performed and the results showed that the moderator of boy percentage was a significant factor (<i>p</i> = 0.04). It indicated that there was an increasing number of children and adolescents with mental problems during the home confinement.

However, the pathophysiology, direct biological effects of the disease, treatment modalities, worsening of symptoms due to various medications, and other long-term sequelae are not fully understood. Therefore, clinicians should be mindful of neuropsychiatric symptoms and conduct a detailed history and physical examination on all patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms in the context of COVID-19. It is also essential to assess for signs and symptoms of delirium in patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Further research is needed to identify the etiology, predisposing factors, exacerbating or precipitating factors contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Student feedback was obtained anonymously through pre-, mid-, and post-elective questionnaires. A total of 26 students enrolled in the two 4-week blocks, with 85% in the 2nd year. Survey response rates for the pre, mid, and post-rotation questionnaires were 96%, 77%, 58% respectively. Of the 15 students who completed the post-survey, the majority strongly and somewhat agreed that the elective met expectations (12/15, 80%), was worthwhile (14/15, 93%) and met goals (12/15, 80%). Best parts of the elective most frequently cited by students were patient care and teamwork. Working remotely was the greatest challenge. Designing a virtual role for students successfully allowed students to re-engage in the acute care setting and connect with patients and participate in COVID-19 care.

"Family Functioning in the Time of COVID-19 Among Economically Vulnerable Families: Risks and Protective Factors","The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has been particularly harmful to economically vulnerable families with young children. We surveyed 247 low-income mothers and fathers from 142 families in the United States about changes in their family life following the economic and social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. We examined the associations between pandemic-related risk factors such as economic stressors (e.g., loss of job) and social stressors (e.g., exposure to the virus) on family functioning (e.g., parents' mental health, parent engagement, and children's socioemotional behaviors) and the degree to which coparenting support and parents' positivity protected families from the negative effects of these stressors on their wellbeing. We found both positive and negative associations. Mothers and fathers who reported more economic stressors since the pandemic also observed that their children behaved more prosocially and that fathers experienced more mental health difficulties during the pandemic. Mothers and fathers who reported more social stressors reported that they were less engaged with their children and their children exhibited more behavior problems compared to before the pandemic. We also found that mothers and fathers who reported feeling more positive also reported feeling less depressed and stressed during the pandemic and observed that their children had more prosocial behaviors compared to before the pandemic. Compared to before the pandemic, mothers and fathers who reported a more supportive coparenting relationship also reported more parent engagement and observed more prosocial behaviors in their children. In terms of protective factors, high levels of parent positivity during the pandemic protected mothers (less mental health difficulties) whereas high levels of coparenting support protected fathers (less mental health difficulties) from the negative effects of economic stress on their mental health during the pandemic. These findings highlight family processes that could promote resilience in mothers and fathers in the face of pandemic-related economic and social stressors.","He, Cabrera, Renteria, Chen, Alonso, McDorman, Kerlow, Reich","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.730447","20211025","COVID-19; coparenting support; parent engagement; parental mental health; positivity; prosocial behaviors; socioemotional problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19203,""
"Polish Emergency Dispatchers During a COVID-19 Pandemic - Burnout Syndrome, Perceived Stress, and Self-Efficacy Effects of Multidimensional Path Analysis","International research has demonstrated that emergency call operators face unique risks to their mental health, in particular job stress, and occupational burnout syndrome. There is already wide knowledge about the relationship between stress, burnout and employee personal resources, which has practical application in preventing mental health. However, more research into the subtle relationships between variables is needed. The aim of the study was to check the moderation effect of differences in the intensity of latent variables on the relationship between perceived stress, self-efficacy and professional burnout. The participants were 546 call-takers and dispatchers from 14 public-safety answering point in Poland aged between 19 and 65 years. The Link Burnout Questionnaire, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, and an independent questionnaire were used to gather information. The method of path analysis was used. The study confirmed the existence of negative relationships between perceived stress (assessment of the current situation) and self-efficacy (a personal trait). Taking into account the moderating effect of latent variable: psychological comfort revealed a hidden relationship between stress and burnout. The stress-burnout relationship occurred only among participants with low level of psychological comfort, so it was not a proportional relationship. In the case of participants with a high level of second latent variable: power-to-affect, the hypothesis that a high level of this variable should weaken the relationship between stress and burnout was not confirmed. The level of latent variables did not affect the self-efficacy relationship with occupational burnout. Taking into account the differences in the intensity of latent variables showed their moderating effect, which often turned out to be different from the assumed one and obtained in the research of other authors. This allowed to discover the relationships that might otherwise have been overlooked and not included in burnout prevention. The results showed a high level of occupational burnout in the ECD's group during the COVID-19 pandemic: 32% of the responders reported emotional exhaustion, 53% loss of professional effectiveness.","Makara-StudziÃ…â€žska, ZaÃ…â€šuski, Adamczyk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.729772","20211025","COVID-19; emergency call-taker and dispatcher; emergency service; occupational burnout; perceived stress; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19204,""
"The Resilience Journal: Exploring the Potential of Journal Interventions to Promote Resilience in University Students","Given the prevalence of mental health issues among university students, they must be regarded as a vulnerable population. Resilience interventions offer one potential means of strengthening students' capacity to overcome academic challenges and external threats. This is all the more urgent in light of the additional difficulties caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic, such as the demands of remote learning. The present study is a first step toward designing and evaluating an appropriate dynamic resilience intervention for students. The design of the <i>Resilience Journal</i> intervention draws on insights from expressive writing and positive writing research and focuses on reflection on daily challenges. In this online intervention, 100 business school students (66% female, M <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 23.74) at a German university were randomly assigned to two groups and completed two different versions of the <i>Resilience Journal</i> for 5 days. The two versions focused, respectively on broadening attention to challenges and priming attention to mastered challenges. In a pre-post design, two resilience measures and one measure of life satisfaction were used to assess intervention outcomes. Additionally, a newly developed rating scale was used for daily monitoring of dynamic resilience. While both groups showed a significant increase in resilience as measured by the Brief Resilience Scale, that increase could not be attributed directly to the intervention, as there were no group differences, and the design did not include a control group. The other resilience and life satisfaction measures showed no significant change. This first implementation confirms the potential of the <i>Resilience Journal</i> and indicates directions for the development of dynamic resilience interventions and measures in future studies. To further study the potential of such a positive psychology intervention, future research necessitates the inclusion of control groups.","Lohner, Aprea","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.702683","20211025","COVID-19; broaden-and-build theory; higher education; journal intervention; online intervention; resilience; university students; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19205,""
"Inpatient Institutional Care: The Forced Social Environment","The landscape of mental health recovery is changing; there have been calls for a shift from the clinical expertise being the dominant voice within mental healthcare towards a more personalised and collaborative service that supports those in need of mental healthcare to define what recovery is for the individual. Within this new recovery movement, there has been a recognition of the importance of the social environment in which individuals are situated and the relationship of this to mental health and wellbeing. Included in this is the importance of an individual's role within society and the ways in which knowledge, such as experts by experience, can hold an important value. The argument then, is that social connectedness forms part of the recovery journey and that relationships can help us develop or re-connect with who we are in powerful ways. Such a view has only been strengthened by the recent and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Within the UK, discussions of the importance of our wellbeing have become commonplace within the context of restricted social contact. With this heightened awareness of how the social contributes to wellbeing, it is important to consider the environments in which those in receipt of mental healthcare are situated. One of which is institutionalised care, where it is commonplace to restrict social contact. For example, by virtue of being within a locked environment, individuals' freedom of movement is often non-existent and thus contacts with those not residing or working within the institution is restricted. While such restrictions may be deemed necessary to protect the individual's mental health, such environments can be unintentionally toxic. Data are presented from an ethnography that was conducted within an inpatient forensic mental health hospital in the UK to highlight the problematic social environment which some individuals experience. Key interpersonal issues are presented, such as, trust, racism, the threat of physical violence and bullying that was experienced by staff and residents at the hospital. Consideration is given to the coping strategies enacted by residents and the pathologising of such behaviour. The consequences on interpersonal wellbeing are explored.","Joyes, Jordan, Winship, Crawford","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.690384","20211025","ethnography; forensic mental health; holistic wellbeing; inpatient secure care; interpersonal wellbeing; recovery; social connectedness; therapeutic communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19206,""
"Self-Transcendence as a Buffer Against COVID-19 Suffering: The Development and Validation of the Self-Transcendence Measure-B","The age of COVID-19 calls for a different approach toward global well-being and flourishing through the transcendence suffering as advocated by existential positive psychology. In the present study, we primarily explained what self-transcendence is and why it represents the most promising path for human beings to flourish through the transformation of suffering in a difficult and uncertain world. After reviewing the literature on self-transcendence experiences, we concluded that the model of self-transcendence presented by Frankl is able to integrate both of the characteristics associated with self-transcendence. Afterward, we discussed how the self-transcendence paradigm proposed by Wong, an extension of the model by Frankl, may help awaken our innate capacity for connections with the true self, with others, and with God or something larger than oneself. We presented self-transcendence as a less-traveled but more promising route to achieve personal growth and mental health in troubled times. Finally, we presented the history of the development and psychometrics of the Self-Transcendence Measure-Brief (STM-B) and reported the empirical evidence that self-transcendence served as a buffer against COVID-19 suffering. The presented data in the current study suggested that the best way to overcome pandemic suffering and mental health crises is to cultivate self-transcendence.","Wong, Arslan, Bowers, Peacock, Kjell, Ivtzan, Lomas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648549","20211025","COVID-19; existential positive psychology (PP2.0); existential psychology; mature happiness; meaning; positive psychology; self-transcendence; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19207,""
"The Implementation of Patient-Centered Humanistic Care for COVID-19 Closely Contacted Hemodialysis Patients Under the Hospital-Based Group Medical Quarantine: A Brief Research Report","In February 2020, an inpatient in Peking University People's Hospital (PKUPH), China, was confirmed positive for the novel coronavirus. In this case, 143 hemodialysis patients were labeled as close contacts and required to be placed under the hospital-based group medical quarantine (HB-GMQ) for 2 weeks by the authorities. After the case was reported, false or misleading information about the case flourished on social media platforms, which led to infodemic. Under this context, PKUPH adopted patient-centered humanistic care to implement the HB-GMQ, through the synergy of administrative, healthcare, logistical, and other measures under the model of patient-centered care of the Massachusetts Medical Society (MMS). As a result, all the patients tided over the HB-GMQ with no COVID-19 infection and no unanticipated adverse events, and all met the criteria for lifting the HB-GMQ. According to the questionnaires taken during the HB-GMQ, a high level of satisfaction was found among the quarantined and no symptomatic increase of anxiety and depression in the patients before and during the HB-GMQ, by comparing the Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) conducted in December 2019 and on the 12th day of the HB-GMQ. This article is to brief on PKUPH's experience in implementing patient-centered humanistic care tailored to hemodialysis patients under the HB-GMQ, and to validate the hypothesis that patient-centered humanistic care is effective and helpful to help them tide over the HB-GMQ, so as to shed light on how to implement the HB-GMQ and cope with the HB-GMQ-induced problems in other hospitals.","Zhang, Gan, Li, Shao, Zuo, Gao, Huang, Jia, Liang, Hou, Wang, Wang, Gao, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.553234","20211025","COVID-19; hemodialysis patients; hospital-based group medical quarantine; humanistic care; measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19208,""
"Schoolteachers' Resilience Does but Self-Efficacy Does Not Mediate the Influence of Stress and Anxiety Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Depression and Subjective Well-Being","<b>Objectives:</b> In the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, schoolteachers experience stress from addressing students or performing school tasks that may result in burnout. This study aimed to observe whether teachers' stress and anxiety due to the pandemic can influence their depression or psychological well-being and examine whether their resilience or self-efficacy mediates this association. <b>Methods:</b> During March 4-15, 2021, 400 teachers participated and responded voluntarily to an online survey that included the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 items (SAVE-9), the Teacher-Efficacy Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 items. <b>Results:</b> High psychological well-being of teachers in COVID-19 pandemic era was expected by a low SAVE-9 score (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99), a high level of self-efficacy (aOR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06), and a high BRS score (aOR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.27). Moreover, teachers' resilience mediated the effects of stress and anxiety from the COVID-19 pandemic on their subjective well-being or depression. <b>Conclusions:</b> Schoolteachers' subjective well-being and depression were influenced by high levels of stress and anxiety of the viral epidemic, and their resilience mediated this relationship in this COVID-19 pandemic era.","Cho, Lee, Kim, Lee, Lee, Yoo, Suh, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.756195","20211025","COVID-19; anxiety; psychology; stress; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19209,""

The results allowed identifying three main areas that influenced the performance of nursing homes during the COVID-19 outbreak: organization models and resources; physical and mental health of residents and; family as a support. Older adults residing in nursing homes are particularly vulnerable to severe disease or death from COVID-19. It is emergent that nursing homes prevent physical and mental frailty in older residents and the loneliness aggravated by the pandemic circumstances.

Physical activity has been suggested to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic and to foster mental health. The present study aimed to investigate, whether sense of control might mediate the supposed beneficial effects of physical activity on positive (PMH) and negative mental health (NMH) in unpredictable extraordinary situations. Data were assessed in a sample of 568 students (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 19.90, <i>SD</i> <sub>age</sub> = 4.52) from Germany via an online survey in fall 2020. Mediation analyses revealed that sense of control mediated the relation between physical activity and PMH as well as depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. The findings indicate that physical activity may be a promising strategy for fostering sense of control and thus mental health. Due to its practical implications and practicability, engagement in physical activity could be an effective way to reduce the NMH consequences of the current COVID-19 situation, and therefore should be addressed in actions for long-term prevention and intervention.","Precht, Margraf, Stirnberg, Brailovskaia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02303-4","20211025","COVID-19; Depression, anxiety, stress; Physical activity; Positive mental health; Sense of control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19215,""
"Fear of COVID-19 and general self-efficacy among Turkish teachers: Mediating role of perceived social support","Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), which has influenced the world since the last months of 2019, has not only affected people physiologically, but also had serious adverse effects on mental health. Unavoidable increases in positive case numbers and loss of life have caused fear and anxiety, which is a psychological aspect of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, it was aimed to examine the mediating role of perceived social support in the relationship between teachers' general self-efficacy perceptions and their fear of COVID-19. The sample of the study consists of 322 Turkish teachers (198 women and 124 men; aged between 23 and 66Ã‚Â years). Data collection tools are the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Perceived Multidimensional Social Support Scale. To test the model structural equation modeling and bootstrapping were used. In the study it was found that fear of COVID-19 has a negative impact on general self-efficacy and the perceived social support. Besides, it was found that perceived social support partially mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and general self-efficacy. Thus, higher fear of COVID-19 was related to lower self-efficacy and perceived social support. In turn, higher perceived social support was associated with higher self-efficacy. The results were discussed within the framework of the literature, and implications presented.","Yenen, Ãƒâ€¡arkit","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02306-1","20211025","COVID-19; Fear of COVID-19; General self-efficacy; Perceived social support; Teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19216,""
"Fear of coronavirus (COVID-19) and mental health outcomes in Palestine: The mediating role of social support","The current investigation was conducted to test the correlation between fear due to coronavirus (COVID-19) and mental health outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety) and the mediating role of social support during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Palestine. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to test the conceptual model, where fear of Covid-19 was considered as a predictor, social support as a mediating variable, and mental health (stress, depression, and anxiety) as outcomes. The participants involved were 370 Palestinians, 266 females, and the remaining were males. Participants were recruited through online methods; Facebook advertising, Network email, and Twitter during the COVID-19 in Palestine. Results of the study showed that fear related to COVID-19 was positively and significantly correlated with mental health outcomes (anxiety; rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.29, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>, depression; rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.25, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>, and stress; rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.36<i>, p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>), while negatively correlated to perceived emotional support (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.30, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>), support seeking (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.29, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>), and received support (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.31, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>). Results of SEM indicated a standardized total effect of social support on mental health outcomes (ÃŽÂ²<sub>X, M</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.57; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.001</i>), and an indirect but statistically significant effect (via social support, ÃŽÂ²<sub>X, M, Y</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-. 286; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.01</i>). These results indicate that social support fully mediated the relationship between fear associated with COVID-19 and mental health distress (stress, depression, and anxiety). The current study supported previous findings demonstrating that fear related to COVID-19 positively correlated with mental health distress (depression, anxiety, and stress). In addition, social support mediated the relationship between fear of COVID19 and mental health outcomes. However, further investigations are needed to test the correlation between current study variables and other associated factors and develop intervention programs targeting affected populations during crises to enhance mental health outcomes.","Mahamid, Veronese, Bdier","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02395-y","20211025","COVID-19; Fear of disease; Mental health outcomes; Palestine; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19217,""
"Psychological Distress, Fear and Coping Strategies among Hong Kong People During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to potential adverse effects on the mental health status of a wide range of people. This study aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among general population in Hong Kong. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; level of fear was evaluated using the Fear of COVID-19 scale; and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify key factors associated with these mental health variables. Of the 555 participants, 53.9% experienced moderate to very high levels of psychological distress, 31.2% experienced a high level of fear of COVID-19, and 58.6% showed moderate to high resilient coping. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that living with family members, current alcohol consumption, and higher level of fear were associated with higher levels of psychological distress; perceived stress due to a change in employment condition, being a frontline worker, experiencing 'moderate to very high' distress, and healthcare service use to overcome the COVID-19 related stress in past 6Ã‚Â months were associated with a higher level of fear; and perceived better mental health status was associated with a moderate to high resilient coping. This study identified key factors associated with distress, fear and coping strategies during the pandemic in Hong Kong. Mental health support strategies should be provided continuously to prevent the mental impact of the pandemic from turning into long-term illness.

"Orthopaedic surgeons and covid- 19, the fear quotient ""what are we really worried about?""","The COVID-19 pandemic swiftly affected the world in a very short duration, and the orthopaedic surgery practice is no exception. Unprecedented lockdown was enforced in many countries including India as a first response to contain virus and its spread. That lead to a lot of confusion, fear, anxiety among general population as well as orthopaedic surgeons. We have studied the impact of this pandemic with fear as a denominator and how it affected the practice and health of orthopaedic surgeons. Cross-sectional web-based national survey distributed to orthopaedic surgeons by social media platform over period of one month from July 25, 2020 to august 25, 2020. Among 1065 responders, 731 completed the survey. Among 1065 responders, 27.22% had orthopaedic practice experience ranging from 10 to 20 years while 21.48% had orthopaedic experience more than 20 years. Scientific literature as well as social media and news media contributed significantly to Covid-19 knowledge and fear. 98.88% were worried about contracting disease by themselves or to family members. 89.47% were worried due to financial loss due to pandemic. 37 (5.06%) surgeons had a FCV- 19 (Fear for Covid-19 scale) score more than 60 (8.2%) while 291 (39.8%) had 41-60 and score was &lt;40 in 403 (55.12%) surgeons. According to survey vaccine availability and emergence of effective drug and treatment protocol will alleviate most of the concerns. 70.81% felt mildly depressed during pandemic times while 65.33% surgeons expressed interest in joining discussion groups and meetings encouraging positive thoughts. Financial liabilities and well-being of self and family are important factors which induced fear of Covid-19 among orthopaedic surgeons. Positive discussions and timely information from credible sources regarding prevention, diagnosis and management and will reduce psychological burden due to Covid-19, also this will help to form policies for future pandemics.","Attarde, Patwardhan, Patwardhan, Shyam, Sancheti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2021.101647","20211025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19219,""
"Perfectionistic Cognitions Pre-Pandemic Predict Greater Anxiety Symptoms During the Pandemic Among Emerging Adults: A Two-Wave Cross-Lagged Study","This study employed a two-wave cross-lagged panel analysis to examine associations between perfectionistic cognitions, anxiety, and depression pre-pandemic to during the pandemic in a sample of 171 (57% female, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°98) emerging adults. Results demonstrated that perfectionistic cognitions decreased, anxiety increased, and depressive symptoms did not change pre-pandemic to during the pandemic. Cross-lagged results indicated that pre-pandemic perfectionistic cognitions predicted higher levels of anxiety symptoms (but not depressive symptoms) during the pandemic after accounting for pre-pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. These results held with the inclusion of covariates (i.e., sex, age, education, exposure to COVID-19, whether or not participants knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, had lost income due to the pandemic, and how often they thought about COVID-19). Psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) pre-pandemic did not predict perfectionistic cognitions during the pandemic after accounting for pre-pandemic levels of perfectionistic cognitions. Results support assertions that individuals with heightened levels of perfectionism are at an increased risk for poorer mental health during the pandemic. Findings underscore the importance of assessing perfectionistic cognitions for the prevention and treatment of anxiety symptoms among emerging adults during and post-pandemic.","Molnar, Methot-Jones, Moore, O'Leary, Wade","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-021-00423-1","20211025","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Emerging adults; Pandemic; Perfectionism; Perfectionistic cognitions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19220,""
"COVID-19 Specific Risk Markers for Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration","Intimate partner violence (IPV) rates have grown alongside the sweeping changes, challenges, and transitions necessitated by the onset of COVID-19. The goal of this exploratory study was to examine COVID-19 related risk markers for IPV perpetration. Data were collected from a national sample of 365Ã‚Â U.S. individuals who were in a relationship during August 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic. Unadjusted odds ratios were calculated for 27 unique risk markers related to lifestyle changes due to COVID-19, mental health, isolation, financial impacts, and COVID-19 diagnoses. The strongest risk markers for IPV perpetration were feelings of loneliness, followed by anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, fear, boredom, substance use and lifestyle changes. Understanding risk markers associated with an increase in IPV perpetration can aid helping professionals identify individuals who may be at risk for IPV, or target these factors to aid in IPV prevention and intervention efforts.","Spencer, Gimarc, Durtschi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-021-00335-9","20211025","COVID-19; Intimate partner violence; Perpetration; Risk assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19221,""
"Do social isolation and neighborhood walkability influence relationships between COVID-19 experiences and wellbeing in predominantly Black urban areas?","Black Americans have been disproportionately affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic. Since the pandemic's start, we have observed compounded health, social, and economic impacts for communities of color, fueled in part by profound residential segregation in the United States that, for centuries prior to the pandemic, created differences in access to opportunity and resources. Based on a longitudinal cohort of Black residents living in two racially isolated Pittsburgh neighborhoods, we sought to: 1) describe the experiences of behavioral responses to COVID-19 conditions (e.g., closures of businesses, schools, government offices) and illness experiences reported by residents within these disinvested, urban areas and 2) determine if these experiences were associated with perceptions of risk, negative mental health outcomes, and food insecurity; and 3) examine whether any of the associations were explained by social isolation or modified by neighborhood walkability. We found direct associations between residents' experience with COVID-19-related closures and with the illness, with perceived risk, and change in psychological distress, sleep quality, and food insecurity from pre-COVID-19 levels. Social isolation was a statistically significant mediator of all of these associations, most strongly mediating the pathway to psychological distress. We found neighborhood walkability to be a significant moderator of the association between closure experiences and sleep quality. The results suggest that experiences of COVID-19 closures and illness were associated with serious threats to public health in Black, disinvested, urban neighborhoods, beyond those caused directly by the virus. Outcomes of the pandemic appear very much dependent on the extent to which social and physical resources are available to meet the demands of stress.","Finucane, Beckman, Ghosh-Dastidar, Dubowitz, Collins, Troxel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104264","20211025","Black; COVID-19; Social isolation; Urban health; Walkability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19222,""
"Severe Burnout and Poor Mental Health Among Healthcare Workers 6 Months After COVID-19 Pandemic Declaration: What Can We Learn for Future Emergencies?","The aim of this study was to examine the predictors associated with severe burnout and poor mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic as a learning opportunity for future emergent situations. Modifiable predictors of mental health need to be further examined and quantified to prioritize human resource support in organizations as healthcare workers confront stressful situations. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 271 healthcare workers from September 8 to October 10, 2020. Approximately one-third reported severe burnout, as well as moderate/severe anxiety and depression. Feeling protected working with COVID-19 patients, high family functioning, and spirituality were associated with 2- to 4-fold lower odds of severe burnout. Satisfaction with the organization's communications predicted 2-fold lower odds of anxiety, whereas high resilience was associated with almost 4-fold lower odds of stress and depression. Healthcare organizations may consider adopting programs to foster resilience, family and spiritual support, and effective communication strategies to reduce burnout and poor mental health among healthcare workers during pandemics and other situations of high stress.","Kim, Sloan, Chechel, Redila, Ferguson","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNA.0000000000001063","20211025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19223,""

Here, we reported a case with no significant psychiatric history who experienced first-episode mania during the COVID-19 treatment. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient's mood was elevated, she thought she can treat other patients with her special power, she was talkative and irritable. Olanzapine 20 mg was started and the patient's score on the Young Mania Rating Scale decreased on the 17th day.

"Effect of COVID-19 on training and mental health of oral medicine residents in North America","The objective of this study was to assess resident and faculty perception of the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the training experience, education, and psychological well-being of oral medicine (OM) residents. An anonymous 16-item online questionnaire was e-mailed to faculty and residents of all Commission on Dental Accreditation-accredited OM residency programs in North America. Survey questions asked about the pandemic's effect on resident educational, clinical, and research activities and the well-being of the residents. Survey data were collected using Qualtrics XM. Forty participants (52.5% residents and 47.5% faculty members) responded to the survey. Regarding the effect on clinical activities, 67.5% reported 50% or less reduction in patient volume seen by residents at its worst during the pandemic. With respect to educational activities, most reported a complete switch of didactic training (85.3%), academic examinations (60%), and off-site resident rotations (45%) to a virtual platform. Research activities were affected the most; 55% reported complete cessation for some time. Thirty-three percent perceived a negative effect, 18% perceived no effect, 11% perceived a positive effect, and 38% were unsure regarding the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 on resident morale. Despite the interruptions in the clinical, research, and educational activities, 62.5% expected on-time resident graduation. Despite constraints due to the pandemic, OM residency programs successfully continued clinical activities, didactic training, and research productivity through virtual means and a hybrid delivery care model while supporting their residents' morale.","Sandhu, Sankar, Sroussi, Villa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2021.09.011","20211024","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19227,""
"Psychological responses and associated factors during the initial stage of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic among the adult population in Poland - a cross-sectional study","The study aimed to assess the emotional state, the occurrence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the quality of life of adults living in Poland during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted on a group of 700 people aged 18 and over living in Poland. An anonymous online questionnaire was used in this cross-sectional study. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured using the Revised Event Impact Scale (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS - 21). The quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF. In Poland, a high average level of post-traumatic stress was found as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least the minimum level occurring in all surveyed people. There was also a high incidence of depression (48.00%), anxiety (39.29%), and stress (54.86) in the first phase of the pandemic. The average level of quality of life in Poland was the lowest for the physical domain and amounted to 49.56 (SD = 11.71). The standard of living in the psychological domain was 60.26 (SD = 13.14). The pandemic is having a significant impact on human mental health. The very high average levels of post-traumatic stress, stress, anxiety, and depression as well as low quality of life make it necessary to consider interventions that will favor the use of more adaptive defense mechanisms and build mental resilience during an infectious disease pandemic and its long-term consequences.","SozaÃ…â€žski, Ã„â€ wirlej-SozaÃ…â€žska, WiÃ…â€ºniowska-Szurlej, Jurek, GÃƒÂ³rniak, GÃƒÂ³rski, Englert-Bator, Perenc","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11962-8","20211024","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-26","",19228,""
