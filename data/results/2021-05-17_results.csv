"Changes in methadone program practices and fatal methadone overdose rates in Connecticut during COVID-19","Background Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has relaxed restrictions on methadone treatment in the United States. There is concern that the relaxation may increase fatal overdose rates. This study examines opioid treatment program (OTP) changes to methadone treatment during COVID-19 and changes in fatal methadone-involved overdose rates in Connecticut. Methods From July 8th to August 18th, 2020, we conducted a comprehensive state-wide survey of all eight OTPs that dispense methadone in Connecticut to examine programmatic changes during COVID-19. We also analyzed state-level data on confirmed accidental opioid-involved deaths to assess if relaxation of take-home dosing restrictions and in-person attendance requirements correlated with increased methadone-involved fatal overdose rates. Results OTPs reported implementing multiple changes to methadone treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The percent of patients receiving 28-day take-home doses increased from 0.1% to 16.8%, 14-day take-home doses increased from 14.2% to 26.8%, and the percent receiving one or no take-home doses decreased from 37.5% to 9.6%. Monthly or more frequent drug testing decreased from 15% to 4.6% and 75.2% of individual counseling for methadone patients transitioned to telehealth. However, changes to methadone treatment varied considerably by program. OTP providers said restrictions on methadone should be relaxed and increases in take-home dosing as well as telehealth should be continued in non-pandemic situations. Methadone-involved fatalities relative to other opioid-involved fatalities did not increase in Connecticut following changes in OTP practices. Conclusions Connecticut OTPs relaxed methadone treatment requirements during COVID-19. Since relaxing restrictions on methadone treatment has not increased fatal overdoses, we recommend that the reductions in-person dosing and attendance requirements implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should be continued and made permanent.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108449","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-17","",13752,""

"Paradigm of technological convergence and digital transformation: The challenges of CH sectors in the global COVID-19 pandemic and commencing resilience-based structure for the post-COVID-19 era","Technology and digitalization are vital for helping organizations to survive in the competitive marketplace. The global COVID-19 pandemic has fixated attention on the cultural heritage sectors. This study presents technological convergence and new digital platforms that require business societies to transform into new sustainable meanings. The concept of technological convergence to the autonomous ecosystem is supported by cutting-edge technologies, a distinctive life cycle for value-added creation. This study is based on a five-part conceptual context to examine the impact of pandemic on the cultural heritage sectors. The major impacts like institutional issues, financial limitations, data access policies, and stakeholders diverging views are fully addressed. An additional impression of this study is that it has comprehensively expressed the opportunities and capabilities of technological convergence in terms of competence, integration, impound and novelty for higher value creation most related to the cultural heritage sectors in the current and post COVID-19 pandemic era.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.daach.2021.e00182","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-17","",13754,""

"Prevalence of mental health symptoms and its effect on insomnia among healthcare workers who attended hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in Dhaka city","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, the high workload, risk of infection, and safety issues for family members may pose a threat to the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) working in hospital settings. The study aimed to find out the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were among HCWs, as well as the factors related to these mental health issues. Methods We conducted an online survey of HCWs employed in Dhaka city from June 6 to July 6, 2020. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. The related factors of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were identified using three regression models. Results This research included responses from 294 HCWs (mean Â± standard deviation age: 28.86 Â± 5.5 years; 43.5% were female). Anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were found in 20.7%, 26.5%, and 44.2% of HCWs, respectively. The variable financial difficulties was commonly found as an associated factor for anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Female HCWs were more prone to mental health symptoms and insomnia compared to male HCWs (Adjusted odds ratio- AOR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.27â€“3.79). The depression symptoms among HCWs were found to be a factor for insomnia (AOR = 6.321, 95% CI = 3.158â€“12.650). Conclusion In the current pandemic, the high prevalence of mental health symptoms among HCWs indicates that this occupational group being associated with increased mental distress. Increasing financial support for HCWs and providing support to female workers in care facilities could help to alleviate the burden of mental illness. Supportive, training, and educational strategies, particularly through knowledge and communication platforms, could be recommended to the care facilities, which can reduce the burden of mental health symptoms among HCWs.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06985","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-17","",13756,""
