"How is the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our life, mental health, and well-being? Design and preliminary findings of the pan-Canadian longitudinal COHESION Study","Abstract With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person social interactions and opportunities for accessing resources that sustain health and well-being have drastically reduced. We therefore designed the pan-Canadian population-based prospective COVID-19: HEalth and Social Inequities across Neighbourhoods (COHESION) cohort to provide deeper understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic context affects mental health and well-being, key determinants of health, and health inequities. This paper presents the design of the two-phase COHESION Study, and descriptive results from the first phase conducted between May 2020 and September 2021. During that period, the COHESION research platform collected monthly data linked to COVID-19 such as infection and vaccination status, perceptions and attitudes regarding pandemic-related measures, and information on participants physical and mental health, well-being, sleep, loneliness, resilience, substances use, living conditions, social interactions, activities, and mobility. The 1,268 people enrolled in the Phase 1 COHESION Study are for the most part from Ontario (47%) and Quebec (33%), aged 48 {+/-} 16 years [mean{+/-} standard deviation (SD)], and mainly women (78%), White (85%), with a university degree (63%), and living in large urban centers (70%). According to the 298 {+/-} 68 (mean {+/-} SD) prospective questionnaires completed each month in average, the first year of follow-up reveals significant temporal variations in standardized indexes of well-being, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. The COHESION Study will allow identifying trajectories of mental health and well-being while investigating their determinants and how these may vary by subgroup, over time, and across different provinces in Canada, in the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stephan Gabet; Benoit Thierry; Rania Wasfi; Margaret De Groh; Guido Simonelli; Catherine Hudon; Lily Lessard; Ãˆve DubÃ©; Bouchra Nasri; Yan Kestens; Gregory Moullec","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.26.22275645","20220527","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32009,""

"The predictive power of insomnia symptoms on other aspects of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study","Symptoms of insomnia are an important risk factor for the development of mental disorders, especially during stressful life periods such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, up to now, most studies have used cross-sectional data, and the prolonged impact of insomnia symptoms during the pandemic on later mental health remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated insomnia symptoms as a predictor of other aspects of mental health across 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, with altogether seven assessments (every 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, t0-t6), in a community sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 166-267). Results showed no mean-level increase of insomnia symptoms and/or deterioration of mental health between baseline assessment (t0) and the 6- month follow-up (t6). As preregistered, higher insomnia symptoms (between persons) across all time points predicted reduced mental health at the 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, contrary to our hypothesis, higher insomnia symptoms at 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month, within each person (i.e., compared to that person's symptoms at other time points), predicted improved rather than reduced aspects of mental health 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month later. Hence, we replicated the predictive effect of averagely increased insomnia symptoms on impaired later mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we were surprised that increased insomnia symptoms at 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month predicted aspects of improved mental health 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month later. This unexpected effect might be specific for our study population and a consequence of our study design. Overall, increased insomnia symptoms may have served as a signal to engage in, and successfully implement, targeted countermeasures, which led to better short-term mental health in this healthy sample.","Werner, Cludius, Sckopke, Stefan, SchÃƒÂ¶nbrodt, Zygar-Hoffmann","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13641","20220527","anxiety; depression; mental wellbeing; psychological resilience; sleep; stress-related symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32011,""
"Mental health and well-being in times of COVID-19: A mixed-methods study of the role of neighborhood parks, outdoor spaces, and nature among US older adults","The role of parks and nature to support well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. To examine this topic, we used mixed-methods data collected in April-May 2020 from US adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 in the COVID-19 Coping Study. We quantitatively evaluated the associations between number of neighborhood parks and depression, anxiety, and loneliness; and conducted qualitative thematic analysis of participants' outdoor experiences. Among urban residents, depression and anxiety were inversely associated with the number of neighborhood parks. Thematic analysis identified diverse engagement in greenspaces that boosted physical, mental, and social well-being.

"Psychometric validity and measurement invariance of the caring for Bliss Scale in the Philippines and the United States","The Caring for Bliss Scale (CBS) is a new measure that assesses an individuals' capacity to cultivate inner joy and happiness. Developed in the United States, its generalizability remains unknown in non-Western contexts. This research explored the scale's cross-national invariance among college students in the Philippines (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°546) and the United States (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°643). A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis using maximum likelihood estimation showed that the unidimensional model of caring for bliss exhibited configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance across the Filipino and the U.S. samples. This scale also had good internal consistency estimates in both settings. In both contexts, caring for bliss was positively correlated with well-being and negatively correlated with different negative quality of life indicators (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depression). This study offered preliminary evidence regarding the cross-national applicability of the CBS in different cultural settings during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Datu, Fincham, Buenconsejo","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2076562","20220527","Caring for Bliss Scale; Philippines; United States; cross-cultural invariance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32013,""
"A suicide prevention initiative across a multi-campus university before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Increasing rates of depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among college students were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This report describes how components of the Johns Hopkins Suicide Prevention Awareness, Response and Coordination (JH-SPARC) Project aligned with a multi-faceted strategy for suicide prevention. Key programs included suicide screening, gatekeeper trainings, and the use of third-party mental health services. Regarding suicide screening outcomes, staff sent 36,148 individual emails inviting students and trainees to participate in stress and depression screening. This approach garnered 2,634 responses and connected 130 students to care, 66 of whom (50.8%) indicated suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. We estimate this screening cost $2.97 per student. Important lessons included the reliance on virtual platforms and the need to coordinate efforts across multiple campuses. Our manuscript provides an example of a transferable strategy for suicide prevention on college campuses in the pandemic era.","Aluri, Lewis, Torres, Wilcox","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2076563","20220527","COVID-19; Clinical medicine; counseling; mental health; suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32014,""
"Relationship of compassion for self and others to sense of well-being of college students","<b>Objective:</b> The mental health issues among college students have increased significantly in recent years. The primary purpose of this study was to explore and describe the relationship between self-compassion, compassion for others, and a sense of well-being among undergraduate college students. <b>Participants:</b> This study surveyed N = 651 college students aged 18-24 years at an urban university in the Northeast. <b>Methods:</b> Students completed an online survey through Survey Monkey that was comprised of questions about their selfcompassion, compassion for others, and overall sense of well-being. <b>Results:</b> The results indicate that self-compassion, compassion for others, and sense of well-being are positively related. Exploratory tests for sex differences showed that females reported having significantly higher compassion for others while males reported having substantially higher self-compassion. <b>Conclusion:</b> The authors discuss the implications of the results and suggest a need for more compassion education programs at institutions of higher education.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among healthcare workers in paediatric intensive care units in China","To perform a mental health evaluation and an early psychological intervention for healthcare workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, an online survey was conducted among 3055 HCWs in the paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) of 62 hospitals in China on March 26, 2020, by the Neurology and Sedation Professional Group, Emergency Department, Paediatrics Branch, Chinese Medical Association. The questionnaire was divided into three parts, including general information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The results show that a total of 970 HCWs (45.99%) were considered to meet the clinical cut-off scores for posttraumatic stress (PTS), and the proportions of participants with mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 39.69%, 36.46% and 17.12%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the psychological impact among HCWs of different genders. Married HCWs were 1.48 times more likely to have PTS than unmarried HCWs (95% Cl: 1.20-1.82, p &lt;0.001). Compared with junior professional title participants, the PTS-positive rate of HCWs with intermediate professional titles was 1.91 times higher (90% Cl: 1.35-2.70, p&lt;0.01). Those who had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were 1.40 times (95% Cl: 1.02-1.92, p &lt;0.05) more likely to have PTS than those who did not have contact with COVID-19 cases or did not know the relevant conditions. For depression, the proportion of HCWs with intermediate professional titles was significantly higher, at 1.65 times (90% Cl: 1.17-2.33, p &lt;0.01) that of those with junior professional titles. The depression of HCWs at work during the epidemic was 1.56 times that of HCWs on vacation (95% Cl: 1.03-2.37, p &lt;0.05), and their anxiety was 1.70 times greater (95% Cl: 1.10-2.63, p &lt;0.05). Participants who had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases had more pronounced anxiety, 1.40 times that of those who did not have contact with COVID-19 cases or did not know the relevant conditions (95% Cl: 1.02-1.92, p &lt;0.05). There was no significant correlation between the variables and the positive results of stress symptoms. In total, 45.99%, 39.69%, 36.46% and 17.12% of PICU HCWs were affected by PTS, depression, anxiety and stress, respectively, to varying degree. Married status, intermediate professional titles and exposure history were independent risk factors for PTS. Intermediate professional titles and going to work during the epidemic were independent risk factors for depression, and going to work and exposure history during the epidemic were independent risk factors for anxiety. In the face of public health emergencies, HCWs not only specialize in paediatric intensive care but also, as a high-risk group, must actively take preventive measures and use mitigation strategies.","Zhang, Pi, Liu, Li, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265377","20220527","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32018,""
"Changes in the Mental Health Indicators and Training Opportunities for Estonian Elite Athletes Compared to the COVID-19 Isolation Period","<i>Background</i>: In spring 2020, two-thirds of Estonian elite athletes had symptoms of emotional distress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health indicators and training opportunities for elite Estonian athletes a year after the complete COVID-19 isolation period compared to June 2020. <i>Methods</i>: In both cross-sectional studies, athletes completed self-reported questionnaires, including the Emotional State Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, <i>t</i>-tests, and Chi2 tests were applied to compare the study groups (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). <i>Results</i>: A total of 172 out of approximately 600 elite Estonian athletes participated in the survey (102 in 2020 and 70 in 2021). More than a year after the COVID-19 lockdown period, the mental health problems of elite athletes (particularly the symptoms of depression and fatigue) are even greater concern than in June 2020, despite the recovery in training conditions and competition. Of all of the subjects, 80% had high levels of distress in 2021 compared to 36% in 2020. According to the athletes, the availability of health care services was good (78.6%), but there was a lack of close cooperation with the coach. However, the athletes considered their coaches to be their main supporters, along with their family members and partners. Only 4.3% of the respondents considered a sports psychologist to be their main supporter (<i>n</i> = 6). <i>Conclusions</i>: More than a year after the COVID-19 lockdown period, the mental health indicators of Estonian elite athletes were worrisome.

"Associations between Parental Factors and Children's Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea","This study investigated how parental depression, parental self-care, family conflict, and parental fear of COVID-19 are associated with children's screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online among South Korean families, resulting in 246 parents (59% fathers) with children between 6 and 12 years of age. Path analysis and multi-group structural equation modelling of fathers and mothers were conducted. Parent's fear of COVID-19 was positively associated with parental depression. Parent's fear of COVID-19 and parental depression were negatively related to parental self-care, which was negatively linked to family conflict. Family conflict was positively associated with children's screen time. The relationships between parental factors and children's screen time were different for mothers and fathers.

"Anxiety and Depression in Belgium during the First 15 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic and policy measures enacted to contain the spread of the coronavirus have had nationwide psychological effects. This study aimed to assess the impact of the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of anxiety (GAD-7 scale) and depression (PHQ-9 scale) of the Belgian adult population. A longitudinal study was conducted from April 2020 to June 2021, with 1838 respondents participating in 6 online surveys. Linear mixed models were used to model the associations between the predictor variables and the mental health outcomes. Results showed that the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression was higher in times of stricter policy measures. Furthermore, after the initial stress from the outbreak, coping and adjustment were observed in participants, as symptoms of anxiety and depression decreased during times of lower policy restrictions to almost the same level as in pre-COVID times (2018). Though time trends were similar for all population subgroups, higher levels of both anxiety and depression were generally found among women, young people, people with poor social support, extraverts, people having pre-existing psychological problems, and people who were infected/exposed to the COVID-19 virus.

"Depressive and anxious symptoms among young adults in the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from monitoring the future","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is associated with worsening mental health among young adults, but further research is necessary to quantify the associations with depression and anxiety. Using Monitoring the Future data (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1244 young adults, modal age: 19, Fall 2020 supplement), we examined internalizing symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 separately), dividing the sample into those without clinically significant scores, significant scores but minimal pandemic-attributed symptoms, and significant scores with substantial pandemic-attributed symptoms. Logistic regression analyses linked demographic factors, pandemic-related experiences, and coping methods to symptom groups. Internalizing symptoms were highly prevalent, with many occurring among a majority at least several days over the past 2 weeks. Major changes in education, employment, and resource availability predicted elevated symptom risk (e.g., lacking a place to sleep or money for rent, gas, or food led to 4.43 [95% confidence interval: 2.59-7.55] times the risk of high depressive symptoms significantly attributed to the pandemic). High internalizing symptoms were linked to underutilization of healthy coping behaviors, substance use overutilization, and dietary changes. High depressive and anxious symptoms attributed to the pandemic were marked by high levels of taking breaks from the news/social media and contacting healthcare providers. The pandemic's associations with young adults' depressive and anxious symptoms warrants urgent attention through improved mental health treatment infrastructure and stronger structural support.","Kreski, Keyes, Parks, Patrick","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23273","20220527","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32022,""
"Resilience and post-traumatic growth in the transition to motherhood during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative exploratory study","Most perinatal research relating to COVID-19 focuses on its negative impact on maternal and parental mental health. Currently, there are limited data on how to optimise positive health during the pandemic. We aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring how women have adapted to becoming a new parent during the pandemic and to identify elements of resilience and growth within their narratives. Mothers of infants under the age of 4 months were recruited as part of a wider UK mixed-methods study. Semi-structured interviews with 20 mothers elicited data about how COVID-19 had influenced their transition to parent a new infant, and if and how they adapted during the pandemic, what strategies they used, and if and how these had been effective. Directed qualitative content analysis was undertaken, and pre-existing theoretical frameworks of resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) were used to analyse and interpret the data set. The findings show evidence of a range of resilience and PTG concepts experienced during the pandemic in this cohort. Salient resilience themes included personal (active coping, reflective functioning, and meaning-making), relational (social support, partner relationships, and family relationships), and contextual (health and social connectedness) factors. There was also evidence of PTG in terms of the potential for new work-related and leisure opportunities, and women developing wider and more meaningful connections with others. Although further research is needed, and with individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, these findings emphasise the significance of social support and connectivity as vital to positive mental health. Opportunities to increase digital innovations to connect and support new parents should be maximised to buffer the negative impacts of further social distancing and crisis situations.","Thomson, Cook, Nowland, Donnellan, Topalidou, Jackson, Fallon","https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.13087","20220527","COVID-19; growth; perinatal; qualitative; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32023,""
"Excess suicides in Brazil: Inequalities according to age groups and regions during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed more than six million direct deaths. Low-and middle-income countries, such Brazil, were severely hit, not only due to direct effects on mortality, but also for its indirect effects on other causes of deaths. The objective of this study was to estimate the excess suicides in Brazil and evaluate patterns within and between its regions during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The observed suicides are gathered from the mortality information system of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The estimates of expected suicides, according to sex, age group, bimonthly period and region, were reached through quasi-Poisson generalized additive models, with adjustment for overdispersion. The analyses were performed in R software, version 3.6.1 and RStudio, version 1.2.1335. From March 2020 to December 2020, 10,409 suicides were observed in Brazil, resulting in an overall decrease of 13%, in comparison to the expected rate for the period. There were excess suicides of 26% in men from the Northern region in the 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and more age group, as well as in women from the Northern region in the 30 to 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years age group in two consecutive bimonthly periods.

"The Effect of COVID-19-Related Lifestyle Changes on Depression","This study aimed to identify the effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related lifestyle changes on depression. This secondary data analysis study included 229,269 adults from a community health survey conducted in the South Korea in 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire about participants' lifestyle changes related to COVID-19 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The data were analyzed using a complex sample independent t-test, analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. The mean age of the participants was 48.76; 49.6% were male, and 50.4% were female. The multiple regression showed that depression increased due to COVID-19-related lifestyle changes (physical activity, sleep duration, consumption of convenience foods, alcohol consumption, smoking, and use of public transportation). The explanatory power was 27.3%, and the model was suitable (Wald F=63.75, p&lt;0.001). This study identified the effect of COVID-19-related lifestyle changes on depression, and the results have implications for future depression-relieving interventions.","Kim, Park, Nho","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0381","20220527","COVID-19; Depression; Life style; Population health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32025,""
"Effect of Parental Perception on the Prevalence of Adolescent Internet Gaming Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have found that Internet usage and gaming times have increased among adolescents. Parents' Internet literacy and attitudes toward Internet gaming have been reported to affect children's Internet gaming disorder (IGD). We hypothesized that parents' attitudes toward Internet use and gaming would affect the prevalence of IGD among adolescents. A total of 199 mothers of children who played Internet games were surveyed online to gather information regarding their demographic characteristics, children's Internet use patterns, psychological factors, and Internet gaming literacy. Among adolescents, increased Internet usage or gaming time was not associated with IGD, but the presence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was. Among parents, anxiety, depression, and family togetherness were not related to IGD, but a positive perception of gaming protected against the development of IGD, whereas a negative perception was a risk factor for IGD. Increased gaming time neither causes nor correlates with IGD in adolescents, even though ADHD may be a risk factor for IGD. Parents' positive or negative perceptions of gaming can be protective or present a risk factor, respectively, for their children's development of IGD.","Lee, Yoo, Son, Kim, Han","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0260","20220527","Coronavirus; Internet game literacy scale; Internet gaming disorder; Parent; Perception; Risk factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32026,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Disease Spectrum of Pediatric Intensive Care Units","We aimed to analyze the changes in the disease spectrum data of a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in Nanjing, China, during the COVID-19 outbreak and explore a feasible plan for the treatment of critically ill children. This retrospective study used data from our PICU from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. Patient demographics, distribution of disease spectrum, results of etiological examinations, and the PICU length of stay (LOS) were compared during the COVID-19 period (2020) and the previous years (2018 and 2019). In 2020, the number of PICU admissions was 46.8 and 47.8% lower than that in 2018 and 2019, respectively. There were significant differences in the number of patients in PICU among different age groups, and these differences were mainly found in children aged &lt;4 years and older than 14 years. The percentage of the number of patients in PICU with respiratory diseases decreased significantly, while those with hematological diseases, poisoning, and rare diseases increased significantly. Moreover, the number of patients with rare diseases increased significantly, while the number of patients with mitochondrial diseases exceeded that of those with autoimmune encephalitis. The PICU LOS in 2020 was higher than that observed in 2018 and 2019, indicating that the changes in the PICU disease spectrum did not directly affect the PICU LOS. Etiological examinations revealed that during the COVID-19 period, the number of patients in PICU with bacterial infections increased, and those with viral infections decreased, although not statistically significant. A striking decrease in the number of PICU admissions was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak, which caused a significant change in the PICU disease spectrum. Changes in the number and characteristics of patients admitted to PICUs should be considered for facilitating the effective working of PICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Xue, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.801255","20220527","COVID-19 outbreak; PICU admissions; PICU length of stay; coronavirus disease; distribution of disease spectrum; patient demographics; pediatric intensive care unit; result of etiological examination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32027,""
"Innovative virtual care delivery in a Canadian paediatric tertiary-care centre","Health care systems and providers have rapidly adapted to virtual care delivery during this unprecedented time. Clinical programs initiated a variety of virtual care delivery models to maintain access to care, preserve personal protective equipment, and minimize infectious disease spread. Herein, we first describe the context within paediatric health delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada that fueled the rise of virtual care delivery. We then summarize the development, implementation, and beneficial impact of the innovative virtual care delivery programs currently in use at Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) for both inpatient and outpatient care, specifically in our ambulatory clinics, emergency department, and mental health program. We highlight the transferable unique ways CHEO has integrated virtual care delivery through our governance structure, stakeholder engagement including patient, caregivers and health care providers and staff, development, and use of eHealth tools and novel approaches for patient care requiring physical assessment. We conclude with our vision for the future of virtual care, one component of paediatric care delivery in the post-COVID-19 era, which requires a common framework for virtual care evaluation. Importantly, rapid implementation of a primarily virtual care model at CHEO sustained high volume quality paediatric care. We believe many of these programs should and will remain in the post-pandemic era. A comprehensive, unified approach to evaluation is essential to yield meaningful results that inform sustainable care delivery models that integrate virtual care, and ultimately help ensure the best health outcomes for our patients.","Goldbloom, Buba, Bhatt, Suntharalingam, King","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab104","20220527","COVID-19; Delivery of health care; Paediatrics; Telemedicine; Virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32028,""
"Return to school and mask-wearing in class during the COVID-19 pandemic: Student perspectives from a school simulation study","This study examined children's perspectives about returning to in-person school following lockdown due to the pandemic and about mask-wearing in class, as well as the mental health of children and parents during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was part of a 2-day school simulation exercise that randomized students to different masking recommendations. Parent-report of mental health and post-simulation child-report of COVID-19-related anxiety and mask-wearing were analyzed using descriptive and multiple regression analyses. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with older students to supplement questionnaire data. Of 190 students in this study, 31% were in grade 4 or lower 95% looked forward to returning to in-person school. Greater child anxiety about COVID-19 was predicted by increased parent/caregiver anxiety (ÃŽÂ²=0.67; P&lt;0.001), and lower parental educational attainment (ÃŽÂ²=1.86; P&lt;0.002). Older students were more likely than younger students to report that mask-wearing interfered with their abilities to interact with peers (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(1)=31.16; P&lt;0.001) and understand the teacher (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(1)=13.97; P&lt;0.001).

"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the mental and physical health of children enrolled in a paediatric weight management clinic","Obesity is a global public health concern. Given the widespread disruption caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to evaluate its impact on children with chronic health conditions. This study examines the health of paediatric patients with obesity enrolled in a tertiary hospital weight management program, before and 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective chart review of patients aged 2 to 17 years enrolled in a paediatric weight management clinic. Mental health outcomes (i.e., new referrals to psychologist, social work, eating disorder program, incidence of dysregulated eating, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm) and physical health (anthropometric measures) were compared before and 1 year into the pandemic. Among the 334 children seen in either period, there was an increase in referrals to psychologist (12.4% versus 26.5%; P=0.002) and the composite mental health outcome (17.2% versus 30.2%; P=0.005) during the pandemic compared with pre-pandemic. In a subset of children (n=30) with anthropometric measures in both periods, there was a lower rate of decline in BMIz score (-1.5 [2.00] versus -0.3 [0.73]/year; P=0.002) and an increase in adiposity (-0.8 [4.64] versus 2.7 [5.54]%/year; P=0.043) during the pandemic. The pandemic has impacted the mental and physical health of children with obesity engaged in a weight management clinic. While our study provides evidence of a negative impact on mental health outcomes and less improvement in anthropometric measures, future research when patients return to in-person care will enable further examination of our findings with additional objective measures.","Nsamenang, Gutierrez, Manayathu Jones, Jenkins, Tibelius, DiGravio, Chamas, Ewusie, Geddie, Punthakee, Samaan, Wahi, Morrison","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxac014","20220527","COVID-19; Children; Mental health; Obesity; Physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32030,""

"Mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with underlying health and disability issues, and their families and health care providers","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health at a population level. Families of children with health vulnerabilities have been disproportionately affected by pandemic-related policies and service disruptions as they substantially rely on the health and social care system. We elicited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with health and disability-related vulnerabilities, their families, and their health care providers (HCPs). Children with diverse health vulnerabilities (cardiac transplantation, respiratory conditions, sickle cell disease, autism spectrum disorder, mental health issues, and nearing the end of life due to a range of underlying causes), as well as their parents and HCPs, participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis in determining themes related to impact and recommendations for practice improvement. A total of 262 participants (30 children, 76 parents, 156 HCPs) were interviewed. Children described loneliness and isolation; parents described feeling burnt out; and HCPs described strain and a sense of moral distress. Themes reflected mental health impacts on children, families, and HCPs, with insufficient resources to support mental health; organizational and policy influences that shaped service delivery; and recommendations to enhance service delivery. Children with health vulnerabilities, their families and HCPs incurred profound mental health impacts due to pandemic-imposed public health restrictions and care shifts. Recommendations include the development and application of targeted pandemic information and mental health supports. These findings amplify the need for capacity building, including proactive strategies and mitigative planning in the event of a future pandemic.","Nicholas, Zulla, Conlon, Dimitropoulos, Urschel, Rapoport, Katz, Bruce, West, Belletrutti, Cullen, Zwaigenbaum","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab103","20220527","COVID-19; Health challenges; Mental health; Paediatric; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32033,""
"Challenges and coping strategies of online learning for college students in the context of COVID-19: A survey of Chinese universities","The COVID-19 epidemic has disrupted the normal teaching and learning in universities, which poses significant challenges to higher education. The traditional face-to-face learning mode has been switched to online (distance) learning, causing various influences on students' academic performance, physical and psychological well-being. As higher education plays a central role in technology innovation and society development, it is of great importance to investigate and improve online learning in the context of COVID-19. This study distributed online questionnaires to undergraduate and postgraduate students from 30 provinces or municipalities in China (covering 88% of the whole country). Results indicate that online learning mode is more likely to reduce the academic performance of lower-grade students (e.g., freshman and sophomore). The learning environment could be one of essential factors affecting the academic performance during online education. Studying at home or dormitory is more evidently correlated with academic performance decline. Regarding the physical and mental health during online learning, most students had experienced eye strain (84%) and cervical stiff (79%), while anxiety is the most prominent mental issue (66% of occurrence). Several coping strategies are suggested to improve the online learning in post-pandemic era, which is essential for higher education and promoting a civilized and sustainable society.","Li, Che","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.103958","20220527","COVID-19, Civilized society; Higher education; Online learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32034,""
"A new RT-LAMP-on-a-Chip Instrument for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics","This work describes the development of a Point-of-Care (POC) Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) instrument for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The hardware is based on a Raspberry Pi computer ($35), a video camera, an Arduino Nano microcontroller, a printed circuit board as a heater and a 3D printed housing. The chips were manufactured in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) using a CO2 laser cutting machine and sealed with a PCR optic plastic film. The chip temperature is precisely controlled by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm. During the RT-LAMP amplifications the chip was maintained at Ã¢Ë†Â¼ (65.0 Ã‚Â± 0.1) Ã‚Â°C for 25 minutes and 5 minutes cooling down, totaling a 30 minutes of reaction .The software interpretation occurs in less than a second. The chip design has four 25 Ã‚ÂµL chambers, two for clinical samples and two for positive and negative control-samples. The RT-LAMP master mix solution added in the chip chambers contains the pH indicator Phenol Red, that is pink (for pH Ã¢Ë†Â¼ 8.0) before amplification and becomes yellow (pH Ã¢Ë†Â¼ 6.0) if the genetic material is amplified. The RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic was made by color image recognition using the OpenCV machine vision software library. The software was programmed to automatically distinguish the HSV color parameter distribution in each one of the four chip chambers. The instrument was successfully tested for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, in 22 clinic samples, 11 positives and 11 negatives, achieving an assertiveness of 86% when compared to the results obtained by RT-LAMP standard reactions performed in conventional PCR equipment.","Torezin MendonÃƒÂ§a, Cassaboni Stracke, de Oliveira Coelho, Bruna Soligo Sanchuki, Klassen de Oliveira, Klerynton Marchini, LucÃƒÂ­ola Zanette, NÃƒÂ³brega Aoki, Ribeiro Viana, Blanes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2022.107600","20220527","COVID-19; LAMP-on-a-chip; OpenCV; Raspberry Pi; SARS-CoV-2; diagnostic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32035,""
"Exacerbation and severity of allergic symptoms during pregnancy and their impact on mental health","Pregnant women with allergies face difficulties, as they tend to avoid medication for symptom control during pregnancy. Moreover, some women experience exacerbations during this period. These difficulties can affect their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing allergy exacerbations during pregnancy and examine the effects of allergy symptoms on the mental health of pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted through web-based research in March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnant women were collected from 3 groups (target: 150 participants in each group): atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis, and without allergies. We evaluated mental health using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and health-related quality of life using the Short Form-8 questionnaire. Overall, 202 (49.1%) of 411 pregnant women had depressive symptoms, and 45 (10.9%) had severe depressive symptoms. Women with allergies had significantly worse mental health than those without allergies. Among 119 AD patients, 36 (30.3%) experienced exacerbations during pregnancy. Of them, 11 (30.6%) did not consult a practitioner and endured the exacerbation. A significant association was observed between severe prepregnancy symptoms, job situation, coping with symptoms of AD during pregnancy, and AD exacerbation. Among 210 rhinitis patients, 17.1% experienced rhinitis exacerbation during pregnancy. The presence of rhinitis symptoms in winter and the second trimester was significantly associated with exacerbation.

"Mental Health Among Medical Students During COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The mental health of medical students is an issue worthy of attention, especially during COVID-19. Many studies have shown that depression and anxiety are the main problems faced by medical students. To assess the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. According to PRISMA, we used a computerized strategy to search studies in EMBASE, PubMed, PsycArticles, Web of Science, and China Biology Medicine disc. The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was calculated by a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analysis. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also carried out in this meta-analysis. Of 1316 studies, 41 studies were selected based on 36608 medical students. The pooled depression prevalence was 37.9% (95% CI: 30.7-45.4%), and pooled anxiety prevalence was 33.7% (95% CI: 26.8-41.1%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students varied by gender, country, and continent. The data reported that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students during COVID-19 was relatively higher than those of the general population and the healthcare workers. The impact of COVID-19 on medical students and how to protect the mental health of medical students are needed to determine through further research.

"The Impact of Social Isolation Due to COVID-19 on Symptom Progression in People With Dementia: Findings of the SOLITUDE Study","People with dementia (PWD) are vulnerable to abrupt changes to daily routines. The lockdown enforced on the 23rd of March 2020 in the UK to contain the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic limited opportunities for PWD to access healthcare services and socialise. The SOLITUDE study explored the potential long-term effects of lockdown on PWD's symptoms and carers' burden. Forty-five carers and 36 PWD completed a telephone-based assessment at recruitment (T0) and after 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2). PWD completed measures validated for telephonic evaluations of cognition and depression. Carers completed questionnaires on their burden and on PWD's health and answered a customised interview on symptom changes observed in the initial months of lockdown. Longitudinal changes were investigated for all outcome variables with repeated-measures models. Additional <i>post hoc</i> multiple regression analyses were carried out to investigate whether several objective factors (i.e., demographics and time under social restrictions) and carer-reported symptom changes observed following lockdown before T0 were associated with all outcomes at T0. No significant changes were observed in any outcomes over the 6 months of observations. However, <i>post hoc</i> analyses showed that the length of social isolation before T0 was negatively correlated with episodic and semantic memory performance at T0. Carers reporting worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms and faster disease progression in PWD also reported higher burden. Moreover, carer-reported worsening of cognitive symptoms was associated with poorer semantic memory at T0. PWD's symptoms and carers' burden remained stable over 6 months of observation. However, the amount of time spent under social restrictions before T0 appears to have had a significant detrimental impact on cognitive performance of patients. In fact, carer-reported cognitive decline during social isolation was consistent with the finding of poorer semantic memory, a domain sensitive to progression in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the initial stricter period of social isolation had greater detrimental impact on patients and their carers, followed then by a plateau. Future interventions may be designed to maintain an optimal level of social and cognitive engagement for PWD in challenging times, to prevent abrupt worsening of symptoms and associated detrimental consequences on patients' carers.","Manca, De Marco, Colston, Raymont, Amin, Davies, Kumar, Russell, Blackburn, Venneri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.877595","20220527","COVID-19; cognitive decline; dementia; neuropsychiatric symptoms; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32038,""
"Exploring the Longitudinal Relationship Between Lockdown Policy Stringency and Public Negative Emotions Among 120 Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediating Role of Population Mobility","To limit the spread of COVID-19, governments worldwide have implemented a series of lockdown policies to restrict the social activities of people. Although scholars suggest that such policies may produce negative effects on public emotions, the existing research is limited because it only provides a cross-sectional snapshot of the effect of lockdown policies in small and local samples. Using large-scale longitudinal cross-country data, the current study aims to gain a better understanding of the dynamic effect of lockdown policies on public emotions and their underlying mechanisms. Drawing on a large-scale longitudinal data from multiple sources, the study employs fixed-effects models to analyze the association between lagged lockdown policy stringency and public negative emotions among 120 countries from February to July 2020 (<i>N</i> = 9,141 country-day observations). The bootstrapping mediation test is used to examine the mediation effects of increased population mobility in residential areas. The results show a statistically significant and positive association between lagged lockdown policy stringency and general public negative emotion (standardized coefficient = 0.32, CI = 0.30-0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). This pattern remains similar to other specific negative emotions, such as depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and helplessness. Moreover, the negative health effects of lockdown policy stringency are significantly mediated by increased mobility in residential areas (51-74% points, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The findings confirm that stringent lockdown policies have a negative effect on public emotions via confining population mobility residential areas. To tackle the COVID-19, future public health policies should pay more attention to the unintended negative consequences of lockdown measures on public emotions.","Gong, Ju, Zhu, Wang, Guo, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.753703","20220527","COVID-19; lockdown policies; population mobility; public emotions; public health policies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32039,""

This prospective cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary university hospital from August 31, 2020 to March 29, 2021 with adult patients followed at 6 and 12 months after acute COVID-19 symptom onset or diagnosis. Clinical characteristics, self-reported symptoms, EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level (EQ5D-5L) index scores, Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Korean version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5-K), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were investigated. Symptom persistent or non-persistent groups were defined according to persistency of COVID-19 related symptoms or signs after acute COVID-19 infection, respectively. Of all 235 patients, 170 (64.6%) patients were eligible for analysis. The median age was 51 (interquartile range, 37-61) years old, and 102 patients were female (60.0%). After 12 months from acute COVID-19 infection, in total, 83 (48.8%) patients still suffered from COVID-19-related symptoms. The most common symptoms included amnesia (24.1%), insomnia (14.7%), fatigue (13.5%), and anxiety (12.9%). Among the five EQ5D-5L categories, the average value of anxiety or depression was the most predominant. PHQ-9 and PCL-5-K scores were statistically higher in the COVID-19-related symptom persistent group than the non-persistent group (<i>p</i>=0.001). However, GAD-7 scores showed no statistical differences between the two groups (<i>p</i>=0.051). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were the major COVID-19-related symptoms after 12 months from acute COVID-19 infection, reducing quality of life.","Kim, Kim, Chang, Kwon, Hwang, Bae","https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2022.63.6.499","20220527","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; health-related quality of life; life quality; long COVID; long-term consequences; persistent symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32040,""
"Children and adolescents' emotional problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","Brazil has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with one of the largest numbers of youth impacted by school closure globally. This longitudinal online survey assessed emotional problems in children and adolescents aged 5-17Ã‚Â years living in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment occurred between June to November 2020 and participants were invited for follow-up assessments every 15Ã‚Â days until June 2021. Participants were 5795 children and adolescents living across the country with mean age of 10.7 (SD 3.63) years at recruitment; 50.5% were boys and 69% of white ethnicity. Weighted prevalence rates of anxiety, depressive and total emotional symptoms at baseline were 29.7%, 36.1% and 36%, respectively. Longitudinal analysis included 3221 (55.6%) participants and revealed fluctuations in anxiety and depressive symptoms during one year follow-up, associated with periods of social mobility and mortality. Emotional problems significantly increased in July and September 2020 and decreased from December 2020 to February 2021 and then significantly increased in May 2021 relative to June 2020. Older age, feeling lonely, previous diagnosis of mental or neurodevelopmental disorder, previous exposure to traumatic events or psychological aggression, parental psychopathology, and sleeping less than 8/h a day were associated with increased rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline and over time. Food insecurity and less social contact with family and peers were associated with baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms, and lowest socio-economic strata, chronic disease requiring treatment and family members physically ill due to COVID-19 were associated with increasing rates over time. The pandemic severely affected youth, particularly those from vulnerable populations and in moments of increased mortality and decreased social mobility. Results underscore the need for allocation of resources to services and the continuous monitoring of mental health problems among children and adolescents.","Zuccolo, Casella, Fatori, Shephard, Sugaya, Gurgel, Farhat, Argeu, Teixeira, Otoch, Polanczyk","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02006-6","20220526","Adolescents; Anxiety; Brazil; COVID-19; Children; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32041,""
"Mental Health Status of Migrant Nepalese Workers Rescued By Government of Nepal During the Corona Virus disease -19 Pandemic","The corona virus pandemic rapidly sweeps across the world; it is inducing a considerable degree of depression, stress and anxiety concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as migrant workers. The aim of the study is to find out mental health status of migrant workers rescued by Nepal Government from different countries during corona virus disease -19-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional descriptive study involving 427 returned migrant workers was conducted using the depression, anxiety and stress scale -21(DASS-21). Association between socio-demographic variables to mental health status was performed using chi-square test and p-value &lt;0.05 was considered as significant level. Out of 427 participants, 4 % of respondents found to have extremely severe level of stress followed by 1.9 % extremely severe level of depression and 2.3% extremely severe level of anxiety. The association between mental health status and covariates showed that depression, anxiety and stress were associated with the place of residence, educational status of the respondents, and their perception of corona virus disease -19 risk at workplace, and test for COVID-19 after arrival to Nepal. The study revealed that job loss, visa and employment contract expiry were the main reasons for migrant workers to return Nepal. Nearly one fourth of the respondents had suffered from depression, nearly one third from stress and 17% from anxiety. Necessary psychosocial interventions should be formulated and implemented for addressing the mental health problems of migrant workers during the corona virus disease -19-19 pandemic.","Kaphle, Karmacharya, Khadka, Shrestha, Adhikari","https://doi.org/10.33314/jnhrc.v19i04.3552","20220527","Government of Nepal; mental health status; migrant workers.; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Government; Health Status; Humans; Nepal; Pandemics; Transients and Migrants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","",32042,""

"Exploration of a Large-Scale Dataset to Understand the Link of Social Interaction with Psychological Problems Amid Mild Lockdown for COVID-19","Aim: The difference in effectiveness of online and offline interactions to overcome psychological problems is unexplored for groups like female, older, health worker and mental health treatment takers. Moreover, the link of psychological problems of the social interactors is not investigated which could be insightful for clinical intervention. The aim of this study is to fill these research gaps. Subject and Methods: We explored a large dataset having 11,333 Japanese peoplesâ€™ data amid the mild lockdown in 2020. To assess psychological problems, we used well-established and clinically validated scales. To compare between groups, we did the T-test and Mann-Whitney U Test and to explore links between variables, we built a Bayesian consensus network by bootstrapping data 10,000 times. Results: We find lower loneliness, depression, and psychological distress among the social interactors. However, interaction effectiveness appears to vary by psychological problem. Compared to only offline interactors, only online interactors have a lower loneliness, larger social network, and also higher COVID anxiety (p<.05). On the other hand, offline interactors have lower depression, psychological distress, and higher healthy sleep (p<.05). Surprisingly, despite doing both types of interaction, 54% of the mental health treatment takers are depressed which is higher than other groups. We also find varying links among psychological problems, lifestyle, and stressors depending on the interaction and people. Conclusions: Our findings suggest there is no single mode of interaction which can be effective universally for all people. Therefore, support to overcome psychological problems should be centered around peopleâ€™s specific needs and problems.","Md.
