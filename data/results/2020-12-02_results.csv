"Giving birth under hospital visitor restrictions: Heightened acute stress in childbirth in COVID-19 positive women","As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread globally, a significant portion of women have undergone childbirth while possibly infected with the virus and also under social isolation due to hospital visitor restrictions. Emerging studies examined birth outcomes in COVID-19 positive women, but knowledge of the psychological experience of childbirth remains lacking. This study survey concerning childbirth and mental health launched during the first wave of the pandemic in the US. Women reporting confirmed/suspected COVID-19 during childbirth were matched on various background factors with women reporting COVID-19 negative. We found higher prevalence of clinically significant acute stress in birth in COVID-19 positive women. This group was 11 times as likely to have no visitors than matched controls and reported higher levels of pain in delivery, lower newborn weights, and more infant admission to neonatal intensive care units. Visitor restrictions were associated with these birth outcomes. COVID-19 positive women with no visitors were 6 times as likely to report clinical acute stress in birth than COVID-19 positive women with visitors. The findings underscore increased risk for childbirth-induced psychological morbidity in COVID-19-affected populations. As hospitals continue to revise policies concerning visitor restrictions, attention to the wellbeing of new mothers is warranted.","Gus Mayopoulos; Tsachi Ein-Dor; Kevin G Li; Sabrina J Chan; Sharon Dekel","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.30.20241026","20201202","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7725,""
"Interest and readiness for digital mental health in coordinate specialty care for early course psychosis: A survey study of 42 programs in 30 states","As in-person healthcare services become suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for digital technologies to augment early course psychosis care has risen. Although technology offers many benefits including increasing access to care, the advantages of such tools are restricted by their implementation into the program. The goal of this study is to better understand the current usage of technology, clinical needs, and digital literacy in Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs. An online survey of CSC staff and clinicians assessed their attitudes, preparedness, and comfort with technology implementation into care. In total, 42 programs from 30 states responded to the web-based survey. Of the six key roles of CSC, the role believed to be most capable for technology to augment was Family Education and Support by 90% (38/42) of participants. Eighty-two per cent (34/42) of clinicians and staff felt that they would benefit from and have interest in receiving digital skills training (41% [17/42] strongly agree, 41% [17/42] agreed). Evaluation of respondent sentiments towards technology revealed that 70 per cent (29/42) (&quot;agree&quot;, or &quot;strongly agree&quot;) believe that technology can integrate into care easily. Survey responses show overall positive sentiments towards technology implementation in early psychosis care. Findings also reveal that the digital tool would be better sustained if CSC staff and clinicians received digital skills education. This survey demonstrates that technology can augment early psychosis care while improving quality of care and expanding access to care.","Camacho, Torous","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13073","20201201","coordinated speciality care; digital tools; first-episode psychosis; mobile apps; smartphones","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7726,""
"Deep brain stimulation telemedicine programming during the COVID-19 pandemic: treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has considerably affected the delivery of postoperative care to patients who have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS teleprogramming technology was developed and deployed in China before the COVID-19 outbreak. In this report, the authors share their experiences with telemedical DBS treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. Four patients (2 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 1 with major depressive disorder, and 1 with anorexia nervosa) underwent DBS surgery at Ruijin Hospital and received continuous postoperative DBS telemedicine case management from January 2020 to July 2020. DBS teleprogramming, individualized psychological support, and medical consultations were provided via the authors' DBS telemedicine platform, which also incorporated a synchronous real-time video communication system. Forty-five DBS telemedicine sessions were conducted; there was no unexpected loss of network connection during the sessions. Of these, 28 sessions involved DBS teleprogramming. Adjustments were made to the stimulation voltage, frequency, pulse width, and contact site in 21, 12, 9, and 9 sessions, respectively. Psychological support and troubleshooting were provided during the remaining telemedicine sessions. Modest to substantial clinical improvements after DBS surgery were observed in some but not all patients, whereas stimulation-related side effects were reported by 2 patients and included reversible sleep and mood problems, headache, and a sensation of heat. DBS telemedicine seems to offer a feasible, safe, and efficient strategy for maintaining the delivery of medical care to psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors propose that implementation of a comprehensive DBS telemedicine system, which combines DBS teleprogramming with psychological counseling, medical consultations, and medication prescriptions and delivery, could be an efficient and effective approach to manage the mental health and quality of life of patients with psychiatric disorders during future local or global public health crises.","Lin, Zhang, Zhang, Dai, Voon, Li, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.FOCUS20666","20201201","COVID-19; case management; deep brain stimulation; psychiatric disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7727,""
"Pediatric neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: update and recommendations from the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a potentially severe respiratory illness that has threatened humanity globally. The pediatric neurosurgery practice differs from that of adults in that it treats children in various stages of physical and psychological development and contemplates diseases that do not exist in other areas. The aim of this study was to identify the level of knowledge and readiness of the healthcare providers, as well as to evaluate new preventive practices that have been introduced, psychological concerns, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric neurosurgical units in Brazil. Pediatric neurosurgeons were given an online questionnaire developed by the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their clinical practice. Of a cohort of 110 active members of the Brazilian Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery, 76 completed the survey (69%). Ninety-six percent were aware of the correct use of and indication for the types of personal protective equipment in clinical and surgical practices, but only 73.7% of them had unrestricted access to this equipment. Ninety-eight percent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the pandemic had affected their pediatric neurosurgical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with outpatient care in 88% of the centers, it affected neurosurgical activity in 90.7%, and it led to the cancellation of elective neurosurgical procedures in 57.3%. Concerning the impact of COVID-19 on surgical activity, 9.2% of the centers had less than 25% of the clinical practice affected, 46.1% had 26%-50% of their activity reduced, 35.5% had a 51%-75% reduction, and 9.2% had more than 75% of their surgical work cancelled or postponed. Sixty-three percent affirmed that patients had been tested for COVID-19 before surgery. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of those interviewed, 3.9% reported fear and anxiety with panic episodes, 7.9% had worsening of previous anxiety symptoms, 60.5% reported occasional fear, 10.5% had sadness and some depressive symptoms, and 2.6% reported depressive symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare services worldwide, including neurosurgical units. Medical workers, pediatric neurosurgeons included, should be aware of safety measures and follow the recommendations of local healthcare organizations, preventing and controlling the disease. Attention should be given to the psychological burden of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers, which carries a high risk of anxiety and depression.","Ballestero, Furlanetti, de Oliveira","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.FOCUS20703","20201201","COVID-19; pandemic; pediatric neurosurgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7728,""
"Mental Health Impacts From COVID-19 and the Necessary Public Health Measures","Coronavirus-19 erupted in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly spreading globally until it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. With no known treatment in place, the world could only respond with symptom management and public health measures to contain the spread of the lethal virus. In its wake, both the pandemic and the interventions have left a significant negative impact on the mental health of the population that may rise to its own level of epidemic. Exploration and recognition of the various factors involved in creating this impact can assist in identifying both strengths and areas in need of more formal intervention. Treatment modalities range from resiliency techniques to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to pharmacotherapy. Assessment and monitoring over time for lasting sequelae will be important for all healthcare disciplines.","Rea","https://doi.org/10.1097/NUR.0000000000000565","20201201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7729,""
"Effects of online and recovery-oriented peer support groups facilitated by Peer Support Workers in times of COVID-19: Protocol for a feasibility study of a trial","In times of pandemics, social distancing, isolation and quarantine have precipitated depression, anxiety and substance misuse. Scientific literature suggests that patients living with mental health problems or illnesses (MHPIs) who interact with Peer Support Workers (PSWs) will not only feel the empathy and connectedness that comes from similar life experiences, but that this interaction also fosters hope in the possibility of a recovery. However, it is the effect of mental health teams or programs where there are PSWs that has been evaluated. Data will be collected for a future Randomized Controlled Trial by determining an effect size that would be specifically attributable to PSWs. The five principal research questions are whether this online intervention will have an impact in terms of (Q1) personal-civic recovery and (Q2) clinical recovery , (Q3) how these recovery potentials can be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, (Q4) how the lived experience of persons in recovery can be mobilized to cope with such a situation, and (Q5) how sex and gender considerations can be taken into account for the pairing of PSWs with service users, beyond considerations based solely on psychiatric diagnoses or specific MHPIs. Intervention: During the transitional and controlled online peer support groups, PSWs will simulate a typical unformal peer support group. They will have a personal-civic recovery focus, and they will be scripted with a fixed, predetermined duration (a series of 10 weekly 90-minute online workshops). There will be two experimental sub-groups: patients diagnosed with (1) psychotic disorders (n=10), and (2) anxiety or mood disorders (n=10), compared to a control group (n=10). Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Allocation: Randomized Ratio: 2:1. Measures: Several instruments have been developed by clinicians and academics to assess clinical recovery. Based on their life narratives and to assess personal-civic recovery, measurement tools have also been developed through community-based participatory research; for instance the Recovery Assessment Scale and the Citizenship Measure questionnaires (personal-civic recovery). This pre-post research feasibility study of a trial is proposed to evaluate the outcomes on personal-civic recovery (primary outcome); and to assess its effects in terms of clinical recovery and stress- or anxiety-related responses to the COVID-19 (secondary outcomes). The COVID Stress Scales and the measures of personal-civic recovery will be repeated, along with the following measures of clinical recovery: (i) Anxiety State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y6, (ii) Depression Patient Health Questionnaire, (iii) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, (iv) Drug Abuse Screening Test, (v) Psychosis Screening Questionnaire, and (vi) World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Change will be compared between groups from baseline to intervention vs. control group in the study outcome measures using the Student paired sample t test. Results are expected for December 2020. Integrated Knowledge Translation: Study results will provide reliable evidence on a web-based intervention provided by Peer Support Workers. The investigators, with key decision makers and patient partners, will ensure knowledge translation throughout and the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on the Fundamentals of Recovery will be updated with the evidence and new knowledge generated by this feasibility study.

"A Pandemic Crash Course: Learning to Teach Equitably in Synchronous Online Classes","This article describes an equity-focused professional learning community that used the EQUIP observation protocol to provide data analytics to instructors. The learning community met during Spring 2020, and due to the global coronavirus pandemic, it moved online midsemester. This article describes patterns of student participation and how they were impacted in moving online. We found that student participation dropped significantly in moving online, but instructors were able to implement new teaching strategies to increase participation. We document seven concrete strategies that instructors used to promote equitable participation in their online classes and that can be incorporated by biology educators into their online teaching. The strategies were: 1) re-establishing norms, 2) using student names, 3) using breakout rooms, 4) leveraging chat-based participation, 5) using polling software, 6) creating an inclusive curriculum, and 7) cutting content to maintain rigor. In addition, we describe the faculty learning process and how EQUIP data and the learning community environment supported instructors to change their practices.","Reinholz, Stone-Johnstone, White, Sianez, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.20-06-0126","20201201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7731,""
"Evidence of Social and Structural COVID-19 Disparities by Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Race/Ethnicity in an Urban Environment","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread social, psychological, and economic impacts. However, these impacts are not distributed equally: already marginalized populations, specifically racial/ethnic minority groups and sexual and gender minority populations, may be more likely to suffer the effects of COVID-19. The COVID-19 Resiliency Survey was conducted by the city of Chicago to assess the impact of COVID-19 on city residents in the wake of Chicago's initial lockdown, with particular focus on the experiences of minority populations. Chi-square tests of independence were performed to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and impacts on heterosexual vs. sexual minority populations, cisgender vs. gender minority populations, and White vs. racial/ethnic minority subgroups. Marginalized populations experienced significant disparities in COVID-19 exposure, susceptibility, and treatment access, as well as in psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Notably, Black and Latinx populations reported significant difficulties accessing food and supplies (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). Healthcare access disparities were also visible, with Black and Latinx respondents reporting significantly lower levels of access to a provider to see if COVID-19 testing would be appropriate (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013), medical services (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and use of telehealth for mental health services (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Sexual minority respondents reported significantly lower rates of using telehealth for mental health services (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011), and gender minority respondents reported significantly lower levels of primary care provider access (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.016). There are evident COVID-19 disparities experienced in Chicago especially for Black, Latinx, sexual minority, and gender minority groups. A greater focus must be paid to health equity, including providing increased resources and supplies for affected groups, adapting to inequities in the built environment, and ensuring adequate access to healthcare services to ameliorate the burden of COVID-19 on these marginalized populations.","Ruprecht, Wang, Johnson, Xu, Felt, Ihenacho, Stonehouse, Curry, DeBroux, Costa, Phillips Ii","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-020-00497-9","20201201","COVID-19; Health disparities; Pandemic response; Racial/ethnic minority populations; Sexual and gender minority populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7732,""
"Current status of and factors influencing anxiety and depression in front-line medical staff supporting Wuhan in containing the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic","This research aimed to shed light on the relationship between the sociodemographic characteristics of front-line medical workers and their anxiety and depression, to provide the basis and reference for targeted mental health education and for relevant departments to formulate appropriate policies during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study adopted a convenient sampling method and examined the psychological status of 150 front-line medical workers from Zhejiang Province with questionnaire surveys using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale. The participants had severe anxiety and depression; the top three items under the category of anxiety were genitourinary symptoms, behavior at interview, and respiratory symptoms, whereas the top three items under depression were feelings of guilt, weight loss, and retardation. Among all personal data, the following factors influenced anxiety, in decreasing order: degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms, degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected, and the affiliated hospital (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). As for depression, the factors were the degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms and the degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). This study revealed that front-line medical staff presented symptoms of anxiety and depression when dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak and the factors influencing their psychological stress.

Different measures may be implemented to solve this problem.","Li, Sun, Fei, Yu, Chen, Yang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1111/jjns.12398","20201201","anxiety; depression; influencing factors; medical workers; novel coronavirus pneumonia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7733,""
"Different types of physical activity are positively associated with indicators of mental health and psychological wellbeing in rheumatoid arthritis during COVID-19","Nationwide lockdowns during SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can compromise mental health and psychological wellbeing and limit opportunities for physical activity (PA), particularly in clinical populations, such as people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who are considered at risk for COVID-19 complications. This study aimed to investigate associations between PA and sedentary time (ST) with indicators of mental health and wellbeing in RA during COVID-19 lockdown, and examine the moderation effects of self-isolating. 345 RA patients completed an online questionnaire measuring PA (NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Questionnaire), ST (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), depressive and anxious symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and vitality (Subjective Vitality Scale) during the United Kingdom COVID-19 lockdown. Associations between PA and ST with mental health and wellbeing were examined using hierarchical multiple linear regressions. Light PA (LPA) was significantly negatively associated with mental fatigue (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .11), depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .14), and positively with vitality (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.13). Walking was negatively related to physical fatigue (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .11) and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .12) and positively with vitality (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.15). Exercise was negatively associated with physical (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .19) and general (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .12) fatigue and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .09). ST was positively associated with physical fatigue (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.19). Moderation analyses showed that LPA was related to lower mental fatigue and better vitality in people not self-isolating, and walking with lower physical fatigue in people self-isolating. These findings show the importance of encouraging PA for people with RA during a lockdown period for mental health and wellbeing.","Brady, Fenton, Metsios, Bosworth, Duda, Kitas, Veldhuijzen van Zanten","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04751-w","20201201","COVID-19; Mental health; Physical activity; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sedentary behaviour; Self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7734,""

Clinical psychologists and psychotherapists received the calls. The vast majority of the 264 phone calls registered during the two months of the pandemic (62%) were initiated by treated patients (availability of a doctor, questions related to the operation of the health-care system, prescribing medications). Still, we could also help patients and their families in potentially dangerous situations (21%): suicidal intentions, alcohol- and drug-related crises, severe neurocognitive disorders (dementias) with acute behavioural and psychological symptoms. In all cases, the telephone consultation led to the successful resolution of the crisis (low-threshold psychological intervention, counselling, assistance in admission to the institution). A relatively small number of calls (7%) were related to more complex psychotherapeutic needs. In summary, our experience shows that in extreme social situations, direct telephone assistance is suitable for supporting registered patients in the mental health system.

"Mental Health Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A 2-Wave Longitudinal Survey","Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs &gt; 1.20, ps &lt; 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms.

"Mental health of healthcare professionals during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic causes healthcare professionals to suffer mental health problems such as psychological distress, anxiety, depression, denial and fear. However, studies are lacking related to Ethiopia and to Africa in general. To study the mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Jimma University Medical Center among 249 healthcare professionals. The data were collected using self-administered questionnaires between 22 and 28 March 2020. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Social support was evaluated using the three-item Oslo Social Support Scale. Data were analysed using logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. The psychosocial status of the healthcare professionals was predicted using a classification tree model supported by the genetic search method. The prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals was 78.3%. The mean IES-R score was 34.2 (s.d. = 19.4). The ISI score indicated that the prevalence of insomnia was 50.2%. Higher psychological distress was associated with younger age, having insomnia, not having a daily update on COVID-19, and feeling stigmatised and rejected in the neighbourhood because of hospital work. This study indicates that, in Ethiopia, the prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals is high and associated with specific sociodemographic risks.","Yitayih, Mekonen, Zeynudin, Mengistie, Ambelu","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.130","20201201","COVID-19; distress; health care professionals; insomnia; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7741,""
"Social, cultural and community engagement and mental health: cross-disciplinary, co-produced research agenda","There is increasing cross-disciplinary research on the relationship between individuals' social, cultural and community engagement (SCCE) and mental health. SCCE includes engagement in the arts, culture and heritage, libraries and literature, sports and nature activities, volunteering, and community groups. Research has demonstrated the effects of these activities both on the prevention and management of mental illness. However, it remains unclear whether current research is focusing on the research questions that are of most immediate urgency and relevance to policy and practice. The current project was funded as part of the UK Research and Innovation cross-disciplinary mental health network programme to develop and co-produce a new cross-disciplinary research agenda on SCCE and mental health. Established processes and principles for developing health research agendas were followed, with a six-phase design including engagement with over 1000 key stakeholders, consultations, integration of findings and collective prioritisation of key questions. We identified four core themes: the mode of engagement, process of engagement, impact of engagement and infrastructure required to facilitate engagement. There were many points of agreement across all stakeholder groups on the priority questions within these themes, but also some specific questions of relevance to different sectors. This agenda is particularly timely given the extreme pressure on mental health services predicted to follow the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to identify how resources from other sectors can be mobilised, and what research questions are going to be most important to fund to support SCCE for mental health.","Fancourt, Bhui, Chatterjee, Crawford, Crossick, DeNora, South","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.133","20201201","Psychosocial interventions; community mental health; cultural; research agenda; social","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7742,""
"A rapid review of mental and physical health effects of working at home: how do we optimise health?","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in changes to the working arrangements of millions of employees who are now based at home and may continue to work at home, in some capacity, for the foreseeable future. Decisions on how to promote employees' health whilst working at home (WAH) need to be based on the best available evidence to optimise worker outcomes. The aim of this rapid review was to review the impact of WAH on individual workers' mental and physical health, and determine any gender difference, to develop recommendations for employers and employees to optimise workers' health. A search was undertaken in three databases, PsychInfo, ProQuest, and Web of Science, from 2007 to May 2020. Selection criteria included studies which involved employees who regularly worked at home, and specifically reported on physical or mental health-related outcomes. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, one author extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments with review by a second author. Twenty-three papers meet the selection criteria for this review. Ten health outcomes were reported: pain, self-reported health, safety, well-being, stress, depression, fatigue, quality of life, strain and happiness. The impact on health outcomes was strongly influenced by the degree of organisational support available to employees, colleague support, social connectedness (outside of work), and levels of work to family conflict. Overall, women were less likely to experience improved health outcomes when WAH. This review identified several health outcomes affected by WAH. The health/work relationship is complex and requires consideration of broader system factors to optimise the effects of WAH on workers' health. It is likely mandated WAH will continue to some degree for the foreseeable future; organisations will need to implement formalised WAH policies that consider work-home boundary management support, role clarity, workload, performance indicators, technical support, facilitation of co-worker networking, and training for managers.","Oakman, Kinsman, Stuckey, Graham, Weale","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09875-z","20201201","Gender; Mental health; Physical health; Telecommute; Working at home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7743,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the health and psychosocial status of vulnerable older adults: study protocol for an observational study","Many countries around the world have adopted social distancing as one of the public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmissions in the community. Such measures could have negative effects on the mental health of the population. The aims of this study are to (1) track the impact of COVID-19 on self-reported mood, self-rated health, other health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization of people who have an interRAI assessment during the first year of COVID-19; (2) compare these indicators with the same indicators in people who had an interRAI assessment in the year before COVID-19; and (3) report these indicators publicly as soon as data analysis is completed every 3 months. interRAI COVID-19 Study (iCoS) is an observational study on routinely collected national data using the interRAI Home Care and Contact Assessment, which are standardized geriatric assessment tools mandated for all people assessed for publicly funded home support services and aged residential care in New Zealand. Based on the 2018/19 figures, we estimated there are 36,000 interRAI assessments per annum. We will compare the four post-lockdown quarters (from 25th March 2020) with the respective pre-lockdown quarters. The primary outcomes are self-reported mood (feeling sad, depressed or hopeless: 0Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°no, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°yes) and self-rated health (0Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°excellent, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°good, 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°fair, 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°poor). We will also analyze sociodemographics, other secondary health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization. Descriptive statistics will be conducted for primary outcomes and other indicators for each of the eight quarters. We will compare the quarters using regression models adjusted for demographic characteristics using weights or additional variables. Key health and psychosocial indicators will be reported publicly as soon as data analysis is completed for each quarter in the 12-month post-lockdown period by using a data visualization tool. This rapid translation of routinely collected national interRAI data will provide a means to monitor the health and psychosocial well-being of vulnerable older New Zealanders. Insights from this study can be shared with other countries that use interRAI and prepare health and social services for similar epidemics/pandemics in the future.","Cheung, Rivera-Rodriguez, Martinez-Ruiz, Ma'u, Ryan, Burholt, Bissielo, Meehan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09900-1","20201201","Health; Mental health; Older adults; Pandemic; interRAI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7744,""
"Premises among SARS-CoV-2, dysbiosis and diarrhea: Walking through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy route","Recently, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in China. Due to its high level of contagion, it has already reached most countries, quickly becoming a pandemic. Although the most common symptoms are related to breathing problems, SARS-CoV-2 infections also affect the gastrointestinal tract culminating in inflammation and diarrhea. However, the mechanisms related to these enteric manifestations are still not well understood. Evidence shows that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in host cells as a viral invasion mechanism and can infect the lungs and the gut. Other viruses have already been linked to intestinal symptoms through binding to ACE2. In turn, this medical hypothesis article conjectures that the ACE2 downregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 internalization could lead to decreased activation of the mechanistic target of mTOR with increased autophagy and lead to intestinal dysbiosis, resulting in diarrhea. Besides that, dysbiosis can directly affect the respiratory system through the lungs. Although there are clues to other viruses that modulate the ACE2/gut/lungs axis, including the participation of autophagy and dysbiosis in the development of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is still no evidence of the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thus, we propose that the new coronavirus causes a change in the intestinal microbiota, which culminates in a diarrheal process through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway into enterocytes. Our assumption is supported by premises that unregulated intestinal microbiota increases the susceptibility to other diseases and extra-intestinal manifestations, which can even cause remote damage in lungs. These putative connections lead us to suggest and encourage future studies aiming at assessing the aforementioned hypothesis and regulating dysbiosis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to confirm the decrease in lung injuries and the improvement in the prognosis of the disease.","de Oliveira, Lopes, Pacheco, de SÃƒÂ¡ GuimarÃƒÂ£es NolÃƒÂªto, Nicolau, Medeiros","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110243","20201201","Coronavirus; Diarrhea; Dysbiosis; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-02","",7745,""
