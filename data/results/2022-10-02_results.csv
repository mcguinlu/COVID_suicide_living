"East Asian Population","This article explores the ways East Asian American (EAA) children and adolescents have experienced disparities in the United States throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The history of racism toward Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) and the complexities of acculturation are reflected through this contemporary lens. Traditional East Asian (EA) values were disrupted during this period. Implications for children and families are discussed. Persistent underlying xenophobia and racism, such as the model minority myth or perpetual foreigner stereotype, rose to new prominence, furthering emotional distress in EA and EAA youths beyond those already experienced universally by AAPI families during the pandemic.","Chou, Han, Ouyang, Yan Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chc.2022.05.006","20221001","Acculturation; East Asian; Mental health; Model minority myth; Systemic racism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38592,""

"Variability of PM<sub>25</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and their driving forces over Chinese megacities during 2018-2020","Recently, air pollution especially fine particulate matters (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) has become a severe issue in China. In this study, we first characterized the temporal trends of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan respectively during 2018-2020. The annual mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> has decreased by 7.82%-33.92%, while O<sub>3</sub> concentration showed insignificant variations by -6.77%-4.65% during 2018-2020. The generalized additive models (GAMs) were implemented to quantify the contribution of individual meteorological factors and their gas precursors on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. On a short-term perspective, GAMs modeling shows that the daily variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration is largely related to the variation of precursor gases (RÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.67-0.90), while meteorological conditions mainly affect the daily variability of O<sub>3</sub> concentration (RÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.65-0.80) during 2018-2020. The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were also quantified by using GAMs. During the 2020 lockdown, PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased significantly for these megacities, yet the ozone concentration showed an increasing trend compared to 2019. The GAMs analysis indicated that the contribution of precursor gases to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> changes is 3-8 times higher than that of meteorological factors. In general, GAMs modeling on air quality is helpful to the understanding and control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China.","Xu, Zhang, Liu, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.10.014","20221001","Air pollution; COVID-19 lockdown; Meteorology; PM(2.5) and O(3) trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38594,""
"Protracted stress-induced hypocortisolemia may account for the clinical and immune manifestations of Long COVID","About one out of eight people to convalesce from COVID-19 suffer from the so called Long COVID, a syndrome of non-specific symptoms with unclear pathogenesis. In a recent study published in Cell Long COVID participants reporting respiratory symptoms had low cortisol levels. In an as yet unpublished analysis from Yale University low plasma cortisol levels discriminated Long COVID from asymptomatic convalescent or healthy non-infected controls. Although various immune perturbations were present in Long COVID, low levels of cortisol were prominent and strikingly, depression and anxiety were increased. It has become clear that Long COVID features may be similar to those described in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, post-SARS sickness syndrome, and various chronic stress syndromes which have been linked to hypocortisolemia. Notably, lack of response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to hypocortisolemia shows a suppressed axis in Long COVID. We suggest that the inability of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to recover after the acute illness, perhaps due to protracted stress in predisposed individuals, may represent the pathogenetic basis of the Long COVID-associated clinical and immunological manifestations.","Yavropoulou, Tsokos, Chrousos, Sfikakis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2022.109133","20221001","Adrenals; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Hypocortisolemia; Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Long Covid-19; Pathophysiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38595,""

"Effectiveness of Online Interventions for the Universal and Selective Prevention of Mental Health Problems Among Adolescents: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","With the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as a threat to mental health, the demand for online interventions that can replace face-to-face approaches for the prevention of mental health problems is increasing. Although several previous reviews on online interventions have targeted adolescents with symptoms of or those diagnosed with mental illness, there is still a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of online preventive interventions for general and at-risk adolescents. Therefore, this review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of online interventions on the prevention of an increase in the scores of stress, anxiety, and depression in general and at-risk adolescents. A search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL. Altogether, 19 studies were included, and 16 studies were used for the meta-analysis. Our results showed that cognitive behavioral therapy and family-based interventions were most commonly used. Twelve and seven studies conducted universal and selective preventive interventions, respectively. The meta-analysis showed that online interventions significantly prevent an increase in depression score but not in stress and anxiety scores. Evidence regarding the prevention of increases in stress and anxiety scores is limited, suggesting the need for further randomized controlled trials on online interventions for stress and anxiety in adolescents.","Noh, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-022-01443-8","20221001","Adolescent; Anxiety; Depression; Meta-analysis; Online intervention; Prevention; Stress; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38597,""
"Impact of COVID-19 inequalities on children: An intersectional analysis","Societal concerns about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have largely focussed on the social groups most directly affected, such as the elderly and health workers. However, less focus has been placed on understanding the effects on other collectives, such as children. While children's physical health appears to be less affected than the adult population, their mental health, learning and wellbeing is likely to have been significantly negatively affected during the pandemic due to the varying policy restrictions, such as withdrawal from face to face schooling, limited peer-to-peer interactions and mobility and increased exposure to the digital world amongst other things. Children from vulnerable social backgrounds, and especially girls, will be most negatively affected by the impact of COVID-19, given their different intersecting realities and the power structures already negatively affecting them. To strengthen the understanding of the social determinants of the COVID-19 crisis that unequally influence children's health and wellbeing, this article presents a conceptual framework that considers the multiple axes of inequalities and power relations. This understanding can then be used to inform analyses and impact assessments, and in turn inform the development of effective and equitable mitigation strategies as well as assist to be better prepared for future pandemics.","Lemkow-TovÃƒÂ­as, Lemkow, Cash-Gibson, TeixidÃƒÂ³-CompaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³, Benach","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13557","20221001","COVID-19; child health; education; impact; inequalities; intersectionality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38598,""
"Help-seeking attitudes and behaviours for mental health problems in adolescents before and during the first COVID-19 school closures in Germany","Comparing measures of psychological wellbeing and help-seeking in youths before and within the first school closures due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic enables a better understanding of the effects the pandemic has for those seeking professional help for mental health problems.

Pre-lockdown and lockdown samples (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°648) were compared regarding pupils' psychological wellbeing, help-seeking attitudes and help-seeking behaviour. Participants from the lockdown sample showed greater positive attitudes towards seeking professional help, whereas psychological wellbeing and help-seeking behaviour remained stable.

"Evaluation of the Brief COPE scale and exploration of coping among primary healthcare nurses' during COVID-19","To explore primary health care nurses' coping strategies and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brief COPE scale. Primary health care nurses are experiencing significant COVID-19-related psychological impacts. Beyond understanding the impacts, there is a need to explore coping strategies. This online cross-sectional survey was completed by 359 Australian primary health care nurses between October and December 2020. Factor analysis revealed seven factors (support, disengagement and venting, humour, positive reframing, acceptance, substance use, and spiritual/religious beliefs)(Cronbach's alpha &gt;0.69). There was an association between age, years of nursing and years of primary health care nursing and the factors of 'support', 'disengagement and venting' and 'positive reframing'. Years of experience were also associated with the factor 'humour'. Urban respondents had higher scores for the 'support' factor. The Brief COPE scale is a valid and reliable tool for assessing primary health care nurses' coping. As demographic characteristics impact the coping strategies that nurses use, supports need to be tailored to optimise their impact. Nurse managers need to consider the workforce demographics when designing and implementing support strategies. The Brief COPE can identify current coping strategies and inform interventions to build coping capacity.","Halcomb, Fernandez, Mursa, Stephen, Calma, Ashley, McInnes, Desborough, James, Williams","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13816","20221001","community; coping; mental health; nursing workforce; pandemic; primary healthcare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38600,""

"Evaluation and analysis of anxiety and depression symptoms for college students during COVID-19 pandemic","The mental health of students is affected by COVID-19. We aim to evaluate the anxiety and depression symptoms among college students duringÃ‚Â COVID-19 pandemic, analyze the influence factors that contribute to college students' anxiety and depression symptoms, and provide some suggestions for improving the mental health of college students. With 179 college students participating, an online questionnaire consisting of a general questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was conducted inÃ‚Â universitiesÃ‚Â in Shanghai. The anxiety and depression symptoms among college students were evaluated using GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales, and influence factors were analyzed using an unordered multi-class Logistic regression model. The reliability and validity of the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales were good (reliabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9, validityÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°100%). The incidence of anxiety was 32.4%, of which were 23.5%, 8.4%, and 0.6% in mild, moderate, and severe, respectively; and the incidence of depression was 46.40%, of which in mild, moderate, moderate to severe, and severe were 28.5%, 10.1%, 7.3%, and 0.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that male students with strong psychological quality, who were not easily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, who received less negative or false information, and who had a strong grasp of psychology and related knowledge were less likely to suffer from mild or moderate anxiety symptoms [OR (95% CI) 0.18 (0.04, 0.81), 0.12 (0.05, 0.33), 0.23 (0.06, 0.89) and 0.07 (0.01, 0.74)]. Furthermore, college students who were not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to suffer from mild, moderate, and moderate to severe depression symptoms [OR (95% CI) 0.23 (0.08, 0.65), 0.22 (0.05, 0.93), 0.10 (0.02, 0.54)]. TheÃ‚Â GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales are suitable for evaluating anxiety and depression symptoms in college students. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a high incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms among college students, although gender and mental state fluctuations during the pandemic, negative and false information, and exposure to psychology and related courses were the main influencing factors.","Gao, Xiang, Lu, Tong, Jiang, Yu, Wang, Lv, Li","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00934-1","20220930","Anxiety and depression symptoms; COVID-19; College students; Mental health; Reliability and validity; The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38602,""

This retrospective study analyzes group differences in mental health symptoms (Pediatric Symptom Checklist; PSC-35) based on 7874 youth seeking treatment in publicly funded mental health treatment programs during California's Stay-At-Home order (March-May, 2020) and the prolonged pandemic (May-December, 2020) phases of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared with matching groups in 2019. Youth entering mental health treatment services, and their caregivers, reported significantly increased internalizing, externalizing, and attention-related symptoms during the prolonged pandemic phase, but not during the acute stay-at-home phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with small effect sizes. Group comparison analyses did not detect a significantly larger effect for Sexual and Gender Diverse (SGD) youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, queer, and/or intersex, and Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC).

"The contribution of social norms and religious practices towards low death registration in 3 HDSS sites of Uganda","Uganda has low levels of death registration, estimated at two per cent by the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA). There are 56 tribes and over 5 religious denominations with so many social norms and religious practices that could have contributed to low death registration in Uganda. Previous studies on the factors affecting death registration have not assessed the contribution of social norms and religious practices toward low death registration in developing countries. A qualitative study design was adopted to examine the contribution of social norms and religious practices toward low death registration in the 3 Health and Demographic Surveillance systems (HDSS) sites of Uganda. The methods of data collection included: focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and a document review of the death registration booklet. 6 FGDs, 2 from each HDSS site were conducted comprising 1 female FGD of 10 participants and 1 male FGD of 10 participants. In addition, 26 key informant interviews were conducted with the district leaders, local council leaders, health care workers, cultural leaders, elderly, HDSS scouts and religious leaders in the 3 HDSS sites. In the 4 sub-counties and 1 town council where the study was conducted, only 32 deaths were registered with NIRA, the Civil Registration authority in Uganda for the entire year from 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020. The study shows that social norms and religious practices have contributed to the low death registration in the 3 HDSS sites in Uganda. Social norms and religious practices either hinder or discourage death registration initiatives by the government of Uganda. It was found out that burials that take place on the same day of death discourage death registration. Cultural taboo to announcing the death of infants, neonates, twins and suicides in the community hinder death registration. The burying of a woman at her parent's house after bride price payment default by the family of a husband discourages death registration. The religious institutions have their own set of rules, practices, and norms, which in most cases discourage death registration. For example, religious leaders refuse to lead funeral prayers for non-active members in religious activities. Results also showed that mixed religions in families bring about conflicts that undermine death registration. Lastly, results showed that traditionalists do not seek medical treatment in hospitals and this hinders death registration at the health facilities. The study shows that death registration is very low in the 3 HDSS sites in Uganda and that social norms and religious practices contribute greatly to the low death registration. To overcome the negative effects of social norms and religious practices, a social behaviour campaign is proposed. In addition, community dialogue should be conducted to identify all negative social norms and religious practices, how they are perpetuated, their effects, and how they can be renegotiated or eliminated to bring about high death registration in the 3 HDSS sites of Uganda. Lastly, there is a need for partnerships with cultural and religious leaders to sensitize community members on the effect of social norms and religious practices on low death registration in the 3 HDSS sites in Uganda.","Habaasa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08589-9","20220930","Covid-19; Death registration; Practices; Religious; Social norms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38604,""
"Depression, reduced education, and bias perceptions as risk factors of beliefs in misinformation","The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 has represented one of the several undesirable effects of the current pandemic. In understanding why people can be more or less at risk to believe in misinformation, emotional distress and education could play a crucial role. The present study aims to analyze the relationship among depressive symptoms, education, and beliefs in misinformation about COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic. We do this through a cross-sectional study carried out on a random and representative sample of the Italian population that allows us to go and verify the co-evolution of many factors: i.e., beliefs in misinformation, symptoms of depression, perceptions about COVID-19, ways in which citizens got informed about the pandemic, and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education). The results show that the relationship between depression and beliefs in misinformation exists and is more complex than hypothesized because it is mediated by individual perceptions. In particular, the most at-risk people to believe in misinformation show higher bias perceptions, higher depression, and lower education. Practical implications are discussed suggesting a supportive intervention at both individual and social levels.","Delmastro, Paciello","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20640-7","20220930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38605,""
"Implementation of a Transdiagnostic Universal Prevention Program on Anxiety in Junior High School Students After School Closure During the COVID-19 Pandemic","School closures due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have worsened mental health problems for children and adolescents worldwide. We aimed to examine the follow-up effectiveness of a transdiagnostic universal prevention program for anxiety of junior high school students after a nationwide school closure during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. A total of 117 junior high school students were included in the analysis. We used the Unified Universal Prevention Program for Diverse Disorders (Up2-D2) program; the Up2-D2 comprises cognitive-behavioral and positive psychological interventions provided over twelve 45-minute sessions. The program was originally implemented between June and July 2020, immediately after pandemic-related school closures had ended in Japan. The program assessments were based on students' responses to a questionnaire incorporating five scales to measure indicators such as internalizing and externalizing problems. Assessments were carried out before, immediately after, two-month, and six-month after implementing the program. Mixed models for the whole sample showed small anxiety improvement effects immediately post-intervention and two-month, and six-month assessments (g = -0.25, g = -0.44, and g = -0.30, respectively). The anxiety reducing effects were even greater for the higher-anxiety group at the post-, 2-month, and 6-month assessments (g = -1.48; g = -1.59; g = -1.06, respectively). Although there was no control group, these results indicate that the transdiagnostic universal prevention intervention reduce only anxiety, but not other outcomes (depression, anger, and self-efficacy) in junior high students returning to school following school closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.","Kishida, Hida, Matsubara, Oguni, Ishikawa","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10935-022-00709-9","20220930","Adolescents; Anxiety; School closure; Universal prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","",38606,""
