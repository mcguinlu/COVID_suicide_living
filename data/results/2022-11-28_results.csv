"Perinatal mental health and COVID-19: Navigating a way forward","The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have increased pre-existing inequalities and risk factors for mental disorders in general, but perinatal mental disorders are of particular concern. They are already underdiagnosed and undertreated, and this has been magnified by the pandemic. Access to services (both psychiatric and obstetric) has been reduced, and in-person contact has been restricted because of the increased risks. Rates of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have increased. In the face of these challenges, clear guidance in perinatal mental health is needed for patients and clinicians. However, a systematic search of the available resources showed only a small amount of guidance from a few countries, with a focus on the acute phase of the pandemic rather than the challenges of new variants and variable rates of infection. Telepsychiatry offers advantages during times of restricted social contact and also as an additional route for accessing a wide range of digital technologies. While there is a strong evidence base for general telepsychiatry, the particular issues in perinatal mental health need further examination. Clinicians will need expertise and training to navigate a hybrid model, flexibly combining in person and remote assessments according to risk, clinical need and individual patient preferences. There are also wider issues of care planning in the context of varying infection rates, restrictions and vaccination access in different countries. Clinicians will need to focus on prevention, treatment, risk assessment and symptom monitoring, but there will also need to be an urgent and coordinated focus on guidance and planning across all organisations involved in perinatal mental health care.","Smith, Howard, Vigod, D'Agostino, Cipriani","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221137819","20221128","COVID-19; Pregnancy; perinatal mental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41774,""
"Social distancing and changes in drug use: Results from a cross-sectional study during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 has led to measures of social distancing and quarantine worldwide. This stressful period may lead to psychological problems, including changes in substance use. In addition, sociodemographic factors are linked to changed levels of drug use and abuse observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are also associated with increased anxiety, depression, and other disorders. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate (i) changes in drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with social distancing, and (ii) to verify factors associated with those changes. A web-based cross-sectional observational survey was completed by a self-selected adult general population in Brazil (<i>N</i> = 2,435) during September/October 2020 (first wave) before and throughout the pandemic. Key outcomes: social distancing, self-reported drug use (ASSIST), and emotional states (DASS-21). High social distancing was associated with fewer chances (prevalence ratio) of increased drug use for alcohol (0.71, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.64-0.80), tobacco (0.72; CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.60-0.87), cannabis (0.65; CI<sub>95%</sub>: 0.55-0.78), and others. Low social distancing presented a higher DASS-21 score for anxiety (<i>P</i> = 0.017). Concerning covariates analysis by a general linear model, men (alcohol: 1. 71; cannabis: 3.86), younger age (alcohol: 0.97), less education (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and cocaine/crack comparing several lower schooling categories vs. higher education), lower income (alcohol: 0.42; tobacco: 0.47; and cannabis: 0.36), and higher depression DASS-21 score (alcohol: 1.05; tobacco: 1.08; cannabis: 1.07; and cocaine/crack: 1.07) were associated with higher use prevalence of several drugs. Individuals reporting low social distancing increased the use of most drugs during the pandemic, while high social distancing significantly decreased drug use. Anxiety and depressive states and several sociodemographic factors (men; lower income; less education) were associated with higher drug use patterns.","Nin, Heidrich, Almeida, Izolan, Constant, Freese, Gomez, Barros","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.999372","20221128","SARS-CoV-2 infection; alcohol; anxiety; cannabis; depression; social isolation; substance-related disorders; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41775,""
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms have been linked to suicidal behavior. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in this association. This study examined ADHD symptoms and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of self-perceived stress in this association. Data were analyzed from an online sample of 1,452 Japanese individuals aged 18 to 89 obtained in February 2021. Information was collected on past-year suicidal ideation. ADHD symptoms were assessed with the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener while stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression was used to examine associations. Fifty-one (3.5%) individuals had ADHD symptoms, while more than one in ten (11.7%) of the respondents reported past-year suicidal ideation. In an analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors, ADHD symptoms were associated with eight times higher odds for past-year suicidal ideation. However, adjusting the analysis for mental health variables (anxiety and depressive symptoms) attenuated the association which became non-significant (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-4.18). In contrast, in an analysis adjusted for mental health, individuals with ADHD symptoms and stress had significantly higher odds for suicidal ideation (OR: 3.72, 95%CI: 1.43-9.67) whereas, ADHD symptoms without stress were not linked to suicidal ideation (OR: 1.25, 95%CI: 0.38-4.18). Self-perceived stress is important in the association between ADHD symptoms and suicidal ideation among individuals in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detecting and managing stress and its effects in individuals with ADHD/ADHD symptoms should be a therapeutic focus for improving health-related outcomes in this population both during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Stickley, Shirama, Inagawa, Ruchkin, Koposov, Isaksson, Inoue, Sumiyoshi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1008290","20221128","ADHD; COVID-19; mental health; self&#x2013;perceived stress; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41776,""
"Intellectual disability and COVID-19: A bibliometric review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the vulnerabilities of certain groups of people have been highlighted, such as people with intellectual disability (ID). Although related research on ID has developed rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quantitative analysis of those research results has not been systematically performed through bibliometric analysis. Bibliometric analysis is a useful and rigorous method to explore large volumes of research data, and it allows researchers to extract quantitative information on distribution by author, time, country, and journal. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively analyze the current status and developing trends in publications on ID research related to and conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science database. Biblioshiny software was used to analyze and visualize the following information: main information of dataset, annual scientific production, journals which published the most relevant sources, most-cited authors, most-cited countries, most-cited global documents, word-cloud of keywords authors have used, and both the co-occurrence and co-citation networks. A total of 450 publications were included. The average number of citations per document was 5.104. Among the top three journals, Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities published 32 articles, Journal of Intellectual Disability Research published 29 articles, and British Journal of Learning Disabilities published 17 articles. The article with the title COVID-19 and People with Intellectual Disability: Impact of a Pandemic was the most cited with total 144 citations The United Kingdom had the most publications and had strong cooperative relationships with the United States, Canada, and Australia. The most popular keywords included mental health, autism, developmental disability, and lockdown. Thematic map analysis identified several possible clusters, including telemedicine, physical activities, and mental health. The present study provides a better understanding in this research field and may help clinicians, researchers and stakeholders to obtain more comprehensive view of ID and COVID-19. The insights gained from this analysis could inform future research.","Ying, Tan, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1052929","20221128","COVID-19; bibliometric analysis; intellectual disability; research trends; scientific collaboration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41777,""
"Internet behavior patterns of adolescents before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the mental health of adolescents. To describe the Internet behavior-changing patterns of adolescents and to understand the impact of clinical features on changing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study using data collected through online investigation in China. A total of 625 adolescents completed the online survey from May 15 to June 7, 2020. The adolescents were asked to retrospect to the Internet behaviors and game behaviors of three time periods as follows: before the COVID-19 outbreak in China, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and back to school. The clinical variables of the demographic data, family functionality, and emotional and behavioral symptoms were also collected. According to the Internet behaviors and game behaviors patterns across the three time periods, the subjects will be sub-grouped. Four Internet behavior-changing patterns during the COVID-19 was identified: (1) Continuous Normal Group (55.52%); (2) Normal to Internet Addiction Group (5.28%); (3) Internet Addiction to Normal Group (14.56%); and (4) Continuous Internet Addiction Group (24.64%). Years of education, academic score ranking, family functionality, and emotional and behavioral symptoms were different across the four groups. Proportions of game behaviors, scores of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and SDQ subscale during the period before the COVID-19 outbreak were significant in predicting changing patterns. The Internet behavior patterns of adolescents during the COVID-19 period were various. Clinical features before the COVID-19 pandemic may predict changing patterns. The heterogeneity in characteristics between different changing patterns should be considered when intervening in adolescents' problematic Internet behavior.","Wu, Ren, Zhong, Bao, Zhao, Du, Chen, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.947360","20221128","COVID-19; Internet behavior pattern; adolescent; game use; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41778,""
"Understanding patient characteristics and medication prescriptions in children with mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders referred to a sleep clinic-A quality improvement/quality assurance analysis","Motivated by challenges faced in outpatient sleep services for mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders (MHNDD) during the COVID-19 clinical shutdown, a pan-Canadian/international working group of clinicians and social scientists developed a concept for capturing challenging sleep and wake behaviours already at the referral stage in the community setting. In a quality improvement/quality assurance (QIQA) project, a visual logic model was the framework for identifying the multiple causes and possible interventions for sleep disturbances. Intake forms informed clinicians about situational experiences, goals/concerns, in addition to the questions from the Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC), the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and medication history. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample. 66% of the pilot study patients (<i>n</i> = 41) scored in the SDSC red domains (highest scoring) with highest sub-scores for insomnia (falling asleep 73%; staying asleep: 51%) and daytime somnolence (27%). A total of 90% of patients were taking at least one medication; 59% sleep initiation/sleep medications, 41% in combination with further non-stimulant medications, 9% with stimulants, 27% with antidepressants and 18% with antipsychotics. Polypharmacy was observed in 62% of all patients and in 73% of the ones medicated for sleep disturbances. Qualitative information supported individualisation of assessments. Our intake process enabled a comprehensive understanding of patients' sleep and wake profiles prior to assessment, at the referral stage. The high prevalence of insomnia in patients, combined with polypharmacy, requires special attention in the triaging process at the community level.","Ipsiroglu, Bhathella, Boldut, Elbe, Hill, Keys, McWilliams, Silvestri, Wensley","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.878356","20221128","disruptive behaviour; medications; mental health; neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); pandemic; polypharmacy; sleep disorders; waitlist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41779,""

"The optimal use of colon capsule endoscopes in clinical practice","Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) has been available for nearly two decades but has grappled with being an equal diagnostic alternative to optical colonoscopy (OC). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CCE has gained more foothold in clinical practice. In this cutting-edge review, we aim to present the existing knowledge on the pros and cons of CCE and discuss whether the modality is ready for a larger roll-out in clinical settings. We have included clinical trials and reviews with the most significant impact on the current position of CCE in clinical practice and discuss the challenges that persist and how they could be addressed to make CCE a more sustainable imaging modality with an adenoma detection rate equal to OC and a low re-investigation rate by a proper preselection of suitable populations. CCE is embedded with a very low risk of severe complications and can be performed in the patient's home as a pain-free procedure. The diagnostic accuracy is found to be equal to OC. However, a significant drawback is low completion rates eliciting a high re-investigation rate. Furthermore, the bowel preparation before CCE is extensive due to the high demand for clean mucosa. CCE is currently not suitable for large-scale implementation in clinical practice mainly due to high re-investigation rates. By a better preselection before CCE and the implantation of artificial intelligence for picture and video analysis, CCE could be the alternative to OC needed to move away from in-hospital services and relieve long-waiting lists for OC.","Bj&#xf8;rsum-Meyer, Koulaouzidis, Baatrup","https://doi.org/10.1177/20406223221137501","20221128","artificial intelligence; capsule endoscopy; colonic disease; endoscopy; routine diagnostic test; wireless capsule endoscopy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41781,""
"Increasing public concern on insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: An info-demiology study","Since December 2019, an unexplained pneumonia has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In order to prevent the rapid spread of this disease, quarantine or lockdown measures were taken by the Chinese government. These measures turned out to be effective in containing the contagious disease. In spite of that, social distancing measures, together with disease itself, would potentially cause certain health risks among the affected population, such as sleep disorder. We herein conducted this web search analysis so as to examine the temporal and spatial changes of public search volume of the mental health topic of ""insomnia"" during COVID-19 pandemic in China. The data sources included Baidu Index (BDI) to analyze related search terms and the official website of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to collect the daily number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. Following a descriptive analysis of the overall search situation, Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the daily insomnia-related search values and the daily newly confirmed cases. The means of search volume for insomnia-related terms during the COVID-19 outbreak period (January 23rd, 2020 to April 8th, 2020) were compared with those during 2016-2019 using Student's <i>t</i> test. Finally, by analyzing the overall daily mean of insomnia in various provinces, we further evaluated whether there existed regional differences in searching for insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak period. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, the number of insomnia-related searches increased significantly, especially the average daily the BDI for the term ""1 min to fall asleep immediately"". Spearman's correlation analysis showed that 6 out of the 10 insomnia-related keywords were significantly positively related to the daily newly confirmed cases. Compared with the same period in the past four years, a significantly increased search volume was found in 60.0% (6/10) insomnia-related terms during the COVID-19 outbreak period. We also found that Guangdong province had the highest number of searches for insomnia-related during the pandemic. The surge in the number of confirmed cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in concern and online searches on this topic of insomnia. Further studies are needed to determine whether the search behavior truly reflect the real-time prevalence profile of relevant mental disorders, and further to establish a risk prediction model to determine the prevalence risk of psychopathological disorders, including insomnia, using insomnia-related BDI and other well-established risk factors.","Chu, Li, Wang, Jia, Zhang, Dai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11830","20221128","Baidu Index; COVID-19; Insomnia; Internet; Web search","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41782,""

"Cardiorespiratory fitness and depression symptoms among adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cooper Center Longitudinal Study","This study examined the relation between cardiorespiratory fitness (fitness) and depression symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 among adults seeking preventive medical care. Participants consisted of 967 patients attending the Cooper Clinic (Dallas, TX) pre-pandemic (March 2018-December 2019) and during the pandemic (March-December 2020). The outcome, depression symptoms, was based on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D). Maximal metabolic equivalents task (MET) levels for fitness were determined from the final treadmill speed and grade. Multiple linear regression models were computed by sex. Analysis revealed that mean fitness decreased from 11.4 METs (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.1) prior to the pandemic to 10.9 METs (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.3) during the pandemic (p-value&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001).

Results from multiple linear regression indicate that increased fitness was associated with a statistically significant decrease in depression scores in men (-0.17 per MET; 95% CI -0.33, -0.02) but not women. This modest decrease may have been tempered by high fitness levels and low depression scores at baseline in this well-educated sample.","Shuval, Leonard, DeFina, Barlow, Drope, Amir, Gneezy, Tzafrir, Chartier, Qadan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.102065","20221128","COVID-19; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Depression; Preventive Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41784,""
"Burden of COVID-19 on health and wellbeing, education, and economy of Bangladesh","The long-term impact of this pandemic will continue in almost all sectors of a country such as health, economic situations, education, mental health, and violence. Therefore, the authors intended to discuss the prolonged effect of COVID-19 on the health along with wellbeing, education, and economy of Bangladesh through a mixed approach. To assess the possible scenario in health sector of Bangladesh, we conducted a short survey through online with a structured questionnaire. The impact of the pandemic is highlighted by graphical presentations and discussed the issues in light of the existing literature. It is realized that health care services and resources are always essential for predominant health conditions and fatal diseases patients. Mental health has also been impacted a lot during this pandemic. Moreover, students of only those schools located in urban areas are attended some online classes but due to the internet interruption and scarcity of devices students from rural areas cannot attend the classes and it will widen the gap between pupils from urban areas and those who live in remote rural areas. Additionally, many students terminate school. The country's youth unemployment is projected to intensify as a result of the economic effects, which would promote antisocial behavior and cause social discontent among young people. Also, the flow of remittances greatly declined in the last couple of months and a many people were jobless abroad, and the majority of them were sent back home. The demographic dividend's intended results are expected to be negatively impacted by COVID-19's overall effect as well as sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Bangladesh.

"Changes in trends of orthopedic services due to the COVID-19 pandemic: A review","As of June 10, 2022, the World Health Organization has recorded over 532 million documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [(Coronavirus) SARS-CoV-2] cases and almost 6.3 million deaths worldwide, which has caused strain on medical specialties globally. The aim of this review is to explore the impact that COVID-19 has had on orthopedic practices. Providers observed a rapid decline in the number of orthopedic patients' admissions due to cancellation of elective procedures; however, emergent cases still required treatment. Various observational studies, case reports, and clinical trials were collected through a PubMed database search. Additional sources were found through Google. The search was refined to publications in English and between the years of 2019 and 2021. The keywords used were ""COVID-19"" and/or ""Orthopedic Injuries"". Thirty-seven studies were retained. The pandemic brought on significant changes to the mechanism of injury, number of admissions, type of injuries, and patient outcomes. Mortality rates significantly increased particularly amongst patients with hip fractures and COVID-19. Road traffic injuries remained a common cause of injury and domestic injuries became more prevalent with lockdown. Social isolation negatively affected mental health resulting in several orthopedic injuries.

"A tale of two stories: COVID-19 and disability A critical scoping review of the literature on the effects of the pandemic among athletes with disabilities and para-athletes","The still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted athletes, and, in particular, para-athletes and athletes with disabilities. However, there is no scholarly appraisal on this topic. Therefore, a critical scoping review of the literature was conducted. We were able to retrieve sixteen relevant studies. The sample size ranged from 4 to 183. Most studies were observational, cross-sectional, and questionnaire-based surveys, two studies were interventional, and two were longitudinal. One study was a technical feasibility study. Almost all studies were conducted as single-country studies, with the exception of one multi-country investigation. Five major topics/themes could be identified: namely, 1) impact of COVID-19-induced confinement on training and lifestyles in athletes with disabilities/para-athletes; 2) impact of COVID-19-induced confinement on mental health in athletes with disabilities/para-athletes; 3) impact of COVID-19-induced confinement on performance outcomes in athletes with disabilities/para-athletes; 4) risk of contracting COVID-19 among athletes with disabilities/para-athletes; and, finally, 5) impact of COVID-19 infection on athletes with disabilities/para-athletes. The scholarly literature assessed was highly heterogeneous, with contrasting findings, and various methodological limitations. Based on our considerations, we recommend that standardized, reliable tools should be utilized and new, specific questionnaires should be created, tested for reliability, and validated. High-quality, multi-center, cross-countries, longitudinal surveys should be conducted to overcome current shortcomings. Involving all relevant actors and stakeholders, including various national and international Paralympic Committees, as a few studies have done, is fundamental: community-led, participatory research can help identify gaps in the current knowledge about sports-related practices among the population of athletes with disabilities during an unprecedented period of measures undertaken that have significantly affected everyday life. Moreover, this could advance the field, by capturing the needs of para-athletes and athletes with disabilities and enabling the design of a truly ""disability-inclusive response"" to COVID-19 and similar future conditions/situations. Furthermore, follow-up studies on COVID-19-infected para-athletes and athletes with disabilities should be conducted. Evidence of long-term effects of COVID-19 is available only for able-bodied athletes, for whom cardiorespiratory residual alterations and mental health issues a long time after COVID-19 have been described.","Puce, Trabelsi, Ammar, Jabbour, Marinelli, Mori, Kong, Tsigalou, Cotellessa, Schenone, Samanipour, Biz, Ruggieri, Trompetto, Bragazzi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.967661","20221128","COVID-19; critical review; disability in sport; para athletes; research methodology; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41787,""
"Psychological distress as a predictor of the burden of care in family caregivers of COVID-19 patients in Iran: A community-based cross-sectional study","Coronavirus disease 2019&#xa0;(COVID-19) has profoundly affected millions worldwide, including family caregivers of COVID-19 patients, in terms of caregiver burden and psychological distress. The present study aimed to evaluate the care burden and psychological distress among family caregivers, caring for a family member with COVID-19. The present study was performed with a cross-sectional design in the Shahroud community, northeast Iran using the convenience sampling method. A total of 297 family caregivers of COVID-19 patients were assessed using self-report scales including the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21&#xa0;and the Zarit burden interview to assess the symptoms of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) and caregiver burden. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (multivariate regression analysis). Factors such as self-reported symptoms of depression (<i>&#x3b2;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.920, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and anxiety (<i>&#x3b2;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.712, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02) were significantly predicted care burden. Variables such as lower levels of education of the family member and caregivers and also the relationship between the caregiver and family member were additional predictive factors that aggravated the care burden. Caregivers of a family member with COVID-19 suffer significant levels of care burden that also results from psychological distress such as depression and anxiety.

"Impact of COVID-19 on postgraduate medical education: Cross sectional survey from an Indian Medical College","The corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread effect on the lives of health care professionals. The postgraduate medical students, who are the major pillars of medical institutions had to bear multitude of setbacks due to the pandemic involving academic, research and well-being issues. This was a cross sectional feedback based online survey done in the month of October 2021 to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic induced changes in the postgraduate medical education; amongst 78 students pursuing MD/MS degree in all departments of a tertiary medical institute in Himalayan foothills of North India. The questionnaire consisted of ten questions; each of which needed to be answered on a five point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Results were assessed for the most common answers of each question (represented by mode) and association between various components of the questionnaire analyzed by Spearman's rho correlation coefficient. The internal consistency of the questionnaire as tested by Cronbach's Alpha (0.82) was good. Most number or respondents were from surgical branches (<i>n</i> = 31, 39.74%). There was a generalized agreement towards preference of resumption of onsite education (75.64%), the lack of variety of cases causing hampering of thesis work (88.46%) and increased mental stress during the pandemic (58.9%). While more time for self-study was seen as the only consensual positive aspect of online teaching (64%), most students opined that technical glitches are a major roadblock in online education (80.76%). Significant positive correlation was seen between disciplinary ease and punctuality in online teaching (<i>R</i> = 0.543, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), lack of interaction and its effect on learning and mental health (<i>R</i> = 0.471; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and the lack of diversity in cases and difficulties in dissertation work (<i>R</i> = 0.351; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Negative correlation was observed between the satisfaction from overall learning through online teaching and the desire of resumption of offline classes (<i>R</i> = -0.491; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on medical education are long lasting. A comprehensive approach is required to rebuild the medical education curriculum, inculcating both traditional and newer virtual methods of education.

We collected demographic information and survey data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener scales were used for objective assessment of depression and anxiety. We collected mental health questionnaires from 3184 students. The investigation demonstrated that adolescents most strongly agreed with the following items: Increased time spent with parents, interference with academic performance, and less travel. Conversely, adolescents most strongly disagreed with the following items: Not having to go to school, feeling an increase in homework, and not socializing with people; 34.6% of adolescents were depressed before COVID-19, of which 1.9% were severely depressed. After COVID-19, 26.3% of adolescents were prone to depression, of which 1.4% were severely depressed. 24.4% of adolescents had anxiety before COVID-19, with severe anxiety accounting for 1.6%. After COVID-19, 23.5% of adolescents were prone to anxiety, of which 1.7% had severe anxiety. Chinese adolescents in different grades exhibited different psychological characteristics, and their levels of anxiety and depression were improved after the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Impacts of COVID-19 on children and adolescents: A systematic review analyzing its psychiatric effects","To summarize the most relevant data from a systematic review on the impact of COVID-19 on children and adolescents, particularly analyzing its psychiatric effects. This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental studies (randomized-individually or pooled-and non-randomized controlled trials), observational studies with a group for internal comparison (cohort studies-prospective and retrospective-and case-control) and qualitative studies in the period from 2021 to 2022. The search identified 325 articles; we removed 125 duplicates. We selected 200 manuscripts, chosen by title and selected abstracts. We excluded 50 records after screening titles and abstracts, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We retrieved 150 records selected for a full reading. We excluded 90 text articles and we selected 25 records for the (n) final. Limitations: Due to the short period of data collection, from 2021 to 2022, there is a possibility of lack of relevant studies related to the mental health care of children and adolescents. In addition, there is the possibility of publication bias, such as only significant findings being published. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern to child and youth psychiatry. Situations such as fear, anxiety, panic, depression, sleep and appetite disorders, as well as impairment in social interactions caused by psychic stress, are punctual markers of pain and psychic suffering, which have increasing impacts on the mental health panorama of children and adolescents globally, particularly in vulnerable and socially at-risk populations.","Gabriel, Lima, Pires, Vieira, Brasil, Pereira, de Oliveira, de Menezes, Lima, Reis, Alves, da Silva, Gon&#xe7;alves Junior, Rolim-Neto","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i11.1313","20221128","Adolescent psychiatry; COVID-19; Child psychiatry; Kids; Mental health; Teens","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41794,""
"""Double whammy"": a rapid review of rural vs urban psychosocial cancer experiences and telehealth service in five countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cancer is a long-term condition with biopsychosocial components. People with cancer living in rural areas can have poorer treatment outcomes and higher rates of unmet psychosocial needs than those in urban areas. Cancer, as opposed to other chronic conditions, poses a unique challenge in this current COVID-19 pandemic context, given immunocompromised states of patients and long-term survivor treatment effects. The disaggregated impact of psychosocial issues potentiated by the pandemic on rural <i>vs</i>. urban cancer populations is yet to be quantified. This rapid review investigates whether (i) people with cancer are experiencing pandemic-related psychosocial impacts, (ii) these impacts are equivalent in urban and rural locations, and (iii) whether the rapid uptake of telehealth mitigates or reinforces any identified impacts. A rapid review was conducted for literature published between December 2019 and 13 August 2021. Fifteen papers were included, incorporating evidence from five countries. The available literature suggests people affected by cancer living in rural areas are evidencing disproportionate psychosocial impacts of COVID-19, compounding cancer experiences. Despite its widespread and necessary use during the pandemic, telehealth was identified as an additional challenge for rural people with cancer. Clinicians working with rural people affected by cancer should ensure recognition of the greater risks of psychosocial concerns in their rural patients, and reduced access to health services. Whilst telehealth and other remote technologies are useful and necessary in this pandemic era, clinicians should consider whether its use benefits their rural clients or reinforces existing disparities.","Barnes, Rice, Murray, Thorsteinsson","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14382","20221128","COVID-19; Cancer; Mental health; Pandemic; Psycho-oncology; Psychosocial; Rural; Telehealth; Wellbeing; distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41795,""
"Elective home education of children with neurodevelopmental conditions before and after the COVID-19 pandemic started","COVID-19 brought disruptions to children's education and mental health, and accelerated school de-registration rates. We investigated Elective Home Education (EHE) in families of children with a neurodevelopmental condition. A total of 158 parents of 5-15 year-old children with neurodevelopmental conditions (80% autistic) provided information on reasons for de-registration, their experience of EHE, and children's mental health. Few differences were found between children participating in EHE before and after the pandemic started. Low satisfaction with school for not meeting children's additional needs was the main reason for de-registering in both groups. COVID-19 had a more limited role in parents' decision to de-register. The main advantage of EHE reported in both groups was the provision of personalised education and one-to-one support.

"A survey of health status of healthcare providers in a square cabin hospital during the new corona omicron outbreak: A cross-sectional study","The coronavirus omicron variant outbroke in early 2022 in Shanghai. Although previous studies indicated that long working hours in a square cabin hospital might increase the risk of mental health among frontline healthcare providers, few studies have investigated whether the mental health risk could be reduced among well-trained professionals following the new guidelines. This study aimed to investigate the health situation of frontline healthcare providers in Shanghai square cabin during the omicron variant circulation. An online survey was used to evaluate those healthcare providers working in the square cabin hospitals from March 1, 2022, to May 31, 2022. The first online survey was conducted and emailed to the health providers on April 1. The second survey was conducted and sent to the nonrespondents on May 31. Overall, 142 frontline healthcare providers completed the online survey. Their mental health was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Psychological Resilience Scale. We estimated multiple clinical systems and identified factors associated with those symptoms among participants. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the risk factors of these symptoms. Overall, 66.20%, 45.07%, and 27.46% of frontline healthcare providers in Shanghai City reported symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety, respectively. In addition, the most common symptoms included dry eyes (57.75%), lumbar muscle strain (47.18%), dry mouth (35.92%), itching (31.69%), headache (29.58%), and sore throat (28.87%) among the frontline healthcare providers.

"Early-childhood temperament moderates the prospective associations of coping with adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms","While appraisal and coping are known to impact adolescent psychopathology, more vulnerable or resilient responses to stress may depend on individual temperament. This study examined early life temperament as a moderator of the prospective relations of pre-adolescent appraisal and coping with adolescent psychopathology. The sample included 226 (62% female, 14-15&#x2009;years) adolescents with assessments starting at 3&#x2009;years of age. Adolescents were predominately White (12% Black 9% Asian, 11% Latinx, 4% Multiracial, and 65% White). Observed early-childhood temperament (fear, frustration, executive control, and delay ability) were tested as moderators of pre-adolescent coping (active and avoidant) and appraisal (threat, positive) on internalizing and externalizing symptoms during the pandemic. Interaction effects were tested using regression in <i>R</i>. Sex and family context of stress were covariates. Early-childhood temperament was correlated with pre-adolescent symptoms, however, pre-adolescent appraisal and coping but not temperament predicted adolescent psychopathology. Frustration moderated the relations of active and avoidant coping and positive appraisal to symptoms such that coping and appraisal related to lower symptoms only for those low in frustration. Executive control moderated the associations of avoidant coping with symptoms such that avoidance reduced the likelihood of symptoms for youth low in executive control. Findings underscore the role of emotionality and self-regulation in youth adjustment, with the impact of coping differing with temperament. These findings suggest that equipping youth with a flexible assortment of coping skills may serve to reduce negative mental health outcomes.","Smith, Parrish, Shimomaeda, Zalewski, Rosen, Rodman, Kasparek, Mayes, Meltzoff, McLaughlin, Lengua","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1011095","20221128","COVID-19; adolescence; coping; early childhood; internalizing and externalizing behavior; stress; temperament","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41799,""

The results indicated that: (1) there was a significant positive correlation between perceived social support and mental health of college soccer players; (2) the athlete burnout played a mediating role between perceived social support and mental health of college soccer players; (3) the hopelessness also played a mediating role between perceived social support and mental health of college soccer players; (4) the athlete burnout and hopelessness played a chain mediating role between perceived social support and mental health. These findings could contribute to insight into the mechanisms by which perceived social support affects the mental health of college soccer players and provide important practical guidance for protecting and promoting their mental health.","Zhao, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001020","20221128","athlete burnout; college soccer players; hopelessness; mental health; perceived social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41801,""
"The need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aims of this study were to explore the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to distinguish which type of psychological guidance they demanded and to investigate the related factors that could be associated with the need for psychological counseling. A total of 112 eligible patients diagnosed with stage I-IV breast cancer who had received surgery were included. The self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), cancer fatigue scale (CFS), and survey for the need for psychological counseling were completed for all subjects prior to radiotherapy. A total of 8.9% and 3.6% of patients suffered from depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The prevalence of sleep disturbance was 62.5%. Only 12.5% of the patients needed psychological counseling, especially for the type of tumor diagnosis and treatment rather than COVID-19-related protection. The higher the total CFS score was, the lower the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients during this pandemic (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84-0.98). Patients who received 7-8 chemotherapeutic cycles had 6.7 times the risk of needing psychological counseling when compared with those who received 1-6 chemotherapeutic cycles. Fewer breast cancer patients suffered from depression and anxiety before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a large number of patients complained of sleep disturbance and fatigue. The majority of patients did not need psychological counseling. More chemotherapeutic cycles or less fatigue could increase their risk of needing psychological counseling, especially for tumor diagnosis and treatment, but not COVID-19-related protection.","Mo, Lai, Mo, Li, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.917175","20221128","COVID-19; anxiety; breast cancer; depression; need; psychological counseling; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41802,""
"COVID-19-related future anxiety is associated with the health-related quality of life in school-aged children and adolescents-A cross-sectional study","Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have shown that the physical as well as the mental health of children and adolescents significantly deteriorated. Future anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associations with quality of life has not previously been examined in school children. As part of a cross-sectional web-based survey at schools in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, two years after the outbreak of the pandemic, school children were asked about COVID-19-related future anxiety using the German epidemic-related Dark Future Scale for children (eDFS-K). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the self-reported KIDSCREEN-10. The eDFS-K was psychometrically analyzed (internal consistency and confirmatory factor analysis) and thereafter examined as a predictor of HRQoL in a general linear regression model. A total of <i>N</i> = 840 8-18-year-old children and adolescents were included in the analysis. The eDFS-K demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's &#x3b1; = 0.77), and the confirmatory factor analysis further supported the one-factor structure of the four-item scale with an acceptable model fit. Over 43% of students were found to have low HRQoL. In addition, 47% of the students sometimes to often reported COVID-19-related fears about the future. Children with COVID-19-related future anxiety had significantly lower HRQoL (<i>B</i> = - 0.94, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Other predictors of lower HRQoL were older age (<i>B</i> = - 0.63, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and female (<i>B</i> = - 3.12, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and diverse (<i>B</i> = - 6.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) gender. Two years after the outbreak of the pandemic, school-aged children continue to exhibit low HRQoL, which is further exacerbated in the presence of COVID-19-related future anxiety. Intervention programs with an increased focus on mental health also addressing future anxiety should be provided.","K&#xe4;stner, L&#xfc;cker, Hannich, Schmeyers, L&#xfc;cker, Hoffmann","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1003876","20221128","COVID-19-related future anxiety; Dark Future Scale for children; KIDSCREEN-10; health-related quality of life (HRQL); mental health; school children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41803,""
"A narrative-based approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of stranded immigrants in four border cities in Mexico","This paper describes the impact that the different COVID-19 related restrictions have had on the mental health and wellbeing of 57 Central American and Caribbean immigrants stranded in Mexico due to the pandemic. Ethnographic data was obtained through the application of in-depth interviews centered on topics such as migration history, personal experience with COVID-19 and beliefs about the pandemic. This information was further analyzed through a narrative approach and Atlas Ti. US Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) have stranded thousands of individuals in the US-Mexico border region, a situation that has overcrowded the available shelters in the area and forced many of the immigrants to live on the streets and in improvised encampments. Thus, exposing them to a higher risk of contagion. Furthermore, the majority of the interviewed Central American and Caribbean immigrants consider that Mexico is more lenient when it comes to the enforcement of sanitary measures, especially when compared to their countries of origin. Finally, vaccination hesitancy was low among the interviewees, mainly due to the operative aspects of the vaccination effort in Mexico and the fear of ruining their chances to attain asylum in the US. These findings are backed up by the discovery of five recurring narratives among the interviewees regarding: (1) The pandemic's psychological impact. (2) The uncertainty of being stranded in Mexico and the long wait. (3) Their fear of violence over the fear of contagion. (4) The perceived leniency of Mexico with the pandemic when compared to their countries of origin, and (5) their beliefs about the pandemic and vaccines. The mental health of stranded Central American and Caribbean immigrants in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic is mostly affected by their inability to make it across the US-Mexico border using legal means.","Cruz Pi&#xf1;eiro, Ibarra","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.982389","20221128","COVID-19; Central American immigration; US-Mexico border; immigration; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41804,""
"Psychological care needs for frontline nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have played vital roles in clinical treatment. Their success in providing adequate care services depends on their psychological state, which determines their physical health, work status, therapeutic outcomes, and response to public health emergencies. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated psychological care needs from the perspective of nurses. This study aimed to describe the psychological care needs for frontline nurses in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a qualitative descriptive study. Data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 15 frontline nurses who had been involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and received psychological care. The conventional content analysis was used to identify themes from the interview transcripts. Four major themes about the psychological care needs of frontline nurses were identified: (1) psychological service providers (categories: professional service team, trustworthy person or group, ability to empathize with nurses); (2) problems with psychological care (categories: lack of universal screening and focused attention, online group counseling lacks targeting, psychological interventions lack individualization); (3) psychological care content (categories: mental health-related education, recognition of nurses' contributions, problem-solving therapy, psychological counseling and venting); (4) organization and management of psychological services (categories: focus on the psychological care needs of frontline nurses, build a standardized psychological service process system). It is important to understand individual psychological care needs of frontline nurses and to provide them with tailor-made psychological care that meet their needs. This will improve their mental health, promote clinical care and quality responses to public health emergencies.","Ding, Wang, Guo, Chen, Jin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1043515","20221128","COVID-19; needs; nurses; psychological care; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41805,""
"Effect of human probiotics on memory, psychological and biological measures in elderly: A study protocol of bi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (CleverAge Biota)","Gut microbiota may influence brain functions. Therefore, we prepared a study protocol for a double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial to determine the complex effects of human probiotics on memory, psychological, and biological measures in the elderly. We selected eligible participants using an effective electronic questionnaire containing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a brief electronic cognitive test. One-third of the respondents with the worst cognitive scores on the electronic test are randomized to group A, starting with a 3-month probiotic intervention, and to group B, starting with a placebo. In a crossover design, both groups change their intervention/placebo status after 3 months for the next 3 months. Participants refusing longer personal assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic were randomly allocated to one of two subgroups assessed online. Participants in both groups are matched in age, education, gender, and cognitive scores on electronic testing at baseline. At three time points, participants are assessed using a neuropsychological battery, self-report measures of mood, a physical fitness test, blood, urine, and stool samples, and actigraphy. A subset of participants also provided their biological samples and underwent the neuropsychological battery in an extended testing phase 3 months after study termination to find out the long-term effect of the intervention. This is the first trial to address the comprehensive effects of human probiotics on memory and many other measures in the elderly. We assume that the probiotic group will have better outcomes than the placebo group after the first and second trimesters. We expect that the probiotic effect will persist for the next 3 months. These study's findings will contribute to an interesting area of how to improve memory, psychological and biological and other factors naturally and will examine the importance of probiotics for overall health in the elderly.

"The Pandemial babies: effects of maternal stress on temperament of babies gestated and born during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic may configure an adverse prenatal context for early development. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of pandemic-related negative experiences, prenatal anxiety and depression on the temperament of six-month-old babies. The sample consisted of 105 mother-child dyads. A longitudinal evaluation was carried out using pre- and postnatal online surveys. Mothers completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory - II, the Pandemic Impact Questionnaire and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised. Serial mediation models were tested, in which the pandemic-related negative experiences constituted the independent variable, the prenatal anxiety and depression were the mediators, and the children's temperament dimensions were the dependent variables. Pandemic-related negative experiences were indirectly associated with the offspring's negative affect and surgency through anxious symptomatology, which acted as a mediating variable. This was the first study to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on temperament. Such an adverse context implies risks for child development. Public health policies aiming to evaluate socioemotional variables during early childhood become necessary to allow on-time interventions for lessening these risks.","L&#xf3;pez-Morales, Gelpi Trudo, Del-Valle, Canet-Juric, Biota, Andr&#xe9;s, Urquijo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03976-1","20221128","COVID-19; Early development; Prenatal maternal stress; Temperament","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41807,""
"Potential polymorphic CYP1A2 and CYP2D6-mediated pharmacokinetic interactions between risperidone or olanzapine and selected drugs intended to treat COVID-19","Risperidone/olanzapine are antipsychotics used in Peru to control symptoms of psychosis. The objective was to review the available evidence on potential pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 polymorphic genes between risperidone or olanzapine and selected drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. A bibliographic search was conducted in SciELO and PubMed/Medline. The selection criteria included all types of articles in English and Spanish languages. In this review, the CYP1A2/CYP2D6/CYP3A4 genes that encode their respective enzymes have been described. The olanzapine/risperidone association increases the risk of prolonging the QT interval; chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine decreases metabolism and increases plasma concentration of risperidone; ritonavir decreases metabolism and increases plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir with the risk of prolonging the QT interval of the cardiac cycle and with a tendency to progression towards Torsades de Pointes. Ritonavir increases metabolism and decreases plasma levels of olanzapine. A low incidence of adverse effect was found between risperidone/azithromycin and olanzapine with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Regarding the association of genes: CYP1A2*1D increases and CYP1A2*1F decreases the plasma concentration of olanzapine. Risperidone plasma levels are increased in CYP2D6 intermediate and poor metabolizers compared with normal metabolizers. Other studies indicate no significant association between poor metabolizers of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 with increased pharmacokinetic parameters. It is concluded that there are potential risks of prolonging the QT interval due to pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by polymorphic genes CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 between risperidone or olanzapine and the drugs selected for the treatment of COVID-19.","Rojas-Macetas, Medalla-Garro, Saravia, Losno, Valderrama-Wong, Pariona, Alvarado","https://doi.org/10.2174/1872312815666221125112724","20221128","CYP1A2; CYP2D6; azithromycin; depression; hydroxychloroquine.; pharmacokinetic interactions; risperidone/olanzapine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41808,""
"Parenthood and psychological distress among English Millennials during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from the Next Steps cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic led to disproportionate mental health responses in younger adults and parents. The aim of the study was to investigate how Millennial parents' experiences were associated with psychological distress over the first year of the pandemic. We examined data in September 2020 (n men&#x2009;=&#x2009;994; n women&#x2009;=&#x2009;1824) and February 2021 (n men&#x2009;=&#x2009;1054; n women&#x2009;=&#x2009;1845) from the Next Steps cohort study (started ages 13-14 in 2003-04). In each wave, we examined differences in GHQ-12 scores between parent groups defined by the age and number of children, adjusting for background characteristics at ages 13-14, psychological distress at ages 25-26, and other circumstances during the pandemic. We also examined if differences varied by work status, financial situation before the outbreak and relationship status. Whereas mothers with one or two children and children aged 0-2 reported less distress than non-mothers in September 2020, there were no such differences in February 2021. Fathers with three or more children reported more distress in February 2021. Compared with non-fathers who worked, fathers were also disproportionally distressed if they were working with one child or with children aged 2 or less in September 2020. The distribution of psychological distress among Millennial parents and non-parents has varied by age, sex, parenting stage, work status and the timing of the pandemic.

Four mutually exclusive groups were created, using the presence or absence of COVID-19-related stress and lack of exercise habits as risk factors for poor OHRQoL (no COVID-19-related stress and no lack of exercise, COVID-19-related stress only, lack of exercise habits only, and both COVID-19-related stress and lack of exercise habits). Poisson regression with robust standard errors provided the prevalence ratio for poor OHRQoL. The presence of both COVID-19-related stress and lack of exercise habits (adjusted prevalence ratio: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.31-&#x2009;3.69) was associated with poor OHRQoL.

"Disability-Adjusted Life Years for Drug Overdose Crisis and COVID-19 Are Comparable During the Two Years of Pandemic in the United States","The drug overdose crisis with shifting patterns from primarily opioid to polysubstance uses and COVID-19 infections are two concurrent public health crises in the United States, affecting the population of sizes in different magnitudes (approximately &lt;10 million for substance use disorder (SUD) and drug overdoses vs. 80 million for COVID-19 within two years of the pandemic). Our objective is to compare the relative scale of disease burden for the two crises within a common framework, which could help inform policymakers with resource allocation and prioritization strategies. We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for SUD (including opioids and stimulants) and COVID-19 infections, respectively. We collected estimates for SUD prevalence, overdose deaths, COVID-19 cases and deaths, disability weights, and life expectancy from multiple publicly available sources. We then compared age distributions of estimated DALYs. We estimated a total burden of 13.83 million DALYs for SUD and drug overdoses and 15.03 million DALYs for COVID-19 in two years since March 2020. COVID-19 burden was dominated by the fatal burden (&gt;95% of total DALYs), whereas SUD burden was attributed to both fatal (53%) and non-fatal burdens (47%). The highest disease burden was among individuals aged 30-39 for SUD (27%) and 50-64 for COVID-19 (31%). Despite the smaller size of the affected population, SUD and drug overdoses resulted in comparable disease burden to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional resources supporting evidence-based interventions in prevention and treatment may be warranted to ameliorate SUD and drug overdoses during both the pandemic and post-pandemic recovery.","Chen, Griffin, Kawasaki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2022.11.010","20221127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41812,""

"Eating disorders in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic and its socio-economic consequences have been influencing considerably the Greek population and especially those people that are vulnerable or are actually suffering from a mental disorder. Considering eating disorders (ED) there are reports of a number of factors that increase the stress experienced by patients. The most important of them are:1 A. Quarantine and house confinement. Many ED patients report poor relationships with other family members or in some cases falling victims of some type of abusive behavior by other family members. Prolonged compulsory house confinement could have a negative impact in the course of ED. It should be noted that a similar negative impact of the pandemic has been observed in family members that have unsuccessfully tried to balance the need of the patients with the need of the rest of the family. B. Changes in exercising. Quarantine has severely influenced patients that have been doing vigorous and compulsive exercise. C. Food fear. During the first quarantine in March 2020, there were rumors of forthcoming extreme shortages of necessary products and food. D. Restrictions in the access to mental health facilities and therapists. In many countries, a substantial number of mental health programs were temporarily shut down during the first wave of the pandemic. E. Isolation of people residing alone in cities far away from the family home. F. Financial adversities due to slow down of economic activities causes by quarantine. g. Increase in obsessive fear concerning body health and food purity due to orthorexia nervosa onset or relapse.2 Research conducted during the pandemic showed that women suffering from ED reported more often than men increase in ED symptomatology, in the number of hours spent exercising and in the intensity of preoccupation with their body image and social appearance.2 A meta-analysis of ED studies during the pandemic showed that 65% of the patients reported a deterioration of ED symptomatology.3 Contrary to the above, the longitudinal studies that were included in the meta-analysis did not report any substantial difference in BMI and ed symptomatology before and after the first quarantine.3 Anorexia nervosa patients seemed to be more influenced than patients suffering from bulimia nervosa and ED non otherwise specified.3 Other longitudinal studies reported that bulimia nervosa patients were greatly influenced during the quarantine showing signs of slower remission or even relapse of the bulimic symptoms.4 Family conflict and intense fear for the life of loved ones could predict a relapse of the ED symptomatology.4 Young people were often caught in the following dilemma. On the one hand, consumption of palatable food could be used as a coping mechanism for regulating emotions such as anxiety, sorrow, and loneliness caused by prolonged house isolation. On the other hand, the increasing presence in the virtual reality environment of social networks has intensified the need for a perfect slim and fit body that could attract more followers and ensure social approval and success.5,6 A special interest group that was affected by the pandemic, was university students. ED symptomatology increased, especially among female students. Stress and depression related to social isolation and disruption of educational activities have been correlated with ED manifestation, especially bulimia nervosa.7 Fortunately, young patients seem to adjust adequately to internet-based treatments. There are indications that therapy through teleconference could prove quite effective for the treatment of ED.8 There are reports that this type of treatment is not attractive for anorexia nervosa patients, while all other ED patients are well adjusted to it.1 The consequences of the pandemic considerably affected mental health experts that have been treating ED patients as the number of new and relapsed clients raised dramatically. The situation was worsened by the fact that a large number of those patients had to be treated distantly. It has been reported that often conduct with other colleagues, the feeling of higher purpose or duty, recognition of their effort and supervision are some of the factors that can protect therapists from professional burn-out.1.","Gonidakis","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.096","20221127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41815,""
"The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life in the Athens area - Greece","This study examines the associations of the COVID -19 pandemic stressors with mental health and quality of life (QoL) of the general population in different demographic areas of Athens. The random sample of the study consisted of 602 participants, 389 (64,6%) women and 213 (35,4%) men residing in Attica (Greece). It was conducted with telephone interviews during the first wave of the pandemic. The instruments used were: World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS - 21), Body Vigilance Scale (&#x392;VS), Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Category 1: contamination obsessions -decontamination compulsions) (DOCS) and a set of socio-demographic data and questions on stressors related to the COVID-19 outbreak. A range of statistical analyses were used, including descriptive statistics, examination of the questionnaires' internal consistency, calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient, as well as multiple linear regression analyses with dependent variables the WHOQOL-BREF, DASS-21, DOCS, and BVS scales. According to the results of our study: a) The greater the extent of negative emotions due to the pandemic and the imposed restrictive measures, such as worry and fear, the higher the score of depression, anxiety, stress, obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, body vigilance and the lower the scores of the WHOQOL domains (Physical Health, Psychological Health, Social Relationships, Environment), b) the fear of being contaminated by the virus seems to have intensified depression-anxiety-stress (DASS-21), obsessive-compulsive (DOCS) and hypochondriacal (BVS) symptomatology. c) The independent variables of depression, stress and anxiety and obsessive - compulsive and hypochondriacal symptomatology were negatively associated with QoL d) The most vulnerable groups in terms of QoL and mental health indicators in our study were those with psychiatric or/and physical illness, the elderly, the unemployed during the lockdown period, those with low educational/ socioeconomic status and those living alone. In conclusion, the negative emotions associated with the COVID-19 outbreak and the imposed restrictive measures had a serious impact on mental health and QoL of the population. This and other similar findings should be taken into account by authorities and decision-makers to prevent and deal with the effects of the pandemic. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is still continuing and the imposition of new restrictive measures is considered. This increases the relevance of research like the one presented here.","Triantafillou, Tsellos, Christodoulou, Tzavara, Mrvoljak-Theodoropoulou, Christodoulou","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.095","20221127","COVID-19 stressors; body vigilance; contamination obsessions -decontamination compulsions; depression; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41816,""
"[Suicide mortality in Hungary during the COVID-19 pandemic]","While suicide rates did not change (or decreased) in the first pandemic year (i.e., 2020) in the majority of countries, in Hungary the number of completed suicides rose significantly. In our study, we investigated whether the unfavourable trend reversal of the Hungarian suicide rate following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic persisted in the second pandemic year. We used an interrupted time-series analysis with Prais-Winsten regression, controlling for time and seasonal effects as well as autoregressive effects, to estimate the effect of the pandemic on the suicide rates of the Hungarian male, female and total populations in 2020 and 2021. In the first pandemic year, we observed a significant increase in suicide rates in males and the total population. Although the case numbers for males and the total population in 2021 exceeded the case numbers of the pre-pandemic year, regression estimates suggest that the increase in rates did not differ significantly from the pre-pandemic years in males and it was only found to be significant at the 10% level in the total population. Based on the examination of data from the first two pandemic years, we may conclude that by 2021 the adverse effect of the pandemic on suicidality reduced in the total population and disappeared in males. The question remains open whether this favourable development will continue. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(48): 1895-1901.

"Mental health concerns and network structures of psychological helpline help-seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: Pandemic stage differences","The present study aimed to investigate the pandemic stage differences of mental health helpline help-seekers emotional responses, psychiatric symptoms, and related network structures during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The data was collected by a large-scale psychological helpline in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. Counselor-reported information about the help-seekers pandemic-related emotional responses and psychiatric symptoms were recorded. A total of 26,870 callers' data from February 28, 2020, to April 23, 2021, were collected in the present study. A linear probability model and network analysis were conducted to determine the differences in help-seekers mental health concerns and network structures between the pandemic (stage I, from February 28, 2020, to April 28, 2020, N&#x202f;=&#x202f;9821) and the regular prevention and control period (stage II, from April 29, 2020, to April 23, 2021, N&#x202f;=&#x202f;17,049). Results revealed that anger, sadness, and obsession symptoms increased in stage II while symptoms of anxiety, somatization, and feelings of fear and stress were relieved. The network analysis results demonstrated both stage I and II networks centered on anxiety firmly. In stage II, the connection between anxiety and hypochondria and fear's strength centrality descended significantly. The mental health outcomes of callers only included the counselor-reported data. The mental health concerns of helpline callers showed pandemic-related stage differences.","Lai, Tong, Xiang, Zhang, Ren","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.065","20221126","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychological network; Stage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41818,""
"Help-seeking behaviors for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature of communication has changed dramatically owing to lockdowns and the need for social distancing with ongoing outbreaks. As a result, patient's help-seeking behavior for mental health may have changed. We summarized the research on help-seeking behavior for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated changes that have occurred. This study was a systematic review. We searched four literature databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CHINAHL, and PsycINFO. We included the following in the review: 1) studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) studies that dealt with help-seeking behavior for mental health. Eligible studies were summarized according to characteristics such as research participants and study type. In total, 41 studies (38 observational studies 2 qualitative studies and 1 randomized trial) were eligible for the review. Most studies reported delays, decreases, or deficits in help-seeking behavior. The study participants included medical professionals, local residents, hospitals, children and adolescents, online participants, pregnant women, people who experienced intimate partner violence, those with eating disorders, and other individuals. Findings from observational studies may have bias as confounder. Meta-analysis could not be performed, because the studies had variations of design. During the COVID-19 pandemic, delay in seeking help from mental health services may have resulted in lost opportunities to link patients with appropriate treatment and care. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing as of 2022. Therefore, it is important to examine the impact of the pandemic on mental health in future research.","Yonemoto, Kawashima","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.043","20221126","COVID-19; Help-seeking behavior; Mental health; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41819,""
"National long COVID impact and risk factors","Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors for long COVID symptoms among polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients (hospitalised and community) in Malta. This was a national cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 patients in Malta during 2020. Patients were sent a questionnaire 3-6 months after testing positive. Data were analysed descriptively to estimate symptom prevalence, and multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine the risk factors for long COVID symptoms. Age, sex, initial symptoms, hospitalisation, and healthcare worker status were used as risk factors and symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, anxiety, sadness, and memory loss) 2.5 months or more after COVID-19 onset were used as outcomes. Of 8446 eligible participants, 2665 (31.55%) responded with a median age of 37 years. Initial symptoms were reported in 82% of responders, and 7.73% were hospitalised. Among the long COVID symptoms, fatigue persisted among most non-hospitalised responders, whereas anxiety, shortness of breath, and sadness were the most common symptoms. Female sex, hospitalisation, and initial symptoms were associated with higher odds of fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, anxiety, sadness, and memory loss as long COVID symptoms. Our study is the first to highlight long COVID symptoms and risk factors in Malta, showing that long COVID is common among hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients. These data should increase awareness of long COVID and facilitate support to those affected nationally.","Baruch, Zahra, Cardona, Melillo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.09.021","20221126","COVID-19 infection; Cross-sectional survey; Long COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41820,""
"The impact of social quarantine on the living status and mental health of the elderly in the Wuhan community: one year after Wuhan COVID-19 blockade","In order to control the corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries have adopted social quarantine policies, with older adults in Wuhan suffering the longest and most severe conditions. But few studies have explored the impact of this on the mental health of older adults in Wuhan. The purpose of this paper is to examine changes in the residential status and mental health of this group when 1 year after the social isolation policies in Wuhan. A cross-sectional study with convenience sampling was conducted to assess the questionnaire of older adults in a total of 21 streets in 5 central and 2 distant urban districts of Wuhan. Using a self-compiled living status questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Social Support Rating Scale, our survey evaluated the living status, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, loneliness and social support of all the participants. A total of 400 valid samples were obtained. One year after experiencing social isolation, older adults had not changed much from their pre-epidemic living status and mostly lived with their partners. They had satisfactory social support (33.86&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.92) and low levels of depression (3.12&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.30), anxiety (1.52&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.19) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (21.41&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.39), but there were moderate levels of loneliness (38.27&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.31). Among them, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were significantly higher (ps&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) in older adults who were COVID-19 close contacts while experiencing social isolation. One year after experiencing Wuhan's harsh social isolation, older adults in the Wuhan community did not experience significant symptoms of depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress, but loneliness has increased and the mental health of older adults who were COVID-19 close contacts needs attention.","Dai, Xiong, Li","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03560-z","20221126","COVID-19; Mental health; Older adults; Social quarantine; Wuhan community","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41821,""
"Adverse outcomes associated with recorded victimization in mental health electronic records during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown","The impact of COVID-19 pandemic policies on vulnerable groups such as people with mental health problems who experience violence remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of victimization recorded in mental healthcare records during the first UK lockdown, and associations with subsequent adverse outcomes. Using a large mental healthcare database, we identified all adult patients receiving services between 16.12.2019 and 15.06.2020 and extracted records of victimisation between 16.03.2020 and 15.06.2020 (first UK COVID-19 lockdown). We investigated adverse outcomes including acute care, emergency department referrals and all-cause mortality in the year following the lockdown (16.06.2020- 01.11.2021). Multivariable Cox regressions models were constructed, adjusting for socio-demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and service use factors. Of 21,037 adults receiving mental healthcare over the observation period, 3,610 (17.2%) had victimisation mentioned between 16.03.2020 and 15.06.2020 (first UK COVID-19 lockdown). Service users with mentions of victimisation in their records had an elevated risk for all outcomes: acute care (adjusted HR: 2.1; 95%CI 1.9-2.3, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), emergency department referrals (aHR: 2.0; 95%CI 1.8-2.2; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and all-cause mortality (aHR: 1.5; 95%CI 1.1-1.9; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), when compared to service users with no recorded victimisation. We did not observe a statistically significant interaction with gender; however, after adjusting for possible confounders, men had slightly higher hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and emergency department referrals than women. Patients with documented victimisation during the first UK lockdown were at increased risk for acute care, emergency department referrals and all-cause mortality. Further research is needed into mediating mechanisms.","Kadra-Scalzo, Kornblum, Stewart, Howard","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02393-w","20221126","Adverse outcomes; COVID-19; Domestic violence; Mental health; Victimisation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41822,""
"Undiagnosed Long COVID-19 in China Among Non-vaccinated Individuals: Identifying Persistent Symptoms and Impacts on Patients' Health-Related Quality of Life","Is Long COVID-19 under-diagnosed? The definition of this new condition has received many contributions, and it is still under development as a great variety of symptoms have been associated to it. This study explores the possibility that there are non-diagnosed cases among individuals who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and have not been vaccinated. The long-term symptoms identified among a sample 255 individuals have been associated to Long COVID-19 by recent literature. The study relates these symptoms to risk factors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) negative impacts. The individuals were screened 1&#xa0;year after discharge to explore its potential relation to Long COVID-19. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and discharged from designated hospitals in a Chinese province between January and April 2020 were included in this study. They received computed tomography (CT) scans one month after discharge. One year after discharge, patients were invited to physical examination and interviewed with questionnaire on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and post-COVID-19 symptoms. Tobit regression and Logistic regression were applied to evaluate the risk factors for health utility value and pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. One year after discharge, 39.61% patients complained of several of the symptoms associated to Long COVID-19. More than half had abnormal chest CT.

"Changes in essential care in individuals with spinal cord injury during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cross-sectional, observational study. To determine whether changes in essential care during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted satisfaction with activities, participation, and relationships among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Data were collected online between December 31, 2020 and February 14, 2021 among community dwelling adults with SCI (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;123). The primary outcome variables were satisfaction with the ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs) (mobility, dressing, feeding, and toileting), as well as satisfaction with participation in household and recreational activities, and satisfaction with relationships among friends, family, and with the status of one's relationship measured with the International Spinal Cord Injury Data Sets Activities and Participation Basic Data Set. Primary predictors were age, gender, time since injury, completeness of injury, injury level, access to mental health, access to medications, access to medical supplies, and access to personal care assistants (PCAs). Impact on access to mental health and impact on access to supplies were the most common factors affecting satisfaction with activities, participation, and relationships for individuals with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact on access to PCAs/homecare was also found to impact certain outcomes including feeding and participation in household activities. Future supply chain disruptions from pandemics or natural disasters could have wide-reaching effects for individuals with SCIs. Thus, further research and advocacy is needed to improve mental health care planning and supply chain access during subsequent natural disasters.","Draganich, Philippus, Eagye, Mikolajczyk, Morse, Monden","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-022-00868-w","20221126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41824,""
"Social isolation and the brain: effects and mechanisms","An obvious consequence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the worldwide reduction in social interaction, which is associated with many adverse effects on health in humans from babies to adults. Although social development under normal or isolated environments has been studied since the 1940s, the mechanism underlying social isolation (SI)-induced brain dysfunction remains poorly understood, possibly due to the complexity of SI in humans and translational gaps in findings from animal models. Herein, we present a systematic review that focused on brain changes at the molecular, cellular, structural and functional levels induced by SI at different ages and in different animal models. SI studies in humans and animal models revealed common socioemotional and cognitive deficits caused by SI in early life and an increased occurrence of depression and anxiety induced by SI during later stages of life. Altered neurotransmission and neural circuitry as well as abnormal development and function of glial cells in specific brain regions may contribute to the abnormal emotions and behaviors induced by SI. We highlight distinct alterations in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and oligodendrocyte maturation caused by SI in early life and later stages of life, respectively, which may affect neural circuit formation and function and result in diverse brain dysfunctions. To further bridge animal and human SI studies, we propose alternative animal models with brain structures and complex social behaviors similar to those of humans.","Xiong, Hong, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01835-w","20221126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41825,""
"The role of community-led organisations in creating social infrastructure for the health and wellbeing of disadvantaged populations: a qualitative study","A decade of cuts to public services and the COVID pandemic have impacted the social infrastructure supporting connection and networking among communities. Although UK Levelling Up agendas advocate investment in physical infrastructure for economic prosperity, there are calls for a greater focus on the creation of community-led social infrastructure to address growing public health concerns, such as social isolation and loneliness. This paper explores the role of community-led organisations in creating social infrastructure and its impacts on the health and wellbeing of disadvantaged populations. Interviews took place with 130 members of 12 community-led third sector organisations in Scotland with different spatial and social disadvantages. Interviewees were recruited through targeted and snowballing techniques, and included 25 staff, 27 volunteers, 11 board members, and 67 service users who commented on the effects of the organisations' activities on their health and wellbeing. To identify types of sociality created through social infrastructure, data was analysed and mapped through thematic coding techniques using social capital theory. Written and verbal consent was gained from all research participants and Ethical approval was granted by Glasgow Caledonian Ethics Committee. Findings showed that the activities of organisations had the most prominent effect on the social wellbeing of service users, including increased social networks, sense of belonging, and decreased instances of social isolation and loneliness. These led to wider positive mental and physical health impacts, such as decreased depression and increased mobility. Community organisations created key social infrastructures that were found to facilitate bonding, bridging, and linking capital as a result of increased opportunity to form meaningful social connections and relationships. This study shows the importance of community-led organisations in creating and maintaining vital social infrastructure for populations facing social and spatial disadvantage. Such information is important to inform policy and practice of ways in which third sector organisations can be supported to provide alternative or complementary provision that exists alongside formal public healthcare in a time where finding social as well as economic solutions for post COVID recovery is a strategic priority.

"Temporal aspects of unrealistic optimism and robustness of this bias: a longitudinal study in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Numerous studies on unrealistic optimism (UO) have shown that people claim they are less exposed to COVID-19 infection than others. Yet, it has not been assessed if this bias evolves; does it escalate or diminish when the information about the threat changes? The present paper fills this gap. For 12 months 120 participants estimated their own and their peers' risk of COVID-19 infection. Results show that UO regarding COVID-19 infection is an enduring phenomenon â€“ It was the dominant tendency throughout almost the entire study and was never substituted by Unrealistic Pessimism. While the presence of UO-bias was constant, its magnitude changed. We tested possible predictors of these changes: the daily new cases/deaths, the changes in governmental restrictions and the mobility of participants' community. Out of these predictors, only changes in governmental restrictions proved to be significant- when the restrictions tightened, UO increased.","Kamil Izydorczak et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0157-C91-598","20221128","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-esteem; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; self-others comparison; change in time; unrealistic optimism/pessimism; comparative optimism; health; bias; comparative bias; positive illusions; covid-19; longitudinal study","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-28","",41829,""
