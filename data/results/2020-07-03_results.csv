"Psychological intervention on COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is novel coronavirus infection in 2019. Many reports suggested that psychological intervention is playing a positive role in COVID-19 treatment, but there is no high-quality evidence to prove its effects. This paper reports the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify effectiveness of psychological intervention during the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be used by 2 independent reviewers: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan fang Database, ClinicalTrials, WHO Trials, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The randomised controlled trials of psychological intervention on COVID-19 will be searched in the databases by 2 researchers independently. Clinical recovery time and effective rate will be assessed as the primary outcomes. Changes of patients physical condition (1. Time until COVID-19 RT-PCR negative in upper respiratory tract specimen; 2. Time until cough reported as mild or absent; 3. Time until dyspnea reported as mild or absent; 4. Frequency of requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation; 5. Frequency of requiring respiratory; 6. Incidence of severe cases; 7. Proportion of re-hospitalization or admission to ICU; 8. All-cause mortality; 9. Frequency of seriously adverse events) and changes of psychological condition (such as: SRQ-20, PHQ-9, GAD-7, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale) will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, such as effective rate, data will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) will be calculated. Fixed effect model will be used for evaluating efficiency. Considering clinical heterogeneity, random effect model will be used for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Relevant studies will be used to evaluate whether psychological intervention is effective for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study will provide reliable evidence for psychological intervention on COVID-19.

"Prisons confinÃ©esÂ : quelles consÃ©quences pour les soins psychiatriques et la santÃ© mentale des personnes dÃ©tenues en FranceÂ ?/ [Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic]","OBJECTIVE: The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11Â million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees&#039; access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000Â prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. METHODS: This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called &quot;UHSAs&quot; (which stands for &quot;unitÃ©s hospitaliÃ¨res spÃ©cialement amÃ©nagÃ©es&quot;, and can be translated as &quot;specially equipped hospital units&quot;). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. RESULTS: The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection&#039;s spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of &quot;Covid units&quot;, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives&#039; well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known &quot;revolving prison doors&quot; effect. DISCUSSION: The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","Fovet, T; LancelevÃ©e, C; Eck, M; Scouflaire, T; BÃ©cache, E; Dandelot, D; Giravalli, P; Guillard, A; Horrach, P; Lacambre, M; Lefebvre, T; Moncany, A-H; Touitou, D; David, M; Thomas, P","FR","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2128,""

"Brainstem involvement and respiratory failure in COVID-19","Respiratory failure is the most worrisome problem of COVID-19. Patients may develop severe pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and a significant proportion of them dies. It has been suggested that brainstem might play a role in severe respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. We described three COVID-19 patients in ICU at Federico II Hospital in Naples that, although had recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation. Our clinical evaluation was consistent with an involvement of the brainstem and especially of respiratory centre thus possibly explaining the weaning failure in patients that were awake and had recovered from lung involvement. Our data, though limited, indicate that brainstem involvement may play a role in respiratory failure and perhaps in the high death rate of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the weaning failure from mechanical ventilation due to central respiratory drive depression might underlie the unusual long stay in ICU reported for COVID-19 patients.","Manganelli, Fiore; Vargas, Maria; Iovino, Aniello; Iacovazzo, Carmine; Santoro, Lucio; Servillo, Giuseppe","IT","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2131,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Social Support among Adult Egyptians","The psychological impact of outbreaks on individuals includes an intense and wide range of psychiatric morbidities. People are likely to experience feelings as; worry about being infected or getting sick, increased self-blame, and helplessness. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and social support among Egyptian adults during the period of the pandemic. This is a cross-sectional observational study using an anonymous online questionnaire. The survey was conducted through a link shared on social networking sites. It was conducted from 2 May 2020 to 9 May 2020. The general populations of the Egyptian adults were included by using convenience and snowball sampling technique (510 adults). Impact Event scale mean 34.3 Â± 15. About 211 (41.4%) suffered a severe impact. There was an increase in stress from work in 174 (34.1%), financial stress in 284 (55.7%), and stress from home in 320 (62.7%). Half of them felt horrified and helpless in 275 (53.9%), and 265 (52%) respectively, while 338 (66.3%) felt apprehensive. only 24.2% reported increased support from friends, while increased support from family members in 207 (40.6%). 46.5% shared their feelings with family members, while 176 (34.5%) shared with others. Caring for family members&#039; feelings increased in 330 (64.7%). Age and rural residency were negative predictors for the impact of event score, while female gender or presence of chronic condition was a positive predictor for the impact of event score.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmologists-in-training and practising ophthalmologists in India","Purpose: To evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID 19 crisis on ophthalmologists-in-training and practising ophthalmologists during lockdown in India. Methods: An online survey was completed by ophthalmologists and ophthalmology trainees during the lockdown. The information collected included demographics (age, gender), domicile (state, union territory), current professional status (in training or practising), type of practice (solo, group, institutional, governmental, non-governmental), marital status (married, single), impact of COVID-19 on their training or practice, and impact on income and ability to meet living expenses. Psychological distress was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: In all, 2,355 ophthalmologists responded. Mean age was 42.5 (range, 25-82 years; SD, 12.05) years. Of these, 1,332 (56.7%) were males; 475 (20.2%) were still not in practice; 366 (15.5%) were single; 1,244 (52.8%) felt that COVID-19 would impact on their training or professional work; and 869 (37%) had difficulty in meeting their living expenses. The mean PHQ-9 score was 3.98 (range, 0-27; SD, 4.65). In terms of psychological impact, 768 (32.6%) had some degree of depression; mild in 504 (21.4%), moderate in 163 (6.9%), and severe in 101 (4.3%). Multivariable analysis showed that depression was significantly higher at younger age. The odds of depression decreased by 3% with 1 year increase in age. It was higher in non-practicing ophthalmologists, especially those who were considerably worried about their training or professional growth, and those with difficulty in meeting living expenses. Conclusion: A strikingly high proportion of ophthalmologists are psychologically affected and may require personalized mental health care.","Khanna, Rohit C; Honavar, Santosh G; Metla, Asha Latha; Bhattacharya, Amritendu; Maulik, Pallab K","IN","","68","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2133,""
"[THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF A PANDEMIC OUTBREAK ON MEDICAL STAFF - LITERATURE REVIEW]","INTRODUCTION: In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020 the WHO announced that the epidemic could be characterized as a pandemic. Subsequently, the WHO acknowledged the importance of providing support to the medical teams, realizing the enormous burden and stress facing this group. The aim of the present study is to review the up-to-date professional literature dealing with the psychological impact of a pandemic outbreak on medical staff. The literature existing so-far is scarce. It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams. Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one&#039;s medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma. A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.","Shelef, Leah; Schiff, Miriam; Zalsman, Gil","IL","","159","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2134,""

Lâ€™objectif de cette revue de la littÃ©rature est dâ€™analyser lâ€™impact de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19Â sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les diffÃ©rents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons Ã©galement des solutions innovantes pour y remÃ©dier. MÃ©thodes Nous avons rÃ©alisÃ© une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandÃ©mies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© suicidaire. RÃ©sultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer lâ€™Ã©mergence dâ€™idÃ©es de suicide et le passage Ã  lâ€™acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de dÃ©connexion et la perception dâ€™une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnÃ©rables. Certaines populations dÃ©jÃ  Â«Â Ã  risque suicidaire Ã©levÃ©Â Â» pourraient Ãªtre encore fragilisÃ©es par la pandÃ©mie actuelleÂ : personnes Ã¢gÃ©es, personnel mÃ©dical et individus exposÃ©s Ã  une forte prÃ©caritÃ© Ã©conomique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptÃ©es aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prÃ©venir le risque suicidaireÂ : outils de santÃ© connectÃ©e, protocole VigilanS, thÃ©rapie comportementale et cognitive de troisiÃ¨me vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inÃ©dite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, Ã  lâ€™heure de lâ€™innovation, plusieurs outils de prÃ©vention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront Ãªtre expÃ©rimentÃ©s Ã  grande Ã©chelle. Abstract Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2219,""
"Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?","RÃ©sumÃ© Objectifs La pandÃ©mie de la maladie Ã  coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoquÃ© une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitiÃ© de la population planÃ©taire. En France, elle a provoquÃ© une rÃ©organisation en urgence de lâ€™offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat dâ€™incertitude. Lâ€™objectif du prÃ©sent article est de faire le point sur les risques associÃ©s Ã  lâ€™exposition des soignants au COVID-19Â pour leur santÃ© mentale. MÃ©thodes Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littÃ©rature internationale tenant compte des donnÃ©es des prÃ©cÃ©dentes Ã©pidÃ©mies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des donnÃ©es plus rÃ©centes concernant le COVID-19. RÃ©sultats Les caractÃ©ristiques de cette pandÃ©mie (rapiditÃ© de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sÃ©vÃ©ritÃ©, dÃ©cÃ¨s de soignants) ont installÃ© un climat anxiogÃ¨ne. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent Ãªtre source de stressÂ : dÃ©ficit dâ€™Ã©quipement de protection individuel, rÃ©affectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matÃ©riels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. Dâ€™autres facteurs de risque sont identifiÃ©s comme lâ€™absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, lâ€™isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail ou les patterns dâ€™attachement insÃ©cure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmentÃ© dâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ©, de dÃ©pression, dâ€™Ã©puisement, dâ€™addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider Ã  mieux comprendre la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© des soignants Ã  la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratÃ©gies de prÃ©vention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. Abstract Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2220,""
"Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic","RÃ©sumÃ© Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont Ã©tÃ© accompagnÃ©es de dispositions spÃ©cifiques pour les prisonsÂ : suspension des activitÃ©s, parloirs et interventions extÃ©rieures. Plus de dix mille personnes dÃ©tenues ont en outre Ã©tÃ© libÃ©rÃ©es pour diminuer le taux dâ€™occupation des Ã©tablissements et limiter la propagation du virus. Lâ€™objectif de cet article est de dÃ©crire la rÃ©organisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire en contexte de pandÃ©mie de Covid-19Â et dâ€™interroger les consÃ©quences du confinement et des libÃ©rations anticipÃ©es sur la santÃ© mentale des personnes dÃ©tenues. MÃ©thode Ce travail sâ€™appuie sur une enquÃªte menÃ©e en avrilÂ 2020Â auprÃ¨s des soignants de 42Â unitÃ©s sanitaires en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire et des 9Â unitÃ©s hospitaliÃ¨res spÃ©cialement amÃ©nagÃ©es en France. Une synthÃ¨se de la littÃ©rature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire durant lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie de Covid-19Â a Ã©galement Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e. RÃ©sultats Lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie de Covid-19Â semble avoir Ã©tÃ© plutÃ´t contenue dans les prisons franÃ§aises au cours de la pÃ©riode de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcÃ©rale est important. Les 3Â niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire ont instaurÃ© des mesures spÃ©cifiques pour assurer la continuitÃ© des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcÃ©rÃ©es et contenir lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la crÃ©ation de Â«Â secteurs CovidÂ Â», la dÃ©programmation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures dâ€™hygiÃ¨ne et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontÃ©s Ã  des sevrages forcÃ©s, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des dÃ©compensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libÃ©rations anticipÃ©es sont aussi trÃ¨s prÃ©occupantes, pouvant entraÃ®ner des ruptures de soins, par manque de prÃ©paration des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilitÃ© accrue au fossÃ© qui sÃ©pare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire. Il nous apparaÃ®t important de rappeler la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© des personnes incarcÃ©rÃ©es qui doivent impÃ©rativement Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©es dans les politiques de santÃ© publique. Abstract Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11Â million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detaineesâ€™ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000Â prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called â€œUHSAsâ€ (which stands for â€œunitÃ©s hospitaliÃ¨res spÃ©cialement amÃ©nagÃ©esâ€, and can be translated as â€œspecially equipped hospital unitsâ€). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of â€œCovid unitsâ€, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relativesâ€™ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known â€œrevolving prison doorsâ€ effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2221,""

"Differences in anxiety, sadness, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and sadness as a function of age and self-perceptions of aging during the lock-out period due to COVID-19","Resumen Objetivos Analizar si existen diferencias en funciÃ³n de la edad en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en personas jÃ³venes, de mediana edad y mayores confinadas debido a la pandemia de la COVID-19, y explorar la relaciÃ³n entre la autopercepciÃ³n negativa del envejecimiento y nivel de sintomatologÃ­a psicolÃ³gica en funciÃ³n del grupo de edad. MÃ©todo Participan 1.501 personas (rango de edad: 18 a 88 aÃ±os). Se evaluaron el grado de ansiedad, tristeza y soledad, y la autopercepciÃ³n del envejecimiento. Se dividiÃ³ a la muestra en funciÃ³n del grupo de edad y por cuartiles (bajo, intermedios y alto) en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y autopercepciÃ³n del envejecimiento. Resultados Las personas mayores informan de menor ansiedad y tristeza que los de mediana edad y jÃ³venes, y los de mediana edad de menores niveles que los jÃ³venes. Los de mediana edad informan de menor soledad, seguidos de los mayores y los jÃ³venes. Para cada grupo de edad, aquellos con una alta autopercepciÃ³n negativa del envejecimiento informan de mayor ansiedad, tristeza y soledad. Hay mÃ¡s comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en jÃ³venes y menos en mayores; mÃ¡s personas deprimidas en mediana edad, menos mayores con ansiedad, y mÃ¡s mayores y menos jÃ³venes sin sintomatologÃ­a ansiosa y depresiva. Para todos los grupos de edad, las personas con comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva son las que tienen puntuaciones altas en autopercepciÃ³n negativa del envejecimiento. Conclusiones Las personas mayores informan de menos malestar psicolÃ³gico que otros grupos de edad. Tener una alta autopercepciÃ³n negativa del envejecimiento perjudica a la salud psicolÃ³gica, independientemente de la edad. Abstract Objectives To analyze differences by age group in anxiety, depression, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and depression in young people, middle aged adults and older adults during the lock-down period at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the association between negative self-perceptions of aging and psychological symptoms controlling by age group. Method Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Results Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging. Conclusions Older adults reported lower psychological anxiety, sadness and loneliness than the other age groups. Having negative self-perceptions of aging damage psychological health irrespective of the chronological age.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2020.05.005","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2223,""
"Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?","RÃ©sumÃ© Ce texte envisage de porter un regard sur les consÃ©quences psychologiques de la situation sanitaire liÃ©e au COVID-19 Ã  partir du concept dâ€™optimisme. Depuis plusieurs annÃ©es, la psychologie positive sâ€™est saisie de cette notion dÃ©jÃ  bien connue du grand public, qui a Ã©galement fait lâ€™objet dâ€™une Ã©laboration conceptuelle majeure dans le domaine scientifique. Ã€ ce titre, il nous semble que le concept dâ€™optimisme soit particuliÃ¨rement utile et pertinent pour comprendre les conduites de nos concitoyens et son influence possible dans la pÃ©riode de confinement qui sâ€™impose actuellement Ã  tous, de la mÃªme maniÃ¨re quâ€™il est nÃ©cessaire de penser lâ€™Â« aprÃ¨s Â» et ses consÃ©quences Ã  court, moyen et long terme, tant sur le plan Ã©conomique que sur celui de la santÃ© morale et physique de nos concitoyens. Traditionnellement, Ãªtre optimiste câ€™est Ãªtre confiant dans lâ€™issue positive dâ€™un Ã©vÃ©nement, alors quâ€™Ã  lâ€™inverse, le pessimisme, câ€™est plutÃ´t sâ€™attendre au pire. Lâ€™incertitude que nous imposent ce virus et les situations inÃ©dites qui en dÃ©coulent nous contraint Ã  penser le monde de demain en des termes nouveaux, ce qui peut Ãªtre dÃ©stabilisant. Comprendre la contribution du concept dâ€™optimisme dans la potentialisation des processus adaptatifs que chacun de nous pourra ou non mobiliser pour faire face et sâ€™adapter Ã  cette crise sanitaire inÃ©dite et sans prÃ©cÃ©dent est essentiel. Cela constituera sans doute un dÃ©fi majeur pour les sciences sociales et la psychologie. Câ€™est la raison pour laquelle nous pensons que le concept dâ€™optimisme peut contribuer Ã  apporter des Ã©lÃ©ments dâ€™Ã©clairage complÃ©mentaires qui nous permettront de mieux saisir les conduites rationnelles (ou non) auxquelles nous pourrions Ãªtre confrontÃ©s dans lâ€™avenir, et dans lesquelles nous sommes dÃ©jÃ  impliquÃ©s. Abstract This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2224,""
"Psychopathological consequences of confinement","RÃ©sumÃ© Les effets psychologiques de lâ€™isolement ont dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tÃ© dÃ©crits dans la littÃ©rature (expÃ©ditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). NÃ©anmoins, lâ€™Ã©chelle du confinement mis en Å“uvre Ã  lâ€™occasion de la pandÃ©mie Ã  COVID-19 est inÃ©dite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les Ã©tudes publiÃ©es, mais aussi anticiper les problÃ¨mes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou Ã  distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix dâ€™aller au-delÃ  de la littÃ©rature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des consÃ©quences connues du confinement : lâ€™ennui, lâ€™isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. Lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ©, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dÃ©pression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets dÃ©crits du confinement, mais les mÃ©canismes dâ€™Ã©mergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent Ã  Ã©tudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mÃ©canismes dâ€™Ã©mergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance Ã  garder sur des consÃ©quences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorÃ©es dans la littÃ©rature sur le confinement, alors quâ€™une vaste littÃ©rature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de consÃ©quences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir Ã  la recherche des diffÃ©rents symptÃ´mes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous rÃ©sumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thÃ©rapeutiques dÃ©jÃ  mises en place, comme la tÃ©lÃ©mÃ©decine, qui connaÃ®t un dÃ©veloppement rapide Ã  lâ€™occasion de la crise du COVID-19. Abstract The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2225,""

Lâ€™expÃ©rience carcÃ©rale conforte les dÃ©tenues-danseuses dans les processus de conscience sensorielle et identitaire, dâ€™estime de soi, de rÃ©intÃ©gration sociale. Les rÃ©percussions touchant les corps et les Ã¢mes renvoient aussi Ã  une rÃ©flexion â€“en miroirâ€“ sur lâ€™actualitÃ© anxiogÃ¨ne et contraignante du confinement : cohabitation dans le respect dâ€™autrui ou insupportable (surnombre, conflit, violence conjugaleâ€¦), dÃ©tresse des personnes vulnÃ©rables ou isolÃ©es en EHPAD malgrÃ© des amÃ©nagements soignantâ€¦ en insistant sur les ressources psychocorporelles positives, vitalisantes, propices Ã  de bienfaisantes Â« Ã©vasions Â». Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by ValÃ©rie MÃ¼ller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women start with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, lead by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women's physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivityâ€¦ move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population â€“youth to elderlyâ€“ try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cookingâ€¦ through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems. A panel of situations goes from deleterious conflictual relationships, dramatic isolation, to funny and positive ones using creativeness to escape, facing the disruption of daily life.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.002","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2226,""
"Community-acquired pneumonia among children: the latest evidence for an updated management()","OBJECTIVE: To provide cutting-edge information for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: â€œcommunity-acquired pneumoniaâ€ AND â€œchildâ€ AND â€œetiologyâ€ OR â€œdiagnosisâ€ OR â€œseverityâ€ OR â€œantibioticâ€. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation = 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77-98%) and 93% (90-99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct aspects of childhood community-acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002","20200318","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2227,""
"In Case You Haven't Heardâ€¦","Thirty-five percent of workers who telecommute said their mental health had deteriorated as a result of doing so amid the COVID-19 lockdown, according to a survey conducted by researchers at Keio University in Tokyo, among other institutions, Fox Business reported April 13. The survey was conducted online March 26â€“28, involving 8,475 employees â€” including nonregular workers â€” aged 20 to 64. Of the 21% of respondents who said they work from home, one-half of them did so in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the telecommuters, 50.7% said it had no impact on their mental health, and 14.3% said their mental health had improved. Of the respondents who said doing telework had worsened their mental state, 41.3% said it was difficult to separate their work and personal lives, followed by 39.9% who said they weren't able to exercise enough and 39.7% who said they had difficulty communicating with co-workers. Professor Isamu Yamamoto of the Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, who conducted the survey, said: â€œThere is a risk that working hours will get longer if the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred. It is necessary to establish a rigid system in which work can be carried out in a planned manner, such as by setting working hours and the timing of contact with supervisors.â€","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32333","20200417","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2228,""
"In Case You Haven't Heardâ€¦","Last week, Congress passed its fourth (actually, it was 3.5) stimulus â€œcoronavirus reliefâ€ bill. The funding goes mainly to small businesses, followed by hospitals and testing. Originally, it was all going to go to small business, which ran out of its allotment from the $2 trillion in the first package in short order. Democrats added the hospitals and testing. None goes to states for public health or to substance use disorder treatment or prevention. Reporters covering the separate stories of the stimulus package and opioid overdoses never converged on coverage, and most of the opioid stories predicted that the pandemic would make the opioid crisis worse. The opportunity to make changes for the better was restricted, in this field, to removing regulations, not to increasing funding. It is hoped that more funding for treatment for substance use disorder will follow.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32705","20200424","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2229,""
"Knowledge, Attitudes, Impact, and Anxiety Regarding COVID-19 Infection Among the Public in China","Objectives: Sufficient knowledge and positive attitudes are crucial to the prevention of COVID-19. However, little is known about public awareness and attitudes regarding COVID-19 in China. The impact of COVID-19 on the societal well-being and anxiety levels of the public has never been documented. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, attitudes, impact, and anxiety levels of the people of China in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire was undertaken between Jan 24 and Feb 24, 2020. The study participants were residents of mainland China over the age of 18 years. The attitude items in this study measured the perceived threat of COVID-19 based on the Health Belief Model. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-reported questionnaire that measure both state (STAI-S), and trait anxiety (STAI-T) Results: A total of 2,446 completed responses were received. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total knowledge score was 20.3 (SD Â± 2.9) out of a possible score of 23. The social disruption and household economic impact were notable, particularly in provinces with higher cumulative confirmed cases. The majority of responses indicated a low perceived susceptibility of being infected (86.7% [95%CI 85.4â€“88.1]), with a fair proportion of respondents perceiving a higher severity (62.9% [95% CI 61.0â€“64.8]). The mean total impact score was 9.9 (SD Â± 3.8) out of a possible score of 15. The mean score for STAI-S was 48.7 (SD Â± 10.8), whereas the mean STAI-T score was 45.7 (SD Â± 8.5). By demographics, women reported significantly higher odds for higher levels of both STAI-S (OR = 1.67) and STAI-T (OR = 1.30) compared to men. People of a younger age were also more likely to experience higher STAI-S and STAI-T. Higher perceived susceptibility and severity and impact were strong predictors of higher levels of STAI-S and STAI-T. Conclusion: Our findings can assist in tailoring public communication to change people's knowledge and attitudes. The present study also underlined the importance of the promotion of mental health during infectious disease outbreaks to help in moderating the perceived threat, social and household economic impact, targeting the vulnerable segment of the population.","Lin, Yulan; Hu, Zhijian; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Li Ping","https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00236","20200527","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2230,""
"Psycho-Neuroendocrine-Immune Interactions in COVID-19: Potential Impacts on Mental Health","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues.","Raony, Ãcaro; de Figueiredo, Camila Saggioro; Pandolfo, Pablo; Giestal-de-Araujo, Elizabeth; Oliveira-Silva Bomfim, Priscilla; Savino, Wilson","https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01170","20200527","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2231,""
"Case report of a patient with suspected COVID-19 with depression and fever in an epidemic stress environment","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of suspected cases, confirmed cases and those who passed away from the virus has been reported in major media and the internet, and has caused a high degree of tension. In addition, peopleâ€™s outdoor activities have been limited, making it more difficult to find outlets for releasing stress. Under this situation, some people began to experience emotions of anxiety and depression. This article reports a case of depression with fever caused by the stress tension of the pandemic. The patient was highly suspected to have contracted COVID-19. The reported patient, who had a history of depression and had been to Wuhan to attend an exam, showed obvious pre-exam anxiety under the epidemic situation, which gradually increased the patient's pressure and then caused some adverse symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, sweating and a reoccurrent fever. Local community authorities paid close attention to him and later sent him to a general hospital in Jingmen for quarantine and treatment, as he was suspected of having COVID-19. After being hospitalised for half a month, he was ruled out from having â€˜COVID-19â€™ and was cured of depression and discharged from the hospital. From this case, we can realise that, under the situation of the epidemic, people are easily prone to insomnia, anxiety and even depression. As clinicians in general hospitals, especially when encountering large emergencies, we must carefully inquire about the patientâ€™s medical history while strengthening our understanding of psychiatric knowledge to improve the recognition rate for depression.","Fu, Rui; Zhang, Yueqin","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100218","20200531","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2232,""
"In Case You Haven't Heardâ€¦","Should therapists have a therapist? Science says yes, according to Valentina Stoycheva, Ph.D., founder of Stress & Trauma Evaluation and Psychological Services, in the May 24 issue of Psychology Today. â€œThe longer the current COVID-19 pandemic lasts and the higher its death toll, the more prominent the need for mental health services will become,â€ Stoycheva wrote. â€œIn turn, this may create a situation in which the demands on mental health professionals' time are at their peak, while their exposure to secondary traumatic stress is increased.â€ Stoycheva wrote that the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention warns that suicide risk for physicians (including psychiatrists) prior to COVID-19 was 1.5 to 2.25 times higher than the general population. â€œâ€¦ A combination of several factors, including exposure to traumatic stress, the mental health needs of society as a whole, and the unwritten code of ethics of healthcare workers, may compromise therapists' own mental health and ability to seek help.

"In Case You Haven't Heardâ€¦","Among the many breathtaking changes the federal government is making because of COVID-19 (more methadone take-homes, video-only buprenorphine induction) is the recent announcement by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services that Medicare beneficiaries be provided more information about methadone, buprenorphine and naloxone, in a harm-reduction-style approach to reducing overdoses among the older population. In a data brief released last month, the OIG notes that people with opioid use disorder (OUD) could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, because of increased risk of respiratory disease, and that most Medicare beneficiaries at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose in 2017 received high amounts of opioids the following year. However, only a quarter received a prescription for naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses. In addition, only 7% of beneficiaries who were at serious risk in 2017 who were diagnosed with an OUD received a medication-assisted treatment drug, â€œpossibly because of challenges that beneficiaries have in accessing prescribers.â€ For the policy brief, go to https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-19-00130.asp.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32741","20200529","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2234,""
"Beliefs towards the COVID-19 pandemic among patients with emotional disorders in China","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to fear and panic in the public. Although hospitals in China reduced outpatient visits and restricted inpatient admission to lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19, this has significantly affected patients in need of medical attention, for example, patients with emotional disorders. AIMS: This study aimed to compare the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders (ie, anxiety or depression) with those of family caregivers and the general public and examine factors that shape the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders. METHODS: Survey data from 570 outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders, 449 family caregivers and 470 general public subjects were collected. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to describe participantsâ€™ level of concern, prevention attitude and positive expectations towards the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: About 70.9% of outpatients had to postpone their mental health treatment; 43.2% of patients admitted that their mental health was adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreakâ€”these patients tended to be older, male and less educated. After controlling for age and education level, outpatients with emotional disorders had significantly lower levels of concerns but more negative expectations towards COVID-19, compared with family caregivers and the public. Multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis showed that age, education and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on oneâ€™s existing mental illness were significantly associated with outpatientsâ€™ beliefs about the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders were relatively less focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, but the impact of the infection was found to be independently associated with their beliefs towards COVID-19. In addition, outpatients who were older and of low educational levels particularly held more negative beliefs about the epidemic, which may place them at a higher risk for poor mental health.","Gao, Yining; Sun, Fei; Jiang, Wenwen; Fang, Yuan; Yue, Ling; Lin, Xiang; Li, Xia","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100231","20200609","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2235,""

The harsh realities of personal fears and severe challenges to our mental health evoked by both the United States presidency of Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic are described initially. Then, a number of self-care practices that are consistent with the basic values of humanistic psychology and that we can undertake to help us meet these harsh realities are illustrated. Next, the author describes his own personal engagement and self-care in the world of progressive politics and humanistic psychology in the context of the Resisting Trump movement. The article concludes with the author suggesting that perhaps it may be worthwhile for politically like-minded others to also consider finding ways of merging their progressive politics with humanistic psychology in order to enhance their self-care through these turbulent times in the Trump/Coronavirus era.","Benjamin, Elliot","https://www.doi.org/10.1177/0022167820934226","20200615","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2239,""

"Psychological Functioning of Slovene Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Resilience Matter?","As a public health emergency, a pandemic increases susceptibility to unfavourable psychological outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the buffering role of personal resilience in two aspects of psychological functioning, mental health and stress, among Slovene adults at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Within five days after Slovenia declared epidemics, 2722 participants (75% female) completed an on-line survey measuring mental health and perceived stress as outcome variables and demographics, health-related variables, and personal resilience as predictor variables. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses demonstrated that women, younger, and less educated participants had higher odds for less favourable psychological functioning during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, poorer health indicators and COVID-19 infection concerns predicted diminished psychological functioning. The crucial factor promoting good psychological functioning during the COVID-19 pandemics was resilience, additionally buffering against detrimental effects of demographic and health-related variables on mental health and perceived stress. While previous research suggests that mental health problems increase during pandemics, one way to prevent these problems and bolster psychological functioning is to build individualsâ€™ resilience. The interventions should be targeted particularly at younger adults, women, less educated people, and individuals who subjectively perceive their health to be rather poor.","Kavcic, Tina; Avsec, Andreja; Zager Kocjan, Gaja","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09789-4","20200617","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2241,""
"A new SAIR model on complex networks for analysing the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","Nowadays, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading around the world and has attracted extremely wide public attention. From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on peopleâ€™s livelihood, societies and economies.","Liu, Congying; Wu, Xiaoqun; Niu, Riuwu; Wu, Xiuqi; Fan, Ruguo","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-020-05704-5","20200615","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2242,""
"The negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on pain and physical function in patients with end-stage hip or knee osteoarthritis","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pain, functional impairment, mental health, and daily activity in patients with end-stage hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: The study included 63 patients, with hip or knee OA, who had been scheduled for arthroplasty that was postponed because of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated by telephone interviews during the first week after lockdown, in the fourth week, and again at the end of the lockdown. Patients rated their pain level on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) and completed WOMAC, SF-12 and Tegner activity scale (TAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: VAS and WOMAC scores increased significantly during lockdown, while physical activity significantly decreased. At the final evaluation, VAS and WOMAC showed a significant negative correlation with TAS. The SF-12 subscale scores showed a significant decrease of the physical component during the lockdown, while the mental component remained largely unchanged. Patients with knee OA showed a faster progress of pain compared to those with hip OA. 50 patients (79%) stated they wished to have arthroplasty as soon as possible. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown had a significant impact on pain, joint function, physical function, and physical activity in patients with end-stage hip and knee OA.

"Evaluation of depression and anxiety levels and related factors among operating theatre workers during the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Abstract Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on healthcare workers due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of healthcare professionals working in operating theatres in various healthcare institutions in Turkey. Methods The data were collected online between 9 April 2020 and 12 April 2020 using a SurveyMonkey questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, California, United States) and healthcare workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings In total, 702 healthcare professionals working in operating theatres participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4Â±4.6 (min: 0â€“max: 21) and 10.0Â±4.5 (min: 0â€“max: 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (p<0.05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease and those whose workload increased (p<0.05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres. In order to reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of healthcare professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.","Koksal, Ersin; Dost, Burhan; Terzi, Ã–zlem; Ustun, Yasemin Burcu; Ã–zdin, SelÃ§uk; Bilgin, Sezgin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017","20200619","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2246,""
"Dynamics of psychological responses to Covid-19 in India: A longitudinal study","To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, India announced a nationwide lockdown on 24th March 2020 for 21 days, later extended for a longer time. This long period of lockdown greatly disrupted routine life and likely affecting citizens psychological well-being. The psychological toll of the pandemic on Indians is documented. However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, showed that anxiety ({beta}=0.81, CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress ({beta}=0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms ({beta}=0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with the psychological outcomes. This suggests that the state needs to address the current mental health impacts of a long-drawn out lockdown and its long-term sequelae. Disproportionate burden on women needs immediate attention. Sustainable change requires addressing the root causes driving the gender inequalities in psychological distress during such crises.","Gopal, A.; Sharma, A. J.; Subramanyam, M.

"A longitudinal study of immune cells in severe COVID-19 patients","Little is known about the time-dependent immune responses in severe COVID-19. Data of 15 consecutive patients were sequentially recorded from intensive care unit admission. Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A V trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11-14 after the onset of symptoms. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient. We report a temporal variation of both innate and adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients, helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions (e.g. anti-inflammatory vs. immunostimulatory ones). We describe a defect in virus-specific CD8 T-cells, a potential biomarker of clinical severity.

"Predictors of household food insecurity in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: To examine associations between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics with household food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: Cross-sectional online survey analyzed using univariable tests and a multivariable logistic regression model. Setting: The United States during the week of March 30, 2020. Participants: Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses. Results: 1,517 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 30% reported food insecurity after the COVID-19 outbreak, 53% were women and 72% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident household food insecurity. Black respondents, Hispanic/Latino respondents, and respondents with annual income less than $100,000 were significantly more likely to experience incident household food insecurity. Individuals experiencing incident household food insecurity were 2.09 (95% CI 1.58-2.83) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.88 (95% CI 1.37-2.52) times more likely to screen positively for depression. Conclusions: Food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable. There are strong associations between food insecurity and anxiety/depression. Public health interventions to increase the accessibility of healthful foods, especially for Black and Hispanic/Latino communities, are crucial to relieving the economic stress of this pandemic.","Lauren, B.

"Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown: South London and Maudsley data on working age community and home treatment team services and mortality from February to mid-May 2020","The lockdown and social distancing policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare; however, there has been relatively little quantification of this. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for home treatment teams (HTTs) and working age adult community mental health teams (CMHTs) from 1st February to 15th May 2020 at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM), a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London. In addition daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users over this period and the same dates in 2019. In summary, the CMHT sector showed relatively stable caseloads and total contact numbers, but a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts, while HTTs showed the same changeover but reductions in caseloads and total contacts (although potentially an activity rise again during May).

"Impact on mental health care and on mental health service users of the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods survey of UK mental health care staff","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. Methods: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","Johnson, S.; Dalton-Locke, C.; Vera San Juan, N.; Foye, U.; Oram, S.; Papamichail, A.; Landau, S.; Rowan Olive, R.; Jeynes, T.; Shah, P.; Sheridan Rains, L.; Lloyd-Evans, B.; Carr, S.; Killaspy, H.; Gillard, S.; Simpson, A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129494","20200614","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2251,""
"Effects of physical activity and exercise on well-being in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic","Background: A disease discovered in China, COVID-19, was characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic in March 2020. Many countries in the world implemented social isolation as a strategy to contain the virus transmission. The same physical distancing which protects society from COVID-19 from spreading may have an impact on the mental health and well-being of the population This study aims to shed some light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and SWB among individuals in the social isolation period of COVID-19. Methods: Data were collected in Brazil between March 31st and April 2nd, 2020. All volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement right after reading the Consent Terms. The inclusion criteria were participants over 18 years old who had been in social isolation for at least one week and agreed to the Consent Terms. Three instruments were used: a questionnaire was built for this study which aimed to assess the participants' exercise routine. The second instrument called Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) was also created by these researchers and aimed to assess the relationship between well-being and physical activity during the social isolation period. And the third measure was the Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Findings: A total of 592 participants reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4 (SD=3.3) days. The amount of participants who reported strength training as exercise increased from 31 (5.2%) before isolation to 82 (13.9%) during quarantine. The study shows that well-being related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine is linked to an established routine of physical activity prior to the social isolation period. Interpretation: People who already practiced physical activity feel more motivated to continue practicing during this period and this causes the appearance of positive affects, unlike people who are only now starting to exercise; according to the study, negative aspects can occur for those who are only just starting. In a period of social isolation, it is important that the practice of physical activity is closer to previous habits, also finding that an obligation to exercise during this period when this was not a reality for the person can contribute to an increase in malaise.","de Abreu, J.

"Adverse effects of COVID-19 related lockdown on pain, physical activity and psychological wellbeing in people with chronic pain","Countries across the world imposed lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been proposed that lockdown conditions disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain, requiring adaptation to treatment and care strategies. We investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N=431) relative to a healthy control group (N=88) using an online survey. In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised increases in perceived pain and psychological distress that would be mediated by pain catastrophizing. Survey questions answered during the lockdown period, probing patients self-perceived changes retrospectively, revealed that people with chronic pain perceived increases in their pain severity compared to before lockdown. They were also more adversely affected by lockdown compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise. Pain catastrophizing was found to be an important factor in predicting the extent of self-perceived increases in pain, and accounted for the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also independently predicted perceptions of increased pain. Interestingly, actual changes in pain symptoms (measured at two time points at pre- and post-lockdown in a subgroup, N = 85) did not change significantly on average, but those reporting increases also demonstrated greater baseline levels of pain catastrophizing. Overall, the findings suggest that remote pain management provision to target reduction of catastrophizing and increases to physical activity could be beneficial for chronic pain patients in overcoming the adverse effects of lockdown.","Fallon, N.; Brown, C.; Twiddy, H.; Brian, E.; Frank, B.; Nurmikko, T.; Stancak, A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122564","20200605","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2253,""
"Risk of Depression in Family Caregivers: Unintended Consequence of COVID-19","Background: COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate the symptoms of poor mental health family caregivers. To investigate whether rates of depression increased in caregivers during COVID-19 and whether the unintended consequences of health protective measures, i.e., social isolation, exacerbated this risk. Another aim was to see if caregivers accessed any online/phone psychological support during COVID. Method: Data (1349 caregivers; 7527 non-caregivers) was extracted from Understanding Society, UK population level dataset. The General Health Questionnaire cut-off scores identifying those with and without depression were our primary outcome. Results: After adjustment for confounding caregivers had a higher risk of having depression compared with non-caregivers, Odds ratio (OR) = 1.22 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.05-1.40)), p=.008 evidenced by higher levels of depression pre-COVID-19 (16.7% vs 12.1%) and during COVID-19 (21.6% vs 17.9%), respectively. Further, higher levels of loneliness increased the risk of depression almost 4-fold risk in caregivers, OR = 3.85 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.08-4.85)), p<.001), while access to therapy attenuated the risk (47%. While 60% of caregivers with depression reported not accessing any therapeutic support (e.g., online or face to face) during COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on family caregivers mental health with loneliness a significant contributor to caregivers depression. However, despite these detriments in mental health, the majority of caregivers do not access any online or phone psychiatric support. Reducing feelings of isolation therefore provides an opportunity for psychiatric services and health care professionals to support at-risk caregivers.","Gallagher, S.; Wetherell, M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131532","20200617","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2254,""
"Steep increases in fentanyl-related mortality west of the Mississippi River: synthesizing recent evidence from county and state surveillance","Background and Aims: Overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl), increased 10-fold in the United States from 2013-2018, despite 88% of deaths occurring east of the Mississippi River. Public health professionals have long feared that further spread of fentanyl could greatly exacerbate the opioid epidemic. We aimed to measure and characterize recent fentanyl deaths in jurisdictions west of the Mississippi River. Design: Systematic search of states and counties in the Western U.S. for publicly available data on fentanyl-related deaths since the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics, which cover through December 2018. Longitudinal study using 2019 and 2020 mortality records to identify changes in fentanyl-involved mortality since most recent CDC statistics. Settings: U.S. states west of the Mississippi River. Measurements: Annual rate of fentanyl-involved deaths per 100,000 population. Proportion of fatal heroin-, stimulant, and prescription pill overdoses also involving fentanyl. Findings: We identified nine jurisdictions with publicly available fentanyl death data through December 2019 or later: State of Arizona, Denver County, CO, Harris County, TX, Humboldt County, CA, King County, WA, Los Angeles County, CA, San Francisco County, CA, Siskiyou County, CA, Dallas-Fort Worth, TX metro area (Denton, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant counties. Fentanyl deaths increased in each jurisdiction. Their collective contribution to national synthetic narcotics mortality tripled from 2017 to 2019. First quarter 2020 data (available from all but San Francisco County) showed a 33% growth in fentanyl-mortality over 2019. Fentanyl-involvement in heroin, stimulant, and prescription pill deaths has grown substantially over time. Conclusions: Fentanyl has spread westward, which could dramatically worsen the already severe opioid epidemic in the United States. Increasing standard-dose of naloxone, expanding Medicaid, improving coverage of addiction treatment, and public health educational campaigns should be prioritized.","Shover, C. L.; Falasinnu, T.

"Evaluation of a Novel Therapeutic Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Technique Optimized for Increased Accessibility in Major Depression","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, technical complexity and operational costs might have been barriers for its wide use and implementation in some jurisdictions, thereby decreasing accessibility. OBJECTIVE Our main goal was to test the feasibility of a novel rTMS protocol optimized for practicality, scalability and cost-effectiveness. We hypothesized that our novel rTMS protocol would be simple to implement and well-tolerated, but less costly and allow for more treatment capacity. METHODS Treatment was administered in an open-room setting, allowing a single technician to attend to multiple patients. Large non-focal parabolic coils held by custom-built arms allowed simple yet efficient and accurate placement. We employed a low-frequency (LF) 1 Hz stimulation protocol (360 pulses per session), delivered on the most affordable FDA-approved devices. MDD participants received an initial accelerated rTMS course (arTMS) of 6 sessions/day over 5 days (30 total), followed by a tapering course of daily sessions (up to 25) to decrease the odds of relapse. The self-reported Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to measure severity of depression. RESULTS Forty-eight (48) patients completed the arTMS course. No serious adverse events occurred, and all patients reported manageable pain levels. Response and remission rates were 35.4% and 27.1% on the BDI-II, respectively, at the end of the tapering course. CONCLUSION If rTMS could be delivered for lower cost at higher volume, while preserving efficacy, safety and tolerability, it could warrant further investigation of this treatment as a first-line intervention in MDD.

"Changes in Solo and Partnered Sexual Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a US Probability Survey","Background: Research demonstrates that pandemics adversely impact sexual and reproductive health (SRH), but few have examined their impact on participation in sex. We examined self-reported changes in solo and sexual behaviors in U.S. adults during early stages of the public health response to COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults (N=1010; aged 18-94 years; 62% response rate) from April 10-20, 2020. We used weighted multinomial logistic regression to examine past month self-reported changes (decreased, stable or increased) in ten solo and partnered sexual behaviors. Predictor variables included: having children at home, past month depressive symptoms, (ACHA 3-item scale), past month loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), COVID-19 protection behaviors (adapted 12-item scale), perceived COVID-19 consequences (adapted 10-item scale) and COVID-19 knowledge (adapted 10-item scale). Findings: Nearly half of all adults reported some kind of change, most commonly, a decrease, in their sexual behavior in the past month. Having elementary aged children at home, past month depressive symptoms and loneliness and enacting more COVID-19 protective behaviors were associated with both reduced partnered bonding behaviors, such as hugging, cuddling, holding hands and kissing, as well as reduced partnered sexual behaviors, such as oral sex, partnered genital touching and vaginal sex. Greater COVID19 risk perception and greater COVID19 knowledge were associated with mixed effects in behavior outcomes. Interpretations: Our data illustrate the very personal ways in which different pandemic-associated factors may create or inhibit opportunities for solo and partnered sex. The centrality of sexuality to health and well-being, even during pandemics, means that a critical piece of public health prevention and management responses should is ensuring that services and resource that support positive sexual decision making remain open and available.","Hensel, D.

"Is the psychological well-being of a population associated with COVID-19 related survival?","OBJECTIVE Immunological mind-body research suggests mental health may also be important in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of mental health as a protective factor for COVID-19 related mortality in the general population. METHODS Data sources were the Global Burden of Disease report 2017 and publicly reported situational reports of COVID-19. We described variables; calculated the spearman's correlation coefficient, calculated the percentage of the variability of the data that is explained by the association. We explored inter-relationships among other variables: aged 70 or older, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. A correlation matrix with plotted scatter matrix diagrams was produced. RESULTS Across 181 countries, the mean total COVID-19 related survivors per million was 999,955 (sd=120), median=999,995. The variable had a lognormal distribution; the mean mentally healthy per 100,000 was 85,411 (sd=1,871), median=85,634. The test of normality resulted in p-value < 0.001. Correlation of mentally healthy per 100,0000 and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was s=0.29 (n=181, 95% CI 0.16-0.43). The variance explained by the relation between mental healthy and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was 8.4% (95% CI 2.6 -18.5). CONCLUSION A weak association was found between the psychological well-being of a population and COVID-19 related survival. This relationship explained between 2.6 and 18.5% of COVID-19 related survival.","Feys, F.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123018","20200607","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2258,""
"The inevitability of Covid-19 related distress among healthcare workers: findings from a low caseload country under lockdown","Objectives: To characterize psychological distress and factors associated with distress in healthcare practitioners working during a stringent lockdown in a country (Jordan) with one of the lowest incidence rates of Covid-19 globally. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey sent to physicians, nurses and technicians, and pharmacists working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were potential sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the key outcome. Results: We surveyed 1,006 practitioners (55.3% females). Approximately 63%, 13%, 17% and 7% were nurses/technicians, physicians, pharmacists, and other nonmedical personnel (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, perception of effective protective institutional measures, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician) and working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. Conclusion: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professional resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","Hawari, F.

"Early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care and on people with mental health conditions: framework synthesis of international experiences and responses","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has many potential impacts on people with mental health conditions and on mental health care, including direct consequences of infection, effects of infection control measures and subsequent societal changes. We aimed to map early impacts of the pandemic on people with pre-existing mental health conditions and services they use, and to identify individual and service-level strategies adopted to manage these. Methods We searched for relevant material in the public domain published before 30 April 2020, including papers in scientific and professional journals, published first person accounts, media articles, and publications by governments, charities and professional associations. Search languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Relevant content was retrieved and summarised via a rapid qualitative framework synthesis approach. Results We found 872 eligible sources from 29 countries. Most documented observations and experiences rather than reporting research data. We found many reports of deteriorations in symptoms, and of impacts of loneliness and social isolation and of lack of access to services and resources, but sometimes also of resilience, effective self-management and peer support. Immediate service challenges related to controlling infection, especially in inpatient and residential settings, and establishing remote working, especially in the community. We summarise reports of swiftly implemented adaptations and innovations, but also of pressing ethical challenges and concerns for the future. Conclusion Our analysis captures the range of stakeholder perspectives and experiences publicly reported in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries.

"Closed-loop fMRI neurofeedback to reduce negative attentional bias in depression","Depressed individuals show an attentional bias toward negatively valenced stimuli and thoughts. Here we present a novel closed-loop neurofeedback procedure that seeks to remediate this bias. Internal attentional states were detected by applying machine learning techniques to fMRI data in real-time, and externalized using a visually presented stimulus that the participant could learn to control. We trained 15 depressed and 12 healthy control participants over three fMRI sessions, preceded and followed by behavioral and clinical assessments. Initially, depressed participants were more likely than non-depressed participants to get â€œstuckâ€ in negative attentional states, but this diminished with neurofeedback training relative to controls. Depression severity also decreased from pre- to post-training. These results demonstrate that our method is sensitive to the negative attentional bias in depressed individuals, and its reduction after training showcases the potential of this method as a treatment in the future.","Mennen, Anne C.; Turk-Browne, Nicholas B.; Wallace, Grant; Seok, Darsol; Jaganjac, Adna; Stock, Janet; deBettencourt, Megan T.; Cohen, Jonathan D.; Norman, Kenneth A.; Sheline, Yvette I.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.137943","20200608","","BioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2262,""
"A meta-analysis of cocaine use disorder treatment effectiveness","Background: In both the U.S. and U.K., after a period of decline, prevalence of cocaine use has been increasing since 2012 and is now the second leading cause of overdose death from an illicit drug. However, psychosocial treatments for cocaine use disorders are limited, and no pharmacotherapy is approved by regulatory bodies in the U.S. or Europe. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to assess treatments impacts on cocaine use. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials that included the word ""cocaine"" in the title and were published between 31/12/1995 and 31/12/2017. All studies of outpatient adults with active cocaine use and reporting urinalysis results were included. Treatment approaches were clustered into 11 categories. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. We calculated intention-to-treat log-odds ratios (OR) for the change in proportion of patients testing negative for cocaine at the end of each study and performed multivariate mixed-effects meta-regression. This study was prospectively registered on covidence.org on 31/12/2015, study 8731. Findings: One hundred fifty-seven studies with 15,842 participants were included. Only contingency management was significantly associated with increased odds of testing negative for cocaine (OR of 2.13, 95% CI 1.62-2.80) and remained significant after all sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: This meta-analysis is unique in its broad inclusivity of treatment types and trial designs over a two-decade period of investigation. Our results converge with focused meta-analyses on treatments for cocaine use disorders; thus, research efforts and policy changes that expanded implementation of contingency management programs are expected to reduce cocaine use in active users and the associated individual, community, and societal burdens associated.","Bentzley, B.

"Assessing the influence of parental anxiety on childhood anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates","The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China on December 31st and spread into international borders, leading to a public health crisis and complete shutdown of countries. The strict quarantine measures taken by governments kept a large number of people, around the world, in isolation and affected many aspects of people's lives. These unprecedented changes triggered a wide variety of psychological problems ranging from panic disorders, anxiety and depression. In this study, we aim to explore anxiety levels among parents, teachers and the general community amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE, as well as identify emotional and anxiety disorders in children. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2,200 self-selected assessed volunteers. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale , emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting the highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%) compared to parents only (14.6%) or teachers only (4.7%). Multivariate logistic regression for GAD-7 score showed that females, participants who felt public fear was justifiable, persons who worried about COVID-19, persons who intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smokers were all associated with anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression for SDQ showed parents who had severe anxiety levels were 7 times more likely to report more emotional problems in their children (OR=7.00, 95% CI, 3.45 to 14.0) than less anxious parents. Findings suggest the urgency of policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and teachers and more specifically for vulnerable children.","Saddik, B.; Hussein, A.; Albanna, A.; Elbarazi, I.; Al-Shujairi, A.; Sharif-Askari, F.

"The curvilinear relationship between the age of adults and their mental health in Iran after its peak of COVID-19 cases","The emerging body of research on the predictors of mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed contradictory findings, which prevent effective psychiatry screening for mental health assistance. This study aims to identify the predictors of nonsomatic pain, depression, anxiety, and distress, especially focusing on age as a nonlinear predictor. We conducted a survey of 474 adults in Iran during April 1-10, 2020, when Iran had just passed its first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with new confirmed cases. We found that Age had a curvilinear relationship with nonsomatic pain, depression, and anxiety. Age was associated with pain, depression, and anxiety disorders negatively among adults younger than 45 years, but positively among seniors older than 70 years. Adults who were female, unsure about their chronic diseases, and exercised less per day were more likely to have mental health issues. This study advances the use of age as an effective predictor by uncovering a curvilinear relationship between individuals' age and mental health issues by using a sample of adults across a wide spectrum of ages.

"The impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the experiences and feeding practices of new mothers in the UK: Preliminary data from the COVID-19 New Mum Study","Background: The COVID-19 New Mum Study is recording maternal experiences and infant feeding during the period of UK lockdown. This report from week 1 of the survey aims to (1) provide information relevant for those supporting this population; (2) identify groups currently under-represented in the survey. Methods: Women living in the UK aged [=]18 years with an infant [=]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey (https://is.gd/covid19newmumstudy). Information/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. Results: Between May 27th and June 3rd 2020, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married/with partner, 66% degree/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered before lockdown (BL) and 316 (23%) during lockdown (DL). Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (p<0.001) and 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed or mixed fed versus 39% of BL (p<0.05). Thirteen % reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient support with feeding. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%/9% contacted a mental health professional and 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact and support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby. Conclusion: Lockdown has had an impact on maternal experiences, resulting in distress for many women. Survey participants are currently not representative of the population; notably, groups at greater risk are under-represented. Increasing the diversity of participants is a priority.","Vazquez-Vazquez, A.; Dib, S.; Rougeaux, E.; Wells, J.

"Evaluating the Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Urban South Africa: Perceived Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Childhood Trauma Predict Adult Depressive Symptoms","South Africa's national lockdown introduced serious threats to public mental health in a society where one in three individuals develop a psychiatric disorder during their life. We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves: between August 2019-March 2020 and during the first six weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.062). Adults were two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.016; 95% CI [1.14, 3.49]). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms among adults with histories of childhood trauma during the first six weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources in South Africa.","Kim, A.

"Comparison of Mental Health Symptoms Prior to and During COVID-19 among Patients with Systemic Sclerosis from Four Countries: A Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) Cohort Study","Background: No studies have reported comparisons of mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Objectives were to compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including continuous change scores, proportion with change [=] 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and factors associated with changes, including country. Methods: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change [=] 1 MCID. Findings: Among 435 participants (Canada = 98; France = 159; United Kingdom = 50; United States = 128), mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France, adjusted scores from the United States and United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.9) and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were not significantly different. Odds of increasing by [=] 1 MCID were twice as high for the United Kingdom (2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.2) and United States (1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Participants who used mental health services pre-COVID had adjusted increases 3.7 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.7) less than other participants. Interpretation: Anxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition. Increase was larger in the United Kingdom and United States than in Canada and France but substantially less for people with pre-COVID-19 mental health treatment.","Thombs, B.

"Emotional health concerns of oncology physicians in the United States: fallout during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Cancer care is significantly impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3/27/2020-4/10/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Results: Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: mean age 45.7 +/- 9.6 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate PPE (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p=0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p=0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included: degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values <0.01). Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among oncology physicians in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Our findings highlight factors associated with and sources of psychological distress to be addressed to protect the well-being of oncology physicians.","Thomaier, L.; Teoh, D.; Jewett, P.; Beckwith, H.; Parsons, H.; Yuan, J.; Blaes, A.

"Relative wealth and inequality associate with health in a small-scale subsistence society","In high-income countries, relative wealth and inequality affect health by causing psychosocial stress. We test this hypothesis in a small-scale subsistence society, the Tsimane. We associated relative household wealth (n=1003) and community-level wealth inequality (n=35, Gini = 0.15 - 0.43) with a range of psychosocial and health outcomes (depressive symptoms [n=663], social conflicts [n=393], non-social problems [n=390], social support [n=392], cortisol [n=828], BMI [n=9378], blood pressure [n=1614]), self-rated health [n=809], morbidities [n=3140]) controlling for absolute wealth, age, sex, community size, distance to town and relevant random effects. Relative wealth and inequality were associated with self-rated health and morbidity, especially respiratory disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Tsimane. Inequality was also associated with higher blood pressure. However, psychosocial stress did not mediate these associations, suggesting other mechanisms. These findings are consistent with socio-economic hierarchies affecting some health outcomes in any society, while others might be exacerbated in high-income countries.","Jaeggi, A. V.; Blackwell, A.

"Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in two longitudinal UK population cohorts","Background: The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is unclear. Evidence from longitudinal studies with pre pandemic data are needed to address (1) how mental health has changed from pre-pandemic levels to during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2), whether there are groups at greater risk of poorer mental health during the pandemic? Methods: We used data from COVID-19 surveys (completed through April/May 2020), nested within two large longitudinal population cohorts with harmonised measures of mental health: two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALPSAC): the index generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2850, mean age 28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n= 3720, mean age = 59) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS, (n= 4233, mean age = 59), both with validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and baseline factors. To answer question 1, we used ALSPAC-G1, which has identical mental health measures before and during the pandemic. Question 2 was addressed using both studies, using pre-pandemic and COVID-19 specific factors to explore associations with depression and anxiety in COVID-19. Findings: In ALSPAC-G1 there was evidence that anxiety and lower wellbeing, but not depression, had increased in COVID-19 from pre-pandemic assessments. The percentage of individuals with probable anxiety disorder was almost double during COVID-19: 24% (95% CI 23%, 26%) compared to pre-pandemic levels (13%, 95% CI 12%, 14%), with clinically relevant effect sizes. In both ALSPAC and GS, depression and anxiety were greater in younger populations, women, those with pre-existing mental and physical health conditions, those living alone and in socio-economic adversity. We did not detect evidence for elevated risk in key workers or health care workers. Interpretation: These results suggest increases in anxiety and lower wellbeing that may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or its management, particularly in young people. This research highlights that specific groups may be disproportionally at risk of elevated levels of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 and supports recent calls for increasing funds for mental health services.

"'Drawing on Wisdom to Cope with Adversity:' A Systematic Review Protocol of Older Adults' Mental and Psychosocial Health During Acute Respiratory Disease Propagated-Type Epidemics and Pandemics (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza)","Background: Mental health has become one of the fundamental priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Situations like physical distancing as well as being constantly tagged as the most vulnerable group could expose older adults to mental and psychosocial burdens. Nonetheless, there is little clarity about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar pandemics in the past on the mental illness, wellbeing, and psychosocial health of the older population compared to other age groups. Objectives: To describe the patterns of older adults' mental and psychosocial health related to acute respiratory disease propagated-type epidemics and pandemics and to evaluate the differences with how other age groups respond. Eligibility criteria: quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating mental illness, wellbeing, or psychosocial health outcomes associated with respiratory propagated epidemics and pandemics exposure or periods (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza) in people 65 years or older. Data source: Original articles published until June 1st, 2020, in any language searched in the electronic healthcare and social sciences database: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, WHO Global literature on coronavirus disease database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( - CNKI). Furthermore, EPPI Centre's COVID-19 living systematic map and the publicly available publication list of the COVID-19 living systematic review will be incorporated for preprints and recent COVID-19 publications. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract predefined parameters. The risk of bias will be assessed. Data synthesis: Data synthesis will be performed according to study type and design, type of epidemic and pandemic, types of outcomes (mental health and psychosocial outcomes), and participant characteristics (e.g., sex, race, age, socioeconomic status, food security, presence of dependency in daily life activities independent/dependent older adults). Comparison between sex, race, and other age groups will be performed qualitatively, and quantitatively if enough data is available. The risk of bias and study heterogeneity will be reported for quantitative studies. Conclusion: This study will provide information to take actions to address potential mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and to understand responses on this age group. Furthermore, it will be useful to identify potential groups that are more vulnerable or resilient to the mental-health challenges of the current worldwide pandemic.","Aravena, J.

"Does Gender or Religion Contribute to the Risk of COVID-19 in Hospital Doctors?","The novel coronavirus pandemic is posing significant challenges to healthcare workers (HCWs) in adjusting to redeployed clinical settings and enhanced risk to their own health. Studies suggest a variable impact of COVID-19 based on factors such as age, gender, comorbidities and ethnicity. Workplace measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing (SD) and avoidance of exposure for the vulnerable, mitigate this risk. This online questionnaire-based study explored the impact of gender and religion in addition to workplace measures associated with risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors in acute and mental health institutions in the UK. The survey had 1206 responses, majority (94%) from BAME backgrounds. A quarter of the respondents had either confirmed or suspected COVID-19, a similar proportion reported inadequate PPE and 2/3 could not comply with SD. One third reported being reprimanded in relation to PPE or avoidance of risk. In univariate analysis, age over 50 years, being female, Muslim and inability to avoid exposure in the workplace was associated with risk of COVID-19. On multivariate analysis, inadequate PPE remained an independent predictor with a twofold (OR 2.29, (CI - 1.22-4.33), p=0.01) risk of COVID-19. This study demonstrates that PPE, SD and workplace measures to mitigate risk remain important for reducing risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors. Gender and religion did not appear to be independent determinants. It is imperative that employers consolidate risk reduction measures and foster a culture of safety to encourage employees to voice any safety concerns.","Daga, S.; Jafferbhoy, S.; Menon, G.; Ali, M.; Chakravorty, S.; Ghani, S.; Burney, A.; Bamrah, J.; Mehta, R.; Chakravorty, I.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20125450","20200619","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2273,""
"Trajectories of depressive symptoms among vulnerable groups in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many aspects of the human condition, including mental health and psychological wellbeing. This study examined trajectories of depressive symptoms (DST) over time among vulnerable individuals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample consisted of 51,417 adults recruited from the COVID-19 Social Study. Depressive symptoms were measured on seven occasions (21st March - 2nd April), using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic vulnerabilities included non-white ethnic background, low socio-economic position (SEP), and type of work (keyworker versus no keyworker). Health-related and psychosocial vulnerabilities included pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological and/or physical abuse, and low social support. Group-based DST were derived using latent growth mixture modelling and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the association between these vulnerabilities and DSTs. Model estimates were adjusted for age, sex, and suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Three DSTs were identified: low [N=30,850 (60%)] moderate [N=14,911 (29%)], and severe [N=5,656 (11%)] depressive symptoms. DSTs were relatively stable across the first 6 weeks of lockdown. After adjusting for covariates, experiences of physical/psychological abuse (OR 13.16, 95% CI 12.95-13.37), pre-existing mental health conditions (OR 13.00 95% CI 12.87-13.109), pre-existing physical health conditions (OR 3.41, 95% CI 3.29-3.54), low social support (OR 12.72, 95% CI 12.57-12.86), and low SEP (OR 5.22, 95% CI 5.08-5.36) were significantly associated with the severe DST. No significant association was found for ethnicity (OR 1.07, 95% 0.85-1.28). Participants with key worker roles were less likely to experience severe depressive symptoms (OR 0.66, 95% 0.53-0.80). Similar but smaller patterns of associations were found for the moderate DST. Conclusions: People with psychosocial and health-related risk factors, as well as those with low SEP seem to be most vulnerable to experiencing moderate or severe depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Frank, P.; Iob, E.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126300","20200611","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2274,""

"Syndromic surveillance insights from a symptom assessment app before and during COVID-19 measures in Germany and the United Kingdom: results from repeated cross-sectional analyses","Background: Unprecedented lockdown measures have been introduced in countries across the world to mitigate the spread and consequences of COVID-19. While attention has focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. Objective: To explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. Methods: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an Ada assessment in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) was conducted between two periods: before and after the implementation of Phase One COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-squared test and reported as Log2 Fold Changes (Log2 FC). Results: Between 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Between 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the UK reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; UK 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority (Germany 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; UK 50,900/68,800, 73.91%) were aged between 10 and 29 years, and about a quarter (Germany 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; UK 14,900/68,800, 21.65%) were between 30-59 years. 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were found in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (Log2 FC, P-value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. Fourteen of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. Conclusions: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","Mehl, A.; Bergey, F.; Cawley, C.; Gilsdorf, A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.20126466","20200619","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2276,""
"Work-related and Personal Factors Associated with Mental Well-being during COVID-19 Response: A Survey of Health Care and Other Workers","Objective: Measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work-exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and describe work-related and personal factors associated with mental health and well-being. Design: Observational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. Setting: Medical and main campuses of a university. Participants: All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows. Exposures: Work factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings; personal factors including demographics and family/home stressors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. Results: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusions and Implications: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being.","Evanoff, B. A.; Strickland, J. R.; Dale, A.

"Predictors of Mental Health during the early Covid-19 Pandemic in the US: role of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing","Objective: To assess mental health in the US adult population in the Covid-19 pandemic and explore the roles of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing in shaping mental health outcomes. Methods: We analyze online survey data from the ""Understanding America Study"" (UAS) that is representative of the US adult population and covers the period of March 10-31st 2020 (sample size: 6436). Results: About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential impact of the virus on respondents' own health and the practice of social distancing also predicted the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms, albeit less strongly. Conclusions: Our findings point towards a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic in the US. They also highlight the importance of economic countermeasures and social policy for mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on adult mental health in the US over and above an effective public health response.","Kampfen, F.; Kohler, I.

"Potential involvement of monoamine oxidase activity in SARS-COV2 infection and delirium onset","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a range of extra-respiratory signs and symptoms. One such manifestation is delirium, an acute confusional state occurring in 60-70% of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. Delirium is also a common clinical syndrome following planned orthopedic surgery. This investigation initially explored the underlying role of metabolism in delirium-susceptibility in this setting. Metabolomics profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood taken prior to surgery found significant concentration differences of several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines were observed in delirium-prone patients. Phenethylamine (PEA) concentrations in delirium-prone patients was significantly lower in CSF than in blood, whilst in age- and gender-matched controls the opposite was observed (adjusted p values: 1.8x10-6 (control) and 1.788x10-10 (delirium)). PEA is metabolised by monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), a putative enzyme target for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and depression. Our computational structural comparisons of MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 found high similarity, specifically within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. MAOB structural alignment to ACE2 was 51% overall, but this was over 95% in the ACE2-spike protein binding region. Thus, it is possible that the spike protein interacts with MAOB on a molecular level. A previously published metabolomic dataset of control subjects and patients with either mild or severe COVID-19 was then analysed. Major concentration differences in some metabolites attributed to altered MAO activity were detected. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 influences MAOB activity, which is one potential cause for the many observed neurological and platelet based complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cuperlovic-Culf, M.; Cunningham, E.

"Toward in vivo-relevant hERG safety assessment and mitigation strategies based on relationships between non-equilibrium blocker binding, three-dimensional channel-blocker interactions, dynamic occupancy, dynamic exposure, and cellular arrhythmia","The human ether-a-go-go-related voltage-gated cardiac ion channel (commonly known as hERG) conducts the rapid outward repolarizing potassium current in cardiomyocytes (IKr). Inadvertent blockade of this channel by drug-like molecules represents a key challenge in pharmaceutical R&D due to frequent overlap between the structure-activity relationships of hERG and many primary targets. Building on our previous work, together with recent cryo-EM structures of hERG, we set about to better understand the energetic and structural basis of promiscuous blocker-hERG binding in the context of Biodynamics theory. We propose a two-step blocker binding process consisting of: Diffusion of a single fully solvated blocker copy into a large cavity lined by the intracellular cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (the initial capture step). Occupation of this cavity is a necessary but insufficient condition for ion current disruption. Translocation of the captured blocker along the channel axis (the IKr disruption step), such that: The head group, consisting of a quasi-linear moiety, projects into the open pore, accompanied by partial de-solvation of the binding interface. One tail moiety packs along a kink between the S6 helix and proximal C-linker helix adjacent to the intra-cellular entrance of the pore, likewise accompanied by mutual de-solvation of the binding interface (noting that the association barrier is comprised largely of the total head + tail group de-solvation cost). Blockers containing a highly planar moiety that projects into a putative constriction zone within the closed channel become trapped upon closing, as do blockers terminating prior to this region. A single captured blocker molecule may associate and dissociate from the pore many times before exiting the CNBHD cavity. Lastly, we highlight possible flaws in the current hERG safety index (SI) and propose an alternate in vivo-relevant strategy factoring in: Benefit/risk. The predicted arrhythmogenic fractional hERG occupancy (based on action potential simulations of the undiseased human ventricular cardiomyocyte). Alteration of the safety threshold due to underlying disease. Risk of exposure escalation toward the predicted arrhythmic limit due to patient-to-patient pharmacokinetic variability, drug-drug interactions, overdose, and use for off-label indications in which the hERG safety parameters may differ from their on-label counterparts.","Wan, Hongbin; Selvaggio, Gianluca; Pearlstein, Robert A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.139899","20200608","","BioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2280,""
"A â€œDeep Diveâ€ into the SARS-Cov-2 Polymerase Assembly: Identifying Novel Allosteric Sites and Analyzing the Hydrogen Bond Networks and Correlated Dynamics","Replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a fundamental step in the virus life cycle and inhibiting the SARS-CoV2 replicase machinery has been proven recently as a promising approach in combating the virus. Despite this recent success, there are still several aspects related to the structure, function and dynamics of the CoV-2 polymerase that still need to be addressed. This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotidesâ€™ substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotidesâ€™ substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three â€œdruggableâ€ allosteric sites within the nsp12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.","Barakat, Khaled; Ahmed, Marawan; Tabana, Yasser; Ha, Minwoo","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.130849","20200603","","BioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2281,""
"Worries and concerns among healthcare workers during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic: a web-based cross-sectional survey","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) treating and caring for patients with emerging infectious diseases often experience psychological distress. However, the psychological impact and behavior change of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among HCWs are still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the worries and concerns of HCWs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, a web-based questionnaire was distributed among HCWs working in hospitals or clinics across Japanese medical facilities from April 20 to May 1, 2020. The questionnaire comprised items on demographics, worries and concerns, perceptions regarding the sufficiency of information, and behavioral changes pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 4386 HCWs completed the survey; 1648 (64.7%) were aged 30-39 years, 2379 (54.2%) were male, and 782 (18.1%) were frontline HCWs, directly caring for patients with COVID-19 on a daily basis. 3500 HCWs (79.8%) indicated that they were seriously worried about the pandemic. The most frequent concern was the consequence of becoming infected on their family, work, and society (87.4%). Additionally, the majority (55.5%) had restricted social contact and almost all HCWs endorsed a shortage in personal protective equipment (median, 8/9 (interquartile range; 7-9) on a Likert scale). There was no significant difference in the degree of worry between frontline and non-frontline HCWs (8/9 (7-9) vs. 8/9 (7-9), p=0.25). Frontline HCWs, compared to non-frontline HCWs, were more likely to have the need to avoid contact with families and friends (24.8% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001) and indicated that they cannot evade their professional duty during the COVID-19 pandemic (9/9 (7-9) vs. 8/9 (6-9), p<0.001). Further, the extremely low proportion of frontline HCWs reported that they would take a leave of absence to avoid infection (1.2%). Conclusions: Both frontline and non-frontline HCWs expressed comparable concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Because HCWs, especially frontline HCWs, reported that they cannot be obliged to do avoid their duty, effective mental health protection strategies should be developed and implemented for HCWs.","Sahashi, Y.; Endo, H.; Sugimoto, T.; Nabeta, T.; Nishizaki, K.; Kikuchi, A.; Matsumoto, S.; Sato, H.; Goto, T.; Hasegawa, K.; Matsue, Y.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126045","20200609","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2282,""
"Y disruption, autosomal hypomethylation and poor male lung cancer survival","Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide1. It is male predominant and for reasons that are unknown also associated with significantly worse outcomes in men2. Here we compared gene co-expression networks in affected and unaffected pulmonary tissue derived from 126 patients with Stage IA-IV lung cancer. We observed marked degradation of a sex-associated gene co-expression network in tumour tissue. The disturbance was linked to fractional loss of the Y chromosome and was detected in 28% of male tumours in the discovery dataset and 27% of male tumours in a 123 sample replication dataset. Depression of Y chromosome expression was accompanied by extensive autosomal DNA hypomethylation. The male specific H3K4 demethylase, KDM5D, was identified as an apex hub within this co-expression network. Male patients exhibiting relative tumour KDM5D deficiency had an increased risk of death in the discovery dataset (Hazard Ratio [HR] 3.80, 95% CI 1.40 - 10.3, P=0.009) and in an independent sample of 1,100 male lung tumours (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.4-2.0, P=1.2x10-10). Our findings identify tumour-specific weakening of male-specific expression, in particular deficiency of KDM5D, as a common replicable prognostic marker and credible mechanism underlying sex disparity in cancer.","Willis-Owen, S.

"Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection, exposure risk and mental health among a cohort of essential retail workers in the United States","Objectives: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) infection and exposure risks among grocery retail workers, and to investigate their mental health state during the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Results: Among 104 workers tested, twenty-one (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six percent positive cases were asymptomatic. After multi-variate adjustments, employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 4.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 32.0) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while smokers had an odds of 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.8) having positive assay. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (i.e. GAD-7 score > 4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.7) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.6) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Conclusions: We found a considerable asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among grocery workers. Employees with direct costumer exposure were 5 times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while cigarette smokers were 90% less likely to have positive assays. Those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had significantly lower risk of anxiety or depression.","Lan, F.-Y.; Suharlim, C.; Kales, S.

"Current and Future Challenges in the Delivery of Mental Healthcare during COVID-19","The USA is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric symptoms in healthcare workers, those with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population. We highlight the challenges ahead and discuss the increased relevance of telepsychiatry. We analyzed all available literature available as of March 25, 2020, on PubMed, Ovid Medline, and PsychInfo. We utilized the MeSH term â€œcovid AND (psychiatry OR mental health)â€ and included all articles. Duplicates were removed resulting in 32 articles, of which 19 are cited. Four additional references are included to examine suicide data. During the review process, an additional 7 articles were identified which are also included. Frontline healthcare workers are currently experiencing increased psychiatric symptoms and this is more severe in females and nurses. Non-frontline healthcare workers, as well as the general population, are experiencing vicarious traumatization. People with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population, face increased psychiatric symptom burden. Migrant workers, the elderly, children, and the homeless may be disproportionately impacted. Suicide rates may be impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe disruption to the delivery of mental healthcare. Psychiatric facilities are facing unprecedented disruptions in care provision as they struggle to manage an infected population with comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Telepsychiatry is a flawed but reasonable solution to increase the availability of mental healthcare during COVID-19.","Gautam, Mohan; Thakrar, Anjali; Akinyemi, Esther; Mahr, Greg","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00348-3","20200611","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2285,""
"Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?","INTRODUCTION: Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive peptides/proteins, immune molecules and inflammatory mediators which are known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. OBJECTIVE: Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimerâ€™s, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. METHODOLOGY: We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. CONCLUSION: More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.","Maximus, Pierre S.; Al Achkar, Zeina; Hamid, Pousette F.; Hasnain, Syeda S.; Peralta, Cesar A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144","20200616","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2286,""
"Taking social support into account regarding the mental health of healthcare practitioners involved in treating COVID-19 patients","While the WHO has already published its mental health and psychosocial considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been almost no discussion of the specific measures that healthcare institutions should take with regard to the mental health of healthcare practitioners. We would like to take this occasion to propose a perspective on this matter from research on social support. Social support can be classified in various ways such as informational, appraisal, instrumental, and emotional. When battling an unknown virus such as this one, having correct informational support is necessary above all else. It is also important that appropriate evaluation for the contribution of practitioners in the institutions as appraisal support. Instrumental support, meanwhile, refers to guaranteeing a system where practitioners can get adequate rest and not excessively strain themselves, and emotional support is when practitioners are shown adequate understanding and appreciation by those around them. There is another view that categorizes social support by how it is given and received: received support and perceived support. It is important for practitioners to receive perceived support, because perceived support is confirmed to have a positive effect on physical and mental health. For the sake of the physical and mental health of healthcare practitioners, it is important for healthcare sites and organizations to take social support into account and for healthcare institutions to adopt the perspective of social support in their day-to-day operations.","Yamamoto, Kenji; Kimoto, Keitaro; Watanabe, Natsuru; Hoshiyama, Sintaro; Kamiyama, Satoshi; Onishi, Yuichi; Mikami, Katsunaka","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.001","20200610","","Elsevier; PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2287,""
"Is investing in religious institutions a viable pathway to reduce mortality in the population?","There is established and consistent findings from epidemiologic studies, among individuals, that religionâ€” broadly assessed through frequency of attending worship servicesâ€”is associated with lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality attributed to suicide, alcohol, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Religious norms, social support, character, virtue, compassion, love, generosity, and religious community are among some mechanisms purported to explain lower mortality, on aggregate. The religious ecology or characteristics of religion within an area or geographic level (e.g., county, ZIP-code, country), has been linked with overall and cause-specific mortality, but directions of findings are mixed. Mechanisms to explain the links between the religious ecology and mortality included social integration, civic engagement, and social control. The manuscript (SSM-D-19-03928R2) adds a fresh and timely perspective by investigating another mechanism: investment in local healthcare spending. The study found some support of an indirect association from county-level religious denominational composition, through investments in health spending, on Black and White all-cause mortality rates. Should society or government invest finances in religious institutions to indirectly improve population health? This work adds evidence to debate that question. Future work on the topic will need to address several conceptual and methodological challenges. Conceptually, is investigating the market share of religious denominations (i.e., % Catholics vs % Protestants) relevant today given diversity in population and declining trends of worship attendance? Is mortality the most relevant for moving policy or should the focus be on well-being? Methodologically, are there alternate observable measures religious investments/spending in the local economy? Mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities for social epidemiology research on this topic are discussed.","Ransome, Yusuf","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113106","20200608","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2288,""

"End of Life Care in Individuals with Serious Mental Illness","BACKGROUND: Approximately 4.5% of the population live with serious mental illness (SMI), a term referring to mental health disorders that are chronic, impair function, and require ongoing treatment. People living with SMI are at risk of premature mortality relative to people without SMI. Chronic medical illnesses contribute significantly to mortality among individuals with SMI. The standard of care for individuals with serious medical illnesses includes palliative care. However, the provision of palliative care has not been operationalized for individuals with SMI. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: This narrative review presents existing epidemiologic data on end-of-life (EOL) care and palliative care for individuals with comorbid serious medical illness and SMI. Challenges in the care of such patients are discussed. The role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist in providing EOL care for individuals with SMI is delineated with an eye towards redressing disparities. RESULTS: Individuals with SMI are at risk of sub-optimal end-of-life care. Patient, clinician, and system-level factors all contribute to disparities including decreased access to palliative care, uneven continued engagement with mental health services, and low rates of advance care planning. CL psychiatrists can use their expertise at the intersection of medicine and psychiatry to address such disparities by (1) correcting misassumptions, (2) promoting advance care planning, (3) engaging long-term caregivers, (4) recognizing social needs, (5) ensuring ongoing access to psychiatric treatment, and (6) addressing suffering.

CL psychiatrists have expertise to ally with medical providers and redress these disparities.","Shalev, Daniel; Fields, Lauren; Shapiro, Peter A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.003","20200612","","Elsevier; PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2292,""
"Psychosocial factors and hospitalisations for COVID-19: Prospective cohort study based on a community sample","BACKGROUND: While certain infectious diseases have been linked to socioeconomic disadvantage, mental health problems, and lower cognitive function, relationships with COVID-19 are either uncertain or untested. Our objective was to examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 were ascertained between 16(th) March and 26(th) April 2020. RESULTS: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 England-based study members. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function â€“ verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend =0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85).

"COVID-19 Impact on Well-Being and Education in Radiology Residencies: a survey of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced rapid evolution of the healthcare environment. Efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus through social distancing and shelter-at-home edicts have unintended consequences upon clinical and educational missions and mental well-being of radiology departments. We sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology residencies with respect to the educational mission and perceptions of impact on well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was IRB exempt. An anonymous 22 question survey regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educational and clinical missions of residencies, its perceived impact upon morale of radiologists and trainees and a query of innovative solutions devised in response, was emailed to the APDR membership. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkeyÂ® (San Mateo, California). RESULTS: Respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their residency programs. Regarding the educational mission impact, 70.1% (75/107) report moderate/marked negative impact and 2.8% (3/107) that educational activities have ceased. Regarding the pandemic's impact on resident morale, 44.8% (48/107) perceive moderate/marked negative effect; perceived resident morale in programs with redeployment is significantly worse with 57.1% (12/21) reporting moderate/marked decrease. Respondents overwhelmingly report adequate resident access to mental health resources during the acute phase of the pandemic (88.8%, 95/107). Regarding morale of program directors, 61% (65/106) report either mild or marked decreased morale. Program innovations reported by program directors were catalogued and shared.

RÃ©sultats. â€“ Nous rappelons les rÃ©percussions collectives des risques lÃ©taux de masse Ã©mergents, et en particulier des agents infectieux viraux, avant dâ€™aborder les modÃ¨les scientifiques existants de confinement collectif dâ€™aprÃ¨s les opÃ©rations militaires en zone hostile, les missions dâ€™hivernage polaire et de conquÃªte aÃ©rospatiale. Il apparaÃ®t que pour lâ€™Ã©tude dâ€™un confinement global, quelque peu Ã©tudiÃ© lors de pandÃ©mies antÃ©rieures, les conceptions de lâ€™adaptation au stress et de lâ€™adaptation psychodynamique sâ€™avÃ¨rent pertinents. Nous dÃ©taillons les consÃ©quences psychologiques du confinement sur les santÃ©s psychiques individuelles et leurs contre-mesures en fonction de trois typologies populationnelles : population gÃ©nÃ©rale, population des soignants en premiÃ¨re ligne contre lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie, et population des sujets dÃ©jÃ  en souffrance psychique ou voyant leurs troubles rÃ©apparaÃ®tre. Nous faisons Ã©galement rÃ©fÃ©rence aux travaux de psychologie cognitive sociale explicitant comment, en situation anxiogÃ¨ne, les raisonnements peuvent Ãªtre biaisÃ©s et conduire Ã  des choix sâ€™avÃ©rant in fine peu rationnels, de lâ€™avis mÃªme de ceux qui les ont faits. La situation actuelle dans le domaine de la santÃ© est en cela propice, comme en tÃ©moigne le Â« dÃ©bat sur la chloroquine Â» largement relayÃ© dans les mÃ©dias et sur les rÃ©seaux sociaux, opposant des conclusions le plus souvent tranchÃ©es Ã  partir de connaissances dâ€™un certain degrÃ© de scientificitÃ©, dâ€™une part, mais aussi en fonction de ce qui semble Ãªtre les fantasmes de tous ceux qui recherchent soit un remÃ¨de miracle, soit une occasion de faire prospÃ©rer une Â« thÃ©orie du complot Â», dâ€™autre part. Discussion. â€“ Les rÃ©percussions psychologiques du confinement apparaissent conditionnÃ©es par les multiples formes que peut prendre ce dernier : volontaire ou subi, plus ou moins prolongÃ©, passÃ© chez soi ou dans un autre lieu, vÃ©cu dans lâ€™isolement individuel ou en petite communautÃ©, associÃ© Ã  dâ€™autres facteurs de stress et/ou traumatiques, etc. Le confinement Ã  domicile dâ€™une population Ã  lâ€™Ã©chelle dâ€™un pays nâ€™a jamais Ã©tÃ© Ã©valuÃ©. Cette expÃ©rience nous semble confronter globalement notre sociÃ©tÃ© au tabou de la mort qui sâ€™impose, mort de plus en plus Ã©ludÃ©e au fur et Ã  mesure que lâ€™Â« homme occidental Â» tente de sâ€™Ã©loigner de ses origines terrestres. En ce sens, des rÃ©percussions de type psychotraumatique sont Ã  prÃ©venir. Afin de faire face Ã  de multiples enjeux, le systÃ¨me de soins sâ€™est adaptÃ© avec notamment le dÃ©veloppement de lâ€™usage dâ€™Internet pour la mise Ã  disposition dâ€™informations destinÃ©es Ã  mieux vivre le confinement, ou encore la gÃ©nÃ©ralisation de la psychothÃ©rapie Ã  distance qui pose autant de questions quâ€™elle apporte de rÃ©ponses. Ces intrications des techniques informatiques dans lâ€™espace de la psychothÃ©rapie, techniques envers lesquelles nous avions quelques mÃ©fiances, se sont imposÃ©es aussi rapidement que le virus : Ã  charge aux cliniciens et aux chercheurs dâ€™en mesurer les enjeux et les consÃ©quences. Conclusion. â€“ Des programmes de santÃ© publique pourraient voir le jour sur le modÃ¨le de ceux dÃ©jÃ  existants afin de prendre en charge des troubles chroniques endÃ©miques bien connus : protection contre les effets dâ€™une alimentation dÃ©sÃ©quilibrÃ©e associÃ©e Ã  la sÃ©dentaritÃ©, lutte contre le tabagisme et lâ€™alcoolisme, prÃ©vention des conduites auto-agressives, etc. Il nous faudra aussi soutenir les soignants qui ont Ã©tÃ© en premiÃ¨re ligne et qui sortiront Ã©prouvÃ©s de cette pandÃ©mie : en dÃ©pendra la pÃ©rennitÃ© des capacitÃ©s dâ€™action de notre systÃ¨me de soins pour revenir Ã  son Ã©tat nominal et aussi peut-Ãªtre, pour quâ€™il puisse faire face Ã  dâ€™autres crises, notamment sociales. Abstract Background. â€“ The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. â€“ We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. â€“ We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. â€“ We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. â€“ The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. â€“ Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001","20200605","","Elsevier; PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2295,""
"Gender and Fear of COVID-19 in a Cuban Population Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency that could potentially have a serious impact on public health. Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male. Our results corroborate international research that indicate a greater psychological vulnerability in women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result points to the need to design interventions that reduce the negative impact of the current outbreak on womenâ€™s mental health.","Broche-PÃ©rez, Yunier; FernÃ¡ndez-Fleites, Zoylen; JimÃ©nez-Puig, Elizabeth; FernÃ¡ndez-Castillo, Evelyn; RodrÃ­guez-Martin, Boris C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00343-8","20200612","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2296,""

"Aging and Feeling Valued Versus Expendable During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: a Review and Commentary of Why Mattering Is Fundamental to the Health and Well-Being of Older Adults","The current commentary and review examines the potentially protective role of feelings of mattering among elderly people during typical times and the current atypical times associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Mattering is the feeling of being important to others in ways that give people the sense that they are valued and other people care about them. We contrast this feeling with messages of not mattering and being expendable and disposable due to ageism, gaps in the provision of care, and apparently economically focused positions taken during the pandemic that disrespect the value, worth, and merits of older persons. We provide a comprehensive review of past research on individual differences in mattering among older adults and illustrate the unique role of mattering in potentially protecting older adults from mental health problems. Mattering is also discussed in terms of its links with loneliness and physical health. This article concludes with a discussion of initiatives and interventions that can be modified and enhanced to instill a sense of mattering among older adults. Key directions for future research are also highlighted along with ways to expand the mattering concept to more fully understand and appreciate the relevance of mattering among older adults.","Flett, Gordon L.; Heisel, Marnin J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00339-4","20200615","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-03","",2298,""
