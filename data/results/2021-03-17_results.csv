"Impact of booster COVID-19 vaccine for Moroccan adults: A discrete age-structured model approach","Public health control strategies, such as lockdown, seem to be effective in reducing the spread of the pandemic, but are ineffective as a whole since lockdown is responsible of global economic crisis and badly lived by the majority of children and adults who have developed mental health disorders and familial problems as well. Thus, the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is needed to control this disease. We have developed a discrete age-structured model and followed the Moroccan vaccination program to assess the impact of booster vaccination targeting Moroccan adults against COVID-19. Using the derived model, we estimated some relevant model parameters related to COVID-19 using collected cumulative mortality and reported Moroccan data. A control reproduction number R_{c}, which determines the necessary level of vaccine uptake that lead to COVID-19 eradication is determined. Furthermore, a herd immunity threshold above which the population can be protected from COVID-19 infection is derived. Analyzing the model, sufficient and necessary conditions for the eradication of the disease are obtained as well. Next, we perform numerical simulations to study the impact of several uptake levels of the potential vaccine on the persistence and the extinction of COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the COVID-19 is expected to last past 2021 in the absence of a vaccination program. Moreover, a vaccination of the adult population at rate 0.6% per day needs at least 67% of vaccine efficacy and 90% of immunogenicity rate to eradicate the disease. Using Sinopharm vaccine, the herd immunity can be achieved when about half of Moroccan adult population is immunized against the COVID-19. However, using Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, less than 60% of adult population must be immunized against the disease to achieve the herd immunity. Finally, if vaccine efficacy is about 80% and the immunogenicity is about 50% then vaccinating adults at rate of 0.6% per day could protect roughly 22% of children from COVID-19 infection.","Aayah Hammoumi; Hanane Hmarrass; Redouane Qesmi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.14.21253555","20210317","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",11941,""

"A Risk Exchange: Health and Mobility in the Context of Climate and Environmental Change in Bangladeshâ€”A Qualitative Study","Background: Climate change influences patterns of human mobility and health outcomes  While much of the climate change and migration discourse is invested in quantitative predictions and debates about whether migration is adaptive or maladaptive, less attention has been paid to the voices of the people moving in the context of climate change with a focus on their health and wellbeing  This qualitative research aims to amplify the voices of migrants themselves to add nuance to dominant migration narratives and to shed light on the real-life challenges migrants face in meeting their health needs in the context of climate change  Methods: We conducted 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews with migrants purposefully selected for having moved from rural Bhola, southern Bangladesh to an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh  Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis under the philosophical underpinnings of phenomenology  Coding was conducted using NVivo Pro 12  Findings: We identified two overarching themes in the thematic analysis: Firstly, we identified the theme â€œA risk exchange: Exchanging climate change and health risks at origin and destinationâ€  Rather than describing a â€œnet positiveâ€ or â€œnet negativeâ€ outcome in terms of migration in the context of climate change, migrants described an exchange of hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities at origin with those at destination, which challenged their capacity to adapt  This theme included several sub-themesâ€”income and employment factors, changing food environment, shelter and water sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) conditions, and social capital  The second overarching theme was â€œA changing health and healthcare environmentâ€  This theme also included several sub-themesâ€”changing physical and mental health status and a changing healthcare environment encompassing quality of care and barriers to accessing healthcare  Migrants described physical and mental health concerns and connected these experiences with their new environment  These two overarching themes were prevalent across the dataset, although each participant experienced and expressed them uniquely  Conclusion: Migrants who move in the context of climate change face a range of diverse health risks at the origin, en route, and at the destination  Migrating individuals, households, and communities undertake a risk exchange when they decide to move, which has diverse positive and negative consequences for their health and wellbeing  Along with changing health determinants is a changing healthcare environment where migrants face different choices, barriers, and quality of care  A more migrant-centric perspective as described in this paper could strengthen migration, climate, and health governance  Policymakers, urban planners, city corporations, and health practitioners should integrate the risk exchange into practice and policies","Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia, Baernighausen, Kate, Karim, Sayeda, Raihan, Tauheed Syed, Selim, Samiya, Baernighausen, Till, Danquah, Ina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052629","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;18(5):2629, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;18(5):2629, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",11949,""

"Changes in psychotic-like experiences and related influential factors in technical secondary school and college students during COVID-19","Objective Although students have been found to be at high risk of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the pandemic's impact on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs)  We conducted a study in technical secondary school and college students before and during the pandemic to explore changes in PLEs and relevant influential factors  Methods A total of 938 students completed both waves of the survey through electronic questionnaires  PLEs were assessed using the 15-item Positive Subscale of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-P15)  Childhood trauma, perceived stress, resilience, and demographic factors were evaluated at baseline, and psychological status was measured during the pandemic  Results The overall CAPE-P15 scores significantly decreased during the pandemic  Students with persistent PLEs showed the most severe COVID-19 related psychological symptoms, followed by new-onset and remitted individuals;those without PLEs exhibited the mildest symptoms (all pÂ &lt;Â  001)  A single parent family (ORÂ =Â 4 707), more childhood trauma (ORÂ =Â 1 056), and a higher family income (ORÂ =Â 1 658) were predictive of new-onset PLEs during the pandemic, while better resilience was a protective factor, associated with remission of previous PLEs (ORÂ =Â 0 932)  Conclusions Despite a downward trend in the prevalence of PLEs during the pandemic, PLEs predict greater serious psychological impact due to COVID-19, especially for students with persistent PLEs  Interventions that cultivate students' resilience are urgently needed to reduce PLEs and improve mental health, especially for students from single parent households or those who have experienced childhood trauma","Sun, Meng, Wang, Dongfang, Jing, Ling, Zhou, Liang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2021.02.015","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Schizophrenia Research;231:3-9, 2021.; Publication details: Schizophrenia Research;231:3-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",11958,""

Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece. All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS scoreÃ¢â€°Â¥13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p&lt;0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p&lt;0.001).

"Neuropsychiatric Complications of COVID-19","To describe the presentation, etiologies, and suggested management of post-acute COVID-19 neuropsychiatric symptoms. Over 30% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may exhibit cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety that persist for months after discharge. These symptoms are even more common in patients who required intensive care for severe effects of the virus. In addition to the pandemic-related psychological stress, multiple biological mechanisms have been proposed to understand the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed with COVID-19. Given limited research regarding effective interventions, we recommend pharmacologic and behavioral strategies with established evidence in other medically-ill populations. Long-term, neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19 are common and consequential. Because these are likely to co-occur with other medical problems, patients recovering from COVID-19 are best managed in clinics with highly coordinated care across disciplines and medical specialties. Future research is needed to inform appropriate interventions.","Nakamura, Nash, Laughon, Rosenstein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01237-9","20210316","COVID-19; Mental health; Neurocognitive; Neuropsychiatric; Post-COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",11998,""
"[Implementation and evaluation of aÃ‚Â telephone hotline for professional mental health first aid during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany]","The COVID-19 pandemic represents aÃ‚Â significant psychological burden for many people; however, especially during the first wave of the pandemic in Germany, little acute professional help was available for people in need. In southern Germany, aÃ‚Â telephone hotline for psychological first aid for COVID-19-related burdens was set up under the lead of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration, opened to the entire population and evaluated in April 2020. In the period from 22 April to 24 July 2020, 753 volunteer psychotherapeutically trained counselors from different professional groups answered aÃ‚Â total of 8096 calls. Depression symptoms (36%), anxiety symptoms (18%) and psychotic symptoms (19%) were most frequently reported. Every second call was related to aÃ‚Â previous mental illness. During the counseling sessions, which lasted 25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯min on average, aÃ‚Â variety of psychological acute interventions were conducted. In the presence of unclear symptoms, psychotic symptoms or severe personality disorder symptoms, the counselors were able to help significantly less compared to the remaining calls in which other clearly defined symptoms were present. The results point to both the benefits and limitations of hotline services. The major benefits relate to the fast availability and effective professional help for people with clearly characterized symptoms. In the case of unclear or complex symptoms, immediate help by telephone seems to be possible only to aÃ‚Â limited extent, but it could initiate access to further help offers. Overall, the results of this study provide aÃ‚Â first indication that hotline services for psychological first aid are feasible under pandemic conditions.

In Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg wurde unter FederfÃƒÂ¼hrung des Ministeriums fÃƒÂ¼r Soziales und Integration im April 2020 eine Telefonhotline zur psychologischen Ersthilfe bei Corona-assoziierten Problemen implementiert, fÃƒÂ¼r die gesamte BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung geÃƒÂ¶ffnet und evaluiert. Im Zeitraum vom 22.04. bis zum 24.07.2020 nahmen 753 ehrenamtliche, psychotherapeutisch ausgebildete Berater*innen unterschiedlicher Berufsgruppen insgesamt 8096 Anrufe entgegen. Es wurden vor allem Depressions- (36Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), Angst- (18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) und psychotische Symptome (19Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) berichtet. Dabei stand jeder zweite Anruf im Zusammenhang mit einer vorbestehenden psychischen Erkrankung. In den durchschnittlich 25-minÃƒÂ¼tigen BeratungsgesprÃƒÂ¤chen wurde eine Vielzahl psychologischer Akutinterventionen durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Beim Vorliegen einer unklaren Symptomatik, psychotischer Symptomatik oder Symptomen schwerer PersÃƒÂ¶nlichkeitsstÃƒÂ¶rungen konnten die Berater*innen aus deren subjektiver Sicht signifikant weniger helfen als bei den restlichen Telefonaten, in denen klar umschriebene andere Symptome vorlagen. Die Ergebnisse weisen sowohl auf den Nutzen als auch die Grenzen von Hotlineangeboten hin. Der Nutzen besteht vor allem in der schnellen VerfÃƒÂ¼gbarkeit sowie einer effektiven professionellen Hilfe bei klar charakterisierter Symptomatik. Bei unklarer oder komplexer Symptomatik scheint eine unmittelbare telefonische Hilfe zwar nur eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nkt mÃƒÂ¶glich zu sein, sie kann den Zugang zu weiteren Hilfsangeboten jedoch einleiten. Insgesamt geben die Ergebnisse dieser Studie einen ersten Hinweis darauf, dass Hotlineangebote eine praktikable MÃƒÂ¶glichkeit zur psychologischen Ersthilfe unter Pandemiebedingungen darstellen.","Vonderlin, Biermann, Konrad, Klett, Kleindienst, Bailer, Lis, Bohus","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00115-021-01089-x","20210316","COVID-19 pandemic; Coronavirus; Hotline; Mental health; Psychological counseling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",11999,""
"How did women with breast cancer experience the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic? A qualitative study","The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic is a stressful experience that is particularly likely to negatively affect cancer patients. The goal of this qualitative study was to explore how breast cancer patients experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. As part of a larger study, 23 women accepted to take part in an individual phone interview investigating the psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis revealed the following themes: (1) increased general psychological distress; (2) concerns about the impact of treatment-related immunosuppression (i.e., increased risk of catching the SARS-CoV-2 and of developing more severe complications); (3) higher risk of catching the SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital; (4) possible impact of changes in cancer care trajectory on prognosis; (5) distress related to going to treatment alone; (6) social isolation and decreased family relationships; (7) increased responsibility at home; (8) variety of coping strategies used (i.e., adherence to public health measures, seeking professional help, avoidance); (9) difficulty receiving professional mental health services and social support; (10) anxiety related to return to work; and (11) uncertainty about the future. The COVID-19 outbreak is a major medical, psychological, social, and occupational stressor for women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. We offer recommendations to reduce the impact of subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other epidemics in this population.","Savard, Jobin-ThÃƒÂ©berge, Massicotte, Banville","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06089-w","20210316","COVID-19; Cancer; Epidemic; Qualitative analysis; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12000,""
"Dermatology outpatient clinic outcomes after COVID-19 outbreak: What is new normal?","Coronavirus disease- 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, has significantly affected outpatient admissions to dermatology outpatient clinics. There have been changes in the number and composition of the patients who applied to the outpatient clinics. The dermatology outpatient clinic applications have dramatically decreased due to restrictions and prohibitions, and active participation of dermatologists in the field immediately after the pandemic. The composition of the diagnoses has also altered for reasons such as excessive use of hygiene products and types of protective equipment usage related to COVID-19. Intensive precautions have been taken in the first three months of the pandemic (March, April, and May). As of May 12, controlled socialization started with new regulations. This period has been called &quot;the normalization process&quot;. This study aims to evaluate the changes of the patients admitted to dermatology outpatient clinics within the normalization process. Despite the increasing number of COVID-19 patients and related deaths in the whole country with the new normal, the admissions to dermatology outpatient clinics have increased. During this period, acne and related diseases, pigmentation disorders, and viral skin infections had increased; dermatoses, xerosis cutis, and superficial fungal infections had reduced. It seems that non-urgent dermatological complaints affect the quality of life of patients and cause the need for an application. Although restrictions reduce these numbers, measures should be taken to protect patients and society during the ongoing pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

"Concerns of Family Caregivers during COVID-19: The Concerns of Caregivers and the Surprising Silver Linings","COVID-19 has had an enormous impact on older people around the world. As family caregivers provide a good portion of the care for older people, their lives have been drastically altered by COVID-19 too. Our study is an in-depth exploration of the greatest concerns of family caregivers in the United States during COVID-19, as well as their perspectives on the benefits of caregiving during this global pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of 52 family caregivers in the United States between May and September of 2020 over video conferencing using a semi-structured interview guide. Thematic analysis was conducted to ascertain our participants' perceptions. Caregiver's concerns were organized into six main themes, including social isolation, decline in mental health, decline in physical and cognitive functioning, keeping their family members safe from COVID-19, lack of caregiving support, and caregiving stress. The themes related to the benefits of caregiving during COVID-19 included: enjoyed the slower pace, increased time to spend together, deepened relationships, recognizing the resilience of family members, and caregiving innovations.

"[Rethinking partnerships between primary schools and child psychiatry public health services in times of COVID-19]","On a global scale, bringing together schools and public child psychiatry services is favored to promote the development of early interventions that could improve health trajectories, from prevention to treatment, for children exposed to psychological and psychiatric difficulties. In a public health perspective, contextualizing these practices is essential in order to ensure their sustainability and efficiency. This article sheds light on the stakes of these partnerships and their advantages in responding to the health, social, and economic mark that has been left behind by theÃ‚Â crisis accompanying the brutal onset of the Covid-19 epidemic. Improving the health care management for children with mental health problems or problems of a psychological nature implies taking into account their environment beyond theÃ‚Â therapeutic framework. Interventional research, currently underway, is taking place in several sites in France: primary schools, Medical-psychological centers (CMP), and Local Committees on Mental Health (CLSM). The goal is to provide an inventory and an analysis of the partnership and interventional structures that are most efficient, based on the needs and available resources at each site. This research envisages a diversification and a contextualization of the offer of care, with great concern for equity and therapeutic efficacy, starting from school. More than simple results, our aim is to make suggestions as to how to better accompany the end of confinement and the months to come. The development of partnerships in regions that are strongly marked by social and economic inequalities is a priority in terms of public health and the direction of local policies. These partnerships would contribute to a global strategy of evaluating the needs and the personalized accompaniment of children. Formalizing the intervention with the interface being the school sector will support the school staff in overcoming the health crisis that is affecting their institution. The steady rise of CLSMs will enhance local coordination and collaboration to help the most psychologically vulnerable children and aid their parents, given their situation, to support the development of their children. Restoring human and material resources to existing structures, notably in the sector of child psychiatry so that it can accomplish its public service mission seems to be a priority today. Establishing school-CMP-CLSM partnerships can contribute to providing local policy direction in the interest of elaborating individual and collective strategies that can ensure needs-adapted care that is accessible to as many children as possible.","Bonneton, Maillard, Denis, Roelandt","https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.205.0531","20210316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12004,""
"Telehealth strategy toÃ‚Â mitigateÃ‚Â the negativeÃ‚Â psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on type 2 diabetes: A randomized controlled trial","To assess the impact of teleintervention on mental health parameters in type 2 diabetes patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)Ã‚Â pandemic. This is a controlled randomized trial for a multidisciplinary telehealth intervention in Southern Brazil, with social distancing measures. Adults agedÃ‚Â 18Ã‚Â years or older with previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The intervention performed was a set of strategies to help patients stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic and included the maintainingÃ‚Â of telephone contacts and providing educational materials on issues related to mental health, healthy habits, and diabetes care. The primary outcome was a positive screening for mental health disorders (Self-Reporting Questionnaire) after 16Ã‚Â weeks of intervention. A positive screening for mental health disorders was considered when the survey scored greater than or equal to 7. Secondary outcomes included a positive screening for diabetes-related emotional distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes), eating (Eating Attitudes Test), and sleep disorders (Mini Sleep Questionnaire). Comparisons with Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests for dichotomous outcomes, along with the Mann-Whitney U test, was used for between group analyses. A total of 91 individuals agreed to participate (46 intervention group and 45 control group). There were no differences in demographic and clinical data at baseline. After 16Ã‚Â weeks of follow-up, a positive screening for mental health disorders was found in 37.0% of participants in the intervention group vs. 57.8% in the control group (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04). Diabetes-related emotional distress was found in 21.7% of participants in the intervention group vs. 42.2% in the control group (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). No differences were found between groups with regard to eating and sleep disorders. This study demonstrated that maintaining remote connections with health professionals during social distancing and quarantine have the potential to reduce the prevalence of positive screening for mental health disorders and diabetes-related emotional distress in adults with type 2 diabetes.","Alessi, de Oliveira, Franco, Becker, Knijnik, Kobe, Amaral, de Brito, Schaan, Telo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-021-01690-1","20210316","COVID-19 pandemic; Diabetes-related distress; Teleintervention; Type 2 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12005,""

"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression: Recent Critical Advances in Patient Care","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an evidence-based treatment for pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder (MDD). In the last decade, the field has seen significant advances in the understanding and use of this new technology. This review aims to describe the large, randomized controlled studies leading to the modern use of rTMS for MDD. It also includes a special section briefly discussing the use of these technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several new approaches and technologies are emerging in this field, including novel approaches to reduce treatment time and potentially yield new approaches to optimize and maximize clinical outcomes. Of these, theta burst TMS now has evidence indicating it is non-inferior to standard TMS and provides significant advantages in administration. Recent studies also indicate that neuroimaging and related approaches may be able to improve TMS targeting methods and potentially identify those patients most likely to respond to stimulation. While new data is promising, significant research remains to be done to individualize and optimize TMS procedures. Emerging new approaches, such as accelerated TMS and advanced targeting methods, require additional replication and demonstration of real-world clinical utility. Cautious administration of TMS during the pandemic is possible with careful attention to safety procedures.","Cosmo, Zandvakili, Petrosino, Berlow, Philip","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40501-021-00238-y","20210316","Depression; Major depressive disorder; Theta burst stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12007,""
"mHealth Mindfulness Intervention for Women with Moderate-to-Moderately-Severe Antenatal Depressive Symptoms: a Pilot Study Within an Integrated Health Care System","Traditional mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to reduce depression symptoms in pregnant women, although in-person classes may pose significant accessibility barriers, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile technology offers greater convenience, but little is known regarding the efficacy of self-paced, mobile-delivered (mHealth) mindfulness interventions in this population. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of offering such an intervention for pregnant women with moderate-to-moderately-severe depression symptoms. We conducted a single-arm trial within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were identified through KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program. Eligible participants included English-speaking pregnant women (&lt;28 weeks of gestation) with moderate-to-moderately-severe depressive symptoms without a regular (&lt;3 times/week) mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to follow a self-paced, 6-week mindfulness meditation program using a mobile app, HeadspaceÃ¢â€žÂ¢, 10-20 min/day. Outcome measures included feasibility, acceptability, and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., depression symptoms). Of the 27 women enrolled, 20 (74%) completed the study. Over half (55%) of participants used the app Ã¢â€°Â¥50% of the days during the 6-week intervention. Responses to the semi-structured interviews indicated that women appreciated the convenience of the intervention and the ability to engage without having to attend classes or arrange childcare. We observed significant improvements in pre-postintervention scores for depression symptoms, perceived stress, sleep disturbance, and mindfulness. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for women with moderate-to-moderately-severe antenatal depression symptoms. The preliminary data further suggest that an efficacy trial is warranted.","Kubo, Aghaee, Kurtovich, Nkemere, Quesenberry, McGinnis, Avalos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-021-01606-8","20210316","Depression; Intervention; Maternal health; Mental health; Mindfulness; Mobile health; Perinatal; Pregnancy; Prenatal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12008,""
"Physiological parameters of mental health predict the emergence of post-traumatic stress symptoms in physicians treating COVID-19 patients","Lack of established knowledge and treatment strategies, and change in work environment, may altogether critically affect the mental health and functioning of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. Thus, we examined whether treating COVID-19 patients affect the physicians' mental health differently compared with physicians treating non-COVID-19 patients. In this cohort study, an association was blindly computed between physiologically measured anxiety and attention vigilance (collected from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 31 2016) and self-reports of anxiety, mental health aspects, and sleep quality (collected from 20 April to 30 June 2020, and analyzed from 1 July to 1 September 2020), of 91 physicians treating COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. As a priori hypothesized, physicians treating COVID-19 patients showed a relative elevation in both physiological measures of anxiety (95% CI: 2317.69-2453.44 versus 1982.32-2068.46; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and attention vigilance (95% CI: 29.85-34.97 versus 22.84-26.61; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), compared with their colleagues treating non-COVID-19 patients. At least 3 months into the pandemic, physicians treating COVID-19 patients reported high anxiety and low quality of sleep. Machine learning showed clustering to the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subgroups with a high correlation mainly between physiological and self-reported anxiety, and between physiologically measured anxiety and sleep duration. To conclude, the pattern of attention vigilance, heightened anxiety, and reduced sleep quality findings point the need for mental intervention aimed at those physicians susceptible to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms, owing to the consequences of fighting at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dolev, Zubedat, Brand, Bloch, Mader, Blondheim, Avital","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01299-6","20210316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12009,""

Depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse. Regression models indicated that planning or considering leaving China due to COVID-19, lacking the confidence to protect themselves and not being confident that the epidemic would end soon was associated with greater depression, lower quality of life and greater levels of alcohol misuse. Worry about contracting COVID-19 and feeling helpless to prevent infection were associated with greater depression and lower quality of life. General perceived social support, and trust in Chinese people, institutions and systems were protective factors for depression and associated with higher reported quality of life. This study identifies key correlates that, if adequately addressed through public health outreach, may safeguard migrant well-being during a public health emergency. Trust in people and systems within the postmigration environment is an important consideration for future public health planning efforts.","Hall, Zhao, Xiong, Latkin, Yang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048012","20210316","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12010,""

As pressure mounted to scale back measures, understanding public priorities was critical. We assessed initial public adherence with and support for stay-at-home orders in nations and cities with different SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 death rates. Cross-sectional surveys were administered to representative samples of adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years from regions with different SARS-CoV-2 prevalences from April 2-8, 2020. Regions included two nations [the United States (US-high prevalence) and Australia (AU-low prevalence)] and two US cities [New YorkÃ‚Â City (NY-high prevalence) and Los Angeles (LA-low prevalence)]. Regional SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 prevalence (cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 deaths) as of April 8, 2020: US (363,321, 10,845), AU (5956, 45), NY (81,803, 4571), LA (7530, 198). Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 (response rate, 63.9%) completed surveys. Median age was 47Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (range, 18-89); 3039 (54.5%) were female. Of 5573 total respondents, 4560 (81.8%) reported adherence with recommended quarantine or stay-at-home policies (range of samples, 75.5-88.2%). Additionally, 29.1% of respondents screened positive for anxiety or depression symptoms (range of samples, 28.6-32.0%), with higher prevalences among those of younger age, female gender, and those in quarantine or staying at home most of the time versus those who did not report these behaviours. Despite elevated prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms and significant life disruptions, 5022 respondents (90.1%) supported government-imposed stay-at-home orders (range of samples, 88.9-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believed orders should last at least three more weeks or until public health or government officials recommended, with support spanning the political spectrum. Public adherence with COVID-19 mitigation policies was highly prevalent, in both highly-affected (US, NY) and minimally-affected regions (AU, LA). Despite disruption of respondents' lives, the vast majority supported continuation of extended stay-at-home orders. Despite common support, these two countries diverged in stringent mitigation implementation, which may have contributed to subsequent outcomes. These results reveal the importance of surveillance of public support for and adherence withÃ‚Â such policies during the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic and forÃ‚Â future infectious disease outbreaks.","Czeisler, Howard, Robbins, Barger, Facer-Childs, Rajaratnam, Czeisler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10410-x","20210316","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Insomnia; Mental health; Mitigation strategies; Pandemic; Public health policy; Qualtrics; SARS-CoV-2; Stay-at-home orders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12012,""

Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P&lt;.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P&lt;.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P&lt;.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","Lim, Leow, Ong, Pang, Lim","https://doi.org/10.2196/21757","20210316","COVID-19; intervention; mental health; mindfulness; perceived stress; psychology; sleep quality; telehealth; videoconference","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12015,""

"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study - Part II","Background: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected; billions have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes, but few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals. Objectives: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the pandemic, measured by search term interest in ""coronavirus"" and ""covid fatigue"" across the United States. Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs), including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. Results: Linear mixed models observed differences in phone usage, sleep, sedentary time and the number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in covid fatigue. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone usage, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (_P_<.001) were significantly associated with interest in covid fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020 [@Huckins2020]. Conclusions: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Though unsurprising, understanding these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","Dante et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46041-E53-EDD","20210317","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; mobile sensing; depression; covid fatigue; sedentary; sleep; college; george floyd; google trends; covid-19; phone usage; anxiety; ema","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12018,""
"Learning it the hard way â€“ how enjoying life and positive appraisal buffer the negative effects of stressors on mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic","Background. Higher levels of stress and negative emotions such as anxiety and depression have been reported since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains less clear how positive emotions, such as hedonic capacity, may be affected. Further, during lockdowns, the ability to learn new pleasurable activities (hedonic learning) may be particularly relevant. Here, we investigated if state hedonia and/or hedonic learning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and mental health. Moreover, we explored whether positive appraisal style (PAS), a major resilience factor, influenced these relationships. Methods. Using a cross-sectional design, 5000 German-speaking participants filled out online questionnaires targeting stressors, mental health, state hedonia, hedonic learning, and PAS between April 9 and May 15, 2020. After confirming the factor structure of our constructs, we applied latent structural equation modeling to test mediation as well as moderated mediation models. Results. Stress showed a positive association with mental health symptoms, which was buffered by both state hedonia and hedonic learning. While higher stress was related to lower state hedonia, participants reported more hedonic learning with greater stressor load. The latter effect was greater for individuals with high PAS. Limitations. The present results should be replicated in longitudinal designs with representative samples to confirm the directionality and generalizability of effects. Conclusions. Both state hedonia and hedonic learning buffered the effect of stress on mental health in an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning new rewarding activities in combination with a PAS may be especially relevant for maintaining mental health during lockdowns.","Anna Daniels et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-065-C75","20210317","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; anhedonia; reward learning; mental health; covid-19; positive appraisal; stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12019,""
"Brexit, COVID-19 and Attitudes Towards Immigration in Britain","A key issue in Britainâ€™s referendum on European Union membership was the free movement of labour into Britain, with Brexit â€˜Leaversâ€™ having more negative attitudes towards immigrants compared to â€˜Remainersâ€™. Such anti-immigrant attitudes are driven by feelings of threat. As Brexit negotiations continued, the coronavirus pandemic presented a new threat, potentially heightening anti-immigrant attitudes. However, the prominent sacrifices of migrant workers in the fight against coronavirus suggests a potential for softening public attitudes. We ask: how did the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of ongoing Brexit negotiations, affected anti-immigrant attitudes and how did these effects differ between Leavers and Remainers? Through a survey experiment, we test the effects of priming COVID-19 thoughts, showing that COVID-19 may exacerbate anti-immigrant attitudes among Leavers while having little effect on Remainers. In doing so, we explore the effect of a viral threat on immigration attitudes and heterogeneity in that effect, based on political identities.","Mark Pickup et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46026-5CE-2FA","20210317","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12020,""
"An ethnopsychological ABC framework of psychiatric morbidity to facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions in Nepal","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be overwhelming leading to strong emotions and distress. Most studies reported the impact on mental health due to uncertainty, fear, and anxiety about the pandemic and post pandemic states. The sufferers may present with a variety of symptoms of psychological distress. Failure to communicate this psychosocial distress between lay and health care providers may pose barriers to treatment and challenges for integration of mental health into primary health centers. There is a need for tools to screen and explain pandemic associated distress in a way that attending physician can communicate with laymen in a coherent way. The article introduces an ethnopsychologial ABC framework that individual in distress can better understand the nature of the illness. Rather than providing a diagnosis to inexperienced clients of psychiatric morbidity, this method promotes improved communication and bridge the observed gaps. Thus, it helps to raise awareness of the relationship between cultural, emotional, thought, behavior, and psychosocial distress. This article discussed the assessment of the ABC framework with ethnopsycholgical premises and psychotherapeutic intervention at different levels that can be applied.","Dhirendra Paudel","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46134-029-1A1","20210316","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Process; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Situation; ethnopsychology; mental disorders; abc; psychotherapy; psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12021,""
"PREDICTORS OF MENTAL HEALTH AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN POLAND","The aim of the article is to determine the predictors of mental health among Polish society. Research was conducted after the first wave of the pandemic. Due to such an approach, it was possible to determine whether secondary effects of the pandemic have impact on mental health, apart from socio-demographic and psychological factors. In order to gather the research material, the CAWI on-line survey method was applied and carried out within the framework of the Ariadna Research Panel on the sample of 1079 Poles aged 15 and over. The FCV-19S scale, which is used to measure the fear of COVID-19 was applied in the measurement. It is a verified diagnostic instrument used to measure mental health in a lot of countries. The results of a hierarchical regression analysis have shown that the factors which increase the level of fear of COVID-19 are demographic, social and psychological features as well as attitudes towards the pandemic. The results of research indicate the significance of social context in the analysis and explanation of the effects of disasters and cataclysms","Piotr Dlugosz","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C5-946-6AF","20210316","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; emotional distress; mental health; social effects.; covid-19; fear of covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12022,""
"Exploring experiences and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young racially minoritised people in the United Kingdom: A Qualitative Study","Within high-income-countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted people from racially minoritised backgrounds. There has been significant research interrogating the disparate impact of the virus, and recently, interest in the long-term implications of the global crisis on young peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing. However, less work explores the experiences of young people from racialised backgrounds as they navigate the pandemic, and the specific consequences this has for their mental health. Forty young people (age 16-25) from black, mixed and other minority backgrounds and living in London, participated in consecutive focus group discussions over a two-month period, to explore the impact of the pandemic on their lives and emotional wellbeing. Thematic analysis identified seven categories describing the impact of the pandemic, indicating: deepening of existing socioeconomic and emotional challenges; efforts to navigate racism and difference within the response; and survival strategies drawing on communal and individual resources. Young people also articulated visions for a future public health response which addressed gaps in current strategies. Findings point to the need to contextualize public health responses to the pandemic in line with the lived experiences of racialised young people. We specifically note the importance of long-term culturally and socio-politically relevant support interventions. Implications for policy and practice are discussed","Rochelle Ann Burgess Dr et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CA-FFB-329","20210317","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; mental health; uk; qualitative research; covid-19; racialised minorities; lived experiences","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-17","",12023,""
