"Self-harm and the COVID-19 pandemic: a study of factors contributing to self-harm during lockdown restrictions","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting public health measures may have major impacts on mental health, including on self-harm. We have investigated what factors related to the pandemic influenced hospital presentations following self-harm during lockdown in England. Method Mental health clinicians assessing individuals aged 18 years and over presenting to hospitals in Oxford and Derby following self-harm during the period March 23rd to 17th May 2020 recorded whether the self-harm was related to the impact of COVID-19 and, if so, what specific factors were relevant. These factors were organized into a classification scheme. Information was also collected on patients demographic characteristics, method of self-harm and suicide intent. Results Of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (N=107) COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. This applied more to females than males (53.5%, N=68/127 v 38.6%, N=39/101, chi square = 5.03, p=0.025), but there were no differences in age, methods of self-harm or suicide intent between the two groups. The most frequent COVID-related factors were mental health issues, including new and worsening disorders, and cessation or reduction of services (including absence of face-to-face support), isolation and loneliness, reduced contact with key individuals, disruption to normal routine, and entrapment. Multiple, often inter-connected COVID-related factors were identified in many patients. Conclusions COVID-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. Females were particularly affected. The fact that mental health problems, including issues with delivery of care, predominated has implications for organisation of services during such periods. The contribution of isolation, loneliness and sense of entrapment highlight the need for relatives, friends and neighbours to be encouraged to reach out to others, especially those living alone. The classification of COVID-related factors can be used as an aide-memoire for clinicians.","Keith Hawton; Karen Lascelles; Fiona Brand; Deborah Casey; Elizabeth Bale; Jennifer Ness; Samantha Kelly; Keith Waters","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.20244129","20201207","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7888,""
"Could Cannabidiol Be a Treatment for Coronavirus Disease-19-Related Anxiety Disorders?","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are likely to be a significant long-term issue emerging from the current pandemic  We hypothesize that cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical isolated from Cannabis sativa with reported anxiolytic properties, could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19-related anxiety disorders  In the global over-the-counter CBD market, anxiety, stress, depression, and sleep disorders are consistently the top reasons people use CBD  In small randomized controlled clinical trials, CBD (300-800 mg) reduces anxiety in healthy volunteers, patients with social anxiety disorder, those at clinical high risk of psychosis, in patients with Parkinson's disease, and in individuals with heroin use disorder  Observational studies and case reports support these findings, extending to patients with anxiety and sleep disorders, Crohn's disease, depression, and in PTSD  Larger ongoing trials in this area continue to add to this evidence base with relevant patient cohorts, sample sizes, and clinical end-points  Pre-clinical studies reveal the molecular targets of CBD in these indications as the cannabinoid receptor type 1 and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (mainly in fear memory processing), serotonin 1A receptor (mainly in anxiolysis) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (mainly in the underpinning anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects)  Observational and pre-clinical data also support CBD's therapeutic value in improving sleep (increased sleep duration/quality and reduction in nightmares) and depression, which are often comorbid with anxiety  Together these features of CBD make it an attractive novel therapeutic option in COVID-related PTSS that merits investigation and testing through appropriately designed randomized controlled trials","O'Sullivan, S.

"Antecedents of Public Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediation of Pandemic-Related Knowledge and Self-Efficacy and Moderation of Risk Level","Background: COVID-19 affects not only patients' physical health but also their mental health  For the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by COVID-19  Controlling the pandemic should focus on not only physical health but also mental health  For the general public, mental health is even more important, as good mental health at the individual level can form a positive social mentality conducive to pandemic prevention and control  Therefore, it is important to assess mental health during the pandemic, and analyze risk and protective factors  Methods: A self-compiled COVID-19 Social Mentality Questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey  A total of 16,616 participants responded, with 13,511 valid questionnaires  Results: Results showed that 10 7% of participants rated their mental health as â€œworse than usualâ€ during the pandemic, and there were gender, age, and educational differences  Social support was positively correlated with pandemic-related knowledge and self-efficacy, and could indirectly predict mental health  Pandemic-related knowledge was positively correlated with self-efficacy and mental health, and risk level was negatively correlated with mental health  Hierarchical regression analysis showed that pandemic-related knowledge played a partial mediating role in the relationship between social support and self-efficacy, while self-efficacy played a complete mediating role in the relationship between social support and mental health  Logistic regression analysis showed that risk level moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and mental health  Conclusions: Social support can increase pandemic-related knowledge, thus improving self-efficacy and maintaining/promoting mental health  High risk levels can undermine the role of self-efficacy in promoting mental health  Therefore, in the fight against the COVID-19, people need to support and cooperate with each other, to improve self-efficacy and reduce risk, thus maintaining and promoting mental health  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Wang, Feng, Zhang, Liu, Wang and Li","Wang, S.; Feng, K.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, J.; Wang, W.; Li, Y.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.567119","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7893,""

"Recovery, restoration, and risk: a cross-sectional survey of the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in the first UK city to lock down","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted GPs immensely. Work patterns have changed, risk stratification has been proposed, and the mental health of clinicians has been adversely affected. The COVID-19 prevalence among GPs is unknown. This study focuses on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in Leicestershire, the first UK city to lock down locally. AIM: This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison with national guidance. It used a validated perceived stress tool to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception. DESIGN & SETTING: The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. METHOD: A total of 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health compared with pre-COVID-19 times. Thus, the NHS in England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care while battling the second wave.","Trivedi, Namrata; Trivedi, Vivek; Moorthy, Arumugam; Trivedi, Hina","https://dx.doi.org/10.3399/BJGPO.2020.0151","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BJGP Open;2020 Dec 01.; Publication details: BJGP Open;2020 Dec 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7900,""
"Mental Health Burden in Different Professions During the Final Stage of the COVID-19 Lockdown in China: Cross-sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 resulted in considerable mental health burden in the Chinese general population and among health care workers at the beginning and peak of the pandemic. However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and successful ways of coping during the last 4 weeks of the lockdown in Hubei Province. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and media preferences. We used a shortened version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (Simplified Chinese version of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale), coping strategies for all participants, and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement for observational studies. RESULTS: The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers, and 20 professions designated under the ""other"" category. We found increased depression (n=123, 17.9%), anxiety (n=208, 30.3%), and stress (n=94, 13.7%) in our sample. Professions that were vulnerable to depression were other medical staff and students. Doctors, nurses, and students were vulnerable to anxiety; and other medical staff, students, and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental, and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety, and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and having a high workload (8-12 hours per day) were not associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: By the end of the lockdown, a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","Du, Junfeng; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Gronewold, Nadine; Zafar, Ali; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24240","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24240, 2020 Dec 02.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24240, 2020 Dec 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7901,""
"Sleep Conditions Associate with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms among Pregnant Women during the Epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen","BACKGROUND: Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Internal Labour Migration in India: A 'Crisis of Mobility'","This paper examines the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migration. The rapid spread of the pandemic caught countries across the world off guard, resulting in widespread lockdowns that clamped down on mobility, commercial activities and social interactions. In India, the pandemic precipitated a severe 'crisis of mobility', with migrant labourers in many major cities seeking to return to their hometowns. Their desperate attempts to return home by any means available rendered the lockdown ineffective in several areas, prompting clashes with authorities, last-minute policy relief and, eventually, the arrangement of transport measures. This paper aims to shed light on the vulnerability of India's internal migrants in terms of their mobility, gender and mental health. In addition, it critically analyses the limitations of public policy in addressing migrants and suggests recommendations for the way ahead.","Irudaya Rajan, S; Sivakumar, P; Srinivasan, Aditya","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41027-020-00293-8","","Country: IN; ÃNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Indian J Labour Econ;: 1-19, 2020 Nov 20.; Publication details: Indian J Labour Econ;: 1-19, 2020 Nov 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7903,""

"Feeling Gratitude is Associated with Better Well-being across the Life Span: A Daily Diary Study during the COVID-19 Outbreak","Numerous studies have shown that gratitude can improve mental health of people facing stressful events. However, most studies in this area have been based on laboratory experiments and retrospective surveys, rather than actual situations in which people are experiencing stress. Moreover, few studies have examined whether age moderates the benefits of gratitude. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused enormous psychological distress worldwide. Evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance well-being during this stressful time. This study attempted to fill these gaps by examining the benefits of feeling gratitude every day during the COVID-19 outbreak. A sample of 231 participants from mainland China aged 18 to 85 years participated in a 14-day daily diary study. After a pretest to collect demographic data, information on gratitude, daily positive and negative affect, perceived stress related to COVID-19, and subjective health were measured using daily questionnaires on 14 consecutive days. One month after the daily diary period, information on affective experiences, life satisfaction, and subjective health was collected as a follow-up survey. On days when individuals feel more gratitude than usual, they report more positive affect, a lower level of perceived stress related to COVID-19, and better subjective health on the concurrent day (Day N). Individuals also report a lower level of stress related to COVID-19 on the following day (Day N+1), when they feel more gratitude than usual on Day N. Higher levels of gratitude across the 14-day study period was associated with a higher level of positive affect and a lower level of negative affect, but was not associated with life satisfaction or subjective health at the one-month follow-up assessment. These findings demonstrate the benefits of gratitude in a naturalistic situation that induced stress and anxiety.","Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa220","20201207","COVID-19; age; gratitude; stress; subjective health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7905,""
"Behavioral measures to fight COVID-19: An 8-country study of perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors","Behavioral measures, such as the wearing of facemasks and maintaining of distance to other people, have been central in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be important in curbing its spread. We therefore investigated their perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors in representative online samples in eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 7,658 participants, 77.4% rated governmental measures (highest: Germany, lowest: France) as useful and 91.7% reported adherence to them. Adherence was lowest in Russia and Poland, where people felt particularly left alone and not well supported, and in the U.S. and Sweden, where governments showed ambivalent attitudes towards the measures. The highest adherence was reported in countries with very high mortality (U.K., Spain, France) or very positively perceived government communication (Germany). Female gender, higher age, belonging to a risk group, being affected physically and mentally, perception of governmental communication as guided by the interests of people, feeling of being well informed and the level of positive mental health positively predicted both outcomes, while being affected economically negatively predicted both outcomes. Country-specific results are considered in the light of the protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior together with potential ways to improve active participation of the population. Overall, we recommend the governments and authorities to stress that each individual can contribute to the control of the COVID-19 situation by adherence to the measures in the public communication. Moreover, they should emphasize the risk of unconscious infection of older individuals by younger people, as well as the importance of physical activity for the protection of mental and physical health especially during the pandemic.","Margraf, Brailovskaia, Schneider","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243523","20201207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7906,""
"Social-media insights into US mental health amid the COVID-19 global pandemic: a Longitudinal analysis of publicly available Twitter data (January 22- April 10, 2020)","The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a significant challenge to the world's mental health and healthcare systems. Considering traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. Significant pluralities of the US population now use social media platforms, such as Twitter, to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field from which to understand personal wellbeing. Broadly, this study answers three research questions: RQ1: What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19?; RQ2: To what extent does social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic?; and RQ3: Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English-language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository (Chen, Lerman, &amp; Ferrara, 2020) in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n = 354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) (Hutto &amp; Gilbert, 2014) sentiment tool. LDA topics generated in the early months of the dataset corresponded to major COVID-19 specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted towards US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis sentiment scores of user timelines were initially high and stable, but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased usage rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media usage on mental health, for many social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental healthcare structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","Valdez, Ten Thij, Bathina, Rutter, Bollen","https://doi.org/10.2196/21418","20201207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7907,""
"COVID-19 as 'Game changer': Use and impact of augmented reality games on physical activity and mental well-being during the pandemic","Location-based augmented reality (AR) games, such as PokÃƒÂ©mon GO (PGO) and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (HPWU), are shown to have beneficial impacts on physical activity, social connectedness, and mental-health for their players. In March 2020, global social distancing measures related to COVID-19 prompted the AR games developer Niantic to implement several changes to ensure continued player engagement with PGO and HPWU. We sought to examine how physical and mental well-being of PGO and HPWU players were affected during the unprecedented COVID-19 restriction period, as well as how video game engagement was affected. (1) To examine the impact of COVID-19 social restrictions on the physical and mental well-being of AR game players; (2) to examine the impact of COVID-19 social restrictions on usage of video games and motivations for use; and (3) to explore the potential role of AR games (and video games in general) in supporting well-being during COVID-19 social restrictions. A mixed-method, online, self-reported survey was conducted in May 2020, during which COVID-19 social restrictions were enforced in many countries. Participants were recruited online via four subreddit forums dedicated to PGO or HPWU. Data collected contained quantitative data on demographics, time spent playing video games, physical activity, and mental health, as well as qualitative data on motivations to play and video game impact on mental health during COVID-19 restrictions. We report results for 2,004 participants (58.8% male, average age=30.5 years). Self-reported physical activity during COVID-19 social restrictions significantly decreased from 7.50 hours per week on average (SD=11.12) to 6.50 (SD=7.81) (p&lt;.001). Over half of the participants reported poor mental health (n=925/1766, 52.4%; WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5&lt;13)). Being female, younger age, and reduced exercise were significant predictors of poor mental health. Participants reported a significant increase in video game play from 16.38 hours per week on average (SD=19.12) to 20.82 (SD=17.49) (p&lt;.001). Three in four participants (n=1102/1427, 77.2%) reported that playing video games had been beneficial to their mental health. The changes made to PGO and HPWU were very well received by players, and players continued to use these games while exercising and to maintain social connection. In addition to providing an escape during the pandemic and as a form of entertainment, participants reported that they also used video games for emotional coping, to lower stress, relax, and alleviate mental health conditions. AR games have the potential to promote physical and mental-health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used by populations under isolation and distress, such games can potentially improve physical and mental health by providing virtual socialization, sustained exercise, temporal routine, and mental structure. Further research is needed to explore the potential of AR games as digital behavioral interventions to maintain human wellbeing in the wider population.","Ellis, Lee, Ijaz, Smith, Braithwaite, Yin","https://doi.org/10.2196/25117","20201207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7908,""
"Psychological Impacts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the First Nationwide Lockdown in Vietnam: An Internet-based Survey","The first nationwide lockdown due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been imposed in Vietnam between April 1 and 15, 2020. Nevertheless, there has been limited information on the impact of COVID-19 to society's psychological health. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological issues and identify the factors associated with the psychological impact of COVID-19 during the first nationwide lockdown among the general population in Vietnam. We employed a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling. A self-administered, online survey was used to collect data and assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants from April 10 to 15, 2020. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were utilized to assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants during COVID-19 social distancing. The associated factors were explored by using regression analysis. A total of 1,385 respondents completed the survey. There were 35.9%, 23.5%, 14.1%, and 22.3% who suffered from psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Those respondents who evaluated their physical health as average had higher IES-R score, DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress than those in good/very good health status (beta-coefficient regression (B) = 9.16, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 6.43 to 11.89), B = 5.85, 95% CI, 4.49 to 7.21, B = 3.64, 95% CI, 2.64 to 4.63, and B = 5.19, 95% CI, 3.83 to 6.56, respectively). Those who were in bad or very bad health condition suffered more severe depression, anxiety and stress (B = 9.57, 95% CI, 4.54 to 14.59, B = 7.24, 95% CI, 3.55 to 10.9, and B = 10.60, 95% CI, 5.56 to 15.65, respectively). Unemployment was more likely associated with depression and stress (B = 3.34, 95% CI, 1.68 to 5.01, and B = 2.34, 95% CI, 0.84 to 3.85). Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half (54.5%) expressed concern on their children aged below 18 years, which increased their IES-R score and DASS-21 stress score (B = 7.81, 95% CI, 4.98 to 10.64, and B = 1.75, 95% CI, 0.27 to 3.24, respectively). Majority (94.6%) were confident on the doctor's expertise in COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, which was positively associated with less distress caused by the outbreak (B = -7.84, 95% CI, -14.58 to -1.11). The findings highlight the impacts on mental health of COVID-19 during the nationwide lockdown among the general population in Vietnam. The study provides useful evidence for policy decision-makers to develop and implement interventions to mitigate these impacts.","Ngoc Cong Duong, Nguyen Le Bao, Thi Lan Nguyen, Vo Van, Phung Lam, Pham Gia, Anuratpanich, Vo Van","https://doi.org/10.2196/24776","20201207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7909,""
"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and course of chronic urticaria","The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically disrupts health care around the globe. The impact of the pandemic on chronic urticaria (CU) and its management are largely unknown. To understand how CU patients are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; how specialists alter CU patient management; and the course of CU in patients with COVID-19. Our cross-sectional, international, questionnaire-based, multicenter UCARE COVID-CU study assessed the impact of the pandemic on patient consultations, remote treatment, changes in medications, and clinical consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic severely impairs CU patient care, with less than 50% of the weekly numbers of patients treated as compared to before the pandemic. Reduced patient referrals and clinic hours were the major reasons. Almost half of responding UCARE physicians were involved in COVID-19 patient care, which negatively impacted on the care of urticaria patients. The rate of face-to-face consultations decreased by 62%, from 90% to less than half, whereas the rate of remote consultations increased by more than 600%, from one in 10 to more than two thirds. Cyclosporine and systemic corticosteroids, but not antihistamines or omalizumab, are used less during the pandemic. CU does not affect the course of COVID-19, but COVID-19 results in CU exacerbation in one of three patients, with higher rates in patients with severe COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic brings major changes and challenges for CU patients and their physicians. The long-term consequences of these changes, especially the increased use of remote consultations, require careful evaluation.","KocatÃƒÂ¼rk, Salman, Cherrez-Ojeda, Ricardo Criado, Peter, Comert-Ozer, Abuzakouk, CÃƒÂ¢mara Agondi, Al-Ahmad, Altrichter, Arnaout, Karla Arruda, Asero, Bauer, Ben-Shoshan, Bernstein, Bizjak, Boccon-Gibod, Bonnekoh, Bouillet, Brzoza, Busse, Campos, Carne, Conlon, Criado, de Souza Lima, Demir, Dissemond, DoÃ„Å¸an GÃƒÂ¼naydÃ„Â±n, Dorofeeva, Felipe Ensina, ErtaÃ…Å¸, Mariel Ferrucci, Figueras-Nart, Fomina, Franken, Fukunaga, GimÃƒÂ©nez-Arnau, Godse, GonÃƒÂ§alo, Gotua, Grattan, Guillet, Inomata, Jakob, Karakaya, Kasperska-ZajÃ„â€¦c, Katelaris, KoÃ…Â¡nik, Krasowska, Kulthanan, Sendhil Kumaran, Lang, Ignacio Larco-Sousa, Lazaridou, Anika Leslie, Lippert, CalderÃƒÂ³n Llosa, Makris, Marsland, Medina, Meshkova, Bastos Palitot, Parisi, Pickert, Ramon, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Gonzalez, Rosario, Rudenko, Rutkowski, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Schliemann, Enis Sekerel, Serpa, Serra-Baldrich, Song, Soria, Staevska, Staubach, Tagka, Takahagi, Francis Thomsen, Treudler, Vadasz, Oliveira Rodrigues Valle, Van Doorn, Vestergaard, Wagner, Wang, Wang, Wedi, Xepapadaki, YÃƒÂ¼cel, Zalewska-Janowska, Zhao, Zuberbier, Maurer","https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14687","20201207","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; UCARE; chronic urticaria; cyclosporine; omalizumab; pandemic; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7910,""

This cross-sectional study was conducted during February 10-20, 2020. A set of online questionnaires was employed to measure mental health and responses. 1,397 participants from Wuhan (age: 36.4 Ã‚Â± 10.7; male: 36.1%) and 2,794 age- and sex-matched participants from other areas of China (age: 35.9 Ã‚Â± 9.9; male: 39.0%) were recruited. Compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan had significantly higher prevalence of any mental health problems (46.6% vs. 32.2%; adjusted OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.65-2.17), anxiety (15.2% vs. 6.2%; adjusted OR=2.65, 95%CI=2.14-3.29), depression (18.3% vs. 9.7%; adjusted OR = 2.11, 95%CI=1.74-2.54), suicidal ideation (10.5% vs. 7.1%; adjusted OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.28-2.02), and insomnia (38.6% vs. 27.6%; adjusted OR=1.70, 95%CI=1.48-1.96). Participants from Wuhan had a slightly higher rate of help-seeking behavior (7.1% vs. 4.2%, adjusted OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.12-2.77) but similar rate of treatment (3.5% vs. 2.7%, adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI=0.68-2.24) for mental problems than their counterparts.

"Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic changes of vital organs in SARS-CoV-2 induced systemic toxicity","Extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are associated with a much higher mortality rate. Yet, little is known about the pathogenesis of systemic complications of COVID-19. Here, we create a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 induced severe systemic toxicity and multi-organ involvement by expressing the human ACE2 transgene in multiple tissues via viral delivery followed by systemic administration of SARS-CoV-2. The animals develop a profound phenotype within 7 days with severe weight loss, morbidity and failure to thrive. We demonstrate there is metabolic suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in multiple organs with neutrophilia, lymphopenia and splenic atrophy mirroring human COVID-19 phenotypes. Animals had a significantly lower heart rate and electron microscopy demonstrated myofibrillar disarray and myocardial edema, a common pathogenic cardiac phenotype in human COVID-19. We perform metabolomic profiling of peripheral blood and identify a panel of TCA cycle metabolites that serve as biomarkers of depressed oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 induces epigenetic changes of DNA methylation, that affects expression of immune response genes and could in part contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our model suggests that SARS-CoV-2 induced metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic changes in internal organs could contribute to systemic toxicity and lethality in COVID-19.","Li, Ma, Yokota, Garcia, Palermo, Wang, Farrell, Wang, Wu, Zhou, Pan, Morselli, Teitell, Ryazantsev, Fishbein, Ten Hoeve, Arboleda, Bloom, Dillon, Pellegrini, Lusis, Graeber, Arumugaswami, Deb","https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.145027","20201207","COVID-19; Epigenetics; Intermediary metabolism; Metabolism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7913,""

"Psychological impact in non-infectious disease specialists who had direct contact with patients with COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a pandemic. Obstetricians and midwives, among other medical staff, are tackling COVID-19 and are under immense psychological stress. We aimed to survey the mental health of non-infectious disease specialist staff, specifically obstetricians and midwives, working in officially designated hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. A nationwide online survey was conducted from 7 March to 17 March 2020 investigating the mental health of obstetricians and midwives (who were not themselves infected with COVID-19) working in hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. We used the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to assess their symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. A total of 885 (41.6%), 609 (28.6%) and 729 (34.3%) obstetricians and midwives reported depression (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5), anxiety (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5) and insomnia (ISI Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8), respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of whether or not they had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, obstetricians and midwives were more likely to report mild and moderate depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with before the pandemic. Those who had direct contact with patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report depression and insomnia than those who did not. Those who had sufficient protective equipment or training were less likely to report depression, anxiety and insomnia than those who did not. Our data suggest that non-infectious disease specialist staff have experienced varying, but increased levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia during this COVID-19 pandemic, which could be reduced by sufficient levels of protective equipment and occupational COVID-19 workplace training.","Liu, Zheng, Sha, Liu, Zheng, Su, Xu, Su, So, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.147","20201207","COVID-19; Mental health; anxiety; depression; obstetrical staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7915,""
"Effect of coronaphobia on smoking habits","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic had exhibited negative effects on patients with a nicotine use disorder because of social stress situations. The objective of this study is to investigate the changes that occurred in the smoking habits of the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic because of the COVID-19 outbreak's effect (coronaphobia) on their mental health. In this study, we included the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic between January 1 and June 30, 2020. We conducted telephonic and face-to-face interviews with the patients during the outbreak, and inquired about the changes in their smoking habits. In total, 114 volunteers (mean age: 41.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years [min-max: 18-82Ã¢â‚¬â€°years], M/F: 70/44 [61.4/38.6%]) who registered in the smoking cessation clinic of Chest Diseases Clinic were included in the study. The number of people with and without coronaphobia was 64 (56.1%) and 50 (43.9%), respectively. The analyses of the changes in smoking behaviors because of coronaphobia demonstrated that people with coronaphobia exhibited a significantly higher decrease or cessation of smoking as compared to no change in smoking behavior or increase in the number of cigarettes (<i>p</i>: .006). Success in smoking cessation can be increased with the accurate analyses of the anxiety effects caused by coronaphobia after COVID-19 outbreak on the desire of smoking cessation. This resolution depends on the solution-oriented strategies that will increase the awareness of physicians and patients, a close follow-up of patients with tools such as telemedicine, and a quick determination of their needs.","Ozcelik, Yilmaz Kara","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1849950","20201207","COVID-19; Coronaphobia; smoking; smoking cessation; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7916,""
"Spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in children during high peak COVID-19 period infection in Northern Italy: is there a link?","Children with COVID-19 have a milder clinical course than adults. We describe the spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations during a COVID-19 outbreak in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. Cross-sectional multicenter study including all diagnosis of KD, myocarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from February to April,2020. KD patients were compared to those diagnosed before the epidemic. KD: 8 patients (6/8 boys, all negative for SARS-CoV-2); complete presentation in 5/8; 7/8 IVIG-responders; 3/8 showed transient coronary lesions (CALs). one 5-year-old girl negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for Parvovirus B19. She responded to IVIG. 4 SARS-CoV-2 positive boys (3 patients with positive swab and serology, 1 patient with negative swab and positive serology). Three presented myocardial dysfunction and pericardial effusion, one developed multicoronary aneurysms and hyperinflammation; all responded to treatment. The fourth boy had mitral and aortic regurgitation that rapidly regressed after steroids. KD, myocarditis and MIS-C were distinguishable cardiovascular manifestations. KD did not show a more aggressive form compared to previous years: coronary involvement was frequent, but always transient. MIS-C and myocarditis rapidly responded to treatment without cardiac sequelae despite high markers of myocardial injury at onset suggesting a myocardial depression due to systemic inflammation rather than focal necrosis. Evidence of actual or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented only in patients with MIS-C.","Fabi, Filice, Andreozzi, Conti, Gabrielli, Balducci, Vergine, Cicero Md, Iughetti, Guerzoni, Corinaldesi, Lazzarotto, Pession, Lanari","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piaa162","20201207","COVID-19; KDSS; Kawasaki Disease; Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome; children; myocarditis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7917,""
"Perceived Impact of Covid-19 Across Different Mental Disorders: A Study on Disorder-Specific Symptoms, Psychosocial Stress and Behavior","The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has plunged countries across the world into crisis. Both in the general population and in specific subgroups such as infected people or health care workers, studies have reported increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. However, the reactions of individuals with mental disorders to Covid-19 have largely been neglected. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the perceived impact of Covid-19 and its psychological consequences on people with mental disorders. In this online survey, participants were asked to evaluate their disorder-specific symptoms, perceived psychosocial stress and behaviors related to Covid-19 in the current situation and retrospectively before the spread of Covid-19. The study included participants with self-identified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and agoraphobia (PA), illness anxiety disorder (IA), social anxiety disorder (SAD), depression (DP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders (ED), schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (SP), other non-specified mental disorder (other) as well as mentally healthy controls (HC). The results of bayesian parameter estimation suggest that the symptom severity of DP, GAD, IA and BDD has deteriorated as a reaction to Covid-19. Across all mental disorders and HC, self-reported psychosocial stress levels were higher during the outbreak of Covid-19 compared to before. A reduced frequency of social contacts and grocery shopping was found for all participants. People with self-identified mental disorders showed higher personal worries about Covid-19 and a higher fear of contagion with Covid-19 than did HC. According to our findings, Covid-19 may reinforce symptom severity and psychosocial stress in individuals with mental disorders. In times of pandemics, special support is needed to assist people with mental disorders and to prevent symptom deterioration.","Quittkat, DÃƒÂ¼sing, Holtmann, Buhlmann, Svaldi, Vocks","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.586246","20201207","Covid-19; corona; impact; mental disorders; pandemics; stress; symptom severity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7918,""

"Longer time spent at home during COVID-19 pandemic is associated with binge drinking among US adults","<i>Background:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced and exacerbated stressors (<i>e.g</i>., job loss, poor mental health) for adults across the United States (US) since the first statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020. Limited research has evaluated if, and how, pandemic-related stressors are associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking. <i>Objectives:</i> This analysis aims to identify COVID-19-related stressors associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking since the outbreak of the coronavirus. <i>Methods:</i> Data were collected on sociodemographics, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-related stressors (household composition, job status, essential worker, stay-at-home duration, and depression) using a web-based, self-report survey to US adults from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression models were used to assess associations between COVID-19-related stressors and binge drinking and changes in alcohol consumption. Among 1,982 participants, 69% were female and 31% male. <i>Results:</i> Thirty-four percent of the sample reported binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. More binge drinkers increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic (60%) than non-binge drinkers (28%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, for every 1-week increase in time spent at home during the pandemic, there was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.08-1.35) greater odds of binge drinking. Additionally, binge drinkers with a previous diagnosis of depression and current depression symptoms had greater odds of increased alcohol consumption compared to those reporting no depression (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.80, 95% CI: 1.15-2.81). <i>Conclusion:</i> Specific COVID-19-related stressors are related to alcohol consumption. This highlights the ancillary and unintended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which could have long-lasting population health consequences.","Weerakoon, Jetelina, Knell","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2020.1832508","20201207","Alcohol consumption; binge drinking; covid-19; shelter-in-place; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7920,""

"How did the mental health of children and adolescents change during early lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK?","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruption to the lives of children and young people. Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors, is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the UK in response to the pandemic. Methods UK-based parents and carers (n = 2,673) of school-aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their childâ€™s mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among pre-adolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders, exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of lockdown on children and young peopleâ€™s adjustment. Developing an understanding of who has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and in what ways, is crucial in order to target effective support where it is most needed.","Polly Waite Dr et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-545-EB2","20201208","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; adolescents; covid-19; young people; mental health; children; lockdown; pandemic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-08","",7923,""
