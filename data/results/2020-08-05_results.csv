"[Comment] The challenges of planetary mental health in the COVID-19 era","As the focus of the COVID-19 crisis is gradually taken away from emergency healthcare needs, increased attention is warranted on the psychological impact of the pandemic on a global level  Existing guidance on managing the COVID-19 related distress needs to be better informed by upcoming larger-scale research  Applying e-Health can be useful in dealing with the immediate psychological needs, while developing strategies to identify vulnerable populations and shifting the provision of mental health and social care to community services need to be prioritised when looking at the future  Focusing on global mental health during this universal crisis is an opportunity for promoting a more compassionate and less discriminating society","Tsamakis, Konstantinos; Dimitrakakis, Georgios; Stefanadi, Ellie; Tsiptsios, Dimitrios; Dimitrakaki, Inetzi; Mueller, Christoph; Spandidos, Demetrios; Stefanadis, Christodoulos; Rizos, Emmanouil","https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2020.8927","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine;20(3):1843-1844, 2020.; Publication details: Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine;20(3):1843-1844, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3647,""
"Effects of general and sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors on the mental health of lesbian, gay and bisexual people in Hong Kong","The impact of COVID-19 on mental health has begun to be widely recognized  While the mental health of socially marginalized groups has been examined, there is an absence of studies on how the mental health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people have been affected  857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study  Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31 5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27 9%)  Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic  4 2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation  One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34 7%)  The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors significantly contributed to the variance explained in depressive and anxiety symptoms, beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors  Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response","Suen, Yiu-tung; Chan, Randolph Chun Ho; Wong, Eliz Miu Yin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;2020.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3648,""
"Finding the Right Balance: An Evidence-Informed Guidance Document to Support the Re-Opening of Canadian Nursing Homes to Family Caregivers and Visitors during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian nursing homes implemented strict no-visitor policies to reduce the risk of introducing COVID-19 in these settings  There are now growing concerns that the risks associated with restricted access to family caregivers and visitors have started to outweigh the potential benefits associated with preventing COVID-19 infections  Many residents have sustained severe and potentially irreversible physical, functional, cognitive, and mental health declines  As Canada emerges from its first wave of the pandemic, nursing homes across the country have cautiously started to reopen these settings, yet there is broad criticism that emerging visitor policies are overly restrictive, inequitable and potentially harmful  We reviewed the nursing home visitor policies for Canadaâ€™s ten provinces and three territories as well as international policies and reports on the topic to develop evidence-informed, data-driven and expert-reviewed guidance for the re-opening of Canadian nursing homes to family caregivers and visitors","Stall, Nathan M.; Johnstone, Jennie; McGeer, Allison J.; Dhuper, Misha; Dunning, Julie; Sinha, Samir K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.07.038","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;2020.; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3649,""

"How People Emotionally Respond to the News on COVID-19: An Online Survey","Introduction: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, news media has played an important role in informing people to satisfy their curiosity about this stressful condition  Regular exposure to such stressful news may elicit different emotions in people and engage them in using strategies to control their emotions  In the present study, we aimed at exploring the most common negative emotion(s) experienced by individuals, as well as the most frequent Emotion Regulation (ER) strategies used facing the COVID-19-related news  We also examined whether the variable of personal relevance can moderate these emotional responses  Methods: 617 individuals living in Tehran who regularly read the news about the COVID-19 from the early stages of spread completed an online survey  After excluding the participants with high scores from the Beck Depression Inventory (&gt;18), data obtained from 443 participants were analyzed in terms of the experienced negative emotions and ER strategies  Results: Anxiety (55 8%) was the most common negative emotion reported by participants facing COVID-19-related news and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy used to control negative emotions  Both groups with high and low personal relevance indicated a similar pattern in experiencing high and low arousal emotions, as well as using ER strategies, and no significant differences were found (X2=0 006, p=0 51;X2=0 14, p=0 39, respectively)  We also found that participants with high scores in the resilience scale used an integrative rather than a single approach of the ER strategies (rbp=0 15, p=0 01)  Conclusion: We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, news media may have important role in triggering anxiety in people who regularly read the relevant news, and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy among them  Being directly involved with COVID-19 in personal life did not make any differences in the way that individuals emotionally respond to the news  While using an integrative approach in regulating emotion was found in more resilient individuals","Hamidein, Zahra; Hatami, Javad; Rezapour, Tara","https://doi.org/10.32598/bcn.11.covid19.809.2","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Journal;11(2):171-178, 2020.; Publication details: Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Journal;11(2):171-178, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3655,""

An online survey was conducted by the Turkish Endometriosis &amp; Adenomyosis Society and administered to patients with endometriosis who agreed to participate in the study. The survey included 25 questions prepared by an expert committee of four professionals (two gynecologists and two endometriosis specialists). Of the 290 questionnaires sent out, 261 (90%) were returned. A total of 213 (83.86%) patients reported that they were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. In addition, 133 (53.63%) patients thought the management of their endometriosis was affected because of the pandemic. Clinical studies clearly indicate that endometriosis is a condition associated with high levels of chronic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has led the public to experience psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. The majority of patients with endometriosis were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. The majority of elective endometriosis surgeries have not been postponed.

"Covid-19-Beyond virology: Potentials for maintaining mental health during lockdown","The current study aimed to assess prevalence of mental disorders during Covid-19 pandemic- and respective lockdown in Germany, and potential behaviors/states that can have protective functions on preventing severe mental problems. Assessing prevalence of mental disorders, as well as to find potential protective variables is very important in order to determine people's psychological suffering. It provides the basis for teaching possible coping styles in order to prevent a major breakdown on mental health. Prevalence on mental disorders was expected to increase during the pandemic, especially depression, (general-/and health-) anxiety, panic attacks- and disorder, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, potentially protective variables, such as resilience and coping, were included. N = 949 subjects completed an online-survey that asked for symptoms regarding depression, (health) anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and lock-down related behavior-starting 14 days after lockdown in Germany. Prevalence of mental disorders in the current sample was much higher than usual prevalence of mental disorders, with 50.6% expressing at least one mental disorder. Resilience was associated with lower risks for any mental disorder (OR = 4.23, p &lt; .0001, 95%CI = 3.21-5.57), as well as with any other measured mental illness (all ORs between = 2.82 for obsessive-compulsive disorder and OR = 41.44 for panic disorder, all p &lt; .001). Similar results were obtained regarding coping (focus on positive). Results are highly relevant in order to provide a glance on what substantial influence the current pandemic- and lockdown situation has on mental health across the country, and possibly across the world. Possible ways in order to prevent deterioration and help coping with the current situation are being elaborated and discussed.","Munk, Schmidt, Alexander, Henkel, Hennig","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236688","20200804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3661,""
"Closing the COVID-19 Psychological Treatment Gap for Cancer Patients in Alberta: Protocol for Implementation and Evaluation of Text4Hope-Cancer Care","Background: Cancer diagnoses and treatments usually engender significant anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients, close relatives, and caregivers. During the COVID-19 pandemic providing psychological support in this context presents additional challenges due to self-isolation and social or physical distancing measures in place to limit viral spread. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. We will implement daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a way of reducing/managing anxiety and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment in Alberta. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, their demographic correlates, and Text4Hope-Cancer Care induced changes in anxiety and depression will be evaluated. Alberta residents with a cancer diagnosis and loved ones of those dealing with cancer diagnosis can self-subscribe to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program by texting &quot;CancerCare&quot; to a dedicated text number. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be collected at onset of individuals receiving text messages, and at the mid and endpoints of the program (i.e., 6- and 12-weeks). Data will be analyzed with parametric and non-parametric statistics for primary outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including number of subscribers and user satisfaction. In addition, data-mining and machine learning analysis will focus on determining characteristics of subscribers that predict high levels of symptoms of mental disorders, and may subsequently predict changes in those measures in response to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program. Text4Hope-Cancer Care has the potential to provide key information regarding prevalence rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed or receiving care for cancer and their caregivers. The study will generate demographic correlates of anxiety and depression, and outcome data related to this scalable, population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for healthcare practitioners working in cancer care and may help inform policy and decision-making regarding psychological interventions for cancer care. Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board (Pro00086163).","Agyapong, Hrabok, Shalaby, Mrklas, Vuong, Gusnowski, Surood, Greenshaw, Nkire","https://doi.org/10.2196/20240","20200804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3662,""
"What factors increase the risk of complications in SARS-Cov-2 infected patients? A cohort study in a nationwide Israeli health organization","Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. Multiple studies have attempted to characterize at-risk patients, using various data sources and methodologies. Most of these studies, however, explored condition-specific patient cohorts (e.g., hospitalized patients) or had limited access to patients' medical history; thus, investigating related questions and, potentially, obtaining biased results. To identify factors associated with COVID-19 complications from the complete medical records of a nationally representative SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort. We studied a cohort of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples, in a nationwide health organization (covering 2.3 million individuals) and identified those who suffered from serious complications (that is, experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, admitted to intensive care unit or died). We then compared the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, extracted from electronic health records, between complicated and non-complicated COVID-19 patient cohorts to identify the conditions that significantly increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Of the 4,353 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, 173 (4%) patients suffered from COVID-19 complications (all above the age of 18 years). Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications. It also indicates that depression (e.g., odds ratio, OR, for males 65 years or older: 2.94, 95% confidence intervals [1.55, 5.58]; P = .014) as well as cognitive and neurological disorder (e.g., OR for individuals Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years old: 2.65 [1.69, 4.17]; P &lt; .001) are significant risk factors; and that smoking and background of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Our analysis agrees with previous studies on multiple risk factors, including hypertension and obesity. It also finds depression, cognitive and neurological disorders, but not smoking and respiratory diseases, to be significantly associated with COVID-19 complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment and recovery efforts.","Yanover, Mizrahi, Kalkstein, Marcus, Akiva, Barer, Shalev, Chodick","https://doi.org/10.2196/20872","20200804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3663,""
"Letter to the editor in response to the article- &quot;Digital mental health and covid-19: using technology today to accelerate the curve on access and quality tomorrow&quot;","Sir, The editorial titled, &quot;Digital mental health and covid-19: using technology today to accelerate the curve on access and quality tomorrow&quot; [1] was an interesting read. The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed use of telepsychiatry and broken down barriers to use technology that existed until recently giving way to a 'can do' approach. The editorial rightly discusses accelerating use of information technology in psychiatry. This is a good time to collect global experience and this is a view from telepsychiatry use in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Whilst telepsychiatry has always been available, there was a notable reluctance to embrace it despite support from accrediting bodies such as the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists which endorsed the view that it can be an option when in person consults were not feasible. Like most public mental health services in Australia, our service also moved to tele psychiatry quickly after COVID-19 to provide safe consulting services. We collated some of our experiences by conducting a rapid survey, which was sent out to 40 people with 14 responses. 70% of the respondents reported the number of teleconsults had increased significantly during this time and a further 70% noted that there were fewer missed appointments and the work was generally more efficient following the transition to tele psychiatry. 79% were satisfied with the care they were able to provide. A few challenges were also encountered during this transition. Difficulty using new technology was experienced by 70% of the respondents. A plethora of platforms such as Zoom, Doxy, CoViu, etc., are available in Australia, each with their own benefits and concerns. There was lack of consensus about which platform to use and guidelines changed frequently requiring learning and relearning when switching between platforms, creating difficulty for some staff and patients alike. Other difficulties experienced by the team were maintaining therapeutic alliance. Effective communication of empathy and use of non-verbal gestures when doing teleconsults was also a challenge. Lack of data availability to do video consults for some disadvantaged patients was also noted. Training around effective use of information technology could be helpful and the survey revealed that only one out of fourteen respondents had sought such training. Suitability of patients for teleconsults is a key issue to consider. Often, the ones with anxiety and mood spectrum disorders were easier to engage compared to the psychotic or drug using patients who had limited insight. There are advantages of using video over telephone as someone who is teary or hypomanic cannot be readily identified over the latter. Another challenge was the absence of a seamless delivery method to ensure electronic prescription dispatch to the pharmacy. Faxing or emailing prescriptions not only increased the workload, but were also unreliable. We hope that adding the Australian experience with telepsychiatry during the COVID pandemic will help in planning better telepsychiatry services in the future- a future where integration of key clinical functions occur within telehealth platforms enabling delivery of accessible, seamless and safe care.

"[Suicidality in adults]","Suicide rates appear to be influenced by the economy. In the Netherlands, fluctuation in these rates in the last 10 years was mainly seen in men. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a negative impact on this fluctuation. There are no reliable predictors of suicidality yet, but there are developments that could lead to better predictions. Examples include 'big data' and 'machine learning' in combination with a network approach in which psychopathology is seen as a complex dynamic system. Better differentiation of suicidality can help clinical practice to offer tailored treatment and prevention. Suicidality is a multifactorial and complex phenomenon that goes beyond mental healthcare. In recent years, various prevention strategies and lines of research have been launched that focus on this complexity, making suicidality easier to treat and understand. The 113 foundation for suicide prevention has an important coordinating and facilitating role in this.","de Winter, de Beurs","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Suicidality+in+adults].","20200804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3665,""
"Initial Challenges of Caregiving During COVID-19: Caregiver Burden, Mental Health, and the Parent-Child Relationship","Research confirms that the mental health burdens following community-wide disasters are extensive, with pervasive impacts noted in individuals and families. It is clear that child disaster outcomes are worst among children of highly distressed caregivers, or those caregivers who experience their own negative mental health outcomes from the disaster. The current study used path analysis to examine concurrent patterns of parents' (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°420) experience from a national sample during the early months of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic. The results of a multi-group path analysis, organized by parent gender, indicate good fit to the data [X<sup>2</sup>(10)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159.04, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01]. Results indicate significant linkages between parents' caregiver burden, mental health, and perceptions of children's stress; these in turn are significantly linked to child-parent closeness and conflict, indicating possible spillover effects for depressed parents and compensatory effects for anxious parents. The impact of millions of families sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic for an undefined period of time may lead to unprecedented impacts on individuals' mental health with unknown impacts on child-parent relationships. These impacts may be heightened for families whose caregivers experience increased mental health symptoms, as was the case for fathers in the current sample.","Russell, Hutchison, Tambling, Tomkunas, Horton","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-020-01037-x","20200804","Anxiety; COVID-19; Caregiver burden; Depression; ParentÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild relationship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3666,""
"Conceptualizing COVID-19 and Public Panic with the Moderating Role of Media Use and Uncertainty in China: An Empirical Framework","Uncertainty puts people in a binary state of mind, where every piece of external information can positively or negatively affect their state of health. Given the uncertain situation created by the new coronavirus pandemic, this study claims to be the first empirical analysis of the real-time status of public panic in China. It frames peoples' intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, creating a psychosocial analysis of public panic. We conducted an online survey of WeChat and QQ users in February 2020 and collected 1613 samples through a QR code questionnaire. We used the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equation model to conceptualize public panic pathways in different gender and age groups. This underlines the psychological origins of fear and anxiety and points out how the media uses socially constructed public panic. The results show that the outbreak of COVID-19 created uncertainty among the public, and the official media intensified it because of the late dissemination of news about the outbreak's real-time status. Hence, unofficial media remained faster in news reporting, but the news reporting remained contradictory with official reports. This created doubts about the authenticity of the given information and caused public mental health abnormalities. The study provides a conceptual framework based on lessons learned from physiology, psychology, and social psychology and real-time public analysis to inform policymakers and public administrators about the contextual dynamics of public panic in China. It provides useful insights into the wise handling of this uncertain time and controlling the fatal conditions of public panic created by COVID-19. It has implications for other countries as well.","Xu, Sattar","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8030249","20200804","anxiety; cognition; news reporting; novel coronavirus; psychosocial analysis; public health; stress management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3667,""

"Psychosocial factors associated with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare providers commonly experience symptoms of anxiety during public health crises and pandemics. The objective of the study was to identify the frequency of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in general practitioners and to estimate the association with particular psychosocial and demographic factors. This is a cross-sectional study, where a total of 531 general practitioners completed an online form that contained sociodemographic variables, questions about fear and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), questionnaire on psychosomatic problems and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The presence of symptoms of GAD was defined by a GAD-7 score of 10 or more points. Voluntary and anonymous participation, acceptance of terms, and informed consent were requested. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners; the following psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with a greater presence of these symptoms: female gender, social discrimination, anguish, job disappointment, nightmares, stress and other symptoms of fear regarding the pandemic. Conversely, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and trusting government measures and information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD. These findings highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals. The authors suggest mental health providers should be deployed during times of crisis to decrease the risk of developing mental illness.","Monterrosa-Castro, Redondo-Mendoza, Mercado-Lara","https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001456","20200804","anxiety; psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3670,""

The scarcity of research in this regard and the necessary acceptance of uncertainty to face the situation, both socially, as well as health and psychological, are discussed.

"Patients With Voice Prosthesis Rehabilitation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analyzing the Effectiveness of Remote Triage and Management","To describe a remote approach used with patients with voice prosthesis after laryngectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting clinical outcomes in terms of voice prosthesis complications management, oncological monitoring, and psychophysical well-being. Prospective cohort study. Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary. Participants who refused telematic support had a significantly shorter time interval from the last ear, nose, and throat visit than patients who accepted (57.95 vs 96.14 days, <i>P</i> = .03). Video-called patients showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety and depression (mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score pre- vs post-video call: 13.97 vs. 10.23, <i>P</i> &lt; .0001) and reported high levels of satisfaction about the service. Remote approach may be a viable support in the management of patients with voice prosthesis rehabilitation.","Longobardi, Galli, D'Alatri, Savoia, Mari, Rigante, Passali, Bussu, Parrilla","https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820948043","20200804","COVID-19; management; total laryngectomy; voice prosthesis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3672,""
"Considerations for assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in Australia","During this unprecedented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for empirical data to characterise its impact on the mental health and well-being of Australians. In this viewpoint, we outline a number of considerations for research on this topic, highlighting areas necessitating special attention, consideration of particular vulnerable groups and the need for longitudinal studies to track mental health fluctuations in the general population. We conclude by introducing the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project, outlining its aims, addressing some considerations raised herein and detailing avenues for future research. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (WHO, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major upheaval both in Australia and globally. While the search for a vaccine continues, current efforts towards tackling the virus and limiting contagion in several nations have focused on social distancing and the shutdown of non-essential services. In Australia, the first case was reported on 13 January 2020 (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team, 2020), the first death occurred on 24 February and a spate of progressive restrictions were enforced throughout the 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks leading up to 31 March 2020 (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team, 2020a).","Tan, Meyer, Neill, Phillipou, Toh, Van Rheenen, Rossell","https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420947815","20200804","COVID-19; Coronavirus; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-05","",3673,""

"The Witness to Witness Program: Helping the Helpers in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Witness to Witness Program (W2W), based on Weingarten's witnessing model (2000, 2003, 2004), began in July 2018 and originally was established to support healthcare workers and attorneys (our partners) who were experiencing empathic distress working with people involved in various stages of the detention process. The W2W program evolved to offer four primary components: clinician listening sessions geared to deep understanding of the person's story of their work and its challenges; an inventory of the person's current internal and external resources both in the present and in the past; help with removal of barriers to those resources; and development of a personal toolkit to handle stress. Additional services available to partners and their organizations included psycho-educational webinars, facilitated peer support groups, and organizational consultations to foster trauma-sensitive and resilience-hardy work environments. In March, after lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, W2W pivoted to focus on handouts and webinars addressing how to cope with distress and moral injury, maintaining resilience, coping with grief, and dealing with multiple losses caused by the pandemic. Disaster sparked collaboration and innovation. A train the trainer model was developed to reach more community health workers providing services to the Latinx community dealing with losses similar to those experienced by the clients they serve. W2W continues to create virtual communities of support. In doing so we practice doing reasonable hope together (Weingarten, Family Process, 2010, 49, 5). El Ã¢â‚¬Å“Programa de testigo a testigoÃ¢â‚¬Â (Witness to Witness Program, W2W), basado en el modelo de testigos de Weingarten (2000, 2003, 2004), comenzÃƒÂ³ en julio de 2018 y se creÃƒÂ³ originalmente para apoyar a los trabajadores sanitarios y a los abogados (nuestros socios) que estaban sufriendo distrÃƒÂ©s empÃƒÂ¡tico al trabajar con personas implicadas en varias etapas del proceso de detenciÃƒÂ³n. El programa W2W evolucionÃƒÂ³ y ahora ofrece cuatro componentes principales: sesiones de escucha con el clÃƒÂ­nico orientadas a una comprensiÃƒÂ³n profunda de la historia del trabajo de la persona y sus dificultades; un inventario de los recursos externos e internos actuales de la persona tanto en el presente como en el pasado; ayuda con la eliminaciÃƒÂ³n de obstÃƒÂ¡culos para acceder a esos recursos; y desarrollo de un conjunto de herramientas personales para manejar el estrÃƒÂ©s. Otros servicios disponibles para los socios y sus organizaciones fueron seminarios web psicoeducativos, grupos de autoayuda con facilitadores y consultas organizacionales para fomentar entornos de trabajo donde se priorice la sensibilidad al trauma y la resiliencia. En marzo, despuÃƒÂ©s de los confinamientos por la pandemia del coronavirus, el W2W dio un giro para centrarse en folletos y seminarios web que abordan cÃƒÂ³mo afrontar el distrÃƒÂ©s y el daÃƒÂ±o moral, mantener la resiliencia, afrontar el duelo y soportar numerosas pÃƒÂ©rdidas causadas por la pandemia. La catÃƒÂ¡strofe generÃƒÂ³ colaboraciÃƒÂ³n e innovaciÃƒÂ³n. Se desarrollÃƒÂ³ un modelo para capacitar a los capacitadores a fin de llegar a mÃƒÂ¡s trabajadores sanitarios de la comunidad que prestan servicios a la comunidad latina a la hora de afrontar pÃƒÂ©rdidas similares a las sufridas por los pacientes a quienes atienden. El W2W continÃƒÂºa creando comunidades virtuales de apoyo. Al hacerlo, ensayamos una esperanza razonable juntos (Weingarten, 2010b).
