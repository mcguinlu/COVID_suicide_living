"Comparison of Mental Health Symptom Changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 by Sex or Gender: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background: Women and gender-diverse individuals face disproportionate socioeconomic burden during COVID-19. We compared mental health symptom changes since pre-COVID-19 by sex or gender. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, medRxiv, and Open Science Framework December 31, 2019 to March 22, 2021 for studies that reported mental health outcomes prior to and during COVID-19 by sex or gender. We conducted restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects meta-analyses. Results: All 11 included studies (9 unique cohorts) compared females or women to males or men; none included gender-diverse individuals. Continuous symptom change differences were not statistically significant for depression (standardized mean difference [SMD]= 0.15, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.39; 3 studies, 4,159 participants; I2=77%) and stress (SMD= -0.09, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.02; 3 studies, 1,217 participants; I2=0%), but anxiety (SMD= 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.26; 3 studies, 4,028 participants; I2=34%) and general mental health (SMD= 0.15, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.18; 2 studies, 15,590 participants; I2=0%) worsened more among females or women than males or men. There were no significant differences in changes in proportion above a cut-off: anxiety (difference= 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02; 2 studies, 6,684 participants; I2=0%), depression (difference= 0.12, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.28; 1 study, 217 participants), general mental health (difference= -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; 3 studies, 18,985 participants; I2=94%), stress (difference= 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.18; 1 study, 217 participants). Interpretation: Mental health outcomes did not differ or were somewhat worse among women than men.","Tiffany Dal Santo; Ying Sun; Yin Wu; Chen He; Yutong Wang; Xiaowen Jiang; Kexin Li; Olivia Bonardi; Ankur Krishnan; Jill T.

"Bilateral associations between sleep duration and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and the leading cause of disability among adolescents, with sleep duration as its vital influential factor. Adolescents might be mentally sensitive to the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the alteration of adolescents' sleep duration, depression, and their associations within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been well documented. We conducted a longitudinal study, recruiting 2496 adolescents from 3 junior high schools to examine the alteration of their sleep duration and depressive symptoms before and during the pandemic, and to explore their potential association(s). Data were collected before (December 2019) and during the pandemic (July 2020). Paired samples t-test revealed a significant decrease in sleep duration and a significant increase in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher grades, COVID-19 infection history, higher CES-DC score, and the COVID-19 pandemic itself might contribute to decreased sleep duration, while longer exercise duration during the pandemic might be a protective factor. According to the cross-lagged analysis, the existence of depressive symptoms before the pandemic was significantly associated with a shorter sleep duration during the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.106, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Previously shortened sleep duration was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.082, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Our findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative influence on adolescents' mental health and sleep. Mental preparedness should be highlighted to mitigate the psychosocial influences of any possible public emergencies in the future. Sleep duration represents a viable home-based intervention for depressive symptoms.","Liao, Luo, Liu, Zhao, Shi, Lei, Jia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.06.007","20210702","Depression; Longitudinal associations; Repeated measures; Sleep; Teenagers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15609,""
"A nine-month study on the course of COVID-19 related perceived post-traumatic stress disorder among Italian community-dwelling adults","The present study aimed to evaluate base rate estimates, course of, and psychopathology and personality risk factors for COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in community-dwelling adults during the pandemic. 203 participants from a sample of 811 Italian community-dwelling adults agreed to participate in a nine-month, three-wave (Wave 1: March 2020; Wave 2: June 2020; Wave 3: December 2020) longitudinal study. Participants in the longitudinal study did not differ from the cross-sectional original sample on age, gender, civil status, educational level, occupation, and Italian area of residence. At each wave, participants were administered the PTSD scale of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), DSM-5 measures of acute stress, dissociation, depression and anxiety, as well as a maladaptive personality domain measure at Wave 1. Participants were instructed to answer to the ITQ items based only on COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures. The point prevalence estimates of COVID-19 related PTSD at each wave ranged from 11% to 13%; however, up to roughly 23% of our participants experienced clinically relevant PTSD features during nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Multiple logistic regression results showed that experiencing internalizing symptoms (i.e., mostly acute stress) and selected personality features (i.e., Negative Affectivity and Psychoticism) at Wave 1 represent risk factors for PTSD symptoms at later waves. These findings extend previous knowledge on COVID-19 related PTSD and support the need for preventive and treatment interventions for PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Somma, Krueger, Markon, Gialdi, Colanino, Ferlito, Liotta, Fossati","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.024","20210702","COVID-19 pandemic; Community-dwelling participants; Internalizing symptoms; Longitudinal study; Maladaptive personality domains","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15610,""

"An overview of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since its initial outbreak in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the global community. In addition to the negative health consequences of contracting COVID-19, the implementation of strict quarantine and lockdown measures has also disrupted social networks and devastated the global economy. As a result, there is rising concern that the pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of the general population. To better understand its impact, an increasing number of studies examined the effects of the pandemic on mental health and psychosocial implications of enforced quarantine and lockdown. In this article, we aim to review and summarize the findings from a variety of studies that have explored the psychosociological effects of the pandemic and its impact on the mental well-being of the general population. We will also examine how various demographic groups, such as the elderly and youth, can be more susceptible or resilient to the pandemic's mental health effects. We hope to provide a broader understanding of the underlying causes of mental health issues triggered by the pandemic and provide recommendations that may be employed to address mental health issues in the population over the long-term.","Chen, Pusica, Sohaei, Prassas, Diamandis","https://doi.org/10.1515/dx-2021-0046","20210702","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; pandemic; psychological health; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15614,""
"University students' sense of coherence, future worries and mental health: findings from the German COVID-HL-survey","Early-on in the COVID-19 pandemic when universities were closed as part of the nation-wide public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, studying and student life significantly changed. Based on limited evidence the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between sense of coherence (SoC), future worries and mental health outcomes among German university students during the early phase of the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey with n =Ã¢â‚¬â€°14 916 participants was carried out by inviting all private and public universities in Germany. All data were analysed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics. Findings indicate a low and very low wellbeing for 38% of university students. Moreover, 29% reported being affected by at least two health complaints more than once week. Both health outcomes follow a social gradient and could be more frequently observed for respondents with lower subjective social status and female students. Regression analysis revealed significant association between the SoC dimensions and wellbeing (OR: 1.2-2.03) as well as health complaints (OR: 1.58-1.71). A high level of future worries was associated with low/very low wellbeing (OR: 2.83) and multiple health complaints (OR: 2.84). Based on the results, the public health response to the pandemic and university health promotion should therefore consider student mental health as an important target within their policy and action frameworks.","Dadaczynski, Okan, Messer, Rathmann","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab070","20210702","COVID-19; psychosomatic complaints; sense of coherence; university students; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15615,""
"Prevalence of depressive symptomatology among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 and the policies to contain it have been a social problem and public health emergency for people in Italy in 2020. The aim of the study is assessing the prevalence of depression symptoms among nursing students from the University of Palermo during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employed a cross-sectional study design. On April 2020, a survey was performed including all the nursing students of the University of Palermo. The survey was structured into two parts. The first part consisted in the collection of socio-demographic information, the second in the administration of the QIDS-SR16 questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to elaborate the results and adjusted Odds Ratios are presented. The sample consisted of 525 students (70.3% female). The probability to have a moderate/severe/ very severe depressive symptomatology is significantly associated with the following variables: ""Female gender"" (aOR 1.96), ""Low perceived economic status"" (aOR 2.32), ""Low perceived health status"" (aOR 2.30) and ""To be a smoker"" (aOR 2.24).

"The increasing significance of disease severity in a burden of disease framework","Recent estimates have reiterated that non-fatal causes of disease, such as low back pain, headaches and depressive disorders, are amongst the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). For these causes, the contribution of years lived with disability (YLD) - put simply, ill-health - is what drives DALYs, not mortality. Being able to monitor trends in YLD closely is particularly relevant for countries that sit high on the socio-demographic spectrum of development, as it contributes more than half of all DALYs. There is a paucity of data on how the population-level occurrence of disease is distributed according to severity, and as such, the majority of global and national efforts in monitoring YLD lack the ability to differentiate changes in severity across time and location. This raises uncertainties in interpreting these findings without triangulation with other relevant data sources. Our commentary aims to bring this issue to the forefront for users of burden of disease estimates, as its impact is often easily overlooked as part of the fundamental process of generating DALY estimates. Moreover, the wider health harms of the COVID-19 pandemic have underlined the likelihood of latent and delayed demand in accessing vital health and care services that will ultimately lead to exacerbated disease severity and health outcomes. This places increased importance on attempts to be able to differentiate by both the occurrence and severity of disease.","Wyper, Assuncao, Fletcher, Gourley, Grant, Haagsma, Hilderink, Idavain, Lesnik, von der Lippe, Majdan, Mccartney, Santric-Milicevic, Pallari, Pires, Plass, Porst, Santos, de Haro Moro, Stockton, Devleesschauwer","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211024478","20210702","Burden of disease; DALY; European burden of disease network; Scottish burden of disease; YLD; disability-adjusted life year; disease severity; severity distribution; years lived with disability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15617,""
"Compliance with recommendations limiting COVID-19 contagion among university students in Sweden: associations with self-reported symptoms, mental health and academic self-efficacy","The COVID-19 containment strategy in Sweden uses public health recommendations relying on personal responsibility for compliance. Universities were one of few public institutions subject to strict closure, meaning that students had to adapt overnight to online teaching. This study investigates the prevalence of self-reported recommendation compliance and associations with self-reported symptoms of contagion, self-experienced effects on mental health and academic self-efficacy among university students in Sweden in May-June 2020. This was a cross-sectional 23 question online survey in which data were analysed by multinomial regression, taking a Bayesian analysis approach complemented by null hypothesis testing. A total of 4495 students consented to respond. Recommendation compliance ranged between 70% and 96%. Women and older students reported higher compliance than did men and younger students. Mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms were reported by 30%, severe symptoms by fewer than 2%; 15% reported being uncertain and half of the participants reported no symptoms. Mental health effects were reported by over 80%, and changes in academic self-efficacy were reported by over 85%; in both these areas negative effects predominated. Self-reported symptoms and uncertainty about contagion were associated with non-compliance, negative mental health effects, and impaired academic self-efficacy. Students generally followed public health recommendations during strict closure of universities, but many reported considerable negative consequences related to mental health and academic self-efficacy. Digital interventions should be developed and evaluated to boost coping skills, build resilience and alleviate student suffering during the pandemic and future similar crises.","Berman, Bendtsen, Molander, Lindfors, Lindner, Granlund, Topooco, EngstrÃƒÂ¶m, Andersson","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211027824","20210702","COVID-19; academic self-efficacy; digital interventions; epidemiology; higher education; mental health; pandemics; recommendation compliance; social medicine; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15618,""
"The effect of the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown on national psychiatric contacts in Denmark: An interrupted time series analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in national lockdowns in several countries. Previous global epidemics led to an increase in the number of psychiatric patients presenting symptoms of anxiety or depression. Knowledge about the impact of early lockdown initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of healthcare interactions is sparse. Contacts in this study include all recorded face-to-face (FTF) and virtual treatment interactions between patients and healthcare systems. To investigate both the impact of the Danish lockdown event on psychiatric patients' contact with the healthcare system, stratified by type of contact (FTF or virtual) and ICD-10 diagnosis, and how acute contacts were impacted in the five regions in Denmark. An interrupted time series analysis was applied to determine the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown event on the number of contacts with psychiatric hospitals in Denmark, from February 25, 2019 to May 3, 2020. The analyses took a Box-Jenkins approach to fit an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Virtual contacts replaced most FTF contacts during the lockdown. For most patient groups, the total number of contacts did not decrease significantly. However, for adult patients diagnosed with ICD-10 F 0-10, 10-19, and 60-69 and child and adolescent patients diagnosed with F 10-19, 70-79, and 80-89, the number of contacts decreased during lockdown. The number of acute contacts with the psychiatric system decreased significantly in all regions in Denmark during lockdown. The Danish healthcare system was forced to introduce innovative tele-psychiatry to mental health care during the lockdown. Disruption to service delivery was minimized because the resources were in place to sustain the transition from FTF to virtual contacts.","Hansen, van Sas, FlÃƒÂ¸jstrup, Brabrand, Hvolby","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2264","20210702","COVID-19; interrupted time series analysis; population register; professional-patient relations; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15619,""
"A critical overview of computational approaches employed for COVID-19 drug discovery","COVID-19 has resulted in huge numbers of infections and deaths worldwide and brought the most severe disruptions to societies and economies since the Great Depression. Massive experimental and computational research effort to understand and characterize the disease and rapidly develop diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs has emerged in response to this devastating pandemic and more than 130Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 COVID-19-related research papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals or deposited in preprint servers. Much of the research effort has focused on the discovery of novel drug candidates or repurposing of existing drugs against COVID-19, and many such projects have been either exclusively computational or computer-aided experimental studies. Herein, we provide an expert overview of the key computational methods and their applications for the discovery of COVID-19 small-molecule therapeutics that have been reported in the research literature. We further outline that, after the first year the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that drug repurposing has not produced rapid and global solutions. However, several known drugs have been used in the clinic to cure COVID-19 patients, and a few repurposed drugs continue to be considered in clinical trials, along with several novel clinical candidates. We posit that truly impactful computational tools must deliver actionable, experimentally testable hypotheses enabling the discovery of novel drugs and drug combinations, and that open science and rapid sharing of research results are critical to accelerate the development of novel, much needed therapeutics for COVID-19.","Muratov, Amaro, Andrade, Brown, Ekins, Fourches, Isayev, Kozakov, Medina-Franco, Merz, Oprea, Poroikov, Schneider, Todd, Varnek, Winkler, Zakharov, Cherkasov, Tropsha","https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cs01065k","20210702","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15620,""
"Assessing COVID-19-related anxiety and functional impairment amongst nurses in Malawi","Psychological well-being of nurses is crucial for them to effectively discharge their duties. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related anxiety can interfere with nurses' performance and reduce their self-efficacy. The primary aim of this study was to assess COVID-19-related anxiety and functional impairment amongst nurses in Malawi. The secondary aim of the study was to determine reliability and validity of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale. The study was conducted in Malawi. This was a cross-sectional study that collected quantitative data from 102 nurses in Malawi online. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and receiver operating curve analysis. This study found that 25.5% (26) of respondents had COVID-19-related anxiety and 48% (49) functional impairment. There were significant differences in the numbers of respondents who had functional impairment in relation to workplace (ÃŽÂ§2 = 8.7, p = 0.03), with many of those working in hospitals (58.6%, n = 34) having highest levels (mean = 20.6 Ã‚Â± 10.4). The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale proved to be an effective instrument (Sensitivity = 73.1%; Specificity = 60.5%; area under the curve = 0.73) for assessing COVID-19-related anxiety amongst nurses. It is necessary to screen nurses for COVID-19-related anxiety and functional impairment and provide them effective psychosocial interventions. Policymakers should place more emphasis on allocation of financial resources to mental health services and staff support programmes targeting nurses during pandemics. There is a need to conduct future research on mental health interventions that might be used to assist nurses with COVID-19-related anxiety and functional impairment.","Chorwe-Sungani","https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v13i1.2823","20210702","COVID-19; anxiety; functional impairment; nurse; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15621,""

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of adults with intellectual impairment: evidence from two longitudinal UK surveys","People with an intellectual impairment experience high levels of social and health inequalities. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of people with intellectual impairment, controlling for demographic risk, socio-economic circumstances and pre-pandemic health levels. Data were drawn from two UK birth cohorts that surveyed their participants on the impact of COVID-19 in May 2020: the Millennium Cohort Study (20-year-old participants) and the British Cohort Survey (50-year-old participants). Health outcomes (COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 symptoms, self-reported physical health, mental health, health service use and impact on health behaviours) were compared between people with and without intellectual impairment, adjusting for gender and ethnicity. Differences were further adjusted for self-reported health pre-pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic circumstances. Controlling for gender and ethnicity, poor health was reported less often by younger adults [relative risks (RR): 0.44 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23, 0.86] and more often by older adults (RR: 1.99 95% CI 1.45, 2.73) with intellectual impairment compared with peers. Older adults were also more likely to experience fever and loss of taste/smell. Adjusting for pre-pandemic health and socio-economic circumstances eliminated some differences in the older cohort, but not in the younger one. In young adulthood, the impact of COVID-19 on health outcomes was not negative. The pattern was reversed in later adulthood, although differences were mostly eliminated after adjustment suggesting a socio-economic and age gradient of COVID-19 impacts on intellectual impairment.","Totsika, Emerson, Hastings, Hatton","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12866","20210702","COVID-19 symptoms; health behaviours; intellectual impairment; mental health; physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15623,""
"Seafarers' mental health in the COVID-19 era: lost at sea?","Seafarers are exposed to several physical and psychosocial stressors. Recent studies highlighted specific disorders as fatigue, boredom and diseases as depression. Seafarers are also commonly exposed to post-traumatic stress disorder (piracy, accidents, threats). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impacts seafarers with an estimated 400,000 of whom are stranded on vessels around the world, with extended time on board, repatriation's difficulties and the financial concerns of the unexpectedly unemployed.

"Problematic Internet Use Was Associated With Psychological Problems Among University Students During COVID-19 Outbreak in China","<b>Background:</b> As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic progressed globally, school closures and home quarantine may cause an increase in problematic Internet use among students in universities. Such a traumatic stress event may also contribute to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, and anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms as well as the predictive role of problematic Internet use in the above-mentioned psychological problems in university students. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 8,879 students in China between April 20 and April 26, 2020. The presence of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms and problematic Internet use were evaluated using PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 9-item scale, the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale, and the Young diagnostic questionnaire, respectively. Sociodemographic information and the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward COVID-19 data were also collected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4,834 (54.4%) participants were female, and 7,564 (85.2%) were undergraduate students. A total of 615 students (6.9%) reported PTSD symptoms; 5.2% (465) and 10.1% (896) reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The problematic Internet use was significantly associated with higher risk of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms (odds ratio 2.662 [95% CI, 2.239-3.165], odds ratio 4.582 [95% CI, 3.753-5.611], odds ratio 3.251 [95% CI, 2.814-3.757], respectively; all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Lower attitude and practice scores also contributed to the risk of depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Psychological problems should be paid more attention, and problematic Internet use may be a predictor when screening high-risk students for psychological problems. Our results will aid in timely psychological screening, which is meaningful in the prevention and intervention of psychological problems.","Xie, Zhu, Xue, Zhou, Liu, Wu, Wan, Zhang, Meng, Zhu, Song","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.675380","20210702","anxiety symptom; coronavirus disease 2019; depressive symptom; posttraumatic stress disease symptoms; problematic internet use; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15625,""
"Association of Gender With Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With 2019-nCoV Infection in Wuhan","<b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study was to analyze the association of gender with psychological status and clinical outcomes among patients with 2019-nCoV infection to provide new directions for the prevention and control of the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> One hundred and thirty-eight patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection at Wuhan Union Hospital, between February 8 and March 31, 2020, were included in the study analysis. General information and data on clinical characteristics were collected from patients' medical records. Participants' responses to self-report measures of psychological status were also collected. <b>Results:</b> Anxiety levels, depression levels, and recovery rates were significantly higher among women compared to men. Conversely, chronic disease history and smoking rates, dry cough incidence, C-reactive protein levels, and disease severity were significantly higher among men than women (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Female patients experienced more severe psychological issues, due to higher levels of anxiety and stress, than male patients; indicating that more attention should be paid to the psychological care of female patients. In contrast, the general condition of male patients was more severe, particularly among elderly male patients with a history of chronic disease and smoking, suggesting that, to prevent and control 2019-nCoV infection, male patients should be encouraged to quit smoking as soon as possible to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia.","Han, Peng, Zheng, Deng, Cheng, Peng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.619482","20210702","2019-nCoV; disease outcome; gender; psychological situation; smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15626,""
"Prevalence of Mental Health Complaints Among Performing Arts Students Is Associated With COVID-19 Preventive Measures","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of COVID-19 preventive measures on the mental health of performing arts students. In a prospective cohort study, performing arts students (<i>N</i> = 213) from Codarts Rotterdam, University of the Arts, were invited to monitor their health during one academic year (September 2019-May 2020). Every month, students completed items on mental health complaints, stress, and sleep quality. Chi-square tests and repeated-measures ANOVA with deviation contrasts were performed to investigate whether COVID-19 preventive measures were associated with changes in mental health complaints, stress scores, and sleep quality. During the COVID-19 lockdown, subjective mental health, Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5), and items on loneliness were additionally completed by the respondents. A total of 98 students (46.0%) were included in the analyses. The 3-month prevalence of mental health complaints was significantly higher during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to the two pre-COVID-19 periods (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Mean stress scores were significantly lower for February (35.20) and March (36.41) when compared to the overall mean (40.38). Sleep quality scores (mean) were significantly higher for April (6.90), and May (6.89) when compared to overall mean (6.58). Furthermore, at least 75.5% of the participants dealt with moderate to very severe loneliness in all 3 months during the COVID-19 lockdown. During lockdown, performing arts students perceived less stress and their sleep quality increased. However, the prevalence of mental health complaints increased. Besides, 3 out 4 students dealt with moderate to very severe loneliness.","Stubbe, Tiemens, Keizer-Hulsebosch, Steemers, van Winden, Buiten, Richardson, van Rijn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.676587","20210702","COVID-19; circus; dance; mental problems; musical theatre; performing arts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15627,""
"Emergency Psychiatric Consultations During and After the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy A Multicentre Study","<b>Aims:</b> The aim was to analyse the psychiatric consultations in nine Italian hospital emergency departments, by comparing the lockdown and post-lockdown periods of 2020 with the equivalent periods of 2019. <b>Methods:</b> Characteristics of psychiatric consultations, patients, and drug prescriptions were analyzed. Joinpoint models were used to identify changes in the weekly trend of consultations. <b>Results:</b> A 37.5% decrease in the number of consultations was seen during the lockdown period and 17.9% after the lockdown. The number of individual patients seen decreased by 34.9% during the lockdown and 11.2% after the lockdown. A significant change in the number of consultations from week 11 to week 18 occurred, followed by a gradual increase. There was a higher percentage of patients with previous psychiatric hospitalizations during the lockdown period (61.1 vs. 56.3%) and a lower percentage after the lockdown (59.7 vs. 64.7%). During the lockdown there was a large increase in psychiatric consultations for substance use disorders, whereas more consultations for manic episodes occurred after the lockdown. A 3.4% decrease was observed in consultations for suicidal ideation and planning during the lockdown, followed by an upward rebound after the lockdown, along with an increase in consultations for suicide attempts. During lockdown antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescriptions increased by 5.2 and 4.1%, respectively. After the lockdown, the number of compulsory hospitalizations was higher than in 2019. <b>Conclusions:</b> We observed a decrease of psychiatric consultations during and after the lockdown. There was an increase in consultations for manic episodes and suicidality after the lockdown. The focus of psychiatric services must remain high particularly in this latter period.","Balestrieri, Rucci, Amendola, Bonizzoni, Cerveri, Colli, Dragogna, Ducci, Elmo, Ghio, Grasso, Locatelli, Mencacci, Monaco, Nicotra, Piccinini, Pischiutta, Toscano, Vaggi, Villari, Vitalucci, Castelpietra, Bondi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.697058","20210702","COVID-19; emergency department; psychiatric consultations; psychotropic drugs; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15628,""
"Dynamics of Perceived Positive Changes and Indicators of Well-Being Within Different Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, people reported about fears, depressive states, and phases of loneliness. However, there have also been positively experienced changes in terms of awareness of nature, reflection of life, more intensive relationships, meaningful digital media usage to connect with others, and interest in spirituality. We were interested in the dynamics of these indicators directly after the first lockdown, the summer months and during the second wave of the pandemic with its second lockdown, and how they relate to the perceived restrictions, fears, and worries. <b>Method:</b> Survey with standardized questionnaires, i.e., Perceived Changes Questionnaire, WHO-Five Well-being Index, Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale, Awe/Gratitude scale. Participants were categorized as cohort 1 (June 2020; <i>n</i> = 1,333), cohort 2 (July to September 2020, <i>n</i> = 823), and cohort three (October 2020 to January 2021, <i>n</i> = 625). <b>Results:</b> Participants perceived changes in specific attitudes and behaviors, which have impacted their well-being and life satisfaction. Compared to their experiences directly after the first wave of the pandemic (cohort 1), well-being (Hedge's g = 0.83) and life satisfaction (g = 0.63) decreased during the second wave (cohort 3) and participants' stressors increased (g = -0.94). At the same time, positive perceptions such as Nature/Silence/Contemplation (g = 0.67), Spirituality (g = 0.62), Relationships (g = 0.55), and Digital media usage declined (g = 0.31), but not Reflections on life (g = -0.03). In cohort 3, the proportion of persons relying on their faith as a strong hold was declining also in nominally religious persons. Awe/Gratitude was among the best predictors of perceived positive changes, indicating a resource which is nevertheless declining during the second wave of the pandemic (g = 0.60). <b>Conclusions:</b> Several perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors have changed, particularly during the second wave of the pandemic, which had a strong influence on psychological health. Although Awe/Gratitude was confirmed as the best predictor of perceived positive changes, this resource may not buffer against the negative outcomes of the pandemic but helps to recognize the still positive aspects in life. There is a need for new and not yet defined public health communities that could focus on persons which are affected in their physical, mental, social, and spiritual health and well-being due to the pandemic.","BÃƒÂ¼ssing, Rodrigues Recchia, Dienberg, Surzykiewicz, Baumann","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.685975","20210702","COVID-19 pandemic; coping with pandemic stress; perceived changes; spirituality; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15629,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize the prevalence and risk factors of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> We applied an optimized search strategy across the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and four Chinese databases, with hand searching supplemented to identify relevant surveys. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in peer-reviewed literature and used a validated method to assess the prevalence and risk factors of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity was quantified using <i>Q</i> statistics and the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistics. The potential causes of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness of the results. <b>Results:</b> We pooled and analyzed data from 20 studies comprising 10,886 healthcare workers. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms was 24.1, 28.6, 44.1, 25.6, 35.0, 16.2, and 10.7%, respectively. Female and nurses had a high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Frontline healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of anxiety and a lower prevalence of depression than the those in the second-line. Furthermore, the proportion of moderate-severe depression and anxiety is higher in the frontline. Additionally, four studies reported on risk factors of mental health problems. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this systematic review, healthcare workers have a relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and focus should be on the healthcare workers at high risk of mental problems. Mental health problems in healthcare workers should be taken seriously, and timely screening and appropriate intervention for the high-risk group are highly recommended. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b>https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020179189.","Hao, Wang, Xie, Tang, Dou, Zhu, Wu, Dai, Wu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.567381","20210702","coronavirus disease; healthcare workers; mental health; meta-analysis; prevalence; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15630,""

"Evaluation of Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Health-Care Workers","Little information is available from India about the psychological impact of COVID-19 on helath-care workers. The current study aimed to evaluate the psychological issues among the health-care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey using Survey Monkey<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> platform was carried out to evaluate depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7), and other psychological issues (using a self-designed questionnaire). The study sample comprised 303 participants with a mean age of 41.2 (standard deviation: 11.1) years. A majority of them were male (69%) and married (79.9%). Nearly half (46.2%) of the participants had either anxiety disorder or depression or both and 12.9% of HCW had suicidal behavior. Higher level of anxiety and depression scores were associated with being female, having undergone quarantine, directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, and younger age (&lt;30 years). Higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder was seen in younger (&lt;30 years) age group, being a doctor (compared to paramedics). In addition, higher prevalence of depression was seen in those who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 infection.

"Compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction in pediatric subspecialists during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","The aim of this study was to explore factors contributing to compassion fatigue (CF), burnout (BO), and compassion satisfaction (CS) during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic in pediatric subspecialists. The Compassion Fatigue and Satisfaction Self-Test (CFST) and a questionnaire of personal/professional characteristics were distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists. There were no significant differences in pre- and early-pandemic CF, BO, and CS scores. Nearly 40% of respondents felt their contributions to the pandemic were not valued by their institutions. Higher CF scores were significantly associated with: higher BO score; ""I have put myself at increased risk through my work""; working in one's specialty &gt;50% of time; distress about mental health and/or future uncertainty. Higher BO scores were significantly associated with: higher CF score; ""Self-care is not a priority""; emotional depletion. Higher CS scores were significantly associated with: ""My institution values my contribution to the COVID-19 crisis""; workplace debriefs; pet therapy. The pandemic has only increased the need for physicians to receive social/emotional support from their institution and to feel their workplace contributions are valued. Successful pre-pandemic workplace interventions may not adequately support physicians during the pandemic. Further study is needed to identify supports that best counter the pandemic's unprecedented challenges. The sentiment ""My institution has valued my contribution to the Covid-19 crisis"" was the only significant factor associated with lower BO scores and was also associated with higher CS scores in pediatric subspecialists. This study is the first comparison of pre- and early-pandemic CF, BO, and CS scores in a national cohort of pediatric subspecialists. When considering interventions to promote CS and mitigate CF and BO for pediatric subspecialists during and after the pandemic, institutional leadership must offer wellness programming focused on social/emotional supports and prioritize a culture that explicitly recognizes and values every physician's contributions.","Kase, Gribben, Guttmann, Waldman, Weintraub","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-021-01635-y","20210702","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15634,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and opioid use disorder: Expanding treatment with buprenorphine, and combining safety precautions with telehealth","This study investigated the efficacy and safety of providing medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and individualized telehealth in Kentucky, a state severely impacted simultaneously by the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigation analyzed pre- and post-COVID-19 characteristics in 191 opioid use disorder (OUD) buprenorphine outpatients who completed an 18-question survey in late 2020 related to COVID testing, OUD relapses, obstacles to maintaining abstinence, and treatment resources. The study revealed no statistically significant changes in drug use before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic despite monthly volume increases. Results further demonstrated statistically significant barriers to treatment, including loss of housing and transportation, food insecurity, and onset of depression. No patients required hospitalization or succumbed to OUD or COVID-19. Potentially effective resource utilization findings included clinic transportation and 24/7 crisis intervention. Respondents rated telehealth as helpful when used in an individualized hybrid model matching patient's need to available resources based on COVID-19 safety guidelines. This report yields key clinical insights into providing outpatient MOUD care during the COVID-19 pandemic, validating in-person care as both safe and effective. Patients' experiences proved helpful in identifying and quantifying obstacles to abstinence in conjunction with facilitating continued patient access to essential clinical resources. Notably, telehealth can supplement rather than replace in-person treatment.","Cales, Cales, Shreffler, Huecker","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108543","20210702","Addiction; Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD); Opioid use disorder (OUD); Telehealth; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15635,""
"Primary care teams' experiences of delivering mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","Integrated primary care teams are ideally positioned to support the mental health care needs arising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how COVID-19 has affected mental health care delivery within primary care settings will be critical to inform future policy and practice decisions during the later phases of the pandemic and beyond. The objective of our study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care teams' delivery of mental health care. A qualitative study using focus groups conducted with primary care teams in Ontario, Canada. Focus group data was analysed using thematic analysis. We conducted 11 focus groups with 10 primary care teams and a total of 48 participants. With respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care in primary care teams, we identified three key themes: i) the high demand for mental health care, ii) the rapid transformation to virtual care, and iii) the impact on providers. From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care quickly responded to the rising mental health care demands of their patients. Despite the numerous challenges they faced with the rapid transition to virtual care, primary care teams have persevered. It is essential that policy and decision-makers take note of the toll that these demands have placed on providers. There is an immediate need to enhance primary care's capacity for mental health care for the duration of the pandemic and beyond.","Ashcroft, Donnelly, Dancey, Gill, Lam, Kourgiantakis, Adamson, Verrilli, Dolovich, Kirvan, Mehta, Sur, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01496-8","20210702","COVID-19; Mental health care; Pandemic; Primary care; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15636,""
"The perception of Italian pregnant women and new mothers about their psychological wellbeing, lifestyle, delivery, and neonatal management experience during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: a web-based survey","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, drastic measures for social distancing have been introduced also in Italy, likely with a substantial impact in delicate conditions like pregnancy and puerperium. The study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle, access to health services, and mental wellbeing during the first Italian lockdown in a sample of Italian pregnant women and new mothers. We carried out a web-based survey to evaluate how pregnant women and new mothers were coping with the lockdown. We collected data about healthy habits (physical exercise and dietary habits), access to health services (care access, delivery and obstetric care, neonatal care, and breastfeeding), and mental wellbeing (psychological well-being and emotive support). Descriptive analysis was performed for both groups of participants, whereas a Poisson analysis was used to measure the association between some structural variables (age, education, socio-economic data, partner support, contact, free time, previous children, and pregnancy trimester) and anxiety or depression, difficulties in healthy eating and reduction in physical activity after lockdown started. Chi2 and Adjusted Prevalence Ratios were estimated only for pregnant women. We included 739 respondents (response rate 85.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°%), 600 were pregnant (81.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°%), and 139 (18.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°%) had delivered during lockdown (new mothers). We found a high score for anxiety and depression in 62.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of pregnant women and 61.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of new mothers. During the lockdown, 61.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of pregnant women reduced their physical exercise, and 44.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°% reported eating in a healthier way. 94.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of new mothers reported to have breastfed their babies during the hospital stay. Regarding the perceived impact of restrictive measures on breastfeeding, no impact was reported by 56.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°% of new mothers, whereas a negative one by 36.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°%. The high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women and new mothers should be a public health issue. Clinicians might also recommend and encourage ""home"" physical exercise. On the other hand, about half of the sample improved their approach towards healthy eating and a very high breastfeeding rate was reported soon after birth: these data are an interesting starting point to develop new strategies for public health.","Stampini, Monzani, Caristia, Ferrante, Gerbino, De Pedrini, Amadori, Rabbone, Surico","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03904-4","20210702","Breastfeeding; COVID-19; Healthy eating; Lockdown; New mothers; Physical exercise.; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15637,""
"Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C-OVID-19: adaptations for fly-in and fly-out mental health providers during COVID-19","Mental health providers have rapidly pivoted their in-person practices to teletherapy and telehealth interventions to address the increased demand for mental health services during the COVID-19 crisis. The change to service delivery has emphasised challenges for mental health service providers, particularly in regions that rely on fly-in and fly-out (FIFO) mental health service providers who are no longer able to travel to their places of work. In this qualitative study, we examined the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of mental health services in Inuit Nunangat. Using a participatory action research methodology, we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight FIFO mental health service providers to understand their experiences and implement strategies to effectively deliver mental health services in a pandemic. We identified three themes through thematic analysis: 1) Service providers identify the challenges in adapting their practices to meet individual and community needs; 2) Service providers recognise the opportunities for enhancements to service delivery; 3) Service providers identify telemental health services as a potentially effective adjunct to in-person sessions. The findings support reconceptualising post-pandemic mental health service delivery to include both face-to-face and telemental health services.","Roberts, Darroch, Giles, van Bruggen","https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2021.1935133","20210702","COVID-19; fly-in/fly-out; mental health; mental health service provider; telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15638,""
"Impact of an artist-in-residence program in a complex continuing care hospital: a quality improvement investigation","<b>Background:</b> The objective was to assess the impact of an Artist-in-Residence (AiR) program on the quality of life of patients living at a complex continuing care hospital.<b>Methods:</b> In the AiR program, a professional Artist facilitated the creation of community art projects by patients in groups (before COVID-19) and individually (during COVID-19). Four patients, four staff and one family member involved with the program were interviewed to assess their experiences.<b>Results:</b> Themes identified included improvements in spiritual, mental and community health, creation of a sense of community, learning skills and knowledge surrounding art and culture, and the importance of the Artist's personal characteristics/personality. It was recommended to continue and expand the program.<b>Conclusions:</b> The patients deeply enjoyed the AiR program and working with the Artist.

"Can Positive Mindsets Be Protective Against Stress and Isolation Experienced during the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding Emotional Health and Wellbeing Needs of Perinatal Women","The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between emotional health and wellbeing and support needs of perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to understand their experiences and need for support. This is a potentially vulnerable group and a critical developmental phase for women and infants. A mixed methods design was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data that provided a robust insight into their unique needs. A total of 174 women who were either pregnant or post-birth participated. The main findings demonstrated that women in this cohort experienced varying levels of stress and isolation but also positive experiences. Exploring the relationship between mental health (perceived stress and wellbeing) and resilience (mindfulness and self-compassion) revealed an association between positive mental health and higher levels of mindfulness and self-compassion. Positive mindsets may be protective against psychological distress for the mother and her child, suggesting that meditation-based or similar training might help support expectant and post-birth mothers during times of crisis, such as a pandemic. This information could be used to make recommendations for future planning for practitioners and policymakers in preparing for prospective infection waves, pandemics, or natural disasters, and could be used to develop targeted tools, support, and care.","Davis, Gibson, Bear, Finlay-Jones, Ohan, Silva, Prescott","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136958","20210702","COVID-19; experiences and perceptions; human isolation; loneliness; mental health; mindfulness; mixed methods; perinatal; pregnancy; self-compassion; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15640,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Causing Depression in Different Sociodemographic Groups in Saudi Arabia","COVID-19 disease was announced as a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World health organization (WHO). Saudi Arabia was among the first countries to enforce restriction measures such as closing schools, remote working, and a travel ban. We aim to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's depression in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey of 1109 participants was conducted during the curfew between 18th of May and 11th of June 2020. An online questionnaire included questions about the commitment to follow the precautionary measures, knowledge on COVID-19, and depression. Depression was assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised method. Females, unmarried individuals, elderly persons, parents of young children, unemployed, and small families were more likely to be depressed. Education level did not explain the differences in depression. However, the more knowledge the participants had about COVID-19 the better they followed the restrictions. A regression analysis revealed that the commitment of a person to follow the restrictions increased his/her depression symptoms. Attention should be paid to different groups of people in future psychiatric planning.","Sonbol, Alahdal, Alanazi, Alsamhary, Ameen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136955","20210702","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; depression; mental health; pandemic; precaution measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15641,""
"A Comparison of Depression and Anxiety among University Students in Nine Countries during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The mental health of young adults, particularly students, is at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in mental health between university students in nine countries during the pandemic. The study encompassed 2349 university students (69% female) from Colombia, the Czech Republic (Czechia), Germany, Israel, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Participants underwent the following tests: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Exposure to COVID-19 (EC-19), Perceived Impact of Coronavirus (PIC) on students' well-being, Physical Activity (PA), and General Self-Reported Health (GSRH). The one-way ANOVA showed significant differences between countries. The highest depression and anxiety risk occurred in Turkey, the lowest depression in the Czech Republic and the lowest anxiety in Germany. The Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> independence test showed that EC-19, PIC, and GSRH were associated with anxiety and depression in most of the countries, whereas PA was associated in less than half of the countries. Logistic regression showed distinct risk factors for each country. Gender and EC-19 were the most frequent predictors of depression and anxiety across the countries. The role of gender and PA for depression and anxiety is not universal and depends on cross-cultural differences. Students' mental health should be addressed from a cross-cultural perspective.","Ochnik, Rogowska, KuÃ…â€ºnierz, Jakubiak, SchÃƒÂ¼tz, Held, ArzenÃ…Â¡ek, Benatov, Berger, Korchagina, Pavlova, BlaÃ…Â¾kovÃƒÂ¡, KoneÃ„ÂnÃƒÂ¡, Aslan, Ãƒâ€¡Ã„Â±nar, Cuero-Acosta, Wierzbik-StroÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10132882","20210702","COVID-19; anxiety; cross-national study; depression; gender; general self-reported health; mental health; physical activity; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15642,""

"Predictors of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms in Brazil during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil is extremely severe, and Brazil has the third-highest number of cases in the world. The goal of the study is to identify the prevalence rates and several predictors of depression and anxiety in Brazil during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. We surveyed 482 adults in 23 Brazilian states online on 9-22 May 2020, and found that 70.3% of the adults (<i>n</i> = 339) had depressive symptoms and 67.2% (<i>n</i> = 320) had anxiety symptoms. The results of multi-class logistic regression models revealed that females, younger adults, and those with fewer children had a higher likelihood of depression and anxiety symptoms; adults who worked as employees were more likely to have anxiety symptoms than those who were self-employed or unemployed; adults who spent more time browsing COVID-19 information online were more likely to have depression and anxiety symptoms.

"How Do Failed Entrepreneurs Cope with Their Prior Failure When They Seek Subsequent Re-Entry into Serial Entrepreneurship? Failed Entrepreneurs' Optimism and Defensive Pessimism and Coping Humor as a Moderator","Entrepreneurial failure is prevalent, and particularly when the COVID-19 crisis exacerbates the economic recession, it becomes even more prevalent. Entrepreneurs experience an intensive emotional crisis when their ventures fail, and this deleterious impact, including stress and emotional pain, may prevent failed entrepreneurs (FEs) from restarting; hence, how they cope with failure has received increased attention in recent years. However, most of the extant literature focuses on success rather than failure, and there is very limited literature on how FEs cope with the psychological and emotional crisis caused by failure. This study focuses on FEs' use of optimism and defensive pessimism as coping strategies within the mental simulation theory with respect to their re-entry intentions. It examines the impact of career ambition and public self-awareness on optimism, of the fear of failure (FoF) and self-doubt, on defensive pessimism, and of coping humor as a moderator. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the data of 277 Korean FEs who have actual entrepreneurial failure experiences and actively prepared for their re-entry. The results show that career ambitions and public self-awareness have an impact on optimism, and FoF and self-doubt lead to defensive pessimism. Coping humor also has a moderating effect on the path from defensive pessimism to the intention to re-enter. This study advances the literature on coping mechanisms that FEs employ to manage the negative impact of failure and prepare for their subsequent re-entry. Its theoretical model, based on the mental simulation theory combined with social comparison theory, provides a possible integrative framework that includes both the pervasively held view of entrepreneurs' optimism related to overconfidence and their defensive pessimism related to their vulnerability due to their ventures' failure. Thus, this study makes theoretical contributions to the literature of entrepreneurial failure, as well as practical implications for policymakers and educators who assist FEs in successfully coping with entrepreneurial failure and re-entry.","Hwang, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137021","20210702","career ambition; coping humor; defensive pessimism and optimism; fear of failure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15645,""
"The Role of a Mentorship Program on the Relationship between Neglect and Depression among Adolescents in Low-Income Families","This study examines the moderating effect of a mentorship program on the relationship between parental neglect and depression among adolescents from low-income households since COVID-19. A total of 264 participants from all provinces in South Korea were registered for a mentorship program provided by the Korea Development Bank [KDB] Foundation, which is a charitable and non-profit organization. Two-hundred fifty-five middle and high school students from low-income families were included in the final sample. The mentorship program was provided to students based on mentors' advice and feedback. A bootstrap method using the PROCESS macro 3.4 for SPSS was utilized to examine the moderating effect of satisfaction with the mentorship program. Neglect was positively related to depression among low-income students. Satisfaction with the mentorship program moderated the relationship between low-income students' neglect and depression. Visits from social workers or other advocates or volunteers to low-income families with children may be helpful to address depression among low-income students. High quality mentorship programs should be provided to more low-income students for their mental health, funded particularly in the context of corporate social responsibility. Particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, financial contributions by corporations would be valuable to reconstruct the damage to quality of life and psychological well-being among low-income adolescents.","Lee, Allen, Lim, Choi, Jung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137010","20210702","depression; low-income students; mentorship program; neglect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15646,""
"Learning from and Leveraging Multi-Level Changes in Responses to the COVID 19 Pandemic to Facilitate Breast Cancer Prevention Efforts","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had multilevel effects on non-COVID-19 health and health care, including deferral of routine cancer prevention and screening and delays in surgical and other procedures. Health and health care use has also been affected by pandemic-related loss of employer-based health insurance, food and housing disruptions, and heightened stress, sleep disruptions and social isolation. These disruptions are projected to contribute to excess non-COVID-19 deaths over the coming decades. At the same time municipalities, health systems and individuals are making changes in response to the pandemic, including modifications in the environmental to promote health, implementation of telehealth platforms, and shifts towards greater self-care and using remote platforms to maintain social connections. We used a multi-level biopsychosocial model to examine the available literature on the relationship between COVID-19-related changes and breast cancer prevention to identify current gaps in knowledge and identify potential opportunities for future research. We found that COVID-19 has impacted several aspects of social and economic life, through a variety of mechanisms, including unemployment, changes in health care delivery, changes in eating and activity, and changes in mental health. Some of these changes should be reduced, while others should be explored and enhanced.","Bowen, Rentscher, Wu, Darien, Haile, Mandelblatt, Kavanaugh-Lynch","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136999","20210702","COVID-19; breast cancer; cancer prevention; review paper","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15647,""
"Sedentary Behavior among 6-14-Year-Old Children during the COVID-19 Lockdown and Its Relation to Physical and Mental Health","As a result of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and consequent restrictions in spring 2020, children in many countries might be engaged in more sedentary behavior and have limited possibilities to access the necessary level of physical activity to maintain their physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between child sedentary behavior, physical activity, mental and physical health, and parental distress in a sample of Lithuanian children aged 6-14 years during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in March-June 2020. Parents of 306 children (52.9% female) completed an online survey in May-June 2020 and reported on their children's screen time for educational and recreational (leisure) purposes, the level of physical activity and time outdoors, somatic symptoms, and emotional well-being and behavior. Parents also reported on stressful life events in the family and personal distress. The results revealed that 57.5% of children exceeded the recommended maximum of 2 h of recreational screen time per day, and 33.6% of the children did not meet the recommended guidelines of 60 min of physical activity per day. Longer screen time for educational purposes and parental distress significantly predicted a higher prevalence of somatic symptoms in children and parental distress also served as a significant predictor of children's decreased emotional well-being and behavior. These results highlight the importance of psychosocial support interventions for parents who experience distress when raising children at a stressful time, such as during a pandemic.","BreidokienÃ„â€”, JusienÃ„â€”, Urbonas, PraninskienÃ„â€”, GirdzijauskienÃ„â€”","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060756","20210702","COVID-19; physical activity; screen time; sedentary behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15648,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Families of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Typically Developing Peers: An Online Survey","When COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic, many countries imposed severe lockdowns that changed families' routines and negatively impacted on parents' and children's mental health. Several studies on families with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) revealed that lockdown increased the difficulties faced by individuals with ASD, as well as parental distress. No studies have analyzed the interplay between parental distress, children's emotional responses, and adaptive behaviors in children with ASD considering the period of the mandatory lockdown. Furthermore, we compared families with children on the spectrum and families with typically developing (TD) children in terms of their distress, children's emotional responses, and behavioral adaptation. In this study, 120 parents of children aged 5-10 years (53 with ASD) participated. In the four tested models, children's positive and negative emotional responses mediated the impact of parental distress on children's playing activities. In the ASD group, parents reported that their children expressed more positive emotions, but fewer playing activities, than TD children. Families with children on the spectrum reported greater behavioral problems during the lockdown and more parental distress. Our findings inform the interventions designed for parents to reduce distress and to develop coping strategies to better manage the caregiver-child relationship.","Levante, Petrocchi, Bianco, Castelli, Colombi, Keller, Narzisi, Masi, Lecciso","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11060808","20210702","COVID-19; adaptive behavior; autism spectrum disorder; children; emotion responses; lockdown; mediation; parental distress; survey; typically developing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15649,""

"Fear and Coping in Students during the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Combined Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Study","The overwhelming impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been experienced by individuals across the world. Additional circumstances unique to students affected their studies during the early stages of the pandemic, with changes in living and studying mid-semester. The current study aimed to investigate predictors of fear of COVID-19 in college students during this acute phase using cross-sectional and longitudinal samples. In total, 175 undergraduate students completed an online questionnaire in the spring 2020 semester following lockdown. A subset of 58 students completed a separate survey in fall 2019, which served as a baseline. For the cross-sectional sample, pre-COVID-19 and current living situations did not predict COVID-19 fears. However, a propensity to experience panic was significantly associated with greater COVID-19 fears. How students coped with the pandemic was not associated with COVID-19 fears, although a greater propensity to use denial as a coping style tended to be related to greater COVID-19 fears. In the longitudinal subsample, students showed decreased positive mood and social stress load while depressive mood increased after lockdown. Their preferred coping styles changed, utilizing more self-distraction and acceptance, and less self-blame and substance use. Findings reflect both positive and negative consequences of the pandemic. The unique changes in students' lifestyles will need to be met by tailored interventions.","Hasratian, Nordberg, Meuret, Ritz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126551","20210702","COVID-19 fears; RDoC Negative Valence Systems; coping; depression; medical fears","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15651,""
"Assessment of Postpartum Depression in Adolescents Who Delivered during COVID-19 Social Restrictions: The Experience of a Tertiary Hospital from Bucharest, Romania","In the context of the viral spread of COVID-19 in 2020, Romanian authorities declared national confinement for two months. Our country faces a public health issue regarding adolescent pregnancy. This study assessed the predisposition of teenage mothers to postpartum depression and the influence of the viral pandemic on their emotional status. This study enrolled patients 10 to 19 years old who delivered in our department between March-December 2020. Teenagers were attributed to the ""lockdown group"" (<i>n</i> = 30) and the ""open group"" (<i>n</i> = 171). All study participants agreed to take an interview based on a three-part questionnaire, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In the ""lockdown group"", 16.67% of patients felt stressed over the last year compared to 11.11% of individuals in the ""open group"", but there was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding overall EPDS scores (z value 0.51, Mann-Whitney U test). Predictable variables for postpartum depression were the use of cigarettes (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00-1.16), intended pregnancies (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09-0.68, <i>p</i> = 0.007) and absence of stressors in the last year (OR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02-0.30, <i>p</i> = 0.0002). More adolescents were stressed during confinement compared to those who delivered in the following time period; this aspect did not interfere with depression screening scores.

"Anxiety and Worries among Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multilevel Analysis","<i>Background</i><b>.</b> Several studies have identified pregnant women as a vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. The perinatal period has been identified as a stage of great risk for the mental health of pregnant women, due to a large increase in mental pathologies during this period. In this context, the objective of the present study was to assess the associations between socioeconomic and demographic factors, health concerns and health information management, and anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant Spanish women. <i>Method</i><b>.</b> The sample of this cross-sectional study was comprised of 353 pregnant women, aged 18 or older and residing in Spain. Data collection was carried out from 1 June to 30 September 2020. Participants were recruited from QuirÃƒÂ³nsalud University Hospital of Madrid. Multilevel regression models were built to value the associations between demographic factors, health concerns and health information management, and anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women. <i>Results</i><b>.</b> Reduced working hours and income due to the COVID-19 pandemic were related to increased anxiety levels, as was the level of concern about COVID-19 symptoms, potential complications, contagion and consequences for the baby. Worries caused by restrictive measures adopted against COVID-19 and resulting isolation, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding were also associated with increased anxiety levels. Being a separated or divorced woman and being informed to a greater extent by a midwife were related to lower anxiety levels. An increase in the degree of information obtained about COVID-19 symptoms, complications, contagion and consequences for the baby, restrictive measures and isolation adopted against COVID-19, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding, were also related to decreased anxiety levels. <i>Conclusions</i><b>.</b> The most vulnerable future mothers in terms of anxiety levels are those with reduced working hours and income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those with a higher level of concern and who had access to a lesser degree of information about COVID-19 (symptoms and complications, contagion and consequences on the baby, restrictive measures and isolation, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding), as well as pregnant women who have obtained information about COVID-19 during pregnancy from TV.","Esteban-Gonzalo, Caballero-Galilea, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Pascual, ÃƒÂlvaro-Navidad, Esteban-Gonzalo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136875","20210702","COVID-19; Spain; anxiety; pregnancy; worries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15653,""
"Identifying Predictors of University Students' Wellbeing during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Data-Driven Approach","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed risks to public mental health worldwide. University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the current study aimed to uncover predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. Six negative predictors of university students' psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students' psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students' psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students. Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students' psychological wellbeing.","Liu, McCabe, Dawson, Cyrzon, Shankar, Gerges, Kellett-Renzella, Chye, Cornish","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136730","20210702","COVID-19; intervention; machine learning; psychological wellbeing; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15654,""
"Convalescent Plasma for Pregnant Women with COVID-19: A Systematic Literature Review","The treatment of COVID-19 is particularly critical in pregnant women, considering the potential teratogenic effects of antiviral agents and the immune-depression related with pregnancy. The aim of this review is to systematically examine the current evidence on the clinical use of convalescent plasma during pregnancy. The electronic databases Medline PubMed Advanced Search Builder, Scopus, Web Of Science and Google Scholar were searched (until 1 January 2021). Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection), in whom convalescent plasma (or hyperimmune plasma) was used as treatment. We searched clinical trial registries (censored 5 January 2021) for eligible studies under way. After elimination of duplications, the initial search yielded 79 potentially relevant records, of which 67 were subsequently excluded. The 12 remaining records were case reports involving 12 pregnancies. Six of the mothers were reported to be well, two were reported to have preeclampsia, and in one case each the maternal outcome was described as survival, clinical improvement, discharged with oxygen and rehabilitation. With regard to the neonates, two were declared to be well, four had transient morbidity, two were critically ill and one died; normal ongoing pregnancies, but no post-delivery information, were reported for the remaining three cases. Clinical trials under way or planned to investigate the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 during pregnancy are lacking. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnancy. The published literature data seem to indicate that convalescent plasma administered to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 provides benefits for both the mother and the fetus. The quality of the available studies is, however, very limited since they are all case reports and thus suffer from relevant reporting bias.","Franchini, Prefumo, Grisolia, Bergamini, Glingani, Pisello, Presti, Zaffanello","https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071194","20210702","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; convalescent plasma; fetus; hyperimmune plasma; newborn; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15655,""
"Dog Walking and the Social Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Loneliness in Older Adults","Pet ownership can provide important companionship and facilitate social connections, which may be particularly important to socially isolated older adults. Given the significant deleterious impact of loneliness on health and wellbeing in later life, many predicted that public safety measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic would greatly increase loneliness, particularly among vulnerable populations like older adults. We investigated whether dog walking buffers loneliness in the context of stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal survey data were obtained from a Florida community-based sample of adults (<i>n</i> = 466) aged 60+ years old in September 2018 and October 2020. Using OLS regression models, we tested: a) the association between the social consequences of COVID-19 and changes in loneliness, and b) the buffering effect of dog walking on this relationship. The high social consequences of COVID-19 were related to increases in loneliness. Walking a dog daily buffered the relationship. These results suggest potential therapeutic effects of dog walking for the promotion of mental health in older adults, particularly in the context of stressful situations that accentuate risks for loneliness.","Carr, Friedmann, Gee, Gilchrist, Sachs-Ericsson, Koodaly","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11071852","20210702","aging; exercise; humanÃ¢â‚¬â€œanimal interaction; pet ownership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15656,""
"Perception of Threat and Psychological Impact of COVID-19 among Expatriates in Makkah Region, Saudi Arabia","In the first few months of the pandemic, Makkah region reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases among all regions in Saudi Arabia. More than 80% of these reported cases were non-Saudi residents. In this study, we evaluated the perceived threat from and psychological impact of COVID-19 among non-Saudi residents of Makkah region. This was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected using a standardized self-report questionnaire. A total of 292 expatriates were included in the study, the majority of whom were non-Arabic speakers. The prevalence of self-reported depression was nearly 40%, anxiety was 32%, and stress was 43%. The findings indicated variability in the prevalence of psychological symptoms among expatriates from different ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, work environment and perceived threat were strong predictors of psychological disorders. This suggested that the perceived threat from and psychological burden of COVID-19 among non-Saudis in Makkah region is substantial. Future research should investigate the reasons behind these variations in the psychological impact of the pandemic among different ethnic groups.","Algarni, Alzahrani, Alatawi, Alasmari, Alsaab, Almalki, Alhifany, Althobaiti","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126650","20210702","BIP-Q5; COVID-19; DASS-21; Saudi Arabia; expatriates; psychological disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15657,""
"Psychological Stress among Students in Health-Related Fields during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Cross-Sectional Study at Selected Munich Universities","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging period of upheaval for higher education students. This study aims to assess the factors associated with psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of students in health-related fields at Munich universities in Germany. Students (<i>n</i> = 623) from KSH Munich and LMU Munich completed an online cross-sectional survey. Information on demographics and academic and everyday difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as data on physical and mental health were collected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the outcome. The prevalence for higher psychological stress was 44% among the study population. Factors associated with higher psychological stress were: lower overall life satisfaction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), worsened health situation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), lack of social support (<i>p</i> = 0.0301) and social interaction (<i>p</i> = 0.0115), worries about financial difficulties due to loss of income (<i>p</i> = 0.0134), stressful thoughts about a second wave (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), feeling unable to positively influence the situation (<i>p</i> = 0.0262) and study-related effects, such as perceived study burden (<i>p</i> = 0.0003) and likely delay in studies (<i>p</i> = 0.0178)).

"The Relationship between Psychological Distress during the Second Wave Lockdown of COVID-19 and Emotional Eating in Italian Young Adults: The Mediating Role of Emotional Dysregulation","This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the impact of psychological distress experienced during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional eating and to assess the mediating role of emotional dysregulation in a sample of Italian young adults (20-35). A total of 437 participants provided demographical data and were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Emotional Eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Correlational analyses were performed to assess the relationship between continuous variables, while ANOVA was conducted to detect differences between males and females for emotional eating. To assess whether demographic and clinical data predicted emotional eating, hierarchical linear regression was performed. Then, a mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether emotional dysregulation was a mediator between psychological distress and emotional eating. Emotional eating was associated with psychological distress and emotional dysregulation. Moreover, higher levels of emotional eating were found in females than in males. Predictors of emotional eating were sex, psychological distress, and emotional dysregulation. Mediation analyses showed that the indirect effect of psychological distress on emotional eating through emotional dysregulation was significant (b = 0.0069; SE = 0.0024; CI = 0.0024-0.0118), confirming that the relationship between psychological distress and emotional eating was mediated by emotional dysregulation, controlling for sex. The model explained 26.8% (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.2680) of the variance. These findings may help to plan and develop psychological interventions aimed at addressing emotional eating in young adults by targeting emotional dysregulation.","Guerrini Usubini, Cattivelli, Varallo, Castelnuovo, Molinari, Giusti, Pietrabissa, Manari, Filosa, Franceschini, Musetti","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11060569","20210702","COVID-19; emotional dysregulation; emotional eating; psychological distress; social isolation; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15659,""
"Psychological Effects of Home Confinement and Social Distancing Derived from COVID-19 in the General Population-A Systematic Review","(1) Background: Home confinement and social distancing are two of the main public health measures to curb the spread of SARS-Cov-2, which can have harmful consequences on people's mental health. This systematic review aims to identify the best available scientific evidence on the impact that home confinement and social distancing, derived from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, have had on the mental health of the general population in terms of depression, stress and anxiety. (2) Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect between 2 January 2021 and 7 January 2021, in accordance with the recommendations of the PRISMA Declaration. The selection of studies and the evaluation of their methodological quality were performed in pairs, independently and blindly, based on predetermined eligibility criteria. (3) Results: The 26 investigations reviewed were developed in different regions and countries. Factors that are associated with poor mental health were female gender, young ages, having no income and suffering from a previous psychiatric illness. Inadequate management of the pandemic by authorities and a lack or excess of information also contributed to worse mental health.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers in Brazil between August and November 2020: A Cross-Sectional Survey","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCW) have been subjected to greater workloads. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian HCW. Data were collected between 11 August and 1 November 2020. Of the 295 respondents, 95 (32.2%) were medical doctors, 82 (27.8%) administrative staff, 53 (18.0%) nurses, 27 (9.2%) laboratory staff, and 38 (12.9%) were other staff. COVID-19-related restructuring at the health facilities was reported by 207 (70.2%) respondents, and 69 (23.4%) had their tasks changed. Preventive measures were well respected when seeing suspected patients. Overall, 167 (56.6%) HCW screened positive for anxiety and 137 (46.4%) for depression; 109 (36.9%) screened positive for both conditions. Of the 217 (73.6%) HCW who had been tested for COVID-19, at least one positive result was reported in 49 (22.6%). Following a positive COVID-19 test, 45/49 (91.8%) stopped working and stayed home. In conclusion, we found a high incidence of COVID-19 infection among Brazilian HCW with high rates of anxiety and depression despite a good self-reported adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. As such, our study highlights the urgent need for interventions to mitigate the psychosocial risks HCW in Brazil encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Faria de Moura Villela, Rodrigues da Cunha, Nelson Siewe Fodjo, Obimpeh, Colebunders, Van Hees","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126511","20210702","Brazil; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health care workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15661,""
"Psychological Support Interventions for Healthcare Providers and Informal Caregivers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review of the Literature","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers and informal caregivers were at an increased risk of adverse mental health effects. This systematic review provides a summary of the available evidence on the content and efficacy of the psychological support interventions in increasing mental health among healthcare providers and informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, and Scopus databases were systematically searched for relevant articles, and the methodological quality of selected articles was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. A search of electronic databases identified five reports based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All psychological support interventions for caregivers were delivered digitally. Despite the large heterogeneity of the selected studies, the findings support the efficacy of mental health interventions in reducing distress and burnout, while promoting self-efficacy and well-being in both healthcare providers and informal caregivers. Since mental health problems are expected to increase during, and as a result of, the COVID-19 pandemic, and digital tools might offer a range of mental health treatments to meet the unique and immediate needs of people, further research is needed to test the cost-effectiveness of digital psychological interventions.","Bertuzzi, Semonella, Bruno, Manna, Edbrook-Childs, Giusti, Castelnuovo, Pietrabissa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136939","20210702","COVID-19; clinical psychology; digital psychological intervention; healthcare providers; informal caregiver; psychological support intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15662,""
"Maternal Work-Life Balance and Children's Social Adjustment: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress and Parenting Practices","The participation of women with young children in the Japanese labor force has increased dramatically in recent years, bringing growing potential for conflict between work and family roles amid inadequate social systems, such as childcare support. Thus, work-life balance (WLB) of mothers may influence their children's mental health and lifestyle. This study aims to clarify the relationship between parents' WLB and children's mental health, as well as the underlying factors of parental stress and nurturing attitude. The study is based on a questionnaire survey administered in 2019 to fifth-grade elementary school students and their caregivers in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The regression results indicated that the higher the work-family negative spillover, the higher the child's externalizing and internalizing problems, and the higher the positive spillover, the lower the problems and the higher the prosocial behaviors. Path analysis indicates that maternal WLB is negatively and positively related to children's behavior through maternal stress and parenting practices. The study suggests that maternal WLB is related to children's emotional and behavioral problems. WLB may impact children's emotional and behavioral problems through parents' mental health and involvement with their children, particularly because of work arrangements changing with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hosokawa, Katsura","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136924","20210702","childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social adjustment behavior; mothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ parenting practices; mothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceived stress; mothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ workÃ¢â‚¬â€œlife balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15663,""
"Residents' Physical Activities in Home Isolation and Its Relationship with Health Values and Well-Being: A Cross-Sectional Survey during the COVID-19 Social Quarantine","The objective of the present study was to examine the associations between residents' physical activity, health values, and well-being during isolation. On the basis of the physical activity rating scale, health values scale, subjective well-being scale, and the satisfaction with life scale, we collected 505 valid questionnaires online from 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. A series of multiple linear regression models were established to study the relationship between variables, and the bootstrap confidence interval was selected to test the mediating effect. The results showed that during the period of isolation, physical activity directly (b = 0.463, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) or indirectly (b = 0.358, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) had a positive impact on residents' well-being through the mediating effect of health values. There was a positive correlation between physical activity and health values (b = 0.710, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while health values had a direct positive association on well-being (b = 0.504, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, a moderate amount of physical activity was found to be more associated with the well-being of residents during home isolation compared to small and large amounts of physical activity.

The participants followed quarantine rules strictly and noted lifestyle changes, such as increased time spent at home due to social distancing guidelines, a smaller radius of daily activity, and changes in exercise and dietary habits. They also reported increased caution toward other people and objects that other people interacted with due to their fear of COVID-19 infection. They expressed fear about COVID-19 infection and anxiety about COVID-19-related news, and they often felt bored and depressed; however, the participants accepted, endured, and gradually adapted to these lifestyle changes.

"Mental Health and Physical Activity in Health-Related University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to increased negative emotional states among students. Physical activity is known to have positive impacts on mental health and well-being. However, due to the closure of gyms and other recreational facilities as a restrictive measure, students' physical activity levels may decrease. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and physical activity among health-related students during the second partial COVID-19 lockdown. The study included 823 students from the Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health of the University of Osijek in Croatia. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Questionnaire for Physical Activity (GSLTPAQ) questionnaires were used to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms as well as physical activity. Two-thirds (59.2%) of students in health-related fields were insufficiently active, while the prevalence of depression (50.8%), anxiety (50.9%), and stress (49.9%) symptoms were high. Also, female respondents had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress than their male counterparts. Graduate students had higher levels of all three negative emotional states, but only anxiety levels were significant. This study shows that students in health-related fields had reduced physical activity and a high prevalence of negative emotional conditions (depression, anxiety, and stress) during the second partial lockdown. The resulting symptoms were mostly of mild intensity; however, we consider this a significant mental health issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to control and support students' mental health, especially in more affected female individuals, in order to reduce the pandemic's negative impact.","Talapko, PeriÃ„â€¡, VuliÃ„â€¡, Pustijanac, JukiÃ„â€¡, BekiÃ„â€¡, MeÃ…Â¡troviÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â krlec","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070801","20210702","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; physical activity; stress; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15666,""

Only a few reviews examined intervention strategies in the workplace such as physical distancing and quarantine, and none included long-term outcomes of exposure or work during an epidemic/pandemic. Findings suggest a number of critical research and evidence gaps, including the need for reviews on occupational groups potentially exposed to or impacted by the negative work and health effects of COVID-19 in addition to health care workers, the long-term consequences of transitioning to the post-COVID-19 economy on work and health, and research with an equity or social determinants of health lens.","Fan, Senthanar, Macpherson, Sharpe, Peters, Koehoorn, McLeod","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136828","20210702","COVID-19; mental health and well-being; occupational health; pandemic; systematic review; work and health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15667,""
"Redefining the Relationship: Palliative Care in Critical Perinatal and Neonatal Cardiac Patients","Patients with perinatal and neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a unique population with higher morbidity and mortality compared to other neonatal patient groups. Despite an overall improvement in long-term survival, they often require chronic care of complex medical illnesses after hospital discharge, placing a high burden of responsibility on their families. Emerging literature reflects high levels of depression and anxiety which plague parents, starting as early as the time of prenatal diagnosis. In the current era of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the additive nature of significant stressors for both medical providers and families can have catastrophic consequences on communication and coping. Due to the high prognostic uncertainty of CHD, data suggests that early pediatric palliative care (PC) consultation may improve shared decision-making, communication, and coping, while minimizing unnecessary medical interventions. However, barriers to pediatric PC persist largely due to the perception that PC consultation is indicative of ""giving up."" This review serves to highlight the evolving landscape of perinatal and neonatal CHD and the need for earlier and longitudinal integration of pediatric PC in order to provide high-quality, interdisciplinary care to patients and families.","Afonso, Ninemire, Gowda, Jump, Lantin-Hermoso, Johnson, Puri, Hope, Kritz, Achuff, Gurganious, Bhat","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8070548","20210702","congenital heart disease; neonatology; palliative care; perinatology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15668,""
"Promoting the Quality of Life of Elderly during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study explored the technology learning model of the elderly in a senior learning center under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many senior learning centers were closed during the pandemic, and many of them adopted the mode of online education. However, problems such as decreased motivation and a lack of peer interaction still exist. To solve these problems, this study used the easy-to-implement calligraphy AR approach and E-book approach to conduct a quasi-experiment on the elderly of a calligraphy course offered by a senior learning center. The results show a higher learning motivation among the elderly who use calligraphy AR. The learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of the elderly in the E-book learning group were higher than those in the calligraphy AR group. The elderly mentioned that the E-book learning approach is more user-friendly. In general, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the suspension of classes in senior centers, education through the development of technology has stimulated the growth of education in advanced learning centers. Through this kind of scientific and technological learning method, it will bring a whole new experience to the elderly. It can improve the stress relief methods, mental health, and quality of life of the elderly during the COVID-19 emergency shutdown, and provide a novel calligraphy technique learning experience for the elderly. Therefore, we believe that the calligraphy AR learning approach and the calligraphy E-book learning approach are practical and may promote quality of life and mental health of the elderly during the emergency closures due to COVID-19, providing elderly attendees with a novel calligraphy technology learning experience.","Lee, Hsu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136813","20210702","COVID-19; augmented reality; life and health; quality of life; senior learning center","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15669,""

The adverse impacts on Asian women, including those in Hong Kong, are substantial. This cross-sectional online study examined the impacts of COVID-19 on Hong Kong women, including psychological effects, self-belief in coping, and quality of life, and was conducted over 4 weeks from July to August 2020. Females aged over 18, living in Hong Kong, and that could read Chinese, were included. Among 417 participants, 50.8% were aged below 50, 66.7% were married, 57.1% were caregivers, 61.4% had a family income of &lt;USD 2600, and 70.3% attained higher secondary education or above. The results show that 32.2%, 42.4%, and 44.9% of participants had negative emotions of stress, anxiety, and depression. There are significant negative correlations between emotional state and different aspects of quality of life, but positive correlations between general self-efficacy and different aspects of quality of life. COVID-19 induced significant psychological and quality of life impacts on females in Hong Kong. The policymakers, healthcare professionals, and social support organizations should establish appropriate strategies and policies to support women during the COVID-19 pandemic or similar future crises.","Hung, Lam, Chan, Liu, Chow","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136734","20210702","COVID-19 pandemic; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; psychological impacts; quality of life; self-efficacy; stress; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15670,""
"""How Come You Don't Call Me?"" Smartphone Communication App Usage as an Indicator of Loneliness and Social Well-Being across the Adult Lifespan during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Loneliness and lack of social well-being are associated with adverse health outcomes and have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Smartphone communication data have been suggested to help monitor loneliness, but this requires further evidence. We investigated the informative value of smartphone communication app data for predicting subjective loneliness and social well-being in a sample of 364 participants ranging from 18 to 78 years of age (52.2% female; mean age = 42.54, SD = 13.22) derived from the CORONA HEALTH APP study from July to December 2020 in Germany. The participants experienced relatively high levels of loneliness and low social well-being during the time period characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from positive associations with phone call use times, smartphone communication app use was associated with social well-being and loneliness only when considering the age of participants. Younger participants with higher use times tended to report less social well-being and higher loneliness, while the opposite association was found for older adults. Thus, the informative value of smartphone communication use time was rather small and became evident only in consideration of age. The results highlight the need for further investigations and the need to address several limitations in order to draw conclusions at the population level.","Wetzel, Pryss, Baumeister, Edler, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Cohrdes","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126212","20210702","COVID-19; age differences; app; loneliness; mental health monitoring; passive data; public mental health; smartphone communication; social media use; social well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15671,""
"Exploring the Relationships between Resilience and Turnover Intention in Chinese High School Teachers: Considering the Moderating Role of Job Burnout","With the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, online teaching time has been extended continuously. The changes in teaching methods, teaching conditions, and teaching environment have brought great pressure and difficulties in adjustment to teachers, which have led to a series of physical and mental problems such as negativity, lack of confidence, and depression. The long-term accumulation of these problems makes teachers' turnover intention increasingly serious. Based on these premises, this study took 449 high school teachers in China as research objects and investigated the relationship between high school teachers' resilience, job burnout, and turnover intention in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. The resilience of high school teachers had a significant negative predictive effect on job burnout and turnover intention (r = -0.473, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; r = -0.283, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), while job burnout had a significant positive predictive effect on turnover intention (r = 0.485, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). At the same time, job burnout played a moderating role between resilience and turnover intention (ÃŽÂ» = -0.019, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). This study suggests that society, schools, families, and individuals should adopt various strategies to improve teachers' adaptability and relieve teachers' job burnout, so as to solve the practical problem of teachers' high turnover intention and ensure continuous improvement and healthy development of online teaching.","Liu, Chen, Xu, Wen, Fang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126418","20210702","COVID-19; Chinese high school teachers; job burnout; resilience; turnover intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-03","",15672,""
