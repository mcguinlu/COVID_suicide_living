"Mental Disorder Prevalence Among Populations Impacted by Coronavirus Pandemics: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Study of COVID-19, MERS & SARS","Coronavirus pandemics are associated with a number of well-documented threats, stressors and traumas that vary by impacted population and contribute to mental disorders. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b) varied by disorder (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined). From 60 publications (N=66,190 participants), 725 individual estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. Across disorder and population, the median summary point prevalence was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates were generally substantially higher than reported by prior research for unselected samples. Psychiatric morbidity and PTSD were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults. Notably high prevalence was found for (a) psychiatric morbidity, PTSD and depression in infected/recovered adults (25-56%), (b) psychiatric morbidity and PTSD in healthcare providers (21-29%), (c) depression and PTSD in the adults in the community (15-19%), and (d) psychiatric morbidity in quarantined adults (28%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates were higher for studies/estimates: (1) focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19, (2) conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus other locations, obtained (3) via questionnaire versus clinician assessment and (4) with standard versus non-standard scoring, and (5) of moderate or very low versus low quality. The number of mental disorders attributable to COVID-19 will be substantial and magnitudes higher than attributable to MERS and SARS due to the vast scope and ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Matthew Boden; Nicole Cohen; Jessilyn Froelich; Katherine Hoggatt; Hoda Abdel Magid; Swapandeep Mushiana","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248499","20201222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8452,""
"Practice-Level Variation in Telemedicine Use in a Pediatric Primary Care Network During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Analysis and Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Telehealth, the delivery of health care through telecommunication technology, has potential to address multiple health system concerns. Despite this potential, only 15% of pediatric primary care clinicians reported using telemedicine as of 2016, with the majority identifying inadequate payment for these services as the largest barrier to their adoption. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in payment and regulations surrounding telehealth, enabling its integration into primary care pediatrics. OBJECTIVE: Due to limited use of telemedicine in primary care pediatrics prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, much is unknown about the role of telemedicine in pediatric primary care. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between practice-level telemedicine use within a large pediatric primary care network and practice characteristics, telemedicine visit diagnoses, in-person visit volumes, child-level variations in telemedicine use, and clinician attitudes toward telemedicine. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health record data from 45 primary care practices and administered a clinician survey to practice clinicians. Practices were stratified into tertiles based on rates of telemedicine use (low, intermediate, high) per 1000 patients per week during a two-week period (April 19 to May 2, 2020). By practice tertile, we compared (1) practice characteristics, (2) telemedicine visit diagnoses, (3) rates of in-person visits to the office, urgent care, and the emergency department, (4) child-level variation in telemedicine use, and (5) clinician attitudes toward telemedicine across these practices. RESULTS: Across pediatric primary care practices, telemedicine visit rates ranged from 5 to 23 telemedicine visits per 1000 patients per week. Across all tertiles, the most frequent telemedicine visit diagnoses were mental health (28%-36% of visits) and dermatologic (15%-28%). Compared to low telemedicine use practices, high telemedicine use practices had fewer in-person office visits (10 vs 16 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=.005) but more total encounters overall (in-office and telemedicine: 28 vs 22 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=.006). Telemedicine use varied with child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care; however, no significant interactions existed between these characteristics and practice-level telemedicine use. Finally, clinician attitudes regarding the usability and impact of telemedicine did not vary significantly across tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Across a network of pediatric practices, we identified significant practice-level variation in telemedicine use, with increased use associated with more varied telemedicine diagnoses, fewer in-person office visits, and increased overall primary care encounter volume. Thus, in the context of the pandemic, when underutilization of primary care was prevalent, higher practice-level telemedicine use supported pediatric primary care encounter volume closer to usual rates. Child-level telemedicine use differed by child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care, building upon prior concerns about differences in access to telemedicine. However, increased practice-level use of telemedicine services was not associated with reduced or increased differences in use, suggesting that further work is needed to promote equitable access to primary care telemedicine.","Schweiberger, Kelsey; Hoberman, Alejandro; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Schoemer, Pamela; Squire, Joseph; Taormina, Jill; Wolfson, David; Ray, Kristin N","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24345","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24345, 2020 Dec 18.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24345, 2020 Dec 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8453,""

"The burden of loneliness: Implications of the social determinants of health during COVID-19","This study sought to examine if mental health issues, namely depression and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness were experienced differently according to various demographic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., a societal stressor). An online survey, comprising demographic questions and questionnaires on depression, anxiety and loneliness symptoms, was distributed in Canada during the height of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents (N=661) from lower income households experienced greater anxiety, depression and loneliness. Specifically, loneliness was greater in those with an annual income &lt;$50,000/yr versus higher income brackets. Younger females (18-29yr) displayed greater anxiety, depressive symptoms and loneliness than their male counterparts; this difference did not exist among the other age groups (30-64yr, &gt;65yr). Moreover, loneliness scores increased with increasing depression and anxiety symptom severity category. The relationship between loneliness and depression symptoms was moderated by gender, such that females experienced higher depressive symptoms when encountering greater loneliness. These data identify younger females, individuals with lower income, and those living alone as experiencing greater loneliness and mental health challenges during the height of the pandemic in Canada. We highlight the strong relationship between loneliness, depression and anxiety, and emphasize increased vulnerability among certain cohorts.","McQuaid, Cox, Ogunlana, Jaworska","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648","20201221","Anxiety; Depression; Gender; Income; Living arrangements; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8455,""

"Exercise routine change is associated with prenatal depression scores during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women across the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected physical and mental health worldwide. Pregnant women already exhibit an elevated risk for depression compared to the general public, a pattern expected to be exacerbated by the pandemic. Certain lifestyle factors, including moderate exercise, may help support mental health during pregnancy, but it is unclear how the pandemic may impact these associations across different locations. Here, we test whether: (i) reported exercise routine alterations during the pandemic are associated with depression scores; and, (ii) the likelihood of reporting pandemic-related exercise changes varies between women living in metro areas and those in non-metro areas. This cross-sectional study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant women in the United States. Participants were recruited April-June 2020 (n = 1,856). Linear regression analyses assessed whether reported COVID-19-related exercise change was associated with depression score as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey. Logistic regression analyses tested whether a participant's Rural-Urban Continuum Code classification of &quot;metro&quot; was linked with higher odds of reporting exercise changes compared to a &quot;non-metro&quot; classification. Women who reported exercise changes during the pandemic exhibited significantly higher depression scores compared to those reporting no changes. Moreover, individuals living in metro areas of all sizes were significantly more likely to report exercise changes compared to women living in non-metro areas. These results suggest that the ability to maintain an exercise routine during the pandemic may help support maternal mental health. It may therefore be prudent for providers to explicitly ask patients how the pandemic has impacted their exercise routines and consider altered exercise routines a potential risk factor for depression. An effort should also be made to recommend exercises that are tailored to individual space restrictions and physical health.","Gildner, Laugier, Thayer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243188","20201221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8457,""
"Downloading a government-issued COVID-19 contact tracing app may improve psychological distress in the outbreak among employed adults: a prospective study","Downloading of a COVID-19 contact tracing app may be effective in reducing anxiety about COVID-19 and psychological distress of users. This 2.5-month prospective study aimed to investigate the association of downloading of a COVID-19 contact tracing app, the COVID-19 Contact Confirming Application (COCOA), released by the Japanese government with fear and worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress in a sample of employed adults of Japan. A total of 996 full-time employed respondents to an online survey on May 22-26, 2020 (baseline) were invited to participate in a follow-up survey on August 7-12, 2020 (follow-up). High level of worrying about COVID-19 and high psychological distress were defined by scores on a single-item scale and the K6 scale, respectively, both at baseline and follow-up. The app was released between the two surveys on June 17. Participants were asked at follow-up if they downloaded the app. A total of 902 (90.6%) out of 996 baseline participants responded to the follow-up survey. Among them, 184 (20.4%) reported that they downloaded the app. Downloading of the contact tracing app was significantly negatively associated with psychological distress, but not with fear and worry about COVID-19, at follow-up after controlling for baseline variables. The study provided first evidence that a COVID-19 contact tracing app may be beneficial for the mental health of employed adults using a government-issued tracing app under the COVID-19 outbreak.","Kawakami, Sasaki, Kuroda, Tsuno, Imamura","https://doi.org/10.2196/23699","20201221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8458,""
"The mental health status and approaches of accessing antenatal care information among pregnant women during COVID-19 epidemicÃ¯Â¼Å¡a cross-sectional study in China","China is the first country that experienced the large scale of COVID-19 epidemic. The rapid spread of the disease and the enforcement of public health measures could cause distress among vulnerable population such as pregnant women. With limited understanding about the new emerging infectious disease, pregnant women looked-for ways of accessing to the timely and trusted health care information. During the public health emergency, the mental health status as well as how pregnant women reacted to the situation, where and how did they obtain antenatal care information are to be understood. This study aimed to determine mental health status by measuring perceived stress, anxiety and depression, to explore approaches of obtaining antenatal health information and to determine their associations with the mental health status among pregnant women during COVID-19 epidemic in China. We conducted an online survey to assess mental health status, using validated Chinese version of Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), among Chinese pregnant women, and collected information on their approaches of accessing antenatal care information during the COVID-19 epidemic from February 5 to 28, 2020. A total of 1,873 women from 22 provinces/regions of China participated in the survey. The occurrence of experiencing perceived stress, anxiety and depression among pregnant women was 89.1% (95% CI: 87.6%, 90.4%), 18.1% (95% CI: 16.4%, 19.9%) and 45.9% (95% CI: 43.6%, 48.1%), respectively. Hospitals' official accounts in the Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo were the most popular channels for pregnant women to obtain antenatal care information during COVID-19 epidemic. Access to antenatal care information via the hospitals' official social media accounts was found associated with a significantly lower risk of suffering from stress (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30 to 0.72, P=.001), anxiety (aOR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.68, P&lt;.001) and depression (aOR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.91, P=.005). Pregnant women obtained health care information via hospital hotlines or SMS was found only significantly associated with lower risk of anxiety (OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98, P=0.04). During the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese pregnant women experienced high level of perceived stress, anxiety and depression. Mental health care in the public health emergency like COVID-19 should be strengthened to reassure and support pregnant women. Developing and disseminating specific contents for pregnant women on how to cope in emergency and major disease outbreak by health professional institutions via social media platforms could be an effective way to mitigate mental health problems in future epidemic preparedness and response.","Jiang, Jin, Qian, Xiong, La, Chen, Yang, Yang, Zhang, Abudukelimu, Li, Xie, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Wang, Li, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/18722","20201221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8459,""
"Psychological status of TMD patients, orthodontic patients and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic","Confronting the outbreak of COVID-19, this cross-sectional study was aimed to assess psychological status of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients, orthodontic patients and the general population in China during the pandemic. An online anonymous questionnaire was developed in Chinese, including the individual background information, the perception of the epidemic, and level of anxiety and depression through Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The respondents were divided into ORTHO group, TMD group and Control group. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression modelling were performed. In total, 1241 valid questionnaires were collected, covering 587 orthodontic patients and 220 TMD patients. It is shown that the overall mental health is not quite optimistic during the COVID-19 pandemic with the mean score of K10 being 18.65. TMD patients have higher level of anxiety and depression than orthodontic patients as well as the general population. Younger age, female gender, having close contact with individuals from Hubei province, higher self-rated infection possibility, concern about psychological barriers and distrust are negatively affecting patients' psychological status. Mental health care should be emphasized when hospitals and clinics reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially to patients with these relevant characteristics.","Wu, Xiong, Fang, Sun, Yi, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1858489","20201221","Covid-19; Psychological distress; TMD; orthodontic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8460,""
"&quot;Safer at Home&quot;: The effect of the Covid-19 Lockdown on Epidemiology, Resource Utilization and Outcomes at a Large Urban Trauma Center","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire global healthcare system. In California, due to a high burden of cases, a lockdown order was announced on March 19th, 2020. This study investigated the impact of the lockdown on the epidemiology and outcomes of trauma admissions at the largest trauma center in Los Angeles. Retrospective study comparing epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of trauma admissions, during the lockdown period (03/20/2020 to 06/30/2020) to a similar period in the previous year (03/20/2019 to 06/30/2019). Data collection included demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital transportation, substance use, injury severity, resource utilization, and outcomes. There were 1,202 admissions during the lockdown period in 2020 and 1,143 during the same calendar period in 2019. Following the lockdown, there was a reduction in the automobile versus pedestrian admissions by 42.5%, motorcycle injuries by 38.7%, and bicycle accidents by 28.4%, but no significant effect on the number of motor vehicle accident admissions. There was an increase in ground level falls by 32.5%, especially in the elderly group. The absolute number of gunshot wounds increased by 6.2% and knife injuries by 39.3%. Suicides increased by 38.5%. Positive testing for substance use increased by 20.9%. During the lockdown patients suffered less severe trauma, with ISS&lt;9 (p&lt;0.001), as well as less severe head (p=0.001) and severe chest trauma (p&lt;0.001). Trauma deaths were reduced by 27.9% and the crude overall mortality was significantly lower during the lockdown period (4.1% vs 5.9%, p= 0.046). ICU admission rates, mechanical ventilation, and ICU LOS were all reduced. The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had a significant effect on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and critical care resource utilization of trauma admissions in a large academic trauma center.

"Age Differences in Stress, Life Changes, and Social Ties During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Psychological Well-Being","Experiences of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019) pandemic and its implications for psychological well-being may vary widely across the adult lifespan. The present study examined age differences in pandemic-related stress and social ties, and links with psychological well-being. Participants included 645 adults (43% women) ages 18 to 97 (M = 50.8; SD = 17.7) from the May 2020 nationally representative Survey of Consumers. Participants reported the extent to which they felt stress related to the pandemic in the last month, the extent to which their lives had changed due to the pandemic, as well as social isolation, negative relationship quality, positive relationship quality, and frequency of depression, anxiety and rumination in the past week. Results showed that older people reported less pandemic-related stress, less life change, less social isolation, and lower negative relationship quality than younger people. Greater pandemic-related stress, life change, social isolation, and negative relationship quality were associated with poorer psychological well-being. Poorer social ties (i.e., greater social isolation, and negative quality) exacerbated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (stress, life change) on psychological well-being. Researchers have indicated that older adults may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and social isolation, but this study indicates that young adults may be relatively more vulnerable. Because isolation and negative relationship quality appear to exacerbate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, reducing social isolation and negative relations are potential targets for intervention.","Birditt, Turkelson, Fingerman, Polenick, Oya","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa204","20201221","Relationship quality; Social isolation; Stress exacerbation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8462,""
"Effects of lockdown on emergency room admissions for psychiatric evaluation: an observational study from the AUSL Romagna, Italy","An observation of the admissions to the emergency room (ER) requiring psychiatric evaluation during the lockdown and investigation of the demographic and clinical variables. Retrospective longitudinal observational study of ER accesses for psychiatric evaluation was performed, comparing two periods (9 March-3 May 2020 vs. 9 March-3 May 2019). Data (number of admissions, key baseline demographic and clinical variables) were extracted from the ER databases of referral centres in a well-defined geographic area of North-Eastern Italy (Cesena, Ravenna, ForlÃƒÂ¬, and Rimini). A 15% reduction of psychiatric referrals was observed, together with a 17% reduction in the total number of patients referring to the ER. This reduction was most evident in the first month of the lockdown period (almost 25% reduction of both referrals and patients). Female gender (OR: 1.52: 95%, CI: 1.12-2.06) and being a local resident (OR: 1.54: 95%CI: 1.02-2.34) were factors associated with the decrease. Lockdown changed dramatically health priorities in the local population, including people with mental health. We speculate that our observations do not only refer to the confinement due to the lockdown regime but also to fear of contagion and adoption of different coping strategies, especially in women. Key-points During lockdown 15% reduction of psychiatric visits and &gt;17% reduction in the number of psychiatric patients referring to the ER was observed. in the first four weeks of the lockdown almost 25% reduction of both visits and patients was observed Female gender and being a local resident were factors associated with the decrease.","Beghi, Brandolini, Casolaro, Beghi, Cornaggia, Fraticelli, De Paoli, Ravani, Castelpietra, Ferrari","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2020.1859120","20201221","COVID-19; Lockdown; consultation; mental health; outbreak; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8463,""

"Possible Prophylactic Approach for SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Combination of Melatonin, Vitamin C and Zinc in Animals","SARS-CoV-2, an epidemic, causes severe stress in both human and animals and may induce oxidative stress (OS) and increases susceptibility to infection. Domestic animals are found infected by their COVID-2 suffering owners. Chronic immobilization stress (CIS), a model of psychological and physical stress of confinement, can trigger depression and anxiety in animals. We evaluated the ameliorative effect of the proposed SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic drugs melatonin, vitamin C, and zinc on CIS-induced OS, inflammation, and DNA damage in rats. Forty male Swiss albino rats (200-250 g, 7-9 weeks old) were divided into five groups as controls, CIS, treated with melatonin (20 mg/kg), and vitamin C plus zinc [VitC+Zn (250 + 2.5 mg/kg)] alone or in combination (melatonin+VitC+zinc) subjected to CIS for 3 weeks. CIS was induced by immobilizing the whole body of the rats in wire mesh cages of their size with free movement of head. Exposure to CIS significantly compromised the circulatory activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione with enhanced malondialdehyde, inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL10, and TNFÃŽÂ±), and lymphocyte DNA damage in comparison to controls. Treatment with melatonin and VitC+Zn alone or in combination significantly restored the altered biochemical parameters and DNA damage of stressed rats to their respective control values. However, the cumulative action of melatonin with VitC+Zn was more effective in alleviating the CIS-induced OS, inflammation, and DNA damage. The present study indicates that the antioxidant combination can be an effective preventive measure to combat severe psychological and confinement stress-induced biochemical changes in animals due to abnormal conditions such as SARS-CoV-2.","Fatima, Zaidi, Alsharidah, Aljaser, Banu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.585789","20201221","chronic immobilization stress; inflammation; melatonin; oxidative biomarkers; vitamin C; zinc","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8467,""
"Novelty Seeking and Mental Health in Chinese University Students Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: A Longitudinal Study","COVID-19 has created significant concern surrounding the impact of pandemic lockdown on mental health. While the pandemic lockdown can be distressing, times of crisis can also provide people with the opportunity to think divergently and explore different activities. Novelty seeking, where individuals explore novel and unfamiliarly stimuli and environments, may enhance the creativity of individuals to solve problems in a way that allows them to adjust their emotional responses to stressful situations. This study employs a longitudinal design to investigate changes in novelty seeking and mental health outcomes (namely, stress, anxiety, and depression) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, among a group of students (final <i>N</i> = 173; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 19.81; <i>SD</i><sub>age</sub> = 0.98; 135 females and 38 males) from a university in southeast China. Participants were surveyed at three points: November, 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic); between February and March, 2020 (during the peak of the pandemic and intense lockdown in China); and between May and June, 2020 (after lockdown had been lifted in China). Cross-sectionally, correlation analysis indicated that greater novelty seeking was associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression at all three time points. Univariate latent curve modeling (LCM) indicated a growth trajectory in which novelty seeking increased over time and then remained high during the post-lockdown period. Stress, anxiety, and depression all showed V-shaped growth trajectories in which these variables decreased during lockdown, before increasing in the post-lockdown period. Multivariate LCM indicated the growth trajectory for novelty seeking was associated with the growth trajectories for stress, anxiety, and depression. This suggests that the observed decreases in stress, anxiety, and depression during the lockdown period may be attributable to the sample's observed increase in novelty seeking. These findings are valuable in that they challenge the notion that lockdown measures are inherently detrimental to mental health. The findings indicate the important role of novelty seeking in responding to crises. It may be possible for future public health measures to incorporate the promotion of novelty seeking to help individuals' respond to stressful situations and maintain good mental health in the face of crises.","Li, Yu, Miller, Yang, Rouen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.600739","20201221","Bayesian estimation; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; latent growth modeling; meaning maintenance model; novelty seeking; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8468,""
"Risk and Resilience Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Snapshot of the Experiences of Canadian Workers Early on in the Crisis","Research highlights several risk and resilience factors at multiple ecological levels that influence individuals' mental health and wellbeing in their everyday lives and, more specifically, in disaster or outbreak situations. However, there is limited research on the role of these factors in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis. The present study examined if and how potential risk factors (i.e., reduction in income, job insecurity, feelings of vulnerability to contracting the virus, lack of confidence in avoiding COVID-19, compliance with preventative policies) and resilience factors (i.e., trait resilience, family functioning, social support, social participation, and trust in healthcare institutions) are associated with mental health and well-being outcomes, and whether these resilience factors buffer (i.e., moderate) the associations between risk factors and said outcomes. One to two weeks after the government recommended preventative measures, 1,122 Canadian workers completed an online questionnaire, including multiple wellbeing outcome scales in addition to measures of potential risk and resilience factors. Structural equation models were tested, highlighting that overall, the considered risk factors were associated with poorer wellbeing outcomes, except social distancing which was associated with lower levels of stress. Each of the potential resilience factors was found to have a main effect on one or more of the wellbeing outcomes. Moderation analysis indicated that in general these resilience factors did not, however, buffer the risk factors. The findings confirm that the COVID-19 crisis encompasses several stressors related to the virus as well as to its impact on one's social, occupational, and financial situation, which put people at risk for lower wellbeing as early as one to two weeks after the crisis began. While several resilience factors emerged as positively related to wellbeing, such factors may not be enough, or sufficiently activated at that time, to buffer the effects of the numerous life changes required by COVID-19. From an ecological perspective, while mental health professionals and public health decision-makers should offer/design services directly focused on mental health and wellbeing, it is important they go beyond celebrating individuals' inner potential for resilience, and also support individuals in activating their environmental resources during a pandemic.","Coulombe, Pacheco, Cox, Khalil, Doucerain, Auger, Meunier","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.580702","20201221","COVID-19; ecological model; mental health; resilience; stressors; wellbeing; workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8469,""
"Safe but Lonely? Loneliness, Anxiety, and Depression Symptoms and COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments worldwide to implement unprecedented response strategies. While crucial to limiting the spread of the virus, &quot;social distancing&quot; may lead to severe psychological consequences, especially in lonely individuals. We used cross-sectional (<i>n</i> = 380) and longitudinal (<i>n</i> = 74) designs to investigate the links between loneliness, anxiety, and depression symptoms (ADS) and COVID-19 risk perception and affective response in young adults who implemented social distancing during the first 2 weeks of the state of epidemic threat in Poland. Loneliness was correlated with ADS and with affective response to COVID-19's threat to health. However, increased worry about the social isolation and heightened risk perception for financial problems was observed in lonelier individuals. The cross-lagged influence of the initial affective response to COVID-19 on subsequent levels of loneliness was also found. The reciprocal connections between loneliness and COVID-19 response may be of crucial importance for ADS during the COVID-19 crisis.","Okruszek, Aniszewska-StaÃ…â€žczuk, Piejka, WiÃ…â€ºniewska, Ã…Â»urek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.579181","20201221","COVID-19; anxiety and depression; loneliness; mental well-being; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8470,""
"Connecting During COVID-19: A Protocol of a Volunteer-Based Telehealth Program for Supporting Older Adults' Health","<b>Introduction:</b> Social-distancing due to COVID-19 has led to social isolation, stress, and mental health issues in older adults, while overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. Telehealth involving phone calls by trained volunteers is understudied and may be a low-cost, scalable, and valuable preventive tool for mental health. In this context, from patient participatory volunteer initiatives, we have adapted and developed an innovative volunteer-based telehealth intervention program for older adults (TIP-OA). <b>Methods and analysis:</b> To evaluate TIP-OA, we are conducting a mixed-methods longitudinal observational study. <b>Participants:</b> TIP-OA clients are older adults (age Ã¢â€°Â¥ 60) recruited in Montreal, Quebec. <b>Intervention:</b> TIP-OA volunteers make weekly friendly phone calls to seniors to check in, form connections, provide information about COVID-19, and connect clients to community resources as needed. <b>Measurements:</b> Perceived stress, fear surrounding COVID-19, depression, and anxiety will be assessed at baseline, and at 4- and 8-weeks. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to assess the experiences of clients, volunteers, and stakeholders. <b>Results:</b> As of October 15th, 2020, 150 volunteers have been trained to provide TIP-OA to 305 older clients. We will consecutively select 200 clients receiving TIP-OA for quantitative data collection, plus 16 volunteers and 8 clinicians for focus groups, and 15 volunteers, 10 stakeholders, and 25 clients for semi-structured interviews. <b>Discussion:</b> During COVID-19, healthcare professionals' decreased availability and increased needs related to geriatric mental health are expected. If successful and scalable, volunteer-based TIP-OA may help prevent and improve mental health concerns, improve community participation, and decrease healthcare utilization. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04523610; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04523610?term=NCT04523610&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1.","Dikaios, Sekhon, Allard, Vacaflor, Goodman, Dwyer, Lavin-Gonzalez, Mahdanian, Park, Walsh, Sasi, Nazar, Gruber, Su, Hanganu, Royal, Schiavetto, Cinalioglu, Rigas, Launay, Beauchet, McDonald, Seitz, Kumar, Nair, Miresco, Bruneau, Alexopoulos, Looper, Vahia, Rej, Bukhari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598356","20201221","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; geriatrics; older adults; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8471,""
"Tele-Psychiatry Assessment of Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms in 100 Patients With Bipolar Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic Social-Distancing Measures in Italy","The acute phase of the COrona VIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) emergency determined relevant stressful burdens in psychiatric patients, particularly those with chronic mental disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), not only for the threat of being infected but also for the strict lock-down and social-distancing measures adopted, the economic uncertainty, and the limited possibilities to access psychiatric services. In this regard, telepsychiatry services represented a new important instrument that clinicians could adopt to monitor and support their patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate acute post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) reported by patients with BD followed in the framework of a telepsychiatry service, set up in the acute phase of the COVID-19 outbreak at the psychiatric clinic of the University of Pisa (Italy). A sample of 100 patients were consecutively enrolled and assessed by the IES-r, GAD-7, HAM-D, and YMRS. Patients reported a mean (Ã‚Â±SD) IES-r total score of 18.15 Ã‚Â± 13.67. Further, 17% of the sample reported PTSS (IES-r &gt; 32), 17% depressive symptoms (HAM-D &gt; 17), and 26% anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 &gt; 10). Work and financial difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and anxiety symptoms appeared to be positively associated with the development of acute PTSS. Acute manic symptoms appeared to be protective. The data of the present study suggest the relevance of monitoring patients with BD exposed to the burden related to the COVID-19 outbreak for prompt assessment and treatment of PTSS.","Carmassi, Bertelloni, Dell'Oste, Barberi, Maglio, Buccianelli, Cordone, Dell'Osso","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.580736","20201221","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; mood disorder; pandemic; post-traumatic stress symptoms; tele-psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8472,""
"Psychological Status Among Anesthesiologists and Operating Room Nurses During the Outbreak Period of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) posed a major threat to public health. Anesthesiologists and operating room (OR) nurses are at high risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19. We conducted a single-center survey to investigate the psychological status and perceived social support among operation room (OR) medical staffs during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> A total of 197 OR medical staffs were enrolled in the survey. The authors performed a cohort study during the period of Wuhan lockdown and then conducted a longitudinal follow-up after lifting of lockdown. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to assess perceived social support. We compared the psychological status of OR medical staffs before and after lifting of Wuhan lockdown. <b>Results:</b> During the period of city lockdown, 177 (89.8%) had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in OR medical staffs was 41.6 and 43.1% under Wuhan lockdown, while 13.2 and 15.7% after lifting of lockdown (<i>P</i> = 0.002, <i>P</i> = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, living in suburb areas, shortage of protective equipment and close contact with COVID-19 patients were associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with depression and anxiety severity in the OR medical staffs (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> OR medical staffs exhibited high incidence of anxiety and depression faced with the high risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients. More social support and social recognition for anesthesiologists and OR nurses might potentially help them relieve their psychological pressure.","Li, Wang, Zhang, Chen, He, Wang, Ke, Wang, Zhang, Song","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574143","20201221","COVID-19; anesthesiologists; anxiety; depression; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8473,""
"A Narrative Review of Stigma Related to Infectious Disease Outbreaks: What Can Be Learned in the Face of the Covid-19 Pandemic?","Infectious disease pandemics are associated with social consequences and stigma that are noticeably similar in various health conditions, health systems, and cultures. Stigma impacts health-related outcomes, not only as a barrier to receiving the timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment but also as an important variable that increases mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 outbreak has been associated with stigma too. Studying similarities as well as differences in the features of stigma observed in each outbreak can provide us with the knowledge and deeper understanding of the situation, which is necessary for approaching the issue comprehensively. The stigma needs to be addressed rigorously by professionals and health care providers as well as authorities. Here, we narratively review stigma due to some well-known infectious diseases and how it parallels to the current COVID-19 situation. After discussing its effects on both individuals and societies, we provide solutions to manage this important issue.","Saeed, Mihan, Mousavi, Reniers, Bateni, Alikhani, Mousavi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565919","20201221","corona virus disease (COVID-19); health consequence; mental health; pandemics; public health; stigma &amp; discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8474,""
"Call for Action to Address Equity and Justice Divide During COVID-19","The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is deepening the inequity and injustice among the vulnerable communities. The current study aims to present an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on equity and social justice with a focus on vulnerable communities. Vulnerable communities include, but not limited to, healthcare workers, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic or minority groups, immigrants or refugees, justice-involved populations, and people suffering from chronic diseases or mental illness. The implications of COVID-19 on these communities and systemic disparities beyond the current pandemic are also discussed. People from vulnerable communities' experience disproportionately adverse impacts of COVID-19. COVID-19 has exacerbated systemic disparities and its long-term negative impact on these populations foretell an impending crisis that could prevail beyond the COVID-19 era. It is onerous that systemic issues be addressed and efforts to build inclusive and sustainable societies be pursued to ensure the provision of universal healthcare and justice for all. Without these reinforcements, we would not only compromise the vulnerable communities but also severely limit our preparedness and response to a future pandemic.","Bhaskar, Rastogi, Menon, Kunheri, Balakrishnan, Howick","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.559905","20201221","COVID-19; health equity; health policy; mental health; social determinants of health; social justice; social medicine; vulnerable communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8475,""
"Pyometra Management Practices in the High Quality, High Volume Spay-Neuter Environment","Pyometra management in the high quality, high volume spay-neuter (HQHVSN) environment is not well documented. The goal of this study was to identify pyometra management practices and patient outcomes in the HQHVSN environment. An electronic survey was piloted and distributed to HQHVSN clinics using Survey Monkey via email lists and social media. A total of 118 responses were received from June to July 2020. Respondents were distributed across the United States with the majority of clinics associated with a shelter (75%). Clinics performed a median of 25 spays and neuters per day and 5000 per year. Most clinics (86%) were willing to treat nonincidental pyometras at least sometimes, and nearly all of these clinics (97%) were willing to accept pyometra referrals. Of these clinics, nearly all (95%) felt they had the necessary resources to treat most pyometras that presented and that a pyometra case was only modestly disruptive to their surgery flow. Most clinics (70%) charged a fee for treatment, charging a median of $200 for dogs and $125 for cats. This is much lower as compared to the estimated ranges for private practice ($600-$2500) and emergency hospitals ($1500-$3579). The majority of patients that HQHVSN clinics accepted for treatment were seen the same day (50%) or next day (42%). These clinics estimated that of the animals who presented, 76% were BAR or QAR, 20% were depressed or nonambulatory, and 4% were obtunded and lateral. Estimated survival for these treated groups were 98%, 80%, and 38%, respectively. HQHVSN clinics may represent a resource for treating pyometras when treatment is disruptive to the schedule of a private practice or clients present with financial limitations. There is an opportunity for HQHVSN and private practice to form a partnership to leverage the strengths of both models and improve access to care for pets.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499","20210301","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8476,""
"The network structure of stress-related states, depression, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown","Background. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing protocols used to impede the spread of the virus may have severe mental health consequences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the network of components of pandemic-related negative psychological states (i.e., fear of infection, financial worries, loneliness) and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods. Data from 10,061 Norwegian adults recruited through an online survey during a period of strict social distancing protocols were analyzed employing a cross-sectional Gaussian Graphical Model. Results. Of the infection fears, fear of being infected, fear of dying from the coronavirus and fear of significant others dying from it had notable connections to the GAD symptoms anxiety and/or fear of awful events. The financial worry component worry about personal economy was connected to the MDD symptom sleep problems and to the GAD symptom generalized worry. Each of the loneliness components was connected to a specific MDD symptom. Anhedonia, depressed mood and worthlessness had the highest strength centrality among the MDD symptoms; generalized worry, uncontrollability of worry, and trouble relaxing among the GAD symptoms; fear of dying from the virus among the fear of infection components; and feeling isolated among the loneliness components. A community analysis identified separate clusters for MDD and GAD as well as a cluster cutting across the two disorders. Conclusions. Particular components of the pandemic-related distressing states of fear of infection and loneliness seem to be associated with specific symptoms of MDD and GAD.

"Psychiatry and Covid-19: Acute mental health presentations before and during the pandemic","Background We aimed to analyse numbers and types of psychiatric presentations to inform planning for future demand on mental health services in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods We analysed electronic data between January and April 2020 for 2,534 patients referred to acute psychiatric services. We used interrupted time series analyses to compare trends in A&E and psychiatric presentations before and after lockdown, and tested for differences in patientsâ€™ demographics, symptom severity, and use of the Mental Health Act, before and after lockdown. Results There were 11% fewer psychiatric presentations the first week and 64% fewer A&E presentations the first month after lockdown initiated. A higher proportion of patients were detained under the Mental Health Act (22.2% vs 16.1%) and Mental Capacity Act (2.2 vs 1.1%)(<U+03C7>2(2)=16.3, p<0.0001) and they experienced a longer duration of symptoms before seeking help from mental health services (<U+03C7> 2(3)= 18.6, p<0.0001). A higher proportion of patients presented with psychotic symptoms (23.3% v 17.0%) or delirium (7.0 v 3.6%) and fewer had parasuicidal behaviour (43.8% v 52.0, <U+03C7>2 (7)= 28.7, p<0.0001).

"Trajectories of eating behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of 22,374 adults in the UK","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of stay-at-home and lockdown measures. It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individualâ€™s eating behaviors. Objective: The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. Design: Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, heath-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. Results: Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR= 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR= 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR= 0.54-0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were most common amongst the consistently overeaters, whereas underweight participants persistently ate less. Conclusion: In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics. This is particularly important as part of on-going preventive efforts to prevent nutrition-related chronic diseases.","Moritz Herle et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-AB6-DD4","20201130","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; lockdown; longitudinal study; obesity; covid-19; eating behavior","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8480,""

However, there is little research on how individualsâ€™ coping strategies during the pandemic were related to changes in mental health over time. The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study (N=26,505) to explore whether particular coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery from symptoms across 21 weeks. People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress.","Meg Fluharty et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-A63-3CF","20201110","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; longitudinal; depression; mental health; coping; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8481,""
"My home is my castle? The role of living arrangements on experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The restrictions implemented to slow down the spread of COVID-19 are leading to noticeable declines in mental health. However, oneâ€™s living arrangement may buffer or catalyze the impact of COVID-19â€™s restrictions. We argue that restrictions may have a stronger impact for those with higher risk of loneliness and those who need to provide childcare. To test these considerations, we employ quantitative text analysis on open-ended questions from novel survey data of a sample of about 1,100 individuals. We examine how worries and loneliness vary across four different household structures: Living alone, shared living without children, living with a partner and children, and single parents. We find that individuals living alone are most likely to report feelings of loneliness, while single parents are at highest risk of experience care related worries, particularly regarding their financial situation. Those sharing a house, with or without children, had lower risks of experiencing both loneliness or care related worries. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.","Alexander Langenkamp et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616C-0B8-59D","20201120","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; germany; topic models; covid-19; loneliness; children; experience; household; corona; content analysis; partnership","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-22","",8482,""
