"The interaction between coping styles with relationship breakdowns, loss, and conflict and the frequency of self-harm thoughts and behaviours: a longitudinal analysis of 21,581 UK adults","Abstract Background Relationship breakdowns or conflict are frequent precipitants for self-harm thoughts and behaviours, but the majority who experience these stressful life events do not think about or engage in self-harm. Understanding factors that attenuate or exacerbate this risk is therefore needed. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether relationship breakdowns, loss, and conflict lead to more frequent self-harm thoughts and behaviours. We also examine whether coping styles and neuroticism, posited by diathesis-stress models of suicide risk to interact with these events, attenuate or exacerbate the risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours from these events. Methods This study utilised data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which acted as a natural experiment by leading to a greater prevalence of relationship breakdowns than usual. Data from 21,581 adults who participated in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study between 28 February 2021 and 4 April 2022 were utilised. Poisson regression models which controlled for socio-demographics and a diagnosed mental health condition were used to examine the impact of four predictor variables (separation or divorce, family problem, an other relationship breakdown [e.g., friend or colleague], and the death of a close relative or friend) with the number of times self-harm thoughts and behaviours were reported over the study period. Interactions between these events and coping styles (problem-focused, emotion-focused, socially supported, and avoidant coping) were also examined. Results Variables representing relationship breakdowns, loss, and conflict were associated with an increased frequency of self-harm thoughts (incidence rate ratio [RRR] range: 1.04 to 1.77) and behaviours (RRR range: 1.48 to 1.96). The use of more avoidant coping strategies (e.g., substance use, denial) increased the risk for both outcomes but unexpectedly attenuated associations between predictor variables and self-harm thoughts. Socially supported coping increased the likelihood of both outcomes, but not in sensitivity analyses which excluding venting from the scale. Problem-focused coping strategies (e.g., active planning) attenuated the impact of separation or divorce and having had a family problem on the frequency of self-harm behaviours. Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of interpersonal loss and conflict for the frequency of thinking about and engaging in self-harm and suggest that the magnitude of these associations may depend on different coping styles.","Elise Paul; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.21.22276696","20220622","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33180,""
"Acceleration of regional, racial and gender disparities in drug overdoses across the United States driven by COVID-19 and fentanyl use","Objectives. To examine trends in drug overdose deaths by gender, race and geography in the United States during the period 2013-2020. Methods. We used the final National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files to extract crude rates by gender and race and to calculate the male-to-female ratios of crude rates between 2013 and 2020. We established 2013-2019 temporal trends for four major drug types: psychostimulants with addiction potential (T43.6, such as methamphetamines); heroin (T40.1); natural and semi-synthetic opioids (T40.2, such as those contained in prescription pain-killers); synthetic opioids (T40.4, such as fentanyl and its derivatives) through a quadratic regression and determined whether changes in the pandemic year 2020 were statistically significant. We also identified states, race and gender categories most impacted by drug overdoses. Results: Nationwide, the year 2020 saw statistically significant increases in overdoses for all drug categories except heroin, surpassing predictions based on 2013-2019 trends. Crude rates for Blacks of both genders surpassed those for Whites for fentanyl and psychostimulants in 2018 creating a gap that widened through 2020. In some regions mortality among Whites decreased while overdose rates for Blacks kept rising. The largest 2020 mortality statistic is for Black males in the District of Columbia, with a record 134 overdoses per 100,000 due to fentanyl, 9.4 times more than the fatality rate among White males. Male overdose crude rates in 2020 remain larger than those of females for all drug categories except in Idaho, Utah and Arkansas where crude rates of overdoses by natural and semisynthetic opioids for females exceeded those of males. Public Health Implications: Drug prevention, mitigation and no-harm strategies should include racial, geographical and gender-specific efforts, to better identify and serve at risk groups.","Lucas BÃ¶ttcher; Maria  R.

"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japanese companion animal clinics","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people's lives throughout the world. A cross-sectional study was conducted to clarify the influence of COVID-19 on Japanese companion animal clinics. A self-administered electronic questionnaire regarding the incidence of COVID-19, hygiene management, the influence on clinical service and employment, and mental stress of staff was conducted for workers in animal clinics between 1 May and 10 June 2021. Questions concerning the hygiene management before the occurrence of COVID-19, under the first state of emergency, and at the time of the survey were asked using the Likert scale. Kessler 6 (K6) was used as an indicator of mental distress. In total, 430 individuals responded. Of these, 4.9% experienced COVID-19 infection in staff. Hygiene management was strengthened, but no particular practice was statistically associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 cases in staff. In Nakaya's variation of Scheffe's paired comparison, the highest prioritized goal in the clinics was the prevention of nosocomial infection with COVID-19. The prevalence of serious mental illness (K6&gt;=13) was 11.1% (95% confidence interval: 6.3-18.6%). Multivariable negative binomial regression found four risk factors for psychological distress: veterinary nurse (P=0.016 with veterinarians and P&lt;0.01 with other staff), female (P=0.004), fear of infection at work (P&lt;0.001), and stress by refraining from going out (P&lt;0.001). Directors of clinics are recommended to take care of female veterinary nurses for distress.","Fukumoto, Kimura, Tsutsumi, Hori, Tanaka, Ukita, Makita","https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.22-0072","20220622","companion animal clinics; coronavirus disease 2019; hygiene management; mental health; veterinary nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33182,""
"Antibody and T cell responses to COVID-19 vaccination in patients receiving anticancer therapies","Patients with cancer were excluded from phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials, and the immunogenicity and side effect profiles of these vaccines in this population is not well understood. Patients with cancer can be immunocompromised from chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or the cancer itself, which may affect cellular and/or humoral responses to vaccination. PD-1 is expressed on T effector cells, T follicular helper cells and B cells, leading us to hypothesize that anti-PD-1 immunotherapies may augment antibody or T cell generation after vaccination. Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike protein were assessed in patients with cancer (n=118) and healthy donors (HD, n=22) after 1, 2 or 3 mRNA vaccine doses. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity to wild-type (WT) or B.1.617.2 (delta) spike peptides was measured by intracellular cytokine staining. Oncology patients without prior COVID-19 infections receiving immunotherapy (n=36), chemotherapy (n=15), chemoimmunotherapy (n=6), endocrine or targeted therapies (n=6) and those not on active treatment (n=26) had similar RBD and Spike IgG antibody titers to HDs after two vaccinations. Contrary to our hypothesis, PD-1 blockade did not augment antibody titers or T cell responses. Patients receiving B-cell directed therapies (n=14) including anti-CD20 antibodies and multiple myeloma therapies had decreased antibody titers, and 9/14 of these patients were seronegative for RBD antibodies. No differences were observed in WT spike-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell generation between treatment groups. 11/13 evaluable patients seronegative for RBD had a detectable WT spike-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. T cells cross-reactive against the B.1.617.2 variant spike peptides were detected in 31/59 participants. Two patients with prior immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adrenal insufficiency had symptomatic hypoadrenalism after vaccination. COVID-19 vaccinations are safe and immunogenic in patients with solid tumors, who developed similar antibody and T cell responses compared with HDs. Patients on B-cell directed therapies may fail to generate RBD antibodies after vaccination and should be considered for prophylactic antibody treatments. Many seronegative patients do develop a T cell response, which may have an anti-viral effect. Patients with pre-existing adrenal insufficiency may need to take stress dose steroids during vaccination to avoid adrenal crisis.","Rouhani, Yu, Olson, Zha, Pezeshk, Cabanov, Pyzer, Trujillo, Derman, O'Donnell, Jakubowiak, Kindler, Bestvina, Gajewski","https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2022-004766","20220622","COVID-19; T-lymphocytes; antibody formation; immunogenicity, vaccine; immunotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33183,""
"Increase in telemental health services on the Medicare Benefits Schedule after the start of the coronavirus pandemic: data from 2019 to 2021","ObjectiveTo describe the change in telemental health service volume that resulted from the introduction of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers in 2020 for services provided by psychologists and psychiatrists in Australia for a 3-year period, from January 2019 to December 2021.MethodsQuarterly MBS activity and cost data for mental health services provided by consultant psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and psychologists between January 2019 and December 2021 were extracted from the MBS statistics website. Data were grouped by profession and delivery mode (in-person, telephone or videoconference) and reported using activity counts. Descriptive analysis and interrupted time-series regression analysis were conducted. Specific descriptive explorations were also conducted for psychiatrists, including: new client consultations, review or general consultations, and group consultations.ResultsThe delivery of mental health services by telehealth (telemental health) during the pandemic has increased (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). When the pandemic started in March 2020, telemental health services provided by psychiatrists and psychologists increased from a combined 1-2% per quarter to 29% videoconference and 20% telephone in quarter two 2020. After the onset of the pandemic, videoconference remained the primary form of telehealth for these professions. However, the telephone accounted for approximately a third of the telehealth activity after the new item numbers were introduced.ConclusionTelemental health services are more likely to be conducted by videoconference than by telephone. The observed increase in telehealth service activity confirms how crucial appropriate funding models are to the sustainability of telehealth services in Australia. The growth in telehealth was used to support people with mental health conditions in Australia.","Snoswell, Arnautovska, Haydon, Siskind, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH22078","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33184,""

We analyzed data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project (four timepoints, 6-month period) using regression models with logarithmically transformed data and non-parametric repeated-measures tests (N = 871). Results showed higher depressive symptoms among women. Family caregivers (either parents or those caring for other relatives) were at highest risk for occupational imbalance and depressive symptoms. Sports and social contact were initially associated with better outcomes, but the effects waned. There was a main effect for time point driven by the last wave (amidst the second lockdown) but no significant interaction effects between predictors and time point were found.

A cross-sectional study examined responses to an online survey conducted among 2076 licensed healthcare workers during the first pandemic peak. Mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, and anger) was examined as a multivariate outcome for association with COVID-related occupational experiences. Odds of negative mental health were increased among those who worked directly with patients while sick themselves (adjusted odds ratio 2.29, 95% confidence interval 1.71-3.08), and were independently associated with: working more hours than usual in the past two weeks, having family/friends who died due to COVID-19, having COVID-19 symptoms, and facing insufficiencies in personal protective equipment/other shortages.

"Exploring COVID-19 Related Stressors Using Topic Modeling","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people globally for over two years. Changes in lifestyles due to the pandemic may cause psychosocial stressors for individuals, and could lead to mental health problems. To provide high-quality mental health support, healthcare organizations need to identify COVID-19-specific stressors and monitor the trends of the prevalence of those stressors. This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to social media data to identify the psychosocial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the trend of the prevalence of these stressors at different stages of the pandemic. We obtained a dataset of 9266 Reddit posts from the subreddit rCOVID19_support, from 14th Feb 2020 to 19th July 2021. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify the topics that were mentioned on the subreddit, and analyzed the trends of the prevalence of the topics. Lexicons were created for each of the topics, and were used to identify the topics of each post. The prevalence of topics identified by the LDA and lexicon approaches were compared. LDA model identified six topics from the dataset: 1) ""fear of coronavirus"", 2) ""problems related to social relationships"", 3) ""mental health symptoms"", 4) ""family problems"", 5) ""educational and occupational problem"", and 6) ""uncertainty on the development of pandemic"". According to the results, there was a significant decline in the number of posts about the ""fear of coronavirus"" after the vaccine distribution started. This suggests that the distribution of vaccines may have reduced the perceived risks of coronavirus. The prevalence of discussions on the uncertainty about the pandemic did not decline with the increase in the vaccinated population. In April 2021, when the Delta variant became prevalent in the US, there was a significant increase in the number of posts about the uncertainty of pandemic development but no obvious effects on the topic of the fear of coronavirus. We have created a dashboard to visualize the trend of prevalence of topics about COVID-19-related stressors being discussed on the social media platform (Reddit). Our results provide insights into the prevalence of pandemic-related stressors during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The NLP techniques leveraged in this study could also be applied to analyze event-specific stressors in the future.","Leung, Khalvati","https://doi.org/10.2196/37142","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33187,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived publication pressure among academic researchers in Canada","The phenomenon of ""publish-or-perish"" in academia, spurred on by limited funding and academic positions, has led to increased competition and pressure on academics to publish. Publication pressure has been linked with multiple negative outcomes, including increased academic misconduct and researcher burnout. COVID-19 has disrupted research worldwide, leading to lost research time and increased anxiety amongst researchers. The objective of this study was to examine how COVID-19 has impacted perceived publication pressure amongst academic researchers in Canada. We used the revised Publication Pressure Questionnaire, in addition to Likert-type questions to discern respondents' beliefs and concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on academic publishing. We found that publication pressure increased across academic researchers in Canada following the pandemic, with respondents reporting increased stress, increased pessimism, and decreased access to support related to publishing. Doctoral students reported the highest levels of stress and pessimism, while principal investigators had the most access to publication support. There were no significant differences in publication pressure reported between different research disciplines. Women and non-binary or genderfluid respondents reported higher stress and pessimism than men. We also identified differences in perceived publication pressure based on respondents' publication frequency and other demographic factors, including disability and citizenship status. Overall, we document a snapshot of perceived publication pressure in Canada across researchers of different academic career stages and disciplines. This information can be used to guide the creation of researcher supports, as well as identify groups of researchers who may benefit from targeted resources.","Suart, Neuman, Truant","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269743","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33188,""
"Future Directions on BIPOC Youth Mental Health: The Importance of Cultural Rituals in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Culture plays an important role in the development of mental health, especially during childhood and adolescence. However, less is known about how participation in cultural rituals is related to the wellbeing of youth who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), and part of the Global Majority. This is crucial amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a global event that has disproportionally affected BIPOC youth and disrupted participation in rituals. The goal of this paper is to promote advances in clinical child and adolescent psychology focused on rituals. We begin by defining culture and rituals and examining their role on development. We illustrate these issues with the Lunar New Year in China, Maya rituals in MÃƒÂ©xico, <i>Ramadan</i> in Turkey, and Black graduations and Latinx funerals in the United States. We discuss how the pandemic has affected participation in these rituals and their potential impact on BIPOC children and adolescents' mental health.

"Factors affecting the willingness of mental health staff to get vaccinated against COVID-19","At the beginning of vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), information about the effects of the vaccine was not known and hesitancy was observed among the population. The mental health staff members in our center in Israel had to decide whether to get vaccinated or not. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences in demographic characteristics of vaccinated and nonvaccinated mental health care workers (HCWs), and to identify their reasons for or against vaccination. Data on characteristics of 357 staff members at a mental health center (MHCS) in Israel and their attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination, those who were nonvaccinated, were collected via anonymous questionnaires, from 1 January to 10 January 2021. The groups were then compared using Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> , Fisher's exact tests, t test or Mann-Whitney nonparametric test as appropriate. A logistic regression was then performed using the significant variables and odd ratios presented. Eighty-one per cent of the sample received at least the first dose of the vaccine. Results indicated differences in seniority (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), profession (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), department (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), risk groups (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), religion (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), religiosity (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), previous care for COVID-19 patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and level of interaction with patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), between the vaccinated and nonvaccinated staff. The factor that was found to be most influential regarding vaccination and which convinced those originally against the vaccine to become vaccinated was the level of scientific knowledge about the vaccine. Efforts and resources should focus on the dissemination of reliable scientific data about the vaccine, to increase vaccination rates among mental HCWs.","Dahan, Bloemhof-Bris, Weizman, Pesah, Gorno, Abu Shah, Levi, Shelef","https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13722","20220622","COVID-19; mental health staff; vaccine acceptance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33190,""
"""Hey child, why were you born when the world is almost over?"": An analysis of first-time mothers' postpartum experiences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico","In Coatepec, Mexico, the immediate postpartum is considered a special time, called the cuarentena, when postpartum women receive critical social support and observe diet and activity pre- and proscriptions-all intended to enhance maternal-child health. This study examined how public health mandates aimed at containing COVID-19, which instructed people to socially isolate, affected women's postpartum experiences, including observing the cuarentena. We recruited first-time mothers from the local public health clinic and collected qualitative data via a verbally administered survey that covered knowledge/perceived threat of COVID-19 and its effect on the cuarentena and maternal mood. We used content analysis to analyze the data. We conducted 33 telephonic interviews from March to December 2020. Overall, women were knowledgeable about and receptive to public health messaging regarding COVID-19 risks and safety measures. Despite knowledge and receptivity, most followed their original cuarentena plans to observe culturally prescribed postpartum practices, even when doing so contradicted public health mandates. However, the mandates that limited socialization with friends and extended family during the cuarentena negatively affected maternal mood. Postpartum women, especially in under-studied low- and middle-income countries, merit research attention. Emergent from this study is that public health messaging should speak to its target audience in a way that makes sense within local contexts, which includes consideration of highly valued health practices. Future studies aimed at understanding how to achieve this goal will facilitate development of stronger programs that address public health needs and protect individual well-being.","Wolfe-Sherrie, Perroni-MaraÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n, NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez-de la Mora, Piperata","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-022-03405-6","20220622","COVID-19; Maternal Mental Health; Postpartum Practices; Public Health Protocols; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33191,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on medium term weight loss and comorbidities in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and its association with psychological wellbeing","The COVID-19 epidemic imposed significant stressors on individuals and changed how medical care is delivered. The affect that this stress has placed on the field of bariatric surgery and the associated outcomes is not well established. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database from a single academic institution was conducted. Weight loss and comorbidity outcomes were compared between a cohort of patients operated on during the pandemic and a matched group operated on prior to COVID-19. GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires were used to assess for anxiety and depression, respectively. A total of 329 and 155 patients were enrolled in the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 groups respectively. There were no significant differences in pre-operative BMI (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.437) or comorbidities: Type II DM (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.810), hypertension (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.879), sleep apnea (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.502), and hyperlipidemia (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.227). Post-operatively, weight loss was comparable at all time points out to 1Ã‚Â year. Type II DM resolution rates were higher in the control cohort at 6Ã‚Â months (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007), but not at 12Ã‚Â months (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.000). There was no statistically significant difference in resolution rates between the control group and the COVID-19 group for the other measured comorbidities. There was no difference in objective measures of anxiety and depression when comparing the two groups (both pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how society and medical systems function. Focusing on pre-operative dietary training and screening for inadequately managed psychological comorbidities yielded similar weight loss outcomes notwithstanding the significant societal and individual stressors with which patients were faced.","Talledo, Carroll, Worden, Greenwood, Alexander, Karlsdottir, Lehmann, Peoples, Smith, Thompson, Zhang, Nau","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-022-09377-6","20220622","Bariatric surgery; COVID-19; Psychological wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33192,""

"Comparison of the levels of depression and anxiety during the first and fourth waves of coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic in Brazil","To compare the levels of depression, anxiety, physical activity, and mobility restrictions between the first wave in June 2020 and the fourth wave in January 2022 of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Brazil. Brazilian citizens answered a self-administered questionnaire that included questions related to personal information, mobility restriction levels, physical activity levels, and the status of mood disorders in June 2020 (n=1853) and January 2022 (n=728). The levels of mobility restrictions (p&lt;0.001), anxiety (p&lt;0.001), and depression (p&lt;0.001) significantly decreased from 2020 to 2022. In June 2020, 23.2% of the participants presented moderate to severe anxiety, and in January 2022, this percentage decreased to 14.8%. In June 2020, 29.6% of the participants presented moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and in January 2022 this percentage decreased to 19.3%. On the contrary, physical activity levels significantly increased between 2020 and 2022 (p&lt;0.001). During the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were less restricted and more physically active than in the first wave. Furthermore, anxiety and depression levels were significantly lower in the fourth wave than in the first wave. Despite this reduction, levels of anxiety and depression remain high; therefore, the authors suggest measures to encourage physical activity and promote mental health.","Barbosa Junior, Barbosa de Lira, Vancini, Puccinelli, Seffrin, Vivan, Ribeiro Dos Anjos, Weiss, Knechtle, Andrade","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202206_28988","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33194,""
"Pharmacists' mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy","The year 2020 was characterized by the outbreak of a new pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. To face the pandemic, many countries worldwide imposed general lockdowns, closing all non-essential businesses. As primary care services, pharmacies had to remain open, thus putting pharmacy staff at significant risk of viral infection and overwork. This study aimed to assess the mental health of Italian Pharmacists, considering demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle, and habits, during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown period (March-May 2020). A web-based survey was created using GoogleÃ‚Â® Forms to collect data from March 30, 2020, to June 1, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections investigating: (1) demographic and occupational variables, (2) lifestyle and habits variables, (3) psychological distress and perceived well-being. A total of 401 participants completed the questionnaire. Older workers and those with more work experience reported more psychological stress. Older and female workers, who felt lonely at home and reported psychological stress, perceived poor well-being. Our findings demonstrate that the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent lockdown rules affected pharmacists' mental health and that it is important to put in place preventive measures against the occurrence of mental disorders among them.","Buomprisco, Cedrone, Vitali, Protano, Cammalleri, Pocino, Perri, Lapteva, De Sio","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202206_28987","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33195,""
"Telepsychiatry services during COVID-19: A cross-sectional survey on the experiences and perspectives of young adults with first-episode psychosis","Limited evidence exists on the implementation of telepsychiatry within the context of early intervention services for psychosis, the need for which has become even more relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this gap, we investigated the experiences and perspectives of young adults recovering from a first-episode psychosis (FEP) following their use of telepsychiatry services (i.e. use of video conferencing technology to deliver mental health services to patients in real time). A cross-sectional online survey study was implemented between November 19<sup>th</sup> , 2020 and March 9<sup>th</sup> , 2021 with young adults recruited from a specialized program for FEP located in an urban Canadian setting. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, exploratory (Fisher's exact test), and content analysis. Among 51 participants (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 26.0, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.7; 56.9% female), the majority were satisfied with the service (91%, 46/51), perceived that the platform was easy to use (90%, 46/51) and felt secure in terms of confidentiality (82%, 42/51). Satisfaction was related to perceptions regarding ease of use, image quality, and employment/studying status. Several partially or totally agreed that the presence of a third party was essential to login during the first few sessions (35%, 18/51), and some needed technical support (24%, 12/51) throughout the sessions. This study shows that telepsychiatry is feasible and acceptable to implement for patients in the early phase of psychosis recovery. It also highlights the importance of making technical support available, especially in the first few times of using the service, and addressing patient concerns regarding confidentiality, even when using secured health technologies.","Lal, Abdel-Baki, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13332","20220622","digital health; information and communication technologies; mental health services; mhealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33196,""
"Pandemic-Related Social Disruption and Well-Being in Pediatric Gastrointestinal Diseases","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted everyone, but there are few data regarding how the pandemic has influenced the lives of children with gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. This cross-sectional study assessed pandemic-related social disruption (PRSD) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease (CD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the potential buffering effect of the parent-child relationship. A survey completed between September and December 2020 asked 146 children (ages 8-17) diagnosed with IBD (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44), CD (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°81), or IBS (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51) and 185 parents how the pandemic has contributed to social disruption (i.e., financial stability, COVID-19 exposure, school changes, GI needs, and isolation) and their social-emotional well-being. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the role of social disruption on well-being, and the moderating effect of the parent-child relationship. Increased social disruption predicted worse parent, ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02, and child well-being, ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.38, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01.

"Anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in prisoners who had high risks to suffer from mood disorders: A longitudinal study before and during the COVID-19","We compared the anxiety levels in prisoners before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and analyzed the causes of the changes in anxiety. and methods: The first survey was conducted in October 2019 (T0), and the second was conducted in March 2020 (T1). GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI scales were selected to assess the quality of emotion and sleep among prisoners (N=803). Three subjective questions were asked to evaluate prisoners' personal feelings on the COVID-19. Paired Samples T-test, Binary, and Multivariate Logistic Stepwise Regression were used to analyze the data. GAD-7 scores decreased at T1 (P&lt;0.001). For the prisoners without anxiety at T0 (n=480), GAD-7's mean value at T1 raised (P&lt;0.001), whereas the mean value decreased (P&lt;0.001) for the prisoners with anxiety at T0 (n=323). For the prisoners without anxiety, shorter years of education (OR=0.843), COVID-19 (OR=4.936), severer depression at T1 (OR=1.683), and severer insomnia at T1 (OR=1.134) were associated with the new onset of anxiety. For the prisoners with anxiety, anxiety was alleviated in 71.2% and exacerbated in 10.5% at T1. For the alleviators, severer depression at T1 (OR=0.667) and COVID-19 (OR=0.258) were associated with anxiety unrelief; severer anxiety at T0 (OR=1.343) was associated with anxiety alleviation. For the exacerbators, severer anxiety at T0 (OR=0.517) was associated with anxiety unaggravation; severer depression at T1 (OR=1.196), COVID-19 (OR=22.882), and severer depression at T0 (OR=1.181) were associated with anxiety exacerbation. At the outbreak of COVID-19, prisoners' anxiety was reduced. The main factor was the baseline anxiety levels. That may be related to prison management and the Downward Social Comparison.

"Intersecting epidemics: the impact of COVID-19 on the HIV prevention and care continua in the United States","To summarize the broad impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on HIV prevention and care in the United States with a focus on the status-neutral HIV care continuum. We conducted an editorial review of peer-reviewed literature on the topics of HIV-risk behaviors, sexually transmitted illness (STI) and HIV prevalence, HIV prevention and treatment trends, and evolving practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. For relevant literature, we reviewed, summarized, and categorized into themes that span the HIV prevention and care continua, including sexual risk behaviors, mental health, and substance use. We identified important changes within each component of the HIV care continuum across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifts in prevention practices, engagement with care, care provision, medication adherence, testing, and prevalence rates were observed during the pandemic. Although heightened disparities for people at risk for, and living with, HIV were seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, many health systems and clinics have achieved and maintained engagement in HIV prevention and care. This review highlights barriers and innovative solutions that can support durable and accessible health systems through future public health crises.","Spears, Taylor, Liu, Levy, Eaton","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000003305","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33199,""

"Psychological Capital, Well-being, and Distress of International Students","International students continue to experience myriad of challenges, some of which further transpired disproportionately during the COVID-19 pandemic era. To this effect, this study investigated psychological capital (PsyCap), psychological distress, and well-being among 188 international students attending U.S universities. Results using Hayes PROCESS indicated that well-being mediated the relationship between PsyCap and psychological distress and in particular moderated the relationship between PsyCap and depression. When higher education institutions are considering steps to mitigate psychological distress experienced by international students during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, based on the findings of our study, we suggest investing efforts and resources into two aspects: (a) promotion of positive mental health and well-being and (b) identification and development of positive psychological capital.

"The impact of screen time changes on anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: sleep and physical activity as mediators","Under the burden caused by COVID-19 and rapid lifestyle changes, many people increased their screen time due to psychological needs and social requirements. The current study investigated the <b>relationship</b> between screen time changes and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic of COVID-19. Furthermore, we examined whether sleep and physical activity would mediate the association between screen time changes and anxiety. The self-developed questionnaire was delivered online to collect people's changes in anxiety, sleep patterns, and screen time during COVID-19. 970 participants (74.4% female) with an average age of 23Ã‚Â years were involved in this study. After adjusting demographic variables, the ordinal logistic regression analyses revealed that a significant increase in screen time was linked with anxiety. Slightly increased screen time,Ã‚Â slightly and significantly decreased screen time did not predict anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. The level of anxiety was significantly higher among respondents who reported decreased sleep quality. Sleep quality directly mediated the association between screen time changes and anxiety, while sleep latency did not. The longer sleep latency caused by increased screen time would amplify anxiety by affecting sleep quality. In addition, the relationship between screen time changes and anxiety was also mediated by physical activity. We concluded that the fluctuation of screen time in a modest range does not affect the anxiety level substantially. The significantly increased screen time would contribute to poor sleep (including longer sleep latency and worse sleep quality) and lack of physical activity, which would lead to higher levels of anxiety.","Chen, Dai, Li, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-022-00398-1","20220622","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Physical activity; Screen time changes; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33202,""
"The influence of lifestyles to cope with stress over mental health in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic affected daily life routines and lifestyles of pregnant and postpartum women and increased their stress and risk of suffering from mental health problems. The aim of this study was to analyse which sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 exposure variables and lifestyles to cope with stress variables predicted anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design was performed with a sample of 3356 Spanish women participating in the Riseup-PPD-COVID-19 study. These participants completed an online survey composed of measures of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (EPDS), and PTSD related to COVID-19 (Checklist DSM-5), as well as demographics, exposure to COVID-19, and lifestyles to cope with stress. Regarding results, 47.2% showed depression and a third reported anxiety, whereas moderate scores were observed in PTSD symptoms. The most commonly used strategies to cope with stress in the COVID-19 pandemic were talking with friends and family and increasing time with social networks. Better results in mental health were associated with coping strategies such as talking with family and friends or participating in family activities, physical activity, sleeping well at night, eating healthier, and increasing personal care. Furthermore, poor results in mental health were observed in those participants who increased time with screens, ate fast food, reported substance use, and talked more frequently with health professionals. More symptoms were also observed in younger women, primiparous women, and those who reported more exposure to COVID-19.

This study aimed to identify factors influencing suicidal tendencies and the mental health status of multicultural adolescents in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 784 multicultural adolescents (Korean fathers and foreign mothers) who participated in the 16th national Korean Youth Risk Behaviour online survey. Research variables were measured using self-reported questionnaires for mental health and suicidal tendencies. Data was analysed using SPSS 26.0 program. The factors influencing suicidal tendencies (contemplating suicide, suicidal plans, and suicide attempts) were sexual intercourse experience (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.67, 5.04, 7.10), depressive mood (aOR 1.03, 0.98, 0.97, 0.90), and unhappiness (aOR 13.00, 7.28, 5.56). In conclusion, the factors that affect suicidal tendencies showed sexual intercourse experience, depressive mood and unhappiness. Screening for suicidal tendencies and suicide prevention programs that consider the significant factors that affect suicidal tendencies should be developed for multicultural adolescents.

"How are the youth? A brief-longitudinal study on symptoms, alexithymia and expressive suppression among Italian adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic","Studies documented the negative consequences on adolescents' mental health of the stay-at-home measures adopted in reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, few contributions focused on the psychopathological trajectories after the end of these stressful measures or investigated the moderating role of this context in the relationship linking psychological symptoms with emotion regulation. This brief longitudinal study was performed with two measurement times: during the severe lockdown (T1), and when the restrictive measures were relaxed (T2). Ninety-three community adolescents (45% boys; M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.94Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.64) completed the Youth Self Report, the Social Media Disorder Scale, the Binge Eating Scale, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 items. Except for binge eating and externalising symptoms, all variables significantly decreased between T1 and T2. The relationship between expressive suppression and binge eating scores significantly decreased across time whereas the link between alexithymia and internalising symptoms increased with time. The study supported the idea that low-risk adolescents experienced psychological relief from the relaxation of stay-at-home measures.

"Simulation to minimise patient self-inflicted lung injury: are we almost there?","Computational modelling has been used to enlighten pathophysiological issues in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using a sophisticated, integrated cardiopulmonary model. COVID-19 ARDS is a pathophysiologically distinct entity characterised by dissociation between impairment in gas exchange and respiratory system mechanics, especially in the early stages of ARDS. Weaver and colleagues used computational modelling to elucidate factors contributing to generation of patient self-inflicted lung injury, and evaluated the effects of various spontaneous respiratory efforts with different oxygenation and ventilatory support modes. Their findings indicate that mechanical forces generated in the lung parenchyma are only counterbalanced when the respiratory support mode reduces the intensity of respiratory efforts.","Tsolaki, Zakynthinos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2022.05.007","20220621","ARDS; COVID-19; computational modelling; lung injury; patient self-inflicted lung injury; simulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","",33207,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with insomnia symptoms in adolescents and young adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly distressing for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer. High levels of distress are associated with sleep disturbances. This study examined the prevalence of insomnia symptoms in AYAs during the COVID-19 pandemic and identified factors related to greater insomnia severity. An online survey was administered to Canadian AYAs (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 805) diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years from January to February 2021. The primary measure was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Univariable and multivariable binomial logistic regression examined demographic, clinical, and psychological factors associated with significant insomnia symptoms (ISI score Ã¢â€°Â¥12). Three hundred twelve (38.8%) participants reported insomnia symptoms. In the multivariable model, severe psychological distress (ie, depression and anxiety; adjusted odds ratio (AOR)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 28.75, p Ã¢â€°Â¤.001), having a pre-existing mental health condition (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.92, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03), worsened mental health during the pandemic (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.73, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .02), finished cancer treatment Ã¢â€°Â¥1 year ago (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.72, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03), and experiencing no changes to schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.18, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004) were associated with significant insomnia symptoms. Standardized coefficients also indicated that worrying about possible disruptions to cancer care and being a homemaker/caretaker contributed to insomnia symptoms.
