"Burden of Food Insecurity and Mental Health Symptoms among Adults with Cardiometabolic Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Our study objectives were to (1) identify the national prevalence and patterns of food insecurity among adults with and without a history of CMCs and (2) determine associations between food insecurity and mental health outcomes among adults with CMCs during the early COVID-19 pandemic period (April&ndash;June 2020). We computed prevalence ratios with Poisson regression using the robust estimation of standard errors to identify disparities in the report of food insecurity across demographic groups and by CMC history. Among adults with CMCs, we estimated associations between food insecurity and self-reported mental health symptoms using multinomial logistic regression. Overall, people with CMCs were more likely to be older, White, without employment in the past 7 days, and from the South or an urban environment. We found that the determinants of food insecurity among individuals with cardiometabolic conditions include having: &lt;60 years of age, female sex, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, an educational degree lower than a baccalaureate, a household income of &lt;$100,000, and either Medicaid, Indian Health Insurance, or no insurance. Individuals with CMCs and food insecurity also had significantly higher odds of adverse mental health symptoms. The continued clinical screening of food insecurity and mental health, as well as public health interventions, targeted toward individuals with CMCs, should be prioritized as we move through the COVID-19 pandemic.","Camacho-Rivera, Marlene, Albury, Jonathan, Chen, Karen, Ye, Zachary, Islam, Jessica Y.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610077","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):10077, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36593,""
"Use of Health Services and Support Resources by Immediate Family Members Bereaved by Suicide: A Scoping Review","The knowledge on health service use, systematic follow-up, and support for families bereaved by suicide remains scarce. This scoping review includes studies from 2010 to March 2022 that investigate the follow-up and support offered by health services, peer support services, and other resources available (e.g., internet-based resources) for families bereaved by suicide. We followed the scoping review framework provided by the Johanna Briggs Institute and performed a double-blinded screening process using Covidence. Data were extracted by four researchers and a thematic analysis was performed to summarize the results. The PRISMA Extension for Scoping reviews was used for reporting results. Of 2385 studies screened by title, 190 by , and 93 by full-text reading, we included 63 original articles of which 24, 29 and 10 were quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies, respectively. The review shows that we have some knowledge about the need for, and experiences with, health services and support resources for immediate family members bereaved by suicide, but a lack of knowledge about their help-seeking behaviour, patient pathways, systematic follow-up, coordination between services, and long-term outcomes. We need more longitudinal observational studies of health service use and patient trajectories for people bereaved by suicide.","Kaspersen, Silje L.; Kalseth, Jorid, Stene-Larsen, Kim, Reneflot, Anne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610016","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):10016, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36594,""
"Post-Traumatic Growth and Resilience among Hospitalized COVID-19 Survivors: A Gendered Analysis","The literature on behavioral outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is inundated with mental health burdens such as depression and stress disorders. The current study investigated gender invariance on resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) as positive psychological changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 381 survivors of the COVID-19 infection completed measurements of resilience, PTG, violence and stigma experience, and mental health problems like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, multivariate regression, and a latent profile analysis. The results revealed that more than half of the participants had high scores on resilience (53.6%) and PTG (60.9%). The positive psychological changes, although independent of each other, were moderated by gender, and influenced by the negative experiences of participants such as stigma, violence, and PTSD. Latent profile analyses revealed three classes of participants, two of which were characterized by high scores on mental health problems and PTG. The clusters were invariant across gender. Surviving COVID-19 contributed to resilience and PTG. These can be targeted for intervention programs to mitigate the mental health burden occasioned by the pandemic.","Adjorlolo, Samuel, Adjorlolo, Paul, Andoh-Arthur, Johnny, Ahiable, Emmanuel Kwadzo, Kretchy, Irene Akwo, Osafo, Joseph","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610014","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):10014, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36595,""
"Hoping for a Better Future during COVID-19: How Migration Plans Are Protective of Depressive Symptoms for Haitian Migrants Living in Chile","This paper explores the migration experiences, perceived COVID-19 impacts, and depression symptoms among Haitian migrants living in Santiago, Chile. Ninety-five participants from eight neighborhoods with a high density of Haitian migrants were recruited. Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis were conducted. Chi-squared tests were used to confirm univariate results. We found that 22% of participants had major depressive symptoms based on the CESD-R-20 scale, 87% reported major life changes due to COVID-19, and 78% said their migration plans had changed due to the pandemic. Factors associated with more depressive symptoms were being in debt (OR = 3.43) and experiencing discrimination (ORs: 0.60 to 6.19). Factors associated with less odds of depressive symptoms were social support (ORs: 0.06 to 0.25), change in migration plans due to COVID-19 (OR = 0.30), and planning to leave Chile (OR = 0.20). After accounting for relevant factors, planning to leave Chile is significantly predictive of fewer symptoms of depression. Haitian migrants living in Chile had a high prevalence of depression. Planning to leave Chile was a significant protector against depressive symptoms. Future studies should explore how nuanced experiences of uncertainty play out in migrants' lives, mental well-being, and planning for their future.","Chen, Yijing, Rafful, Claudia, Mercado, Mercedes, Carte, Lindsey, Morales-Miranda, Sonia, Cheristil, Judeline, Rocha-JimÃ©nez, Teresita","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169977","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9977, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36596,""
"The Use of Social Media in Children and Adolescents: Scoping Review on the Potential Risks","In recent years, social media has become part of our lives, even among children. From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic period, media device and Internet access rapidly increased. Adolescents connected Internet alone, consulting social media, mostly Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. During 'lockdown';, the Internet usage allowed communication with peers and the continuity activities such as school teaching. However, we have to keep in mind that media usage may be related to some adverse consequences especially in the most vulnerable people, such as the young. Aim of the review is to focus on risks correlated to social media use by children and adolescents, identifying spies of rising problems and engaging in preventive recommendations. The scoping review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, searching on PubMed the terms 'social media';or 'social network';, 'health';, and 'pediatrics';. Excluding articles not pertinent, we found 68 reports. Out of them, 19 were dealing with depression, 15 with diet, and 15 with psychological problems, which appeared to be the most reported risk of social media use. Other identified associated problems were sleep, addiction, anxiety, sex related issues, behavioral problems, body image, physical activity, online grooming, sight, headache, and dental caries. Public and medical awareness must rise over this topic and new prevention measures must be found, starting with health practitioners, caregivers, and websites/application developers. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks associated to a problematic social media use for the young's health and identify sentinel signs in children as well as prevent negative outcomes in accordance with the family.","Bozzola, Elena, Spina, Giulia, Agostiniani, Rino, Barni, Sarah, Russo, Rocco, Scarpato, Elena, Di Mauro, Antonio, Di Stefano, Antonella Vita, Caruso, Cinthia, Corsello, Giovanni, Staiano, Annamaria","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169960","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9960, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36597,""
"Fear of COVID-19 Impact on Professional Quality of Life among Mental Health Workers","Several studies have examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health, but only a few have investigated its detrimental effect on the mental well-being of mental health workers (MHWs). Background: The current study aimed to explore the effect of the fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19) on professional quality of life dimensions, namely compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO), and secondary traumatic stress (STS) in MHWs above and beyond sociodemographic and professional factors. Methods: Hierarchical linear regression models were employed to examine the relationship of extreme FCV-19 with CS, BO, and STS in MHWs (n = 224), after considering sociodemographic variables as potential confounding factors. Extreme FCV-19 was operationalized as a binary variable with a cut-off score of &ge;16.5 considered as extreme fear. Results: We found that extreme FCV-19 in MHWs is linked with increased compassion fatigue (BO and STS), and this relationship is exacerbated by younger age in regard to BO and by female gender concerning STS. CS remains unaffected by severe FCV-19, and it is higher in older participants. Conclusion: Organizational support is required to protect MHWs' mental well-being and ensure the quality of care they provide during prolonged crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures that intensify a sense of safety, protection, and control against COVID-19 infections in mental health services should be included in the recommendations that may reduce BO and STS among MHWs.","Stefanatou, Pentagiotissa, Xenaki, Lida-Alkisti, Karagiorgas, Ioannis, Ntigrintaki, Angeliki-Aikaterini, Giannouli, Eleni, Malogiannis, Ioannis A.; Konstantakopoulos, George","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169949","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9949, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36598,""
"The Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on PHQ Depression Screening Scores for High School Athletes","Adolescent behavioral health was in crisis before COVID-19. The shutdown and reopening of in-person learning and extracurricular activities may have worsened this crisis. We examined high school athletes' depression before and during the pandemic. Data were collected as part of a pilot program incorporating Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) screenings during high school sports physicals before the COVID-19 lockdown and three timepoints after. Statistical comparisons were made using logistic regression. A total of 927 individual scores were analyzed: 385 from spring 2020;145 from fall 2020;163 from fall 2021;and 234 from spring 2022. Fall 2020 students were 3.7 times more likely to have elevated PHQ-2 scores than spring 2020 students (95% CI = 1.8, 7.6). Fall 2021 and spring 2022 scores did not differ significantly from pre-pandemic, although trends of elevated scores persisted (OR = 1.6;95% CI = 0.7, 3.5, and OR = 1.2;95% CI = 0.6, 2.4, respectively). A significant difference in PHQ-9 depression severity classification was detected over time (p &lt; 0.01). Elevated PHQ scores were found after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Depression, Anxiety and Quality of Life among Online Responders in Poland: A Cross-Sectional Study Covering Four Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the population. This study aims to assess the prevalence of subjective depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as assess the quality of life in different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic based on an online survey. Methods: The study was conducted based on an original and anonymous questionnaire, consisting of a section assessing sociodemographic status and psychometric tools: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). A total of 6739 people participated in the survey, with the largest number from the first wave of the pandemic (2467-36.6%), followed by 1627 (24.1%) for the second wave, 1696 (25.2%) for wave three and 949 (14.1%) for wave four. The mean age of the study group was 28.19 &plusmn;9.94. Results: There was an initial, gradual increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms over the three waves. There were no significant differences in the quality-of-life scores, except for the second and third waves (&minus;0.0846;p = 0.013. It was found that women, residents of big cities and people with psychiatric history showed higher BDI and GAD-7 scores. Conclusions: The impact of the pandemic on mental health was not homogeneous, with the first three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic having more of an impact compared to the fourth wave. Female respondents' sex, history of mental disease and reduced earning capacity exacerbated psychiatric symptoms.","Babicki, Mateusz, Bogudzinska, Bogna, Kowalski, Krzysztof, Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169934","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9934, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36600,""
"Research and Innovation for and with Adolescent Young Carers to Influence Policy and Practice-The European Union Funded 'ME-WE';Project","Young carers are children and adolescents who provide care to other family members or friends, taking over responsibilities that are usually associated with adulthood. There is emerging but still scarce knowledge worldwide about the phenomenon of young carers and the impact of a caring role on their health, social and personal development spheres. This paper provides an overview of the main results from the ME-WE project, which is the first European research and innovation project dedicated to adolescent young carers (AYCs) (15&ndash;17 years). The project methods relied on three main activities: (1) a systematization of knowledge (by means of a survey to AYCs, country case studies, Delphi study, literature review);(2) the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a primary prevention intervention addressing AYCs' mental health (by means of Blended Learning Networks and a clinical trial in six European countries);(3) the implementation of knowledge translation actions for dissemination, awareness, advocacy and lobbying (by means of national and international stakeholder networks, as well as traditional and new media). Project results substantially contributed to a better understanding of AYCs' conditions, needs and preferences, defined tailored support intervention (resilient to COVID-19 related restrictions), and significant improvements in national and European policies for AYCs.","Hanson, Elizabeth, Barbabella, Francesco, Magnusson, Lennart, Brolin, Rosita, Svensson, Miriam, Yghemonos, Stecy, Hlebec, Valentina, Bolko, Irena, Boccaletti, Licia, Casu, Giulia, Hoefman, Renske, de Boer, Alice H.; de Roos, Simone, Santini, Sara, Socci, Marco, Dâ€™Amen, Barbara, Van Zoest, Frans, de Jong, Nynke, Nap, Henk Herman, de Jong, Yvonne, Bouwman, Tamara, Lewis, Feylyn, Parkhouse, Tom, Leu, Agnes, Phelps, Daniel, Guggiari, Elena, Morgan, Vicky, Centola, Francesca, Joseph, Stephen, Becker, Saul","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169932","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9932, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36601,""
"Effects of Pre-Existing Mental Conditions on Fatigue and Psychological Symptoms Post-COVID-19","Background: Patients who are post-COVID-19 will require more treatment soon. Therefore, it is important to understand the root cause of their psychological and somatic conditions. Previous studies showed contradictory results on the influence of pre-existing mental conditions. The present study examines the influence of these pre-existing conditions and their pre-treatment on the severity of post-COVID-19 symptoms. Methods: This analysis employs questionnaire data from a large study sample in Germany. Overall, 801 participants were included. All participants rated their health status on a scale from 0 to 100. Fatigue, depression, and anxiety were measured using the FAS, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 scales. Results: All pre-pandemic values showed no significant differences between the groups. The current health status was rated similarly by the recovered patients (&mu;= 80.5 &plusmn;17.0) and the control group (&mu;= 81.2 &plusmn;18.0) but significantly worse by acutely infected (&mu;= 59.0 &plusmn;21.5) and post-COVID-19 patients (&mu;= 54.2 &plusmn;21.1). Fatigue, depression, and anxiety were similar for recovered patients and the control group. By contrast, there were significant differences between the control and the post-COVID-19 groups concerning fatigue (45.9% vs. 93.1%), depression (19.3% vs. 53.8%), and anxiety (19.3% vs. 22.3%).

"Association between Sleep Quality and Depression Symptoms in Chinese College Students during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period","Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has seriously threatened the health of people around the world. To prevent the spread of the epidemic, Chinese universities have implemented closed management of campuses. The implementation of restrictive measures has gradually caused changes in the quality of sleep and the psychological state of college students. In addition, college students are faced with the dual pressure of employment and study, and the psychological pressure is huge. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate sleep and depressive symptoms among college students. Methods: Using the method of stratified cluster sampling, 6695 college students were selected from three universities in Jiangxi, Anhui, and Xinjiang provinces from April to May 2022. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) were used for the survey. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the PSQI and the SDS. Results: Overall, during the outbreak of COVID-19, 69.0% of males and 73.5% of females had poor sleep quality among Chinese college students and the detection rate of depressive symptoms was 43.6% for males and 47.8% for females, respectively. Taking students with good sleep quality as references, after controlling for covariates, hierarchical logistic regression shows that Chinese college students with poor sleep quality have a higher OR value (OR = 12.0, 95%CI: 10.2~14.1, p &lt; 0.001), especially in males (OR = 43.8, 95%CI:30.2~63.6, p &lt; 0.001). For both males and females, the OR value of college students with the following characteristics was higher: rural college students (males, OR = 50.32, 95%CI: 32.50&ndash;77.93;females, OR = 8.03, 95%CI: 6.45&ndash;9.99), overweight college students (males, OR = 62.17, 95%CI: 19.47&ndash;198.53;females, OR = 16.67, 95%CI: 6.48&ndash;42.88), and college students drinking sugar-sweetened beverages (males, OR = 59.00, 95%CI: 36.96&ndash;94.18;females, OR = 8.16, 95%CI: 6.63&ndash;10.05) (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality is associated with depressive symptoms among Chinese college students, especially college males.

"Prevalence of Musculoskeletal Post-COVID Pain in Hospitalized COVID-19 Survivors Depending on Infection with the Historical, Alpha or Delta SARS-CoV-2 Variant","We compared the prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain between previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors infected with the historical, Alpha or Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Data about musculoskeletal post-COVID pain were systematically collected through a telephone interview involving 201 patients who had survived the historical variant, 211 who had survived the Alpha variant and 202 who had survived the Delta variant six months after hospital discharge. Participants were recruited from non-vaccinated individuals hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in one hospital of Madrid (Spain) during three different waves of the pandemic (historical, Alpha or Delta variant). Hospitalization and clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. In addition, anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were also assessed. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain was higher (p = 0.003) in patients infected with the historical variant (47.7%) than in those infected with the Alpha (38.3%) or Delta (41%) variants. A significantly (p = 0.002) higher proportion of individuals infected with the historical variant reported generalized pain (20.5%) when compared with those infected with the other variants. The prevalence of new-onset post-COVID musculoskeletal pain reached 80.1%, 75.2% and 79.5% of patients infected with the historical, Alpha or Delta variants, respectively. No specific risk factors for developing post-COVID pain were identified depending on the SARS-CoV-2 variant. In conclusion, this study found that musculoskeletal post-COVID pain is highly prevalent in COVID-19 survivors six months after hospital discharge, with the highest prevalence and most generalized pain symptoms in individuals infected with the historical variant.

"Meeting 24 h Movement Guidelines and Health-Related Quality of Life in Youths during the COVID-19 Lockdown","Limitations in the use of public spaces have impacted the frequency and duration of movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep) and outdoor activities of children and adolescents. Whether pandemic-induced changes in movement behaviours are related to the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children and adolescents is unknown. The aim of the current study was to examine the association between meeting 24 h movement guidelines and HRQoL during the COVID-19 lockdown among children and adolescents. Data from 1099 3&ndash;17-year-old children and adolescents from Spain and Brazil were analysed. An online questionnaire was used to collect parent-reported information concerning physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration. For the assessment of HRQoL, the EQ-5D-Y proxy version was used. The highest prevalence of reported problems was related to the 'worries/sadness/unhappiness' factor, where 36.3% of participants declared to have at least 'some problems'. Participants meeting the 24 h guidelines had a higher HRQoL score compared with those who did not (91.9 &plusmn;2.5 vs. 84.3 &plusmn;0.5, respectively;p &lt; 0.05). The current study shows that children and adolescents that met 24 h movement guidelines presented a higher HRQoL during the COVID-19 lockdown, providing support for the promotion of healthy movement behaviours-especially during a pandemic.","LÃ³pez-Gil, JosÃ© Francisco, Tremblay, Mark S.; Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ãngel, TÃ¡rraga-LÃ³pez, Pedro Juan, Brazo-Sayavera, Javier","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12168056","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 12(16):8056, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36605,""
"Basic needs support and achievement emotions in daily research of life scientists considering academic positions","Emotions are a crucial factor in daily research of academic staff and, accordingly, affect scientific progress. Already before but especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the strong connection between working conditions and work-related emotional states as antecedents for mental health of academic staff gained more and more attention. However, in depths investigations of researchers' emotions in academia are still rare. In the highly competitive field of academia, experiencing the working environments as supportive may be an important influential factor for researchers' emotions. On a structural level, academic positions may also be tied to different emotional experiences. Taking a Self-Determination Theory approach, we therefore investigate, whether a basic need-supportive environment (regarding perceived competence and autonomy support, and social relatedness to the scientific community) and the academic position (research assistants without leading responsibility and principle investigators with leading responsibility) predict activity-related achievement emotions (enjoyment, anger, frustration, and boredom) during daily research activities. However, measurements on basic needs support and achievement emotions tailored to the specific academic research context are lacking. Therefore, this study is aimed at developing fitted scales on these constructs. In a cross-sectional survey, we questioned N = 250 life scientists in 13 German universities. Results of multiple linear regression analyses suggest that supportive environments in academia were positively associated to the level of experienced enjoyment and negatively to the level of experienced frustration. Surprisingly, social relatedness to the scientific community does not affect frustration. Principle investigators report a more favorable emotional pattern with higher levels of enjoyment than research assistants. However, the level of experienced frustration was not affected by the academic position. The scales on anger and boredom seemed not to differentiate emotional experiences on these two negative achievement emotions in the research context accurately. Therefore, we needed to exclude anger and boredom from analyzes. Further research on these achievement emotions is needed. We discuss our findings on enjoyment and frustration and derive both theoretical and practical implications, taking an international and interdisciplinary perspective.","Meuleners, J. S.; Neuhaus, B.

"Post-COVID symptoms and health-related quality of life in extended postpartum period","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has remarkable effect not just on physical health, but also on psychological state and overall quality of life (QoL). It affected all the section of community including vulnerable section of pregnant females and children. Aims and Objective: The aim of the study was to assess health-related QoL in recovered COVID-19 positive pregnant females in their extended postpartum period along with insight into prevailing post-COVID symptoms in this population. This was a cross-sectional and questionnaire-based study conducted in Kota, Rajasthan, India. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 173 admitted females between March 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 who were pregnant and contacted COVID-19 infection at any point of their antenatal/intrapartum period. The questionnaire included details related to demographics, symptomatology, hospitalization, oxygen requirement, and ventilator use during the acute disease as well as any symptoms after recovery from acute COVID-19 disease. Patients were contacted during their extended postpartum period and systematically asked about a list of post-COVID-19 symptoms (dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, chest pain, cough, mood disturbances, etc.), but they were also free to report any other symptoms that they considered relevant. The health-related QoL was evaluated using the EuroQoL five-dimension five-level questionnaire telephone interview version. In-person interview and telephonic interview methods were arranged for collection of data. Descriptive statistical analysis was done. Results: Among the 173 consented participants, the mean age was 26.3 (Â±6.6) years, most of them were primiparous (45.66%), admitted with gestational age between 37 and 40 weeks (68.21%), asymptomatic (85.54%) or mildly symptomatic. For symptomatic cases, the most common clinical presentations included fever, cough, and dyspnea. Only 1.16% of symptomatic subjects required ventilator support. For 58.96% patients, hospital stay was less than a week. Mean duration of stay was 5.86 days. However, 87.28% patients required antiviral medications. About 23.70% have various comorbidities among which anemia 7.51% and preeclampsia 6.35% predominated. About 85.55% did not experienced any persistent symptoms after discharge but some of the subjects shown persistent symptoms such as cough, fever, and breathlessness among which persistent cough predominates (7.51%). In relation to post-COVID effects, 82.56% were found asymptomatic while rest 17.44% showed effects such as body ache, insomnia, cough, and loss of taste and smell and depression. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic left its sequels both in the form of physical as well as psychological symptoms in extended postpartum period although health-related QoL does not significantly affected by COVID-19 disease during this period.

"Perceived stress during social isolation due to COVID-19 and cognitive impact on young university students","The long-lasting and uncontrollable nature of confinement as a measure to slow down the spread of COVID-19 represents a source of extrinsic and chronic stress that could affect cognitive processes, especially memory. The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of perceived stress during compulsory social isolation due to COVID-19 on daily memory and to explore the emotional impact of confinement. Participants were 128 young Colombian university students, who answered the Spanish version of the Perceived Stress Scale (EEP-10) and the Questionnaire on memory failures of daily life, according to their experience in the last month of confinement. The influence of global perceived stress, general distress and coping ability on memory lapses in daily life was analyzed using a factorial variance analysis. Participants reported emotions and thoughts associated with states of anxiety, depression, and stress during confinement. A significant effect of perceived stress on daily life memory failures was found, and a significant interaction between general distress and coping ability on everyday memory. These findings are in addition to those reported in previous studies on the negative impact of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. The association found between perceived stress and subjective memory complaints in university students may have repercussions in the educational field that must be studied in depth, considering the influence of coping capacity on cognitive performance in stressful situations.","Gutierrez-Ruiz, K.; Perez, I.

"The Trauma of COVID-19â€“Fueled Discrimination: Posttraumatic Stress in Asian American Adolescents","With the emergence of COVID-19 in China, East and Southeast Asian American (ESEAA) students have reported increased incidents of COVID-19â€“fueled discrimination in online and offline (in-person) settings. Given the recency of this situation, there is a scarcity of research investigating the impact of COVID-19â€“related discrimination on ESEAA adolescents' mental health, especially posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the current study, therefore, we provide evidence regarding the relations of COVID-19â€“fueled online and offline discrimination to PTSD symptoms in a sample of ESEAA high school students. We discuss study limitations;future recommendations;and implications for school leaders, school counselors, and other educators.

"""We Are the Heartbeat of the School"": How School Counselors Supported Student Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to online learning exacerbated the mental health needs of children and adolescents, especially among minoritized students who were disproportionately impacted by the virus. Although the pandemic has increased the demand for counseling, research finds that school counselors are often hindered by organizational constraints. Using organizational role theory, this study examined school counselors' perceptions of their role delivering mental health supports during the pandemic. Findings indicate that school counselors reported an increased need for counseling, but faced multiple barriers to supporting students, leaving those who most needed the support particularly vulnerable.

"A qualitative analysis of coping with genetically exacerbated risk of breast and ovarian cancers among medically-underserved women with BRCA1/2 mutations","Individuals testing positive for BRCA1/2 genetic mutations, or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer mutations, are 33-55% more likely than women without these mutations to develop breast and/or ovarian cancers before the age of 70. While research involving these genetic mutations continues to emerge, there remains unanswered questions regarding prophylactic experiences and subsequent impacts on mental health within subgroups of BRCA1/2-positive women. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the impact of BRCA1/2 mutations, prophylactic surgeries, and surveillance regimens within the scope of everyday life within a sample of BRCA1/2 positive women from medically-underserved backgrounds living in the United States (US). A sample of 211 US adult women who have tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutations within the past 5 years and who identify with one or more medically-underserved populations (racial, ethnic, or sexual minority, person with a physical disability, chronically-ill, those in poverty, immigrant populations) elucidated compelling qualitative data. A total of 169 (80.1%) women completed open-ended questions at the end of the online survey. Thematic analysis was utilized to identify themes and subthemes concerning mental health, sources of stress, and methods of stress relief. The focus of the current analysis is on the sources of stress identified by the respondents. Fourteen subthemes were identified. The four most common stressors were concerns about post-treatment recovery (19% of respondents), recurrence of a new cancer (15%), medical unknown of having a genetic mutation that increases the risk of cancer (14%), and having to schedule and plan for continual surveillance (12%). The next five subthemes ranged from 7-9% and include waiting for medical results, personal finances and covering medical expenses, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-operative anxiety, and worrying about insurance coverage. Our findings support previous research on cancer stressors for women while adding important qualitative elements for a richer understanding. Furthermore, since much of the research on the lived experiences of BRCA1/2 has been on highly-educated, non-Hispanic white women, few studies have focused entirely on medically-underserved populations, which was the entirety of our sample. This work adds an important intersectional lens in which to better understand the experiences of living with a BRCA1/2 mutation.","Tredway, K.; Dibble, K. E.; Connor, A.

"Diet and supplement use changes among male cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of cancer survivors who may be at higher risk than people without cancer of other adverse health outcomes. For many individuals, a cancer diagnosis leads to lower physical activity and change in mental health status. Modifiable health behaviors, such as consumption of a healthy diet, can positively affect cancer survivorship outcomes. Aim: To investigate the individual-level changes in diet and supplement use among male cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared to men without cancer. Methods: Participants of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, enrolled since 1986, were asked to self-report health behaviors during the pandemic on three web-based questionnaires administered during the COVID-19 pandemic (baseline COVID: October 2020, first follow-up: January 2021, second follow-up: April 2021). Diet and supplement use were analyzed descriptively between cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer. Further, outcomes were dichotomized to reflect whether a change was healthful or unchanged/unhealthful;for example, lower fast food consumption was classified as a healthful change. To assess the associations between cancer survivors and other men, logistic regression was used, adjusting for age, race, pre-pandemic body mass index, pre-pandemic physical activity, and other health information. Results: Of 4,416 men who completed the baseline COVID-19 questionnaire, 962 were cancer survivors (after excluding those with non-melanoma skin cancer). Across all eligible men (median age: 78 years), there were considerable proportions of men engaging in healthful changes following the start of the pandemic in intake of fast food (19% decreased), sugary drinks (14% decreased), fresh fruit (26% increased), fresh vegetables (19% increased), fish (13% increased), and red meat (12% decreased) consumption. Similar changes in diet were reported on the second follow-up questionnaire. For most foods, a similar percentage of cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer increased healthy eating. Findings from multivariable logistic regression models were reflective of higher odds of cancer survivors to engage in a healthful diet change for unhealthy food categories (i.e., less fast food, less frozen food), though none of which were statistically significant. There was little change in supplement use during the pandemic, except for 6% who started use of vitamin D supplements between the baseline and first follow-up questionnaire. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that older men engaged in healthful diet changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, without noticeable differences among cancer survivors.","Shreves, A. H.; McGrath, C.

"Mental health of children with and without special healthcare needs and of their caregivers during COVID-19: A cross-sectional study","Objective To describe mental health outcomes and measures of pandemic burden of children with and without special healthcare needs, and their caregivers following the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Design This is the second of a sequential series of cross-sectional online surveys conducted among caregivers of children =18 years since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, administrated between 2 April 2021 and 31 July 2021. Main outcome measures Child and parental mental health were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and WHO-5 Well-being index. Children with Special Healthcare Needs (CSHCN) were identified using the CSHCN-Screener. Descriptive statistics, linear and hierarchical logistic regression modelling assessed associations between parent-reported child mental health problems and measures of pandemic burden, disease complexity, caregiver mental well-being and socioeconomic status. Results 521 participants were included in the final sample. There was a high prevalence of parent-reported mental health problems in n=302 (66.7%) children, particularly in CSHCN. Among caregivers, n=372 (72.5%) screened positive for depression. Logistic regression modelling showed a strong association of child mental health problems and disease complexity, parental mental well-being, increase in family conflict and inadequate social support. Conclusions Our study identifies CSHCN as a particularly vulnerable group in terms of mental health outcomes. Psychosocial factors were important predictors of parent-reported child mental health problems. Policy measures should consider the importance of social support systems for vulnerable children and their families, and aim to provide accessible mental health support for caregivers.","Geweniger, A.; Haddad, A.; Barth, M.; HÃ¶gl, H.; Mund, A.; Insan, S.; Langer, T.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001509","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 6(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36615,""
"Impact of academic stress by parent-proxy on parents' learning-support-services: a moderated-mediation model of health anxiety by parents' educational level","Purpose This study focused on parents' health anxiety by proxy about their children when they started learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore the impact of academic stress by parent-proxy on parents' learning support services with the mediating role of health anxiety by parent-proxy and the moderating role of parental educational level. Design/methodology/approach In total, 8,940 primary school students' parents participated in the study. Bootstrapping was performed to test the constructed model. Findings (1) Academic stress by parent-proxy positively predicted health anxiety by parent-proxy. (2) Health anxiety by parent-proxy significantly positively predicted learning support services. (3) Academic stress by parent-proxy also significantly positively predicted learning support services. (4) Academic stress by parent-proxy positively predicted parents' learning support services through the mediating effect of health anxiety by parent-proxy. (5) Parental educational level moderated the relationship between academic stress by parent-proxy, health anxiety by parent-proxy, and learning support services. Academics and parents will benefit from the conclusions of this study in both theory and practice. Originality/value During the COVID-19 pandemic, offline learning has been replaced with online learning, which has brought with it many physical and mental health problems, including additional academic stress. Most studies on learning support services have focused on offline learning. However, this study explored the relationships between academic stress by parent-proxy, health anxiety by parent-proxy, learning support services, and parental educational level in the context of online learning. Results show that it is necessary to pay attention to academic stress and health to provide children with appropriate learning support services.","Wang, C. H.; Li, S. Q.; Su, Y.

"Investigating the prevalence and predictors of food insecurity: a comparison of HFSSM and EU-SILC indicators","Purpose&gt;Data from the Northern Ireland (NI) Health Survey 2014/15 (nÂ =Â 2,231) were statistically analysed to examine the prevalence of food insecurity according to both indicators. Pearson's X2 test for association and logistic regressions were used to examine associations between food security status and predictor variables.Design/methodology/approach&gt;Household food insecurity has been identified as a significant societal issue in both developed and developing nations, but there exists no universal indicator to approximate its prevalence. In NI, two indicators (United States Household Food Security Survey Module [HFSSM] and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions [EU-SILC] food deprivation questions) have been used. This study examines how both indicators differ in their classification of food insecurity prevalence in a population sample and also examines the relationship between various demographic and household factors and food security status.Findings&gt;According to the EU-SILC food deprivation questions, 8.3% (nÂ =Â 185) were indicated to be food insecure, while according to the HFSSM, 6.5% (nÂ =Â 146) were indicated to be food insecure. The HFSSM and EU-SILC regression models differed in the underlying variables they identified as significant predictors of food insecurity. Significant variables common to both modules were tenure, employment status, health status, anxiety/depression and receipt of benefits.Originality/value&gt;Findings can inform policy action with regards to targeting the key contributors and can inform policy decisions in NI and elsewhere with regards to choosing the most appropriate food insecurity indicator.","Beacom, Emma, McLaughlin, Christopher, Furey, SinÃ©ad, Hollywood, Lynsey Elizabeth, Humphreys, Paul","https://doi.org/10.1108/BFJ-05-2021-0514","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Food Journal; 124(9):2705-2721, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36618,""
"Internet-Enabled Behaviors in Older Adults During the Pandemic: Patterns of Use, Psychosocial Impacts, and Plans for Continued Utilization","In response to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a need to increase the frequency of internet enabled behaviors (IEBs). To date, little is known about how the pandemic impacted IEBs in older adults, a population that has historically been linked to lower digital literacy and utilization. We administered an online survey between April and July 2021 to 298 adults who were over age 50 (mean age = 73 years;93.5% non-Hispanic white;94% smart phone owners;83.5% retired). Older adults self-reported IEBs for social, shopping, medical, and leisure activities during the pandemic, plans for continued use of these behaviors, and completed measures of psychosocial functioning. 66.8% of respondents reported an overall increase in IEBs during the pandemic, most notably for online meeting attendance. More frequent online meeting use was associated with less depression (r = -0.12, p = .04) and less loneliness (r = -0.14, p = .02). With regard to plans for continued use, 82.5% of the sample reported at least one IEB (M = 2.18, SD = 1.65) that they increased during the pandemic and planned to maintain over time (e.g., online shopping for household goods). Plans for continued use were more likely in participants who used IEBs more overall during the pandemic (r = 0.56, p &lt; .001), and who frequently sought technical support on search engines (r = 0.22, p &lt; .001), or online video sites (r = 0.16, p = .006). In summary, IEBs during the pandemic were associated with favorable psychosocial functioning and expectations for continued use in this sample of predominantly white older adults who had some baseline technological familiarity.","Benge, J.

"COVID-19 and the Impact on School-Based Mental Health Professionals","In March of 2020, many school systems transitioned to fully virtual platforms in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19. In the following months, schools remained online, transitioned to hybrid (partially online, partially in-person) models, or reopened completely. School-based mental health professionals (SBMHPs) remained responsible for meeting the mental health needs of students in the school system, regardless of the setting. This study sought to find out how COVID-19 and the subsequent changes in school setting have impacted SBMHPs. Through ethnographic observations of a nonprofit providing school-based mental health services as well as qualitative interviews with SBMHPs, this study uncovered a range of impacts. SBMHPs experienced an increase in demand for support with meeting basic needs and improving attendance and academics.

"Risk of COVID-19 transmission estimated from PM 25 and weather conditions (preprint)","COVID-19 infection affects respiratory system;thus, air pollution and meteorological factors also contribute majorly to its transmission. This study is aiming to estimate and comprehend the linkages between contribution of PM 2.5 concentrations and meteorological parameters to spreading coronavirus infection in Gurugram, a badly affected city of India due to COVID-19 pandemic. We employed some statistical analysis on daily average data of PM 2.5 concentrations and meteorological constraints with daily COVID-19 cases during March 2020-February 2022. Time series analysis was conducted to optimize PM 2.5 concentrations associated with COVID-19 cases. The Pearson correlation test was applied to investigate the correlations between PM 2.5 concentrations, meteorological parameters, and COVID-19 cases. The PCA was applied to reveal the most significant factor attributable to affect the rate of COVID-19 transmission in Gurugram. The highest cases of COVID-19 (25,7375) were observed in the month of February when PM 2.5 concentration was 286.6Âµg/m 3, 12.64Â°C temperature, 73.81% RH and 68.265 km/h wind speed;while minimum cases (3125) were found in the month of March with the 18.18Âµg/m3 PM 2.5 concentration, 10.62Â°C temperature, 50.05% RH, and 83.295km/h wind speed. The principal component analysis revealed that the daily COVID-19 cases were significantly positively correlated with PM 2.5 concentrations, RH, and temperature. However, daily COVID-19 cases were negatively or poorly correlated with wind speed. COVID-19 pandemic is prominently affected by PM 2.5 while RH and temperature were found as important meteorological factors significantly affect its human-to-human transmission. This study may provide the useful indications to regulatory bodies to modify the environmental health policies.","","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166115369.95051135/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36622,""

"Antidepressant augmentation upon intranasal Galanin and Neuropeptide Y agonists enhanced ventral hippocampal proliferative and neurotrophic actions (preprint)","Background:  and Purpose: Dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is linked to major depressive disorder (MDD), with more than 300 million people diagnosed and worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence for Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL) interaction was shown in various limbic system regions at molecular-,cellular- and behavioral-specific levels. The purpose of the current work was to evaluate the proliferating role of GALR2 and Y1R agonists interaction upon intranasal infusion in the ventral hippocampus. Experimental approach: We studied their hippocampal proliferating actions using the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the expression of of the brain-derived neurothrophic factor (BDNF). Moreover, we studied the formation of Y1R-GALR2 heteroreceptor complexes and analyzed morphological changes on hippocampal neuronal cells. Finally, the functional outcome of the NPY and GAL interaction on the ventral hippocampus was evaluated in the forced swimming test. Key Results: We demonstrated that the intranasal infusion of GALR2 and the Y1R agonists promotes cell proliferation in the DG of the ventral hippocampus and the induction of the neurotrophic factor BDNF. These effects were mediated by the increased formation of Y1R-GALR2 heteroreceptor complexes, which may mediate the neurites outgrowth observed on neuronal hippocampal cells. Importantly, BDNF action was found necessary for the antidepressant-like effects after GALR2 and the Y1R agonists intranasal administration. Conclusions & Implications: Our data may suggest the translational development of new heterobivalent agonist pharmacophores acting on Y1Râ€“GALR2 heterocomplexes in the ventral hippocampus for the novel therapy of mayor depression disorder or depressive-affecting diseases.","","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166015984.42299981/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36624,""

"Health-Related Quality of Life scores among low-income patients on Social Welfare Programs in Japan: A repeated cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background:  Low-income is one of the well-established determinants of peopleâ€™s health and health-related behavior including susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To support financial access to medical care among low-income patients, there are two social welfare services in Japan: Public Assistance (PA) which provide both minimum income and medical costs, and Free/Low-Cost Medical Care (FLCMC) in which only medical costs were covered. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the changes in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scores before and after the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income patients on PA, FLCMC, and the general population, to examine if the social welfare services contributed to protect low-income peopleâ€™s HRQOL during the pandemic. Methods: : We used repeated cross-sectional data obtained from adult patients on FLCMC or PA and those without social welfare services who regularly visit the Kamigyo clinic in Kyoto, Japan. We collected the data from 2018 and 2021 using a questionnaire about patientsâ€™ socioeconomic attributes and Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Results: : We analyzed data of 200 individuals in 2018 and 174 individuals in 2021. Low-income patients on social welfare services had lower physical health component summary (PCS) score, and the role-social component summary (RCS) score than general population in each year. The results of multiple linear regression analyses with robust standard estimator showed that the decline in Mental Component Summary (MCS) score was significantly larger among FLCMC recipients than patients without welfare services (coefficient: -4.71, 95% Confidence Interval: -8.92 to -0.51), while the decline in MCS scores among PA recipients were not significant when compared to the general population. Conclusions: : Low-income patients on social welfare services especially on FLCMC experienced the significant decline in MCS scores during COVID-19 pandemic. To maintain mental health of low-income patients on social welfare services in the pandemic, need to be provided with not only social care, but financial livelihood support may also be required.

"Evaluating the First University-Based Online Graduate Course on Telemental Health in the Middle East: Lessons Learned from Lebanon (preprint)","Background:  Despite the increasing interest in mental health and shift of many clinicians to using telemental health (TMH) services following the COVID-19 pandemic, university-based educational opportunities covering TMH remain scarce in multiple regions of the world including Lebanon. Through a mixed-methods design, we evaluated the first implementation of a university-based online graduate course on TMH in Lebanon. Data was collected from students of different disciplines during class time and were triangulated and synthesized. Results: Despite this being an online course, high engagement and low absenteeissm was observed with students who remained interested in the topic. In-class interactive activities, limited theoretical pedagogical approaches, participation of international guest speakers, and contextualized material were all listed as key factors to the success of the course. Additionally, students demonstrated much critical thinking when asked about potential applicability of TMH in Lebanon during and after the course. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrates that online learning for TMH in Lebanon can be highly engaging for students depending on certain key factors that should be considered in the design and implementation of the course. This course may have potential to be replicated in other settings across the Middle East in this format to improve knowledge and confidence in TMH in other settings. Recommendations for future studies and similar implementations are discussed in the manuscript.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1966947/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36627,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-efficacy scores and intensity of depressiveness in people aged over 60 years providing kinship foster care (preprint)","Background:  The objective of this study has been to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had impact on self-efficacy scores and intensity of depressive severity in people aged over 60 who provide kinship foster care to their grandchildren. Methods: The study subjects were selected from among individuals aged over 60 years providing kinship foster care to their grand-children. The participants were asked to complete the Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before and during the pandemic. The questionnaire was com-pleted in whole twice by 40 participants. Results: There are no statistically significant differences between the GSE and GDS scores obtained before and during the pandemic. In study subjects with the oldest child in foster care aged 10 years or less, the GDS score decreased in a statistically sig-nificant way (p=0.03). The correlation coefficient of the GSE and GDS scores before the pandemic was -0.46 (p = 0.003), while that of scores during the pandemic was -0.43 (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Neither the sense of self-efficacy nor the intensity of depressiveness of the study subjects changed significantly during the pandemic. Both before and during the pandemic, the intensity of depres-siveness decreased as the sense of self-efficacy increased.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1940144/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36628,""

Prescribing changes of common medications can be used as a marker for new diagnoses.AimTo describe how psychotropic prescribing in England was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsPrimary Care Prescribing data for different classes of drug from March 2017 - February 2022 were considered. To capture the impact during periods of restricted access to health services for new diagnoses/existing conditions, repeat prescriptions/episodic prescribing were included with account taken of historical trend.The pre-pandemic prescriptions issued each month from March 2017 - February 2020 were linearly extrapolated forward to give an expected annual growth (EAG). The monthly average expected prescriptions for the pandemic period (March 2020â€“February 2022) were compared with this.ResultsPhysical health medications had lower monthly prescriptions during the pandemic with antibiotics down -12.2%(EAG -1.4%). Most repeat prescriptions were for bronchodilators -1.8%(EAG 0%), hypertension and heart failure -1.3%(EAG 1%), and lipid regulating drugs at -0.1%(EAG 2.3%). Mental Health monthly prescribing increased with hypnotics/anxiolytics by 0.6%(EAG -2.4%), antipsychotics by 0.5%(EAG 2.7%) and antidepressants by 0.3% (EAG 4.9%) The three main antidepressant were: Sertraline grew by 21% so its share of total anti-depressants increased from 22.7% to 24.6% (+8%), Mirtazapine grew by 16% so share increased from 13.0% to 13.6% (+5%), Venlafaxine grew by 11% so share stayed at 6.3%(0%).ConclusionThe increase in anxiolytic/hypnotic prescribing above trend links to pandemic effects on anxiety/worry.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on language deserves more attention: Evidence from university students in Greece (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dire effect on young people. Recent studies have reported its impact on several mental health domains in this population group. However little has been discussed about the influence of disrupted education and socialization on the linguistic ability of young people. We report early observations from a cross - sectional study conducted among university students in Thessaloniki, Greece. Approximately 3 out of 4 participants observed foreign terms to be introduced in their everyday language, and most of them reported that they have used terms coming from at least 3 different languages. More than half of the participants agreed that the current changes to their vocabulary may have an impact ontheir future linguistic competence, and about one third of them expressed fears that nationallanguages will be negatively impacted by the situation. Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of them disagreed with the latter and opted for enhancing biology and health literacy rather than language in educational curricula. Overall, university students in Greece consider that the pandemic has diversified their vocabulary and potentially affected their linguistic competence. Integrating this knowledge in the current understanding of youth's mental health amidst COVID-19 can help researchers and healthcare practitioners meet the needs of this population group.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1938002/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36630,""

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in sub-Saharan Africa A narrative review of existing literature (preprint)","Background:  The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the physical and mental health of the general population worldwide, with healthcare workers (HCWs) at particular risk. The pandemic's effect on healthcare workers' mental well-being has been severe and characterized by depression, anxiety, work-related Stress, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Therefore, protecting the mental well-being of HCWs is a significant priority. This review is to determine identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes and any protective or coping measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis among HCWs in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: : We performed a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Embase for relevant materials. We obtained all articles published between March 2020 and April 2022 relevant to the review subject and met pre-defined eligibility criteria. We selected twenty-three articles for the initial screening, and we included twelve papers for the final review. Result:  A total of 5,323 participants in twelve studies predominantly from Ethiopia (08 studies), one from Uganda, Cameroon, Mali, and Togo fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Investigators found that 16.3â€“71.9% of HCWs with depressive symptoms, 21.9-73.5% with anxiety symptoms, 15.5-63.7% experienced work-related stress symptoms, 12.4-77% experienced sleep disturbances, and 51.6-56.8% reported PTSD symptoms. Healthcare workers, especially those working in emergency, intensive care units, infectious disease wards, pharmacies, and laboratories, were at higher risk of developing adverse mental health impacts. HCWs had profound fear, were very anxious and stressed with the high transmission rate of the virus and high death rates among their patients and lived in constant fear of infecting their families and themselves. Other sources of fear and work-related Stress were the lack of standardized PPEs and available treatment and vaccines to protect themselves against the virus. HCWs faced stigma, abuse, financial problems, and lack of support. Conclusion:  The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD in HCWs in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic has been high. Several organizational, community, and work-related challenges and interventions were identified, including improvement of workplace infrastructures, adoption of correct and shared infection control measures, provision of standardized personal protective equipment (PPE), social support, and the implementation of resilience training programs.

"Physical Activity Virtual Intervention for Improving Mental Health among University Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Co-Creation Process and Evaluation Using the Behavior Change Wheel (preprint)","Background:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were reductions in university students' physical activity, which further increased their mental distress, calling for technology-based physical activity interventions to address the challenges in delivering in-person interventions. This study aimed to develop a technology-based physical activity intervention and pilot test it. Methods:  We developed a virtually-delivered team-based physical activity challenge using the Behavior Change Wheel and Co-creation Framework based on Self-determination Theory. A pilot study was conducted in the evaluation phase to measure the recruitment rate, dropout rate, change in physical activity and mental distress, while identifying problems and collecting participants' opinions regarding the challenge. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess the change in physical activity and mental distress. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results:  A three-week physical activity challenge comprising five identified intervention functions was held with 480 participants. The recruitment rate was 84.8% resulting from 407 virtual challenge participants who were conveniently joined as research participants. The dropout rate for the pilot study was 10.96% resulting from the incompatibility problems with the application. Among sample participants who lacked physical activity, participation in this challenge improved their physical activity by 52.5 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week and reduced their mental distress by 3 points of self-reporting questionnaire-20 score. Issues regarding the virtual application, the influence of participation in the challenge on basic psychological needs, and lack of time were identified as the main barriers to physical activity from participants' opinions. Conclusion:  A co-created physical activity intervention developed using the Behavioral Change Wheel Framework inspired high interest from university students and may increase their physical activity and improve their mental health. Several suggestions were discussed to address the identified problems and improve the internal and external validity of the evaluation phase.

"The association mental health of adolescents with economic impact during the COVID-19 pandemic: A 2020 Korean nationally representative survey (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 has affected innumerable lives across society, including in the spheres of education, economy, and religion. Economic problems and inequality are related to the poor mental health of adolescents. This study was to identify the relationship between the economic damage to families due to COVID-19 and various mental health problems for Korean adolescents, and evaluate the risk factors of mental health. Methods A total of 54,948 students were surveyed from 398 middle and 395 high schools. Complex sample logistic regressions were performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of depression and suicidal ideation. Generalized linear model analysis were used to examine the association between mental health (unhappiness, lonely and stress) and economic impact of COVID-19. Theses analyses were adjusted for age, gender, school grade, perceived academic achievement, perceived family economic status, economic support. Results The ORs of depression (OR = 1.77, 95% CI : 1.57-2.00), suicide ideation (OR = 2.14, 95% CI : 1.84â€“2.50), unhappiness (OR = 1.51 95% CI 1.42â€“1.60) and lonely (OR = 1.38 95% CI 1.27â€“1.49) for the low level of perceived family economic status was higher compared to middle level. Adolescents who experienced economic deterioration at household as COVID-19 showed a higher risk of depression (OR = 1.42, 95% CI : 1.35â€“1.49), suicide ideation (OR = 1.36, 95% CI : 1.28â€“1.44), unhappiness (OR = 2.23 95% CI 2.19â€“2.27), lonely (OR = 1.20 95% CI 1.17â€“1.22), and stress (OR = 1.14 95% CI 1.12â€“1.16) than those who did not.

"Forced Social Isolation and Lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Depression, Anxiety, and Trauma-distress in a Greek sample (preprint)","Purpose:  The COVID-19 outbreak escalated into a global pandemic, forcing governments around the world to impose measures affecting all aspects of life. Like other countries, Greece adopted social restriction, lockdowns, and quarantines to reduce transmission from person-to-person. This cross-sectional study investigated the impact of social restriction measures on mental health in a Greek adult sample. Method An online questionnaire collected data during the second national lockdown (February to May 2021). A total of 650 participants ( M age: 33.13, 71.5% female) comprised the final sample. Results 21.3% of respondents reported moderate-to-extremely severe anxiety, 33% moderate-to-extremely severe depression, 31.8% moderate-to-severe stress, and 38% clinically significant trauma-related distress. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that the strongest contributors to adverse mental health outcomes were being female, younger age, experiencing increases in verbal arguments at home, being separated from family and close friends, and being unable to afford enough or healthy food. Lastly, participants moved away from social support and into more individual strength and resilience-based coping strategies to cope with challenges. Conclusion These findings suggest that in addition to the detrimental effects on physical health, COVID-19 also imposed a heavy psychological burden on the population via forced social isolation, which, by design, increased not only physical distancing but also psychological distancing between people.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1909518/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36635,""
"An online behavior change intervention to promote physical activity in adults with asma: study protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial (preprint)","Background:  Behavior change interventions have been the focus of recent studies, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of online interventions. However, no previous studies have investigated behavior change techniques to improve physical activity in adults with asthma through online intervention.MethodsThis double-blind clinical trial will investigate the effectiveness of an online behavior change intervention in increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in adults with asthma, as well as in improving other clinical outcomes in short and medium terms. Patients with clinically stable moderate to severe asthma, who are physically inactive and do not have cardiovascular and/or osteoneuromuscular impairments will be randomized into control or intervention groups (23 in each). Both groups will carry out an online educational program (1 hour). Additionally, the intervention group will receive weekly individual online sessions for 12 weeks of motivation-based behavior change intervention to promote increase in physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior based on both self-determination theory and transtheoretical model. The intervention group will also receive an activity monitor with specific strategies related to it. Both groups will be reassessed immediately after the intervention and 6 months after that. The primary outcomes are physical activity and sedentary behavior, which will be objectively assessed by a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X-BT). Secondary outcomes are: Asthma Control Questionnaire, Incremental Step Test, Sit-To-Stand, Timed Up-and-Go, 4-Metre Gait Speed, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Actiwatch 2 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.DiscussionThe intervention is unprecedented and was carefully developed to joint most characteristics and techniques of both behavioral strategies (transtheoretical model and self-determination theory). Therefore, this intervention has potential to improve physical activity levels and asthma management, and reduce sedentary behavior. As a consequence, this novel intervention will improve global health in this population and support its use in clinical practice. The intervention will be carried out online with direct weekly contact with the therapist. Consequently, it has low implementation costs, might improve patientâ€™s attendance and has the potential to be largely offered elsewhere.Trial registrationClinical Trials;NCT05241223;registered on January 22 2022;https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05241223","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1897891/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36636,""
"The prevalence of mental ill-health in women during pregnancy and after childbirth during the Covid-19 pandemic: a Systematic Review and Meta- analysis (preprint)","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a respiratory disease which causes coronavirus and has given rise to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV in Hong Kong and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). COVID-19, to date, has had the highest morbidity and mortality rates globally, thus reaching the pandemic status. Whilst research has explored the impact of pandemic on general wellbeing, there appears to be a paucity on its association with womenâ€™s mental health, with many pregnant women reporting the pandemic negatively impacted their mental health. This study aims to explore the prevalence of the impact of the COVID-19, MERS and SARS pandemics on the mental health of pregnant women. A study protocol was developed and published in PROSPERO (CRD42021235356) to explore several key objectives. A literature search was carried out and identified 316 studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to report the findings. There were no studies reporting the mental health impact due to MERS and SARS. Results showed that women who were pregnant or had just given birth displayed various symptoms of poor mental health including those relating to depression (24.9%), anxiety (32.8%), stress (29.44%), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (27.93%), and sleep disorders (24.38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of managing mental health during pregnancy and after-delivery improves the quality of life and wellbeing of mothers hence developing an evidence-based approached as part of pandemic preparedness would improve mental health during challenging times.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1894395/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36637,""
"The BEACON Study: An update to the protocol for a cohort study as part of an evaluation of the effectiveness of smartphone-assisted problem-solving therapy in men who present with intentional self-harm to emergency departments in Ontario (preprint)","Background:  Men who present to the emergency department (ED) with self-harm are at high risk of dying by suicide, with 2.7% of men dying in the year following their presentation, more than double the rate for women (1.2%). Despite this, care received after an ED visit is highly variable and many are not assessed for psychological needs. Furthermore, the limited psychological care that is available is often not covered by provincial health insurance. Even when referrals for follow-up care are made, engagement rates are low. Previous recommendations to improve engagement include written discharge plans, caring contacts, and focused interventions targeting middle-aged men at elevated risk of dying by suicide. Blended care, the incorporation of technology into traditional care, has also been proposed as a method to increase engagement in and clinical benefits from psychotherapy. This project aims to determine whether the delivery of an evidence based treatment (Problem Solving Therapy - PST) iss enhanced by the addition of a custom smartphone application (BEACON) compared to usual care. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on site participation and the planned implementation, we have made several changes to the study design, primary outcome and implementation. Method:  We originally proposed a cohort study nested within a larger cluster randomized trial wherein intervention sites would deliver the blended care, and control sites, whose personnel were not aware of their participation, would continue delivering usual care. The cohort study evaluated participant level outcomes as previously described by Hatcher et al (2020). Due to pandemic related constraints, our number of participating sites dropped to five potential sites which left the cohort study underpowered. As such, we changed the study design to a multi-site, individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) among the five remaining sites. Participants will be randomized to six sessions of therapy (PST) alone, or to the therapy plus BEACON, and followed up for 6 months. Our primary outcome was changed to evaluate feasibility and acceptability with the aim of designing a definitive RCT. Study implementation was reimagined to allow for completely virtual/online conduct to comply with local COVID-19 and institutional restrictions on in-person activities. Conclusion:  This updated protocol will provide strong results for the planning of a definitive RCT of the blended care intervention in the future, addressing areas of difficulty and concern prior to its implementation. We will evaluate the feasibility of the study intervention, assess recruitment and retention of participants, and address challenges with implementing the protocol. Lastly, we will evaluate the appropriateness of our primary outcome measure and accurately determine a sample size for a definitive RCT. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03473535.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health and Substance Use Health (MHSUH) Workforce in Canada: A Mixed Methods Study (preprint)","Background:  The increased need for mental health and substance use health (MHSUH) services during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need to better understand workforce capacity. This study aimed to examine the pandemic's impact on the capacity of MHSUH service providers and to understand reasons contributing to changes in availability or ability to provide services. Methods We conducted a mixed method study including a pan-Canadian survey of 2,177 providers of MHSUH services and semi-structured interviews with 13 key informants. Survey participants answered questions about how the pandemic had changed their capacity to provide services, reasons for changes in capacity, and how their practice had during the pandemic. Thematic analysis of key informant interviews was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of the pandemic on the MHSUH workforce. Results Analyses of the survey data indicated that the pandemic has had diverse effects on the capacity of MHSUH workers to provide services: 43% indicated decreased, 24% indicated no change, and 33% indicated increased capacity. Logistic regression analyses showed that privately-funded participants had 3.2 times greater odds of increased capacity ( B  = 1.20, p  &lt; .001), and participants receiving funding from a mix of public and private sources had 2.4 times greater odds of increased capacity ( B  = 0.88, p  &lt; .001) compared to publicly-funded participants. Top reasons for decreases included lockdown measures and clients lacking access or comfort with virtual care. Top reasons for increases included using virtual care and more people having problems relevant to the participant's skills. Five themes were constructed from thematic analysis of key informant interviews: the differential impact of public health measures, increased inequity accessing MHSUH services, improving recognition driven by need for services, the accumulating impact of stressful working conditions, and critical gaps in MHSUH workforce data. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the capacity of the MHSUH workforce to provide services. Findings indicate the importance of increasing and harmonizing funding for MHSUH services across the public and private sectors, developing standardized datasets describing the MHSUH workforce, and prioritizing equity across the spectrum of MHSUH services.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1858476/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36639,""

"A Cross-sectional Study on Covid-19 Pandemic and Mental Illness in Healthcare Professionals (preprint)","Introduction:  Mental health illness has increased substantially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating anxiety and depression in healthcare providers can clarify the dimensions of this burden. The objectives of the study were to compare the levels of anxiety and depression in the study population (COVID-positive versus COVID-negative) with Hamilton's anxiety (HAM-A) and Hamilton's depression (HAM-D) scales, respectively, and to estimate the relative risk of anxiety and depression in the COVID-positive participant to COVID-negative participant with subgroup analyses as per gender and occupation. Materials:  and Methods In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 983 healthcare professionals from SCB Medical College, India, to assess their levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the HAM-A and HAM-D scores of COVID-positive and COVID-negative participants. We also calculated the relative risks of developing anxiety and depression symptoms. We used R software (version 4.1.2) for the statistical analyses and generation of plots. Results:  The mean age of the study population was 35.95Â±11.54 years. Six hundred thirteen participants (62.36%) were positive for COVID infection. 575 (58.49%) persons had anxiety, as suggested by their HAM-A scores. The majority of them were nurses and pharmacists (245, 24.92%), followed by students (236, 24.01%) and clinicians (94, 9.56%). 620 (63.07%) persons had depression. Most of them were medical students (301, 30.62%), followed by nurses and pharmacists (211, 21.46%) and clinicians (108, 10.99%). The COVID-positive individuals were less anxious [relative risk: 0.614;95% CI: 0.538-0.701] and more depressed [relative risk: 2.541;95% CI: 2.079-3.106] than the COVID-negative individuals. Subgroup analysis of the HAM-A and HAM-D scores yielded similar results. Conclusion:  The majority of the study population had symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. The COVID-negative individuals were more anxious than the COVID positives. Nevertheless, the symptoms of depression were more common in COVID-positive individuals.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1846336/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36641,""
"Mental health status among non-medical college students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zhanjiang city (preprint)","Objectives:  The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought great changes to people's lifestyles. Previous reports implied that college students are more vulnerable to mental disorders. We aimed to evaluate the mental status of non-medical college students during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Zhanjiang city. Methods: : 1083 non-medical college students aged 18-25 years old were enrolled in this study. An online survey was applied to collect demographic data. Sleep quality, anxiety and depression symptoms were analyzed by pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), hamilton depression rating scale-17 (HDRS-17) and self rating anxiety scale (SAS), respectively. Results: : There are 93.2% students had good sleep quality, 6.8% students had poor sleep quality. There are 97.4% students had no anxiety, 1.86%, 0.37% and 0.37% students had mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. 66.9% students had no depression, 26.7%, 4.7% and 1.7% students had minimal, mild-moderate and severe depression. The sleep quality of students in different grades showed no statistical significance. Female students had higher proportions of anxiety ( p =0.02) and depression ( p &gt;0.0001) than male students. No statistical difference was found in different educational levels regarding to anxiety and depression. The students whose household income that lower than 3000 RMB were more vulnerable to anxiety ( p =0.017) and depression ( p =0.004). Conclusions: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of students remain good sleep quality and positive mental health and a small number of students showed depression. Female students and lower household income were positively related to the prevalence of anxiety and depression. To our knowledge, this is the novel study revealing the mental health of non-medical college students concerning COVID-19 in Zhanjiang.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1839216/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36642,""
"Efficacy of computer- and/or internet-based cognitive-behavioral guided self-management for depression in adults and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (preprint)","Background:  Depression is a worldwide disease. Studies show that the rate of depression during the COVID-19 breakout seems to have considerably increased. CBT-based self-help treatment allows patients with mild to moderate depression symptoms to improve their depression or to bridge the waiting- or pandemic period until they receive further clinical treatment. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the efficacy and acceptability of computer-delivered and/or internet-based CBT self-help interventions with minimal guidance (up to 10 minutes) for depression. In addition, comparing the effectiveness of treatment by the type of minimal guidance: (1) by e-mail, (2) by telephone calls, (3) by e-mail and telephone together, or (4) face-to-face in reducing depression symptoms at post-treatment was the second aim. Methods The Cochrane depression, anxiety, and neurosis review groupâ€™s specialized register electronic searches, grey literature, reference lists and correspondence were used to search for published and unpublished RCTs that reported efficacy of computer- and/or internet-based CBT self-help treatments for depression with minimal guidance up to 10 minutes per week. Methodological quality of included studies was evaluated with Cochrane Collaboration tools for assessing risk of bias. The meta-analysis was accomplished using the RevMen software. Results In total, 2620 study abstracts were checked for eligibility. Out of these, 17 studies (18 samples) with a total of 3134 participants were included. The results showed that concerning efficacy, the treatment group is superior to the control group with a medium to large effect size of 0.60. Also, treatment groups with combined guidance by e-mail and telephone calls together had greater effects (SMD - 0.74) than groups with other types of minimal guidance (guided by e-mail SMD - 0.63;guided face to-face SMD â€“ 0.66;guided by telephone calls SMD - 0.33). Moreover, there were higher drop-out rates in the treatment condition (RR 1.35) than in the control groups. Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis support the efficacy of computer- and/or internet-based CBT self-help programs with minimal weekly guidance for improving depression symptoms at post-treatment for adults and adolescents.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1816188/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36643,""
"Early detection of variants of concern via funnel plots of regional reproduction numbers (preprint)","Tools to early detect the emergence of a new variant of concern are essential to develop strategies that contain epidemic outbreaks and their health-economic-social consequences. For example, knowing in which region a variant of concern appears or starts spreading enables prompt actions to circumscribe the diffusion area. This paper presents â€˜funnel plotsâ€™ as a statistical process control method that can quickly identify regions of a country where the reproduction number is anomalous with respect to the national one, while keeping false alarms under control. Unlike tools whose purpose is to identify rises of R t , the proposed method detects when a regional R t behaves differently from the national average and thus represents an abnormal situation that needs to be investigated through cross-cutting research. The method is validated on public COVID-19 data demonstrating its efficacy in the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in India, South Africa, England, and Italy, as well as of a malfunctioning episode of the diagnostic infrastructure in England.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1538799/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36644,""
"Covid-19 Vaccination and Mental Stress within Diverse Socio-demographic Groups (preprint)","In this study, we surveyed over 600 participants to determine: a) major causes to mental stress during the pandemic and its future impacts, and b) diversity in public perception and acceptance (specifically for children) of Covid-19 vaccination. Statistical results and intelligent clustering outcomes indicate significant relationships between sociodemographic diversity, mental stress causes, vaccination perception, and Covid-19 infections. For instance, statistical results indicate significant dependence between mental stress due to Covid-19 and gender (p = 1.7e-05). Over 25% of males indicated work related stress comparing 35% in females however, females indicated more stressed (17%) due to relationships comparing to males (12%). Around 30% of Asian/Arabic participants don&rsquo;t feel vaccination being safe as compared to 8% of white-British and 22% of white-European indicating significant dependence (p = 1.8e-08) with ethnicity. More specifically, vaccination acceptance for children is significantly dependent to ethnicity (p = 3.7e-05) where only 47% participants show willingness towards children&rsquo;s vaccination. Primary dataset in this study along with experimental outcomes identifying sociodemographic information diversity with respect to public perception and acceptance of vaccination to children and potential stress factors might be useful for public and policy makers to be better prepared for future epidemics as well as working globally to combat mental health issues and running more effective vaccination campaigns.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202208.0350.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36645,""
"Determinants of Mental Health during and after COVID-19 Lockdown among University Students in Malaysia (preprint)","Background:  Young adults, particularly university students might be at greater risk of developing psychological distress, and exhibiting symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to explore and compare the determinants and predictors of mental health (anxiety and depression) during and after COVID-19 lockdown among university students. Methods: This was an observational, cross-sectional study with a sample size of 417 students. An online survey utilizing International Physical Activity Questionnaire&ndash;Short Form (IPAQ-SF), General Anxiety Disorder&ndash;7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was distributed to Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman students via Google forms. Results: During lockdown, family income [&chi;2 (1, n=124) = 5.155, p=0.023], and physical activity [&chi;2 (1, n=134) = 6.366, p=0.012] were associated with anxiety, while depression was associated with gender [&chi;2 (1, n=75) = 4.655, p=0.031]. After lockdown, family income was found to be associated with both anxiety [&chi;2 (1, n=111) = 8.089, p=0.004], and depression [&chi;2 (1, n=115) =9.305, p=0.002]. During lockdown, family income (OR=1.60, p=0.018), and physical activity (OR=0.59, p=0.011) were predictors for anxiety, and gender (OR=0.65, p=0.046) being the only predictor for depression. After lockdown, family income was a predictor for both anxiety (OR=1.67, p=0.011), and depression (OR=1.70, p=0.009). Conclusion: Significant negative effects attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown, and certain factors predisposed to the worsening of mental health status in university students.

"A Narrative Inquiry into the Practices of Healthcare Workers Wellness Program: The SEED Experience in New South Wales, Australia (preprint)","The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires followed by the COVID-19 pandemic brought the significant mental health implications of working in healthcare to the fore. The importance of appropriate support services to ensure the resilience and recovery of healthcare workers has been highlighted. In response to healthcare staff experiences during the bushfires, the SEED Wellness Program was created in 2020 in the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, in NSW Australia. SEED used a participatory action methodology to engage and collaborate with healthcare staff teams in workplace-based restorative activities. Guided by Practice Theory, this study aimed to identify and describe SEED wellness practices that supported healthcare staff. Thirty-three healthcare workers participated in focus groups or individual interviews between June 2021 and March 2022. The analysis involved inductive thematic individual and collective exploration of SEED practices, including co-analysis with participants. Eight core practices that supported participantsâ€™ wellbeing were identified including responsive and compassionate leading, engaging staff at every stage of the recovery process, creating a sense of connection with others, and collective caring. The study found that workplace wellness initiatives are optimised when place-based and grounded in local knowledge, needs, and resources incorporating a collective and supportive team approach. Moreover, to ensure engagement in, and sustainability of these initiatives, both bottom-up and top-down commitment is required.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202208.0262.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36647,""

Despite this, little is known about the unique experiences of LTC workers. This scoping review synthesizes existing research on the experiences of HCWs in LTC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following Arksey and O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s framework, data were extracted from six databases from inception of the pandemic to June 2022. Among 3,808 articles screened, 40 articles were included in the final analysis. Analyses revealed three interrelated themes: carrying the load (moral distress);building pressure and burning out (emotional exhaustion);and working through it (a sense of duty to care). Given the impacts of the pandemic on both HCW wellbeing and patient care, every effort must be made to address the LTC workforce crisis and evaluate best practices for supporting HCWs experiencing mental health concerns during and post-COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202208.0239.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36648,""

Two-way analysis of covariance for PHQ-9 showed a significant main effect of the presence of psychiatric history and a significant interaction effect of psychiatric history Ã— time since infection. Two-way analysis of covariance for the GAD-7 score revealed a significant main effect of the presence of psychiatric history and time since COVID-19 infection and the interaction effect of these factors. Conclusions: The course of depression and anxiety was more severe in COVID-19 survivors with a psychiatric history than in those without a psychiatric history.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202208.0227.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36649,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study of Canadian Workerâ€™s Mental Health During the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a considerable expansion in the way work settings are structured with a continuum emerging between working fully in-person and from home. The pandemic has also exacerbated many risk factors for poor mental health in the workplace, especially in public-facing jobs. Therefore, we sought to test the potential relationship between work setting and self-rated mental health. Methods: We modeled the association of work setting (only working from home, only in-person, hybrid) on self-rated mental health (Excellent/Very Good/Good vs. Fair/Poor) in an online survey of Canadian workers during the 3rd wave of COVID-19. Mediating effects of vaccination, masking, and distancing were explored due to the potential effect of COVID-19 related worries on mental health among those working in-person. Results: Among 1,576 workers, most reported hybrid work (77.2%). Most also reported good self-rated mental health (80.7%). Exclusive work from home (aOR: 2.79, 95%CI:1.90,4.07) and exclusive in-person work (aOR: 2.79, 95%CI: 1.83,4.26) were associated with poorer self-rated mental health than hybrid work. Vaccine status mediated only a small proportion of this relationship (7%), while masking and physical distancing were not mediators. Conclusion: Hybrid work arrangements were associated with positive self-rated mental health. Compliance to vaccination, masking, and distancing did not meaningfully mediate this relationship.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202208.0172.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36650,""
"Providing bilingual COVID-19 educational material for the border region during the pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Studies show that the introduction of early public health interventions correlates with decreased rates of transmission and reductions in mortality resulting from epidemic or pandemic events. Methods: : Medical educators and students from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso created the El Paso-Health Education and Awareness Team (EP-HEAT) to educate at-risk populations in the border region. The English and Spanish material created by EP-HEAT included information about disease symptoms, transmission, preventive measures and mental health resources. An online, anonymous survey was distributed to attendees to obtain feedback on the provided coronavirus disease (COVID-19) educational material. Results: : The results showed that over 90% of participants agreed that the informational pamphlets increased their awareness and knowledge of COVID-19. Conclusions: : In this study, educators and students created COVID-19-related material in virtual workshops and pamphlets, designed to increase knowledge about COVID-19, mitigate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and how to address mental health issues related to the pandemic. A majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the COVID-19 material developed by EP-HEAT helped raise awareness, understanding, and the importance of education about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/mep.19215.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36651,""
"The social prescribing of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of addictions and substance use disorders with military veterans: a reclamation of identity and belonging (preprint)","Social prescribing is a way of connecting individuals to a source of support within the community to help improve their health and well-being. Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted within the United Kingdom (UK) and United States as non-pharmaceutical interventions for those living with addiction and substance misuse needs. These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder. In this paper, I will discuss the associated determinants of addictions and substance for the military veteran population, as well as how the social prescribing of psychosocial interventions could be used to reaffirm participantâ€™s identity and enhance their sense of belonging for military veterans, using a real-world example in Wales, UK.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.124768.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36652,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the socioeconomic inequality of health behavior among Japanese adolescents: a two-year-repeated cross-sectional survey (preprint)","Background Although disparities in socioeconomic status in health behaviors have been highlighted globally, they are not well understood in Japanese adolescents. The purpose of this study was to clarify the changes in socioeconomic disparities in adolescentsâ€™ fundamental health behaviors, such as physical activity, screen time (ST), sleep, breakfast intake, and bowel movement before and during COVID-19. Methods This was a repeated cross-sectional study which used data from the 2019 and 2021 National Sports-Life Survey of Children and Young in Japan. Data of 766 and 725 participants in 2019 and 2021, respectively, were analyzed. Favorable health behaviors were defined as daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) of at least 60 minutes, ST of less than 2 hours, sleep of 8 to 10 hours, daily breakfast intake, and bowel movement frequency of at least once in every 3 days. We calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) in each health behavior for equivalent household income levels for assessing absolute and relative economic inequalities. Results Compliance with MVPA and ST recommendation significantly declined from 20.1% and 23.0% in 2019 to 11.7% and 14.9% in 2021, respectively. The SII and RII increased in MVPA for income levels, but decreased in daily breakfast in 2019 to 2021. Although the widening and narrowing of the disparity was inconclusive for ST, it exacerbated for the higher income groups. Conclusions Our study revealed widening of economic disparities in the achievement of recommended MVPA and narrowing of it in breakfast intake among adolescents before and during COVID-19. What is already known on this subject Although disparities in the economic status of the family and neighborhood have been observed in several fundamental health behaviors among western countriesâ€™ adolescents, they have not been well understood in Japan. It has been pointed out that the economic disparities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to increase disparities in health and health behaviors. What this study adds This is the first study to examine the change in socioeconomic inequalities in various health behavior among Japanese adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found widening of socioeconomic disparities in the achievement of recommended PA We found narrowing of socioeconomic disparities in breakfast intake. How this study might affect research, practice or policy Continuous monitoring of how this affects health in the short and long term is needed.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.11.22278499","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36653,""
"Direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in Switzerland: A population-based study (preprint)","The direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population-level mortality is of concern to public health but challenging to quantify. We modelled excess mortality and the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on mortality in Switzerland. We analyzed yearly population data and weekly all-cause deaths by age, sex, and canton 2010-2019 and all-cause and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths from February 2020 to April 2022 (study period). Bayesian models predicted the expected number of deaths. A total of 13,130 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were reported. The model estimated that COVID-19-related mortality was underestimated by a factor of 0.72 [95% Credible Interval: 0.46-0.78] resulting in 18,140 [15,962-20,174] excess deaths. After accounting for COVID-19 deaths, the observed mortality was 3% [-1-7] lower than expected, corresponding to a deficit of 4,406 deaths, with a wide credibility interval [-1,776-10,700]. Underestimation of COVID-19 deaths was greatest for ages 70 years and older;the mortality deficit was most pronounced in age groups 40 to 69 years. We conclude that shortcomings in testing caused underestimation of COVID-19-related deaths in Switzerland, particularly in older people. Although COVID-19 control measures may have negative effects (e.g., delays in seeking care or mental health impairments), after subtracting COVID-19 deaths, there were fewer deaths in Switzerland during the pandemic than expected, suggesting that any negative effects of control measures on mortality were offset by the positive effects. These results have important implications for the ongoing debate about the appropriateness of COVID-19 control measures.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.05.22278458","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36654,""
"Data-driven assessment of adolescentsâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Importance Adolescentsâ€™ mental health and well-being were severely compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal follow-up studies, based on real-world data, assessing the changes in mental health of adolescents during the later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic are needed. Objective To quantify the effect of COVID-19 on the incidence of Israeli adolescentsâ€™ mental health outcomes from electronic health record (EHR) data. Design, Setting and Participants Retrospective cohort study analyzing EHR data of Maccabi Healthcare Services members, the second largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel. Eligible subjects were 12-17 years old, during 2017-2021 with no previous diagnosis or psychiatric drug dispensation of those analyzed in this study. This resulted in over 200,000 eligible participants each year. Exposure COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate it. Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence rates of mental health diagnoses (depression;anxiety;obsessive-compulsive disorder;stress;eating disorders;ADHD), and psychiatric drugs dispensation (antidepressants;anxiolytics;antipsychotics;ADHD agents) were measured, and relative risks were computed between the years. Subgroup analyses were performed for age, gender, population sector and socioeconomic status. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis evaluated changes in monthly incidence rates of psychiatric outcomes. Results During the COVID-19 period a 36% increase was observed in the incidence of depression (95%CI: 25-47), 31% in anxiety (95%CI: 23-39), 20% in stress (95%CI: 13-27), 50% in eating disorders (95%CI: 35-67), 25% in antidepressants (95%CI: 25-33) and 28% in antipsychotics dispensation (95%CI: 18-40). Decreased rate of 26% (95% CI: 0.80-0.88) was observed in ADHD diagnoses and 10% (95% CI: 0.86-0.93) in prescriptions of ADHD agents. The increase was mostly attributed to females in the general Israeli population;nevertheless, a 24% increase in anxiety was seen in males (95%CI: 13-37), 64% in Israeli Arabs (95%CI: 12-140) and 31% in ultra-orthodox (95%CI: 3-67). ITS analysis revealed a significantly higher growth in the incidence of psychiatric outcomes during the COVID-19 period, compared to previous years. Conclusions and Relevance EHR data of adolescents shows increased incidence rates of mental health diagnoses and medications during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically identified females as those with the highest mental health burden.

"Application of Traditional Vaccine Development Strategies to SARS-CoV-2 (preprint)","Over the past 150 years, vaccines have revolutionized the relationship between people and disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies such as mRNA vaccines have received significant attention due to their novelty and successes. However, more traditional vaccine development platforms have also been applied against SARS-CoV-2, yielding important tools in the worldwide fight against the virus. A variety of approaches have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines that are now authorized for use in countries around the world. In this review, we highlight strategies that focus on the viral capsid outwards, rather than on the nucleic acids inside. Such approaches broadly fall into two categories: whole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines. Whole-virus vaccine approaches use the virus itself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state. Subunit vaccines isolate an immunogenic component of the virus using various strategies that is then introduced through vaccination. We highlight specific vaccine candidates that utilize these approaches in different ways. In a companion manuscript, we review the more recent and novel development of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies. We further consider the role that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in providing immunity to people around the world. Well-established vaccine technologies have proved especially important because of the significant role they have played in COVID-19 vaccine access at the global scale. Vaccine development programs that use established platforms have been undertaken in a much wider range of countries than those using nucleic-acid-based technologies, which have been led by wealthy Western countries. Therefore, these vaccine platforms, while less cutting-edge on the biotechnology side, have proven to be extremely important to the management of SARS-CoV-2.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Application+of+Traditional+Vaccine+Development+Strategies+to+SARS-CoV-2+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36656,""
"The Silver Lining of the Pandemic: Stories of Working Scholars from Marginalized Families in Midsayap, Cotabato (preprint)","Students working part-time or full-time while studying is becoming a common occurrence all around the world. Students will eventually be prepared for their future careers through working. Most of the working scholars came from below minimum wage-earning families and the reason why they became working scholars is because of financial constraints. During the start of the pandemic, the working scholars are greatly affected given the fact that they juggle both work and academics. The series of lockdown hampered their work-life balance. These working scholars make work easier and faster for the office staff in fact, they sometimes run most of the errands as if they are hired as a regular employee. However, the assistance provided to the working scholars often end with a certain number of units to be shouldered by the school that is why some working scholars would often take on another job or two to cover the allowance and the miscellaneous. There are areas that are sometimes neglected especially the work-school balance and the studentsâ€™ mental health. In this phenomenological study, the joys and struggles of the working students will be navigated including their coping mechanisms in dealing with the challenges they have encountered during the pandemic. Moreover, this study will also gather the different suggestions of the working scholars for the improvement of the program provided by the school for them.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Silver+Lining+of+the+Pandemic:+Stories+of+Working+Scholars+from+Marginalized+Families+in+Midsayap,+Cotabato+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36657,""
"The Effects of Fiscal Policy on Households during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Emerging Economies (preprint)","In response to the economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic, many govern- ments provided financial assistance to households. Using representative consumer surveys conducted during the pandemic in 2020, we examine the effects of this fiscal policy instrument on households in two emerging economies, Vietnam and Thailand. Our paper contributes to the literature by studying consumer sentiment and durable spending responses to government financial support and the underlying transmission channels for these responses. We find that government support improves consumer sentiment and increases the likelihood of durable spending. Possible channels for these effects include more optimistic macroeconomic expectations and higher trust in the government's ability to deal with the pandemic, as well as less concern about the general impact of the crisis. We also find that financial support improves in- dividuals' mental health and life satisfaction. Our results suggest that government financial support not only helps stimulate the economy but also enhances people's well-being more generally.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effects+of+Fiscal+Policy+on+Households+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Evidence+from+Emerging+Economies+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36658,""
"Identifying Parent Anxiety and Family Distress of Critically Ill Children in Response to Changes in Hospital Visitation Policies During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","A childâ€™s admission to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is one of the most stressful and anxiety-provoking situations that parents, and families can endure (Jee et al., 2012). Parents describe the PICU environment as unfamiliar, loud, confusing, unpredictable, and emotional (Alzawad et al., 2020). Parent and family routines are dramatically disrupted during a childâ€™s PICU hospitalization further contributing to parent stress (Kirschbaum, 1990). Parents of critically ill children report feeling stressed and uncomfortable about the inability to participate in their childâ€™s care. This loss of control increases parent anxiety and stress as well as feelings of hopelessness and helplessness (Dahav & Sjostrom-Strand, 2018;Simeone et al., 2018). Additional parent stressors include limited access to medical information, uncertainty of the childâ€™s prognosis, and leaving the hospitalized child (Kirschbaum, 1990). Parents report that unrestricted access to their critically ill child helps them better understand the treatment plan and options for care, feel more confident in healthcare staff, and alleviates stress and anxiety (Dahav & Sjostrom-Strand, 2018;Simeone et al., 2018;Sood et al., 2018). In 2020, healthcare institutions throughout the world scrambled to care for unprecedented numbers of patients afflicted with COVID-19. While most children were spared significant illness, pediatric hospitals around the world found themselves adapting to accommodate adult patients or shifting personnel to assist in overwhelmed adult units. The desire to protect vulnerable staff and patients by limiting spread of the virus spread prompted abrupt changes in visitor policies in both adult and pediatric hospitals (Hugelius et al., 2021). For patients ofnchildren admitted to the PICU, the already-stressful circumstances surrounding ICU admission were compounded by checkpoints and restricted parent presence.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Identifying+Parent+Anxiety+and+Family+Distress+of+Critically+Ill+Children+in+Response+to+Changes+in+Hospital+Visitation+Policies+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36659,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 after hospital discharge: A follow-up study on Italian recovered patients","Since COVID-19 outbreak, clinical experience on its management during the acute phase has rapidly grown, including potential effects on the psychopathological dimension. However, still few data are available regarding the impact on survivors' mental health over the long-term. A sample of 1457 COVID-19 patients underwent a multidisciplinary follow-up protocol, approximately 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months after hospital discharge, including a psychological evaluation. The primary outcomes were anxiety, depression, resilience, post-traumatic symptoms, and health-related quality of life. Furthermore, we examined the potential role of hospitalization and delay in the follow-up assessment on the increased burden of illness. Although a general high level of resilience emerged, suggesting most patients relied on their individual and interpersonal resources to face difficulties related to the pandemic, almost one third of the sample reported signs of psychological distress over time, especially post-traumatic symptoms, with anxiety being more represented than depression. Furthermore, hospitalization - regardless of the setting of care - and promptness in follow-up evaluation were found to play a protective role on patients' recovery and mental wellbeing. Selection bias of patients exclusively admitted to the hospital; absence of a control group; psychological assessment relying on self-reported instruments. The current crisis demands resilience and adjustment resources, either in the acute and post-acute phase. Thus, the clinical effort should aim at relieving the traumatic impact of such condition through timely interventions. Further investigation may address potential predictors of developing a traumatic stress response, in order to identify and promptly treat at-risk subpopulations.","Spada, Biffi, Belotti, Cremaschi, Palumbo, Locatelli, Cesana, Bondi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.086","20220827","COVID-19; Post-traumatic; Psychological impact; Recovered patients; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36660,""
"Prevalence, trajectory over time, and risk factor of post-COVID-19 fatigue","Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in the context of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Notably, fatigue is characterised by overlapping physical and psychopathological symptoms, and questions about its trajectory over time and possible predictors remained unanswered. Thus, in the present study we aim to investigate the prevalence, the course over time, and the risk factors of post-COVID fatigue. We included 495 patients recovered from COVID-19. For all of them we collected one month demographic, clinical and psychopathological characteristics. We evaluated fatigue severity at one, three, six, and twelve-months according to Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). We explored the potential predictor of long-term post-COVID fatigue (six or twelve months FSS) by implementing 5000 non-parametric bootstraps enhanced elastic net penalised regression. We found that 22%, 27%, 30%, and 34% of patients self-rated fatigue symptoms in the pathological range at one, three, six, and twelve months respectively. We detected a worsening of fatigue symptomatology over time. From the elastic net regression results, only depressive symptomatology at one month (ZSDS and BDI-13) predicted the presence of post-COVID-19 long-term fatigue. No other clinical or demographic variable was found to predict post-COVID fatigue. We suggest that, rather independent of COVID-19 severity, depression after COVID-19 is associated with persistent fatigue. Clarifying mechanisms and risk factors of post-COVID fatigue will allow to identify the target population and to tailor specific treatment and rehabilitation interventions to foster recovery.","Mazza, Palladini, Villa, De Lorenzo, Rovere Querini, Benedetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.08.008","20220827","COVID-19; Depression; Fatigue; Post-COVID syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36661,""

"Heightened COVID-19 Mortality in People With Severe Mental Illness Persists After Vaccination: A Cohort Study of Greater Manchester Residents","Previous studies show that people with severe mental illness (SMI) are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, however limited evidence exists regarding risk postvaccination. We investigated COVID-19 mortality among people with schizophrenia and other SMIs before, during and after the UK vaccine roll-out. Using the Greater Manchester (GM) Care Record to access routinely collected health data linked with death records, we plotted COVID-19 mortality rates over time in GM residents with schizophrenia/psychosis, bipolar disorder (BD), and/or recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) from February 2020 to September 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare mortality risk (risk ratios; RRs) between people with SMI (N = 193 435) and age-sex matched controls (N = 773 734), adjusted for sociodemographic factors, preexisting comorbidities, and vaccination status. Mortality risks were significantly higher among people with SMI compared with matched controls, particularly among people with schizophrenia/psychosis (RR 3.18, CI 2.94-3.44) and/or BD (RR 2.69, CI 2.16-3.34). In adjusted models, the relative risk of COVID-19 mortality decreased, though remained significantly higher than matched controls for people with schizophrenia (RR 1.61, CI 1.45-1.79) and BD (RR 1.92, CI 1.47-2.50), but not recurrent MDD (RR 1.08, CI 0.99-1.17). People with SMI continued to show higher mortality rate ratios relative to controls throughout 2021, during vaccination roll-out. People with SMI, notably schizophrenia and BD, were at greater risk of COVID-19 mortality compared to matched controls.

"Assessment of anxiety/depression among cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","To assess differences in the prevalence of anxiety/depression symptoms among cancer patients before (2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020); and the associations between anxiety/depression and sociodemographic and health behavior factors among cancer patients before and during the pandemic. We analyzed data from the 2019 (n= 856) and 2020 (n= 626) Health Information National Trends Survey, a nationally representative survey of US adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years. Only adults with a cancer diagnosis were used in the analyses. Anxiety/depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (low/none [0-2], mild [3-5], moderate [6-8], and severe [9-12]) and dichotomized as low/none and current anxiety/depression (mild/moderate/severe). Multivariate analysis was performed. The prevalence of anxiety/depression symptoms among cancer patients was 32.7% before the COVID-19 pandemic and 31.1% during the pandemic. The odds of anxiety/depression among patients with fair/poor health status was higher during the pandemic relative to before (before: [Odds Ratio] OR=1.85 vs during: OR=3.89). Participants aged 50-64 years (before: OR=0.29, CI [95% Confidence Interval]=0.11-0.76; during: OR=0.33, CI=0.11-0.97) and Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years (before: OR= 0.13, CI=0.05-0.34; during: OR=0.18, CI=0.07-0.47) had lower odds of anxiety/depression before and during the pandemic compared to those aged 35-49 years. Hispanics/Latinos had higher odds of anxiety/depression (OR=2.70, CI=1.11-6.57) before the pandemic and lower odds of anxiety/depression during the pandemic (OR=0.2, CI=0.05-1.01) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Those who completed high school (before: OR=0.08, CI=0.01-0.42), some college (before: OR=0.10, CI=0.02-0.42), Ã¢â€°Â¥college degree had lower odds of anxiety/depression symptoms (before: OR= 0.05, 95% CI= 0.01-0.26; during: OR= 0.06, CI= 0.01-0.61) compared to those with less than a high school education. Our results suggest the need to increase the provision of mental health services to cancer patients at high risk of developing anxiety/depression symptoms, particularly during public health emergencies, to alleviate further health burdens.

"To Hell and Back: A Performer's Mental Health Journey During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: The COVID-19 pandemic has induced a considerable amount of mental health difficulties, ranging from anxiety and depression to psychosis. As services struggle to cope with the demand for support, the effect of such psychological challenges on quality of life remains a major concern. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ WHAT DOES THE PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vast amount of research has focused on the physical consequences of the virus. Gradually, studies on the mental health effects related to the pandemic started to emerge, as it became clear that mental health difficulties were as present and as concerning as the physical ones. Whilst such studies commonly explore the prevalance and nature of the presenting mental health challenges, the publication of personal mental health experiences linked to the ongoing situation is lacking. Introducing the human element in literature is an important means of raising awareness on the mental health difficulties that can be triggered by the pandemic. Using public figures such as the individual in this paper is additionally powerful due to the role model effect. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The paper highlights the need for enhanced awareness and monitoring of mental health especially by health professionals who therefore need to receive adequate mental health training. Furthermore, mental health awareness efforts need to be considered as being a part of the role of the psychiatric and mental health nurse who is at a prime position to educate, monitor and support those receiving care.","Grech, Chircop, Azzopardi","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12868","20220827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36665,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Calls to a National Suicide Prevention Hotline in Taiwan: An Analysis of Time Trend and Characteristics of Calls","We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on call volumes and call characteristics using data from a national crisis helpline. Data were extracted for 215,066 calls to Taiwan's national suicide prevention hotline (January 2018-May 2020). We used negative binomial regression to investigate changes in the weekly number of calls during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak (January 21, 2020-May 25, 2020), relative to that expected according to the pre-pandemic trend. The call characteristics during the pandemic period (February 18, 2020-May 31, 2020) were compared between COVID-19 related vs unrelated calls. Higher-than-expected call volumes started from the 6th week of the pandemic and reached a peak in the 14th week, which was 38% (rate ratio = 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.26-1.51) higher than that expected based on the pre-pandemic trend. The higher-than-expected call volumes were mainly attributable to higher-than-expected calls from non-suicidal and male callers. Calls in which COVID-19 was mentioned (13.2%) were more likely to be from male and first-time callers, occur outside 12 am-6 am, last less than 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°min, and were less likely to be from callers who had previous suicide attempts, recent suicidal ideation or suicide plans or actions than COVID-19 unrelated calls. Callers who made COVID-19 related calls were more likely to request information than other callers. Crisis helplines should strategically adapt to the increased need and callers' specific concerns related to the outbreak.","Liu, Chang, Hwang, Shaw, Hsu, Hsu, Gunnell, Chang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2022.2114867","20220827","COVID-19; Taiwan; crisis helpline; suicide; trend","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36666,""
"Loneliness, loneliness literacy, and change in loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults: a cross-sectional study","Loneliness has become a significant public health concern for older people. However, little is known about the association of loneliness, loneliness literacy, and changes in loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic with mental well-being. The purpose of this study was to explore whether loneliness literacy is related to a lower risk of loneliness, increased loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, and improved mental well-being for community-based older adults. A telephone survey was conducted to collect data from older adults aged 65Ã‚Â years or older in Taiwan (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°804). Loneliness, change in loneliness during COVID-19, and loneliness literacy were the main variables. Mental well-being was assessed by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Related factors included personal level (demographics, health conditions, health behaviors, and problem-focused/ emotion-focused coping strategies), interpersonal level (marital status, living arrangements, social support, social participation, leisure activities, and social interactions during COVID-19), and societal level (areas and regions) factors. Four dimensions of loneliness literacy were identified by factor analysis: self-efficacy, social support, socialization, and in-home support. Self-efficacy and in-home support were related to lower loneliness. Lower self-efficacy, higher social support, and higher socialization were related to changes (increases) in loneliness during COVID-19. In-home support may prevent depressive symptoms, while self-efficacy was beneficial for better life satisfaction. In addition, emotion-focused coping may increase loneliness during COVID-19, while satisfaction with family support would be a protective factor against loneliness. Loneliness literacy is related to loneliness and increased loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building up an age-friendly community with embedded services/information and learning positive coping and mental resilience strategies are suggested.","Hsu, Chao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03396-7","20220826","COVID-19; Community; Coping strategy; Loneliness; Loneliness literacy; Mental well-being; Older adults; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36667,""
"[Chronic pain in elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic]","International studies have shown negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mood and levels of distress. Correlations between the pandemic and higher levels of pain as well as greater pain-related disability have also been found; however, studies report ambiguous results about whether elderly people cope differently with the pandemic and its effects. The University Hospital of WÃƒÂ¼rzburg offers multimodal pain therapy for older adults. The current study performed aÃ‚Â retrospective analysis of routine data measured during an interdisciplinary multimodal assessment. We compared nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°75Ã‚Â patients taking part in the therapy during 2018 and 2019 to nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42Ã‚Â patients assessed in 2020-2021. We measured pain, mental distress and physical functioning using the German Pain Questionnaire, clinical diagnosis, and geriatric tests of physical fitness. Both subgroups did not differ in demographic characteristics, neither did we find significant differences regarding pain intensity, pain-related disability, and mental health; however, patients before the pandemic reported aÃ‚Â higher number of days on which they felt limited due to pain. In the physical performance test, we even found significantly better results during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current data do not support an aggravation of pain or mental and physical well-being. Possible explanations could be better resilience in elderly people due to their experience of life, financial security or less change in their daily life.

"Mask-related skin changes among healthcare workers in a community-based hospital","During the COVID-19 pandemic, dermatologists within the Beaumont Farmington Hills' Dermatology program noticed an increase in conditions associated with mask wearing, such as ""maskne"" (acne in a mask distribution, thought to be caused by mask wearing), as well as worsening of previously diagnosed dermatologic conditions. The goal of our study was to explore various factors that impacted mask-related skin changes and howÃ‚Â these skin changes affected quality of life. A cross-sectional study was performed. The primary 10-item survey instrument administered was the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Respondents were asked a series of 10 additional questions concerning the degree to which abnormal mask-related skin conditions affect their skin symptoms, possible embarrassment/self-consciousness, and perceived impact of mask-related skin changes. A series of descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation charts, and graphical examinations of data was utilized to evaluate sample subgroup and outcome distributional patterns. Pearson r bivariate correlation coefficients between possible collinear predictive measures on the primary study outcome were calculated. A series of simple inferential chi-squared (ÃŽÂ§<sup>2</sup>) tests of independence were also conducted. A total of 370 out of 430 (86.0%) Beaumont Health employees noticed some degree of skin changes since the work-hours face mask requirement was instituted, while 378 out of 430 (87.9%) felt that their skin wasÃ‚Â better when not wearing a mask. The majority of respondents, 283 (65.8%), reported having at least a little symptomatic skin (i.e.,Ã‚Â itchy, painful, sore, stinging) during the prior week. Furthermore, 72.3% reported that they were at least a little embarrassed or self-conscious ofÃ‚Â their skin. Chi-squared analysis of composite DLQI scoreÃ‚Â categories by the number of types of masks utilized (Pearson X<sup>2</sup>=19.0, df=8, p=0.015), and some degree of symptomatic skin (Pearson X<sup>2</sup>=156.4, df=4, p&lt;0.001) were found to be statistically significant.

"Hardiness moderates the effects of COVID-19 stress on anxiety and depression","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sharp increases in mental health problems around the world, most notably in anxiety and depression. The present study examines hardiness and age as potential protective factors against the mental health effects of COVID-related stress. A sample of Canadians balanced across age and gender, completed an online survey including measures of COVID related stressors, hardiness, depression, and anxiety, along with age, gender, and other demographics. Conditional PROCESS analysis showed that COVID stressors led to significant increases in anxiety and depression. Hardiness moderated these relations, with those high in hardiness showing less anxiety and depression. Age was negatively related to anxiety and depression, with highest levels observed among the younger respondents. At the same time, a moderating effect of age was found with respect to depression, with older people showing sharper increases in depression as COVID-related stress goes up. Gender was not a significant factor in any of these relations, meaning that the results apply equally well to both women and men. This study provides evidence that younger people who are also low in hardiness are most vulnerable to developing anxiety and depression while under COVID stress, and so would likely benefit from preventive intervention strategies. While anxiety and depression symptoms are highest among the young, older age groups appear more vulnerable to increasing rates of depression symptoms related to COVID stress. Clinicians and practitioners should thus be especially vigilant for COVID related increases in depression among older people, and those low in psychological hardiness.","Bartone, McDonald, Hansma, Solomon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.045","20220826","Age; Anxiety; COVID-19 stress; Depression; Hardiness; Moderation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36670,""
"The impact of built environment on mental health: A COVID-19 lockdown perspective","Tackling mental health has become a priority for governments around the world because it influences not only individuals but also the whole society. As people spend a majority of their time (i.e., around 90%) in buildings, it is pivotal to understand the relationship between built environment and mental health, particularly during COVID-19 when people have experienced recurrent local and national lockdowns. Despite the demonstration by previous research that the design of the built environment can affect mental health, it is not clear if the same influence pattern remains when a 'black swan' event (e.g., COVID-19) occurs. To this end, we performed logistic regression and hierarchical regression analyses to examine the relationship between built environment and mental health utilising a data sample from the United Kingdom (UK) residents during the COVID-19 lockdown while considering their social demographics. Our results show that compared with depression and anxiety, people were more likely to feel stressed during the lockdown period. Furthermore, general house type, home workspace, and neighbourhood environment and amenity were identified to have significantly contributed to their mental health status. With the ensuing implications, this study represents one of the first to inform policymakers and built environment design professionals of how built environment should be designed to accommodate features that could mitigate mental health problems in any future crisis. As such, it contributes to the body of knowledge of built environment planning by considering mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Xiao, Zhao, Luo, Liu, Greenwood","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2022.102889","20220826","Built environment design; COVID-19 lockdowns; Mental health; Regression analysis; The UK","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36671,""
"Kratom use categories and their associations with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Kratom, a psychoactive substance, use is an evolving research area that needs more studies to augment the limited literature. Our study examines the association between kratom use categories and mental health and substance use disorders in the U.S. <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We used the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 32,893), a cross-sectional survey data, on the U.S. population aged 12 years or older. We used STATA/SE version 16 to perform a multinomial logistic regression analysis to assess our study aims. Bisexuals, compared to heterosexuals, had higher risks of kratom use within the past 30 days (relative risk ratio [RRR]= 2.47, 95% CI= 1.07, 5.71). Major depressive episode was positively associated with kratom use more than 30 days ago (RRR= 2.04, 95% CI= 1.24, 3.34). This association was also observed for mild (RRR= 2.04, 95% CI= 1.38, 3.02), moderate (RRR= 2.25, 95% CI= 1.13, 4.51), or severe alcohol use disorder (RRR= 1.88, 95% CI= 1.05, 3.36); and mild (RRR= 1.98, 95% CI= 1.27, 3.11), moderate (RRR= 2.38, 95% CI= 1.27, 4.45), or severe marijuana use disorder (RRR= 2.13, 95% CI= 1.02, 4.47).

"Presentations of children to emergency departments across Europe and the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational observational study","During the initial phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reduced numbers of acutely ill or injured children presented to emergency departments (EDs). Concerns were raised about the potential for delayed and more severe presentations and an increase in diagnoses such as diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health issues. This multinational observational study aimed to study the number of children presenting to EDs across Europe during the early COVID-19 pandemic and factors influencing this and to investigate changes in severity of illness and diagnoses. Routine health data were extracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children aged 18 years and under, presenting to 38 EDs in 16 European countries for the period January 2018 to May 2020, using predefined and standardized data domains. Observed and predicted numbers of ED attendances were calculated for the period February 2020 to May 2020. Poisson models and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), using predicted counts for each site as offset to adjust for case-mix differences, were used to compare age groups, diagnoses, and outcomes. Reductions in pediatric ED attendances, hospital admissions, and high triage urgencies were seen in all participating sites. ED attendances were relatively higher in countries with lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (IRR 2Ã‚Â·26, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·90 to 2Ã‚Â·70, p &lt; 0.001) and in children aged &lt;12 months (12 to &lt;24 months IRR 0Ã‚Â·86, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·84 to 0Ã‚Â·89; 2 to &lt;5 years IRR 0Ã‚Â·80, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·78 to 0Ã‚Â·82; 5 to &lt;12 years IRR 0Ã‚Â·68, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·67 to 0Ã‚Â·70; 12 to 18 years IRR 0Ã‚Â·72, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·70 to 0Ã‚Â·74; versus age &lt;12 months as reference group, p &lt; 0.001). The lowering of pediatric intensive care admissions was not as great as that of general admissions (IRR 1Ã‚Â·30, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·16 to 1Ã‚Â·45, p &lt; 0.001). Lower triage urgencies were reduced more than higher triage urgencies (urgent triage IRR 1Ã‚Â·10, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·08 to 1Ã‚Â·12; emergent and very urgent triage IRR 1Ã‚Â·53, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·49 to 1Ã‚Â·57; versus nonurgent triage category, p &lt; 0.001). Reductions were highest and sustained throughout the study period for children with communicable infectious diseases. The main limitation was the retrospective nature of the study, using routine clinical data from a wide range of European hospitals and health systems. Reductions in ED attendances were seen across Europe during the first COVID-19 lockdown period. More severely ill children continued to attend hospital more frequently compared to those with minor injuries and illnesses, although absolute numbers fell.

"Patterns in Mental Health Symptomatology and Cigarette, E-cigarette and Marijuana Use among Texas Youth and Young Adults Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study examined patterns in mental health symptomatology and smoking and vaping behaviors among youth and young adults over a one-year period from before to during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n=2,148) were 16-24-year-olds who completed three waves of the Texas Adolescent Tobacco and Marketing Surveillance Study (TATAMS). Descriptive statistics and mixed effects logistic regression models were used to examine changes in anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and cigarette, e-cigarette, and marijuana use from before COVID-19 (fall 2019) to 6-month follow-up (spring 2020) and 12-month follow-up (fall 2020) periods during COVID-19. Longitudinal associations between mental health symptomatology and smoking and vaping were examined. Modest increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed from before to during COVID-19. Perceived stress remained high and unchanged. Ever marijuana use increased at 6- and 12-month follow-up, while ever cigarette and e-cigarette use increased significantly only at 12-month follow-up. Marijuana use frequency increased significantly at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Adjusting for socio-demographic factors, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted increases in ever cigarette, e-cigarette, and marijuana use, and past 30-day cigarette and e-cigarette use, but not past 30-day marijuana use. Higher perceived stress predicted increases in ever use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and past 30-day cigarette use. Changes in mental health symptomatology and smoking and vaping behaviors among young people in Texas varied during this period of the COVID-era. Increases in mental health symptomatology predicted increases in cigarette, e-cigarette, and marijuana use behaviors. This study adds to limited research on the longitudinal impact of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress on cigarette, e-cigarette, and marijuana use from before to during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings warrant health messaging and interventions that address the significant impact of worse mental health on increased smoking and vaping behavior, especially during crises like COVID-19 that may exacerbate mental health and substance use behaviors.","Clendennen, Chen, Sumbe, Harrell","https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntac205","20220826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36674,""

In this retrospective observational study, we investigated the communication-language style, contents and user activity-in 7975 unique posts and 51,119 comments by NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2862 active adolescent users in a large suicidal ideation support community (SISC) on the social media website reddit.com in the onset period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found significant relative changes in language style markers for hopelessness such as negative emotion words (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.00%) and positive emotion words (-Ã‚Â 3.45%) as well as for social disengagement such as social references (-Ã‚Â 8.63%) and 2nd person pronouns (-Ã‚Â 33.97%) since the outbreak of the pandemic. Using topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified significant changes in content for the topics Hopelessness (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°23.98%), Suicide Methods (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.11%), Social Support (-Ã‚Â 14.91%), and Reaching Out to users (-Ã‚Â 28.97%). Changes in user activity point to an increased expression of mental health issues and decreased engagement with other users. The results indicate a potential shift in communication patterns with more adolescent users expressing their suicidal ideation rather than relating with or supporting other users during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Feldhege, Wolf, Moessner, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02067-7","20220826","Adolescents; Language style; Online self-help community; Social media; Suicidal ideation; Suicide attempt; Topic modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36675,""
"COVID-19-Induced Inequalities and Mental Health: Testing the Moderating Roles of Self-rated Health and Race/Ethnicity","This study examines the relationship among COVID-19-induced social, economic, and educational inequalities on mental health (i.e., anxiety and depression). This study also examines if levels of self-rated health (SRH) moderate the relationship (i.e., COVID-induced inequalities [CII] and mental health), as well as examines the racial/ethnic group differences among 567 young adults in the mid-Atlantic region. Using a moderation model, results indicate that CII were significantly related to depression (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.221, t(554)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.59, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.000) and anxiety (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.140, t(555)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.23, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). SRH and race/ethnicity also moderated both relationships. At above-average SRH (i.e., moderator), higher CII were also significantly related to lower anxiety (Asian young adults only) and lower depression (Asian and White young adults only). Overall, SRH and race/ethnicity are important factors in the mental health impact of COVID-19 on young adults.","Johnson, Hood, Moreno, Fuentes, Williams, Vassileva, Amstadter, Dick, Dick, Amstadter, Lilley, Gelzinis, Morris, Bountress, Adkins, Thomas, Neale, Pedersen, Bannard, Cho, Adkins, Barr, Byers, Berenz, Caraway, Cho, Clifford, Cooke, Do, Edwards, Goyal, Hack, Halberstadt, Hawn, Kuo, Lasko, Lend, Lind, Long, Martelli, Meyers, Mitchell, Moore, Moscati, Nasim, Neale, Opalesky, Overstreet, Pais, Pedersen, Raldiris, Salvatore, Savage, Smith, Sosnowski, Su, Thomas, Walker, Walsh, Willoughby, Woodroof, Yan, Sun, Wormley, Riley, Aliev, Peterson, Webb","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01389-1","20220826","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Multivariate analysis; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36676,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trends in corneal donor mortality data from Eye Bank records in India","To describe the causes and trends of corneal donor mortality from eye bank data in India during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This retrospective eye bank-based study included 13,529 donors who donated their cornea between January 2018 and December 2021. Donors in whom the cause of mortality was documented were included as cases. The data were collected from the eye bank records. Overall, 13,529 corneal donors were included in the study. Most of the donors were males (69.71%). The mean age of the donors was 51.55 Ã‚Â± 20.54 years, whereas the median age was 51 (inter-quartile range: 35-68) years. The mean age of males (49.3 Ã‚Â± 19.47 years) was lesser than the mean age of females (56.72 Ã‚Â± 21.94 years) at the time of donation. The most common age group at the time of donation was during the sixth decade of life with 2,139 (15.81%) donors. The mean age of the donors decreased by a decade from 54.95 Ã‚Â± 20.51 years in 2018 to 44.35 Ã‚Â± 18.88 years in 2021. The most common cause of donor mortality was cardio-respiratory arrest in 5,190 (38.36%) donors and trauma in 3,469 (25.64%) donors, followed by suicide in 2,790 (20.62%) donors. The trend of cardio-respiratory arrest decreased from 53.01% to 9.5% (p = &lt;0.00001), whereas the trends of trauma increased from 21.93% to 36% (p = &lt;0.00001) and suicide increased from 12.71% to 36.41% (p = &lt;0.00001) between 2018 and 2021. Corneal donors are more commonly males in their sixth decade of life. The most common cause of donor mortality was related to cardio-respiratory arrest with a concerning rising trend in suicide cases over the years seen significantly during the pandemic.","Das, Kommu, Chilukuri, Chilukuri, Chaurasia","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.IJO_778_22","20220826","COVID-19 pandemic; India; donor mortality; eye bank; mental health; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36677,""
"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress During COVID-19 Pandemic Among Females Who Live in Kuwait","Health regulations to constrain the progress of the pandemic such as lockdowns, curfews, and quarantines made radical alterations in every aspect of individuals' lives, causing significant impact on their mental health and well-being. The current study aimed to examine whether there are significant differences in participants' sociodemographic variables in reported cases of depression, anxiety, and stress among women who lived in Kuwait during the curfew and lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic. This study used a cross-sectional method. A nonrandom sample of 596 participants was recruited. The current study found that women at higher risk of reporting more incidents of depression, anxiety, and stress during the lockdown and curfew were from the older age group above 50Ã‚Â years old, hold higher educational certificates, and own private businesses. High rates of reported depression and anxiety were detected significantly among Kuwaiti women. The findings of this study reveal the significant impact of an uncomfortable and distressful environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may negatively affected individuals' mental health and generated diverse forms of psychosocial illness.","Al-Ma'Seb, Al-Sejari","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2022.2117254","20220826","COVID-19; Mental health; female","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36678,""

The present study aimed to compare the mental health status and the COVID-19 event impact between the survivors and the general population in Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran. A web-based cross-sectional survey was used. This study was performed using convenience sampling. In total, 1,766 participants were included in this study. The findings revealed that the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in both outpatient and hospitalized groups was significantly higher than that in the general population. Besides, the levels of anxiety and depression in the group receiving inpatient care and treatment had significantly elevated than those in the general population. Given the high prevalence rate of mental disorders, healthcare professionals are recommended to plan for various interventions and support services to boost community mental health status.","Hasannezhad Reskati, Kheradmand, Moosazadeh, Assadi, Shafizad, Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Hosseini, Elyasi","https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.1341","20220826","COVID-19; event impact; general population; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36679,""
"A case report and first-person account of an individual at risk for psychosis who improved during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to increase stress and mental health symptoms. We present the case of a young man at risk for psychosis who has paradoxically shown symptomatic and functional improvement as a result of circumstances produced by COVID-19. These changes were unexpected given the client's persistent mental health struggles in the year leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States and the expectation of an exacerbation of psychotic-like symptoms. This report is based on clinical assessments and the client's first-person account during the height of the pandemic when stay at home orders were in place. During the pandemic, the client demonstrated increased agency by taking on more responsibility at home and obtaining part-time employment. He showed improvement in his mood and relationships with others, had less symptom-related distress, and significantly reduced his cannabis use. The client interpreted these improvements in terms of changing his mindset toward more adaptive thoughts and engaging in healthy coping skills such as praying, reading, and healthy eating. This case highlights the importance of fostering agency in clients during a time of crisis and ensuring that clinicians be aware of potential biases about mental health symptom exacerbation.","Herrera, Sarac, Bilgrami, Dobbs, Jespersen, Haas, Garg, Shaik, Landa, Corcoran","https://doi.org/10.1080/17522439.2021.1915369","20220827","COVID-19 pandemic; case report; clinical high risk; first person account; psychosis risk; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36680,""
"Aesthetic experiences and flourishing in science: A four-country study","In response to the mental health crisis in science, and amid concerns about the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientists, this study seeks to identify the role of a heretofore under-researched factor for flourishing and eudaimonia: aesthetic experiences in scientific work. The main research question that this study addresses is: To what extent is the frequency of encountering aesthetics in terms of beauty, awe, and wonder in scientific work associated with greater well-being among scientists? Based on a large-scale (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,061) and representative international survey of scientists (biologists and physicists) in four countries (India, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States), this study employs sets of nested regressions to model the associations of aesthetic experiences with flourishing while controlling for demographic factors and negative workplace and life circumstances such as burnout, job/publication pressure, mistreatment, COVID-19 impacts, other stressful life events, serious psychological distress, and chronic health conditions. The results show that the frequency of aesthetic experiences in scientific work in the disciplines of biology and physics has a very large and statistically significant association with flourishing and eudaimonia that remains robust even when controlling for demographic factors and negative workplace and life circumstances, including COVID-19 impacts. Aesthetic experiences in scientific work are even as strongly associated with flourishing as the presence of serious psychological distress and are most strongly associated with the flourishing domain of meaning in life, thus pointing to a link with eudaimonic well-being. In line with neurophysiological evidence and positive psychological models of flow, self-transcendence, and intrinsic motivation, aesthetics are a key source of flourishing for scientists in the disciplines of biology and physics. While future research needs to test the causal mechanism, the strength of the findings could encourage leaders of scientific labs and research organizations generally to remove obstacles to experiencing the aesthetic dimensions of science. Fostering cultures in which the aesthetic experiences that are intrinsic to scientific practice are fully appreciated might potentially protect or boost flourishing by reducing the impacts of burnout, job/publication pressure, and mistreatment-related experiences in science.","Jacobi, Varga, Vaidyanathan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.923940","20220827","aesthetics; awe; beauty; flourishing; mental health crisis; scientific work; wonder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36681,""
"Exploring the Research Priorities for Occupational Therapy in India: A Descriptive Review","Occupational therapists are considered an important workforce for the rehabilitation of persons with disabilities globally. However, in India, the profession is just beginning to gain recognition within the national and state-level systems for health care. One of the reasons for this could be the paucity of specific research related to the development of occupational therapy (OT) and its benefits to the health systems. Therefore, it is of immense public health importance to explore the priorities and gaps in OT research in India. A vast majority of the OT research in India is promoted and disseminated through the All-India Occupational Therapists Association (AIOTA) and its annual national conference (ANC). The objective of this study is to descriptively review the conference abstracts of the AIOTA ANC published in the <i>Indian Journal of OT</i> (IJOT), an official publication of the AIOTA, from 2017 to 2021. The study design was a descriptive, nonsystematic review. Review of the abstracts selected for the AIOTA ANC published in the IJOT from 2017 to 2021. A data extraction form was developed and used to synthesize data related to the clinical and demographic characteristics of OT research in India. The search yielded 218 abstracts. State-level trends indicated that close to 85% of the research submissions were from four states and no submissions from the northeastern states until 2020. Nearly 60% of the abstracts were clinical research with OT interventions. About 40% of these research abstracts were related to pediatrics, followed by neurology (17%), musculoskeletal (15%), mental health (10%), and ergonomics and assistive technology (8%). There were 1%-2% of research abstracts submitted related to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and geriatrics. About 85% of the research abstracts were related to impairment (39%), activity limitation (26%), and social participation (22%). This review highlights the need for diversifying the research in OT in India. This is particularly important in relation to expanding from selected states to pan-India research and development, especially in the northeastern states. Furthermore, the focus of OT research must move beyond impairments and approach disability from the biopsychosocial perspective. It is also very important to diversify the research in OT to areas that are of public health importance such as COVID-19, geriatrics, noncommunicable diseases, and rehabilitation in health systems. Priority setting for research in OT in India is an important implication of this review.","Kamalakannan, Sethuraman, Chockalingam, Samuelkamaleshkumar, Moorthy, Srinivasan, Ramakrishnan, Muthuvel, Mani","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijoth.ijoth_58_22","20220827","Disability; Health Systems; Occupational Therapy; Rehabilitation; Research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36682,""

"Associations between coping styles, gender, their interaction and non-suicidal self-injury among middle school students in rural west China: A multicentre cross-sectional study","To investigate the association between coping styles, gender, their interactions and non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviors among middle school students in rural western China under COVID-19. A multicentre cross-sectional study method was used to conduct an online survey of 8,361 students from 23 middle schools in the northern Sichuan region by clustering sampling, using the General Information Questionnaire, the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory, and the Coping Style Scale for Middle School Students. The past year prevalence of NSSI among middle school students in rural west China was 5.7%. The differences in scores between those with and without NSSI on all dimensions of coping styles were statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that vocational high school (<i>OR</i> = 1.67), girls (<i>OR</i> = 2.5), single parent with divorced parents (<i>OR</i> = 1.89), remarriage with divorced parents (<i>OR</i> = 1.81), and tolerance (<i>OR</i> = 1.17), venting emotions (<i>OR</i> = 1.15) and fantasy/denial (<i>OR</i> = 1.07) in coping styles may increase the risk of NSSI among middle school students, while problem solving (<i>OR</i> = 0.9) and seeking social support (<i>OR</i> = 0.9) among coping styles may reduce the risk of NSSI among middle school students. The interaction results show that gender has a moderating role in the process of endurance, avoidance, venting of emotions, and fantasy/denial influencing non-suicidal self-injury in middle school students. There is an association between coping styles and self-injury among middle school students in rural areas in western China, with gender playing a moderating role. Active attention should be paid to students' coping styles and encouraging them to adopt positive coping styles as well as avoid negative coping styles, especially in the case of girls, which can help prevent self-injury.","Zhou, Zhang, Huang, Zhao, Xiao, Zhang, Li, Zhao, Ma, Ou, Wang, Ou, Luo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.861917","20220827","coping styles; gender; interactive effects; middle school students; non-suicidal self-injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36684,""

"The pandemic coping scale - validity and reliability of a brief measure of coping during a pandemic","This study assessed the validity and reliability of the Pandemic Coping Scale (PCS), a new brief measure of coping with pandemic-related stressors. The PCS was administered to <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2316 German participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was applied among random splits of the sample. Global goodness of fit (<i>Ãâ€¡</i> <sup>2</sup>, RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, TLI), local goodness of fit (factor loadings, communalities, factor reliability, discriminant validity) and additional test quality criteria (internal consistency, item discrimination and difficulty) were evaluated for a four-factor model vs. a four-factor model combined with a second-order general factor. Convergent and divergent validity were examined by Pearson correlations of the PCS subscales with the Brief-COPE subscales; criterion validity was evaluated by correlations with wellbeing (WHO-5), depressive (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-2). Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution ('Healthy Lifestyle', 'Joyful Activities', 'Daily Structure', 'Prevention Adherence'). Confirmatory factor analysis showed a sufficient global fit for both specified models which did not differ in their fit to the data. Local goodness of fit indices showed moderate to large factor loadings and good factor reliabilities except for the subscale 'Prevention Adherence'. Internal consistencies were good for the PCS total scale (<i>ÃŽÂ±</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.83), the 'Healthy Lifestyle' (<i>ÃŽÂ±</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.79) and the 'Daily Structure' (<i>ÃŽÂ±</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.86) subscales, acceptable for 'Joyful Activities' (<i>ÃŽÂ±</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.60), and low for 'Prevention Adherence' (<i>ÃŽÂ±</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.52). The four subscales evidenced convergent and divergent validity with the Brief-COPE subscales. The subscales 'Healthy lifestyle', 'Joyful activities' and 'Daily structure' showed criterion validity with wellbeing, depressive and anxiety symptoms.

"Current Vaccine Platforms in Enhancing T-Cell Response","The induction of T cell-mediated immunity is crucial in vaccine development. The most effective vaccine is likely to employ both cellular and humoral immune responses. The efficacy of a vaccine depends on T cells activated by antigen-presenting cells. T cells also play a critical role in the duration and cross-reactivity of vaccines. Moreover, pre-existing T-cell immunity is associated with a decreased severity of infectious diseases. Many technical and delivery platforms have been designed to induce T cell-mediated vaccine immunity. The immunogenicity of vaccines is enhanced by controlling the kinetics and targeted delivery. Viral vectors are attractive tools that enable the intracellular expression of foreign antigens and induce robust immunity. However, it is necessary to select an appropriate viral vector considering the existing anti-vector immunity that impairs vaccine efficacy. mRNA vaccines have the advantage of rapid and low-cost manufacturing and have been approved for clinical use as COVID-19 vaccines for the first time. mRNA modification and nanomaterial encapsulation can help address mRNA instability and translation efficacy. This review summarizes the T cell responses of vaccines against various infectious diseases based on vaccine technologies and delivery platforms and discusses the future directions of these cutting-edge platforms.","Ura, Takeuchi, Kawagoe, Mizuki, Okuda, Shimada","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081367","20220826","T-cell-mediated immunity; infectious diseases; mRNA vaccines; vaccines; viral vectors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36691,""
"Network Analysis of Well-Being Dimensions in Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Samples of University Students from Poland during the Fourth Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although numerous studies investigated the predictors of vaccination intention and decision, little is known about the relationship between vaccination and well-being. This study compares the physical and mental health dimensions among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. In a cross-sectional online survey, 706 university students from Poland (mean age of 23 years, 76% of women) participated in this study during the fourth pandemic wave (November-December 2021). Standardized questionnaires with a Likert response scale were included in the survey to measure spirituality, exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived physical health, stress, coronavirus-related PTSD, fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction. Consistent with the fuzzy-trace theory, the unvaccinated sample was younger and scored significantly lower than the vaccinated group in exposure to COVID-19, perceived physical health, stress, coronavirus-related PTSD, fear of COVID-19, and depression, while higher in life satisfaction. The network analysis showed that mental health plays a crucial role in both groups, with the central influence of anxiety and stress on depression and life satisfaction. The message on vaccination to university students should focus on the benefits of vaccination in maintaining the status quo of good health and well-being. Campus prevention programs should primarily aim to reduce anxiety, stress, and negative emotions by teaching students coping strategies, relaxation techniques, and mindfulness.","Rogowska, Chilicka, Ochnik, Paradowska, Nowicka, Bojarski, Tomasiewicz, Filipowicz, Grabarczyk, BabiÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081334","20220826","mental health; network analysis; physical health; subjective well-being; university students; vaccination intention and decision","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36692,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Emergency Medicine: A Systematic Review","(1) <i>Background and Objectives:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably affected clinical systems, especially the emergency department (ED). A decreased number of pediatric patients and changes in disease patterns at the ED have been noted in recent research. This study investigates the real effect of the pandemic on the pediatric ED comprehensively by performing a systematic review of relevant published articles. (2) <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A systematic review was conducted based on a predesigned protocol. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for relevant articles published until 30 November 2021. Two independent reviewers extracted data by using a customized form, and any conflicts were resolved through discussion with another independent reviewer. The aggregated data were summarized and analyzed. (3) <i>Results:</i> A total of 25 articles discussing the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric emergencies were included after full-text evaluation. Geographic distribution analysis indicated that the majority of studies from the European continent were conducted in Italy (32%, 8/25), whereas the majority of the studies from North America were conducted in the United States (24%, 6/25). The majority of the studies included a study period of less than 6 months and mostly focused on the first half of 2020. All of the articles revealed a decline in the number of pediatric patients in the ED (100%, 25/25), and most articles mentioned a decline in infectious disease cases (56%, 14/25) and trauma cases (52%, 13/25). (4) <i>Conclusions:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decline in the number of pediatric patients in the ED, especially in the low-acuity patient group. Medical behavior changes, anti-epidemic policies, increased telemedicine use, and family financial hardship were possible factors. A decline in common pediatric infectious diseases and pediatric trauma cases was noted. Researchers should focus on potential child abuse and mental health problems during the pandemic.","Cheng, Huang, Chao, Ng, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58081112","20220826","COVID-19; pediatric emergency department; pediatric patient volume; pediatric trauma patient","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36693,""
"Did Usage of Mental Health Apps Change during COVID-19? A Comparative Study Based on an Objective Recording of Usage Data and Demographics","This paper aims to objectively compare the use of mental health apps between the pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 periods and to study differences amongst the users of these apps based on age and gender. The study utilizes a dataset collected through a smartphone app that objectively records the users' sessions. The dataset was analyzed to identify users of mental health apps (38 users of mental health apps pre-COVID-19 and 81 users during COVID-19) and to calculate the following usage metrics; the daily average use time, the average session time, the average number of launches, and the number of usage days. The mental health apps were classified into two categories: guidance-based and tracking-based apps. The results include the increased number of users of mental health apps during the COVID-19 period as compared to pre-COVID-19. Adults (aged 24 and above), compared to emerging adults (aged 15-24 years), were found to have a higher usage of overall mental health apps and guidance-based mental health apps. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, males were found to be more likely to launch overall mental health apps and guidance-based mental health apps compared to females. The findings from this paper suggest that despite the increased usage of mental health apps amongst males and adults, user engagement with mental health apps remained minimal. This suggests the need for these apps to work towards improved user engagement and retention.","Aziz, Erbad, Almourad, Altuwairiqi, McAlaney, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12081266","20220826","COVID-19; digital health; mental health; mindfulness; mobile health; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36694,""

The Ã¢â€°Â¥19-year-old population in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2019 and 2020 was included. The histories of depression, stress, and suicidal attempts were compared between the 2019 and 2020 cohorts using multiple logistic regression analysis with complex sampling. The prevalence of depression was not significantly different between the 2019 and 2020 groups (4.1% vs. 4.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.326).

"A Retrospective Chart Review of Factors Impacting Psychotropic Prescribing Patterns and Polypharmacy Rates in Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic","High but variable rates of psychotropic polypharmacy (PP) in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been reported in previous studies. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on prescribing patterns has not been well described. This study aims to examine the factors associated with psychotropic prescribing patterns, including rates of PP and multiclass polypharmacy (MPP) in youth with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the prescription records and clinical characteristics of youth aged between 3-21 years with a clinical diagnosis of ASD who were followed at an urban tertiary autism center psychiatry clinic between 1 January 2019, and 31 December 2020. For study purposes, we treated 2019 as the pre-pandemic year and 2020 as the pandemic year and compared the clinical characteristics of the ""total clinic cohort <i>(n =</i> 898)"" across two years. We examined the clinical characteristics of patients seen in both years (""paired-sample,"" <i>n</i> = 473) and those seen only in 219 (""not-paired sample,"" <i>n</i> = 378) to identify factors associated with the likelihood of patients' return to clinic in 2020. As the total clinic cohort was a naturalistic sample containing duplicate patients, we created a separate data set by randomly assigning duplicate patients to one of the years (""random unique sample,"" <i>n</i> = 898) and examined the clinical characteristics across two years. We defined PP and MPP broadly as the use of Ã¢â€°Â¥2 unique medications (PP) and Ã¢â€°Â¥2 unique medication classes (MPP) within a calendar year in this study. In the total clinic cohort, increased rates of PP (71.6% to 75.6%), MPP (61.9% to 67.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.027), and antidepressant prescriptions (56.9% to 62.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.028) were noted, although only the latter two were nominally significant. The paired-sample had a higher proportion of teens (31.0% vs. 39.7%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 and persons who self-identified as non-Hispanic (77.8% vs. 85.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.016)), higher rates of anxiety (78.9% vs. 48.7%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), ADHD (71.0% vs. 44.4%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), depression (23.9% vs. 13.0%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and disruptive behavior (63.3% vs. 33.3%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) diagnoses, higher rates of antidepressants (63.4% vs. 48.7%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), ADHD medications (72.5% vs. 59.8%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and antipsychotics (36.8% vs. 26.2%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) prescribed, and higher rates of PP (81.6% vs. 59.0%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and MPP (71.0% vs. 50.5%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) than the not-paired sample. In the random unique sample, the patient group assigned to 2020 had higher rates of anxiety (75.0% vs. 60.2%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), ADHD (69.9% vs. 54.6%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and disruptive behavior (57.9% vs. 45.4%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) diagnoses but the PP and MPP rates did not differ across years. Overall, we found high rates of PP and MPP, likely due to the broader definition of PP and MPP used in this study than those in other studies as well as the study site being a tertiary clinic. While our study suggests a possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on comorbidity rates and prescribing patterns, a replication study is needed to confirm how pandemic-related factors impact prescribing patterns and polypharmacy rates in youth with ASD.","Taniguchi, Conant, Keller, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11164855","20220826","COVID-19; autism; demographic; polypharmacy; psychiatry; psychotropic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36696,""
"Physical Activity Level and Perspectives of Participants Transitioning from Onsite to Virtual Cardiac Rehabilitation during the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Method Study","This mixed-method study aimed to compare physical activity (PA) patterns of a cross-over cardiac rehabilitation (CR) cohort with a center-based CR cohort and to explore barriers and facilitators of participants transitioning and engaging in virtual CR. It included the retrospective self-reported PA of a cross-over CR cohort (n = 75) and a matched center-based CR cohort (n = 75). Some of the participants included in the cross-over cohort (n = 12) attended semi-structured focus group sessions and results were interpreted in the context of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model. Differences between groups were not observed (<i>p</i> &amp;gt; 0.05). The center-based CR cohort increased exercise frequency (<i>p</i> = 0.002), duration (<i>p</i> = 0.007), and MET/minutes (<i>p</i> = 0.007) over time. The cross-over cohort increased exercise duration (<i>p</i> = 0.04) with no significant change in any other parameters. Analysis from focus groups revealed six overarching themes classified under predisposing factors (knowledge), enabling factors (external support, COVID-19 restrictions, mental health, personal reasons/preferences), and reinforcing factors (recommendations). These findings suggest an improvement of the PA levels of center-based CR cohort participants pre-pandemic and mitigated improvement in those who transitioned to a virtual CR early in the pandemic. Improving patients' exercise-related knowledge, provider endorsements, and the implementation of group videoconferencing sessions could help overcome barriers to participation in virtual CR.","Vanzella, Ghisi, Colella, Larkin, Vanderlei, Marzolini, Thomas, Oh","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11164838","20220826","COVID-19; cardiac rehabilitation; mixed methods; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36697,""
"Hospitalizations for Anorexia Nervosa during the COVID-19 Pandemic in France: A Nationwide Population-Based Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on mental health, including on food-related behaviors. However, little is known about the effect of the pandemic on anorexia nervosa (AN). We sought to assess an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and a potential increase in hospitalizations for AN in France. We compared the number of hospitalizations with a diagnosis of AN during the 21-month period following the onset of the pandemic with the 21-month period before the pandemic using Poisson regression models. We identified a significant increase in hospitalizations for girls aged 10 to 19 years (+45.9%, RR = 1.46[1.43-1.49]; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001), and for young women aged 20 to 29 (+7.0%; RR = 1.07[1.04-1.11]; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001). Regarding markers of severity, there was an increase in hospitalizations for AN associated with a self-harm diagnosis between the two periods. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of being admitted for self-harm with AN increased significantly during the pandemic period among patients aged 20-29 years (aOR = 1.39[1.06-1.81]; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05 vs. aOR = 1.15[0.87-1.53]; NS), whereas it remained high in patients aged 10 to 19 years (aOR = 2.40[1.89-3.05]; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001 vs. aOR = 3.12[2.48-3.98]; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001).

"The Higher the CKD Stage, the Higher the Psychological Stress in Patients with CKD during COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is related to psychological distress. Such distress depends on various factors. We previously reported that hemodialysis patients have more psychological distress than peritoneal dialysis patients among patients on dialysis in the COVID-19 pandemic era. However, no study has reported how psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic depends on renal function in the entire group of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 according to CKD stage. This was a cross-sectional study that included 397 CKD patients who visited a hospital from August 2020 to November 2020. Patients responded to questionnaires covering depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7), psychological impact of event (22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R), insomnia (7-item Insomnia severity Index, ISI), concerns, and precautionary measures about COVID-19. According to eGFR and dialysis status, patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with CKD stage 1~2, (2) patients with CKD stage 3~5 without dialysis, and (3) dialysis patients. The higher the CKD stage, the higher the GAD-7 (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and the ISI score (<i>p</i> = 0.001). When patients with CKD stage 1~2 and CKD stage 3~5 (with or without dialysis) were compared, PHQ-9 (<i>p</i> = 0.026), GAD-7 (<i>p</i> = 0.010), and ISI score (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were higher in the CKD stage 3~5 group. However, when comparing those with and without dialysis, only the ISI score (<i>p</i> = 0.008) showed a significant difference. More severe kidney dysfunction in CKD patients was associated with more psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as CKD stage increases, more attention should be paid to the mental care of these patients.","Lee, Kim, Hwang, Cho, Park, Gil, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11164776","20220826","CKD; COVID-19; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36699,""
"A Path Model for Subjective Well-Being during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Study among Polish and Ukrainian University Students","Previous studies showed several associations between physical and mental health dimensions and well-being. This study aims to examine a complex path model explaining the life satisfaction of university students from Poland and Ukraine during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional web-based study was performed in November 2020 using Google Forms. The conventional sample of 3230 university students from Poland (<i>n</i> = 1581) and Ukraine (<i>n</i> = 1649), aged 18-59 (<i>M</i> = 21.40, <i>SD</i> = 3.46), with 59% women, participated in the study. We used standardized questionnaires to measure life satisfaction (SWLS), self-reported physical health (GSRH), perceived stress (PSS-10), coronavirus-related PTSD (PCL-S), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). We also developed some questions to assess the exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic, positive effects of the pandemic, religiosity, and physical activity (PA). We found a high prevalence of stress, coronavirus-related PTSD, anxiety, and depression and a low level of life satisfaction and physical health. Polish students, women, and those with insufficient PA levels reported worse physical and mental health than Ukrainians, men, and those who exercised sufficiently during the pandemic. Low perceived stress can directly predict life satisfaction, anxiety, and depression. Low stress also leads to better physical health, sufficient PA levels, high religiosity, and more perceived positive effects of the pandemic. Several indirect effects between particular variables and life satisfaction were also found in the path model. The target group for campus prevention programs is Polish university students, women, and people with insufficient PA levels. Intervention and prevention programs should focus on coping strategies and techniques for improving mental and physical health.","Rogowska, KuÃ…â€ºnierz, Pavlova, Chilicka","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11164726","20220826","anxiety; coronavirus-related PTSD; depression; gender; mental health; perceived stress; physical health; relationship status; university students; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36700,""

Migraine, MOH was defined as The International Classification of Headache Disorders Third edition. CDH was defined as a headache occurring at least 15 days per month. K-means++ were used to perform clustering. Among 2858 valid responses, headache disorders, migraine, CDH, and MOH prevalence was 11.97%, 0.91%, 1.57%, and 0.70%, respectively. Combined-analgesic and non-opioid analgesic were widely used. Only one migraineur used prophylactic medication. We performed k-means++ to group the 332 MOH patients into four clusters. Cluster 1 seemed to have tension-type headache-like headache characteristics, cluster 2 seemed to have MOH-like headache characteristics, cluster 3 seemed to have severe headaches with comorbidities such as dyslipidemia, stroke, and depression, and cluster 4 seemed to have migraine-like headache characteristics with photophobia and phonophobia.

"Proprietary Model of Qualification for In-Hospital Rehabilitation after COVID-19","Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Poland, 6,128,006 people have been diagnosed, of which 116,798 died. Patients who recovered from COVID-19 and require rehabilitation due to varied impairments should be provided an opportunity to participate in an individualized, complex rehabilitation program starting from acute care and being continued in the post-acute and long-term rehabilitation phase. It is recommended to offer out-patient and in-hospital rehabilitation procedures depending on the type and persistence of symptoms and dysfunctions. The aim of this paper is to present the qualification process of post-COVID19 patients for an in-hospital complex rehabilitation program developed on the basis of pulmonary physical therapy. The presented qualification program was developed on the basis of clinical experience of over 2000 patients participating in the pilot program of in-hospital rehabilitation launched in September 2020 and based on the Regulation of the Polish Minister of Health of 13 July 2020. The proposed model of patients' qualification rests on well-known and validated tools for functional assessment: exercise tolerance assessment, dyspnea intensity assessment, functional fitness assessment, assessment of arterial blood saturation, lung ventilation function assessment, assessment of long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms, and patient's basic mental health condition. The proposed qualification model for the post-COVID rehabilitation program allows us to introduce adequate qualifications followed by much needed assessment of the health effects.","Szczegielniak, Szczegielniak, Ã…Âuniewski, Bogacz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610450","20220826","COVID-19; physical therapy; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36702,""
"Promoting University Students' Mental Health through an Online Multicomponent Intervention during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The mental health of university students is a serious public health issue. The alarming trend of high levels of untreated psychological distress observed during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for prevention programs. Digital tools are a promising means of delivering such programs. Web-based programs are acceptable and effective at improving mental health problems and general mental well-being. However, the usefulness of such digital prevention approaches to address the multiple issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be tested. The current study assessed the effectiveness of an 8-week online intervention, integrating a variety of evidence-based strategies for improving French university students' mental health. Students were assigned to: (1) the online self-help program ETUCARE (<i>n</i> = 53), or (2) the control condition (<i>n</i> = 50). All the participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires that assessed mental health problems and psychological well-being. The findings revealed that, compared to the control group, participation in the online program was associated with higher levels of psychological well-being post-test and fewer clinical symptoms of psychological distress, anxiety, and alcohol consumption. These preliminary findings suggest that the ETUCARE program is a promising multicomponent intervention to buffer the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in French university students.","Theurel, Witt, Shankland","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610442","20220826","COVID-19; mental health; online; self-help program; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36703,""
"Uncertainty and Well-Being amongst Homeworkers in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study of University Staff","The COVID-19 pandemic heightened uncertainties in people's lives-and was itself a source of fresh uncertainty. We report a study of homeworkers on whether such uncertainties, and particularly those related to their work environment, are associated with lower levels of well-being and whether this association is exacerbated by prior poor well-being. We focus on five uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and employment-the virus, the job quality, workload, logistics of work lives, and support from the employer. Our empirical tests show that uncertainties around the virus, employer support, and their job quality have the strongest negative associations with well-being. These are based on data collected over three time periods in the first year of the pandemic from a sample of university staff (academics and non-academics) and well-being is measured on two continua, anxiety-contentment and depression-enthusiasm. The effects of uncertainties around workload and logistics are less pronounced, but more apparent among employees with better (not poorer) past well-being, at various times of the recession. The study adds to our understanding of the pandemic and highlights the need to link uncertainty to mental health more than it has in the past.","Wood, Michaelides, Daniels, Niven","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610435","20220826","COVID-19; homeworking; job quality; uncertainty; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36704,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on University Students: An Analysis of Its Influence on Psychological and Academic Factors","The irruption of COVID-19 has had different consequences on mental health in the youth population. Specifically, the sector made up of university students has suffered an abrupt change of teaching modality because of the pandemic. As such, this paper aims to analyze the impact that COVID-19 has had on different personal factors of students: (i) satisfaction with life; (ii) lived uncertainty; (iii) depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as factors related to academic development; (iv) motivation and the creation of teaching and learning strategies during this period; and (v) the perception of the degree of adaptability to the new scenario brought about by the university system. For this purpose, a cross-sectional quantitative design was advocated through the elaboration of an SEM model, which included 1873 university students from Andalusian Universities (Spain). The results reflected the strong negative impact that the pandemic had, especially on the levels of life satisfaction and the indices of depression, anxiety, and stress of the students. Likewise, the findings reflected the relevance of the correct adaptability on the part of the university to these new circumstances. It is necessary for university institutions to focus their efforts on quality attention to students, in order to establish fluid communication with them and to adapt to their academic and personal needs.","GÃƒÂ³mez-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Ramos-Navas-Parejo, de la Cruz-Campos, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-JimÃƒÂ©nez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610433","20220826","COVID-19; academic motivation; depression; higher education; life satisfaction; structural equation modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36705,""
"The Relationship between Self-Concept and Negative Emotion: A Moderated Mediation Model","<b>Background:</b> Emotional problems such as depression and anxiety are very serious among college students, especially during the COVID-2019 pandemic. The present study aimed to explore the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between self-concept and negative emotion, and the moderating role of exercise intensity in the direct and indirect effect of self-concept on negative emotion among college students. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 739 Chinese college students aged between 18 and 25 years (M = 20.13; SD = 1.67) were selected to complete the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS), the Depression Anxiety Stress Self Rating Scale, the Adolescent Psychological Resilience Scale, and the Physical Exercise Scale (PARS-3) to assess self-concept, negative emotions, psychological resilience, and exercise intensity, respectively. Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to test the relationships among these variables. <b>Results:</b> Self-concept was negatively correlated with negative emotions; psychological resilience partially mediated the association between self-concept and negative emotions; exercise intensity moderated the effect of self-concept on negative emotions, and college students with low intensity physical activity would strengthening the association between self-concept and psychological resilience, psychological resilience, and negative emotions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Psychological resilience is a critical mediating mechanism through which self-concept is associated with negative emotions among college students, and exercise intensity plays a role as a moderating variable in the direct and indirect influence of self-concept on negative emotions.

"Determinants of Suicide Ideation in the Romanian Population","Suicide ideation and behaviors are directly linked to the risk of death by suicide. In Romania, as well as worldwide, increased suicide rates were observed in the recent past, more so in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of psychosocial factors, quality of life (QOL), and loneliness dimensions and adverse life antecedents on suicide ideation (SI) and prolonged sadness (PS). This cross-sectional quantitative research study used a CATI data gathering method to investigate 1102 randomly selected individuals over 18 years of age regarding various determinants of SI and PS. Data were collected in June 2021. Descriptive, inferential, and multivariate statistics were used for data analysis. SI was negatively correlated with all the assessed psychosocial factors, more significantly with family relationships, wealth, health, social relationships, and affective life. Stronger correlations were observed when investigating the state of prolonged sadness, sex, and affective lives along with health and income, which were more influential. SI was negatively correlated with QOL and positively correlated with adverse life events and total loneliness scores. Lesser educated youngsters with reduced overall happiness and a history of depression, self-harm, and trauma were at greater risk of developing SI. This is the first national study exploring the suicide ideation and prolonged sadness in relation to psychosocial factors, quality of life, and adverse life events. These results have important implications for suicide prevention programs, which should be designed in accordance with similar studies.","Vuscan, Faludi, Rusu, Vica, Balici, Siserman, Coman, Matei","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610384","20220826","loneliness; prolonged sadness; psychosocial determinants; quality of life; suicide ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36707,""
"Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms and Their Relationships with Ego-Resiliency and Life Satisfaction among Well-Educated, Young Polish Citizens during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Ego-resiliency is a set of traits that promotes positive adaptation to life's vicissitudes. High ego-resiliency helps in upholding one's personality system when facing adversity and in adjusting it to new environmental demands. Our study aimed at evaluating the connections between ego-resiliency, the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. A total of 604 Polish citizens aged 16 to 69 years participated in the online survey. Ego-resiliency was measured with the Ego Resiliency Scale (ER89-R12), anxiety and depression with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and life satisfaction with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Statistical analyses were performed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The results revealed correlations between the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction, and the intensity of ego-resiliency. Individuals with a high level of ego-resiliency tended to experience a lower intensity of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, individuals with a high level of ego-resiliency exhibited a higher level of life satisfaction. Our conclusions might assist in better understanding the close link between levels of ego-resiliency, the occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and satisfaction with life among Polish individuals experiencing crises.","Goryczka, DÃ„â„¢bski, Gogola, Gorczyca, Piegza","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610364","20220826","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; ego-resiliency; life satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36708,""
"Lowered Quality of Life in Long COVID Is Predicted by Affective Symptoms, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Inflammation and Neuroimmunotoxic Pathways","The physio-affective phenome of Long COVID-19 is predicted by (a) immune-inflammatory biomarkers of the acute infectious phase, including peak body temperature (PBT) and oxygen saturation (SpO2), and (b) the subsequent activation of immune and oxidative stress pathways during Long COVID. The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as the increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version, Geneva, Switzerland) and the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1ÃŽÂ², IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID.","Maes, Al-Rubaye, Almulla, Al-Hadrawi, Stoyanova, Kubera, Al-Hakeim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610362","20220826","Long COVID; depression; inflammation; myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome; neuro-immune; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36709,""
"How Did Work-Related Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Hamper Healthcare Employee Performance during COVID-19? The Mediating Role of Job Burnout and Mental Health","The study objective was to examine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of healthcare employees. The study was informed by a theoretical framework that incorporates different psychological issues (i.e., stress, depression, and anxiety) that influence healthcare workers' performance through the mediating roles of job burnout and mental health. The study data was gathered through structured questionnaires from 669 participants working in the healthcare sector in Pakistan. A structured equation modeling (SEM) technique was used for data analysis and hypothesis development. It was found that stress, depression, and anxiety positively affected healthcare employees' job performance during COVID-19. Psychological factors had a positive and significant impact on job burnout and mental health. Job burnout and mental health mediated the relationship between stress, anxiety, depression, and employee performance. The ongoing repercussions of COVID-19 include their impact on employee performance in the healthcare sector. Healthcare worker performance is critical to fostering industrial economic growth. Elevated levels of stress, depression, and anxiety have profoundly exacerbated employee mental health issues. COVID-19 has created challenging working conditions in organizations requiring that they address the growing psychological issues which impact negatively on worker performance.","Sun, Sarfraz, Ivascu, Iqbal, Mansoor","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610359","20220826","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; job burnout; mental health; psychological well-being; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36710,""
"Chinese College Students' Physical-Exercise Behavior, Negative Emotions, and Their Correlation during the COVID-19 Outbreak","In the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of college students' physical exercise, the detection rate of negative emotions, and their correlation should attract extensive attention. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the correlation between college students' physical exercise and negative emotions. Data were collected via a web-based cross-sectional survey. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3118 college students from five universities in Shanghai in March 2022. In addition to sociodemographic information, measures included Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). The chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to analyze the differences and test the relative risk of negative emotions caused by different amounts of physical exercise. Most students (66.1%) performed a small amount of physical exercise. Male students' physical-exercise level was higher than female students', and the detection rate of negative emotions was lower than that of female students. Moderate and low physical-exercise levels were associated with a higher risk of depression (beta of 0.289 and 0.345, respectively) and anxiety (beta of 0.301 and 0.418) symptoms than high physical-exercise level. The anxiety symptoms of college students were significant during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The physical-exercise behavior of college students was closely related to negative emotions, and the weakening of physical-exercise behavior was one of the factors that induced negative emotions in college students.","Han, Li, Ke, Wang, Meng, Li, Cui, Tong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610344","20220826","COVID-19; college student; exercise behavior; health promotion; mental health; negative emotion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36711,""
"Earlier Bedtime and Effective Coping Skills Predict a Return to Low-Risk of Depression in Young Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","To determine the persistent effects of the pandemic on mental health in young adults, we categorized depressive symptom trajectories and sought factors that promoted a reduction in depressive symptoms in high-risk individuals. Specifically, longitudinal analysis investigated changes in the risk for depression before and during the pandemic until December 2021 in 399 young adults (57% female; age range: 22.8 Ã‚Â± 2.6 years) in the United States (U.S.) participating in the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) was administered multiple times before and during the pandemic. A score Ã¢â€°Â¥10 identified individuals at high-risk for depression. Self-reported sleep behavior, substance use, and coping skills at the start of the pandemic were assessed as predictors for returning to low-risk levels while controlling for demographic factors. The analysis identified four trajectory groups regarding depression risk, with 38% being at low-risk pre-pandemic through 2021, 14% showing persistent high-risk pre-pandemic through 2021, and the remainder converting to high-risk either in June 2020 (30%) or later (18%). Of those who became high-risk in June 2020, 51% were no longer at high-risk in 2021. Logistic regression revealed that earlier bedtime and, for the older participants (mid to late twenties), better coping skills were associated with this declining risk. Results indicate divergence in trajectories of depressive symptoms, with a considerable number of young adults developing persistent depressive symptoms. Healthy sleep behavior and specific coping skills have the potential to promote remittance from depressive symptoms in the context of the pandemic.","Zhao, Wang, Kiss, Yuksel, de Zambotti, Clark, Goldston, Nooner, Brown, Tapert, Thompson, Nagel, Pfefferbaum, Sullivan, Pohl, Baker","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610300","20220826","COVID-19; coping; depressive symptoms; sleep; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36712,""
"Mental Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study of Women Receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Allowance in Hong Kong","Welfare recipients were often considered the least deserving of COVID-related support. Despite the recent attention paid to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, few studies have explored the mental distress experienced by welfare recipients. This cross-sectional study on female Comprehensive Social Security Allowance recipients in Hong Kong aimed to explore their level of mental distress and its association with a range of risk factors specific to welfare recipients. Hence, 316 valid cases from a local community center responded to our online survey. We found that 52.3%, 23.4%, and 78% of the participants showed moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. A higher level of mental distress was associated with having a psychiatric diagnosis, poorer social, and greater concerns over disciplining children, the living environment, daily expenses and being infected by COVID-19. Unexpectedly, being married, having a permanent residence, and having a job were not significant protective factors for this group. The models explained 45.5%, 44.6%, and 52.5% of the overall variance in the level of depression, anxiety, and stress (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), respectively.

"COVID-19 Related Shifts in Social Interaction, Connection, and Cohesion Impact Psychosocial Health: Longitudinal Qualitative Findings from COVID-19 Treatment Trial Engaged Participants","While effective for slowing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, public health measures, such as physical distancing and stay-at-home orders, have significantly shifted the way people interact and maintain social connections. To better understand how people sought social and psychological support amid the pandemic, we conducted a longitudinal qualitative evaluation of participants enrolled in a COVID-19 treatment trial (<i>N</i> = 30). All participants from the parent trial who consented to being contacted for future research studies were recruited electronically via email, and first-round virtual interviews were conducted between December 2020 and March 2021. Participants who participated in first-round interviews were contacted again, and follow-up interviews were conducted in January-February 2022. The results reported significant shifts in how participants connected to social support, including changes from physical to virtual modalities, and using different social networks for distinct purposes (i.e., Reddit/Facebook for information, WhatsApp for community connection). While having COVID-19, profound loneliness during isolation was described; yet, to mitigate effects, virtual support (i.e., emotional, knowledge-seeking) as well as in-person material support (e.g., groceries, snow-shoveling), were key. Public health efforts are needed to develop interventions that will improve the narratives about mental health challenges related to COVID-19 isolation, and to provide opportunities to share challenges in a supportive manner among social networks. Supporting social cohesion, despite the everchanging nature of COVID-19, will necessitate innovative multimodal strategies that learn from lived experiences across various stages of the pandemic.","Perez-Brumer, Balasa, Doshi, Brogdon, Doan, Oldenburg","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610264","20220826","COVID-19; psychosocial health; social connection; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36714,""
"How Can Apartment-Complex Landscaping Space Improve Residents' Psychological Well-Being?: The Case of the Capital Region in South Korea","Urban green spaces have a positive impact on citizens' mental health and have contributed to improving their quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. In South Korea, where more than 50% of all households live in apartments, apartment-complex landscaping space plays the role of urban green space. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among a perceived restorative environment, restorative experience, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being by conducting a survey between residents living in apartments with landscape space. More specifically, an online survey was conducted from 8 to 15 June 2021 among residents in apartment complexes (500 households or more) located in the capital region in South Korea. We applied partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using 220 samples to test the causal relationship presented in the conceptual model of this study. The results revealed that residents' perceptions of the restorative environment of landscape space, including fascination, being away, and coherence had positive effects on restorative attention. Among the restorative environmental factors, the higher the ""being away"", the greater the effect on restorative attention. Second, the effects of fascination and coherence on life satisfaction were mediated by restorative attention. Third, restorative attention and life satisfaction significantly influenced psychological well-being. Additionally, life satisfaction acts as a mediator in the relationship between restorative attention and psychological well-being. In summary, this study has theoretical implications, in that it explores the effects of apartment complex landscaping space as urban green spaces on residents' mental health.","Tae, Jeong, Chon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610231","20220826","apartment complex; attention restoration theory; restorative environments; urban green space; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36715,""
"Detection of Intestinal Dysbiosis in Post-COVID-19 Patients One to Eight Months after Acute Disease Resolution","The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the immune response against viral infections, modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. The cytokine storm is associated with COVID-19 severity, and the patient's immune status is influenced by the intestinal microbiota in a gut-lung bidirectional interaction. In this study, we evaluate the intestinal microbiota of Brazilian patients in different post-COVID-19 periods, and correlate this with clinical data and the antibiotic therapy used during the acute phase. DNA extracted from stool samples was sequenced and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and C-reactive protein were quantified. Compared with controls, there were significant differences in the microbiota diversity in post-COVID-19 patients, suggesting an intestinal dysbiosis even several months after acute disease resolution. Additionally, we detected some genera possibly associated with the post-COVID-19 dysbiosis, including <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Haemophillus</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, in addition to decreased beneficial microbes, associated with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, such as <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Therefore, our hypothesis is that dysbiosis and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics during the pandemic may be associated with post-COVID-19 clinical manifestations. In our study, 39% (<i>n</i> = 58) of patients reported symptoms, including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, alopecia, anxiety, memory loss, and depression.

"Changes in Canadian Adolescent Well-Being since the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Prior Child Maltreatment","Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, given their increased socialization needs during this developmental period. This prospective study examined the potential changes in adolescents' well-being from before to during the pandemic, and the moderating role of a history of child maltreatment (CM), COVID-19-related distress, and gender among 1,802 adolescents (55.5% participants identified as boy, 42.2% as girl, and 1.5% as nonbinary; M<sub>age</sub> 14.74 years). Another aim was to determine whether COVID-19-related distress mediated the relationship between CM and well-being. Results revealed that COVID-19-related distress was associated with lower well-being (i.e., higher levels of internalized and externalized behaviors, and lower levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction). Boys experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction and self-esteem than girls. A history of CM had a moderation effect, with the pandemic having a lesser impact on the outcomes of adolescents with such a history. However, it was also associated with more COVID-19-related distress, which in turn was associated with lower levels of internalized and externalized behaviors, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. These unexpected results with regard to CM might indicate that the social restrictions during the pandemic could have had a relieving effect on adolescents with particular challenges associated with CM.","Dion, Hamel, Clermont, Blackburn, HÃƒÂ©bert, Paquette, Lalande, Bergeron","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610172","20220826","COVID-19 stress; adolescents; anxiety; child abuse and neglect; conduct disorder; depression; life satisfaction; longitudinal design; psychological adaptation; self-esteem","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36717,""

"Learning Stress, Involvement, Academic Concerns, and Mental Health among University Students during a Pandemic: Influence of Fear and Moderation of Self-Efficacy","COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the mental health and well-being of students. An effective method that can enable students to cope with difficult times is to help them realize their inner potential. Following the stimulus-organism-response model, this study developed a theoretical framework that deepens our understanding of an environmental stimulus (fear of COVID-19) that is experienced by students; struggle within the organism (learning stress, learning involvement, and academic concerns); and the psychological response (psychological well-being). The findings clarified how the fear of COVID-19 affects the psychological well-being of university students and revealed the moderate role of academic self-efficacy in this process. Some systematic practical advice was provided to higher education institutions to develop effective interventions to protect the mental health of college students and establish strategies to promote their inner potential.","Yang, Xiang, Zheng, Liang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610151","20220826","COVID-19; academic concerns; involvement; learning stress; psychological well-being; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36719,""
"Psychometric Properties of the WHO-5 Well-Being Index among Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Three Countries","Nurses' well-being has been increasingly recognised due to the ongoing pandemic. However, no validation scales measuring nurses' well-being currently exist. Thus, we aimed to validate the WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5) in a sample of nurses. A cross-sectional multinational study was conducted, and a total of 678 nurses who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain (36.9%), Chile (40.0%) and Norway (23.1%) participated in this study. The nurses completed the WHO-5, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) and three questions about the quality of life (QoL). The WHO-5 demonstrated good reliability and validity in the three countries. Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.81 to 0.90. High correlations were found between the WHO-5 and the psychological well-being dimension of QoL, and negative correlations between the WHO-5 and PHQ-2. The unidimensional scale structure was confirmed in all the countries, explaining more than 68% of the variance. The item response theory likelihood ratio model did not show discernible differences in the WHO-5 across the countries. To conclude, the WHO-5 is a psychometrically sound scale for measuring nurses' well-being during a pandemic. The scale showed strong construct validity for cross-cultural comparisons; however, more research is required with larger sample sizes.","Lara-Cabrera, Betancort, MuÃƒÂ±oz-Rubilar, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Novo, Bjerkeset, Cuevas","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610106","20220826","COVID-19; WHO-5 Well-Being Index; cross-cultural; item response theory; measurement invariance; mental health; nursing staff; pandemics; public health; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36720,""
"And Still She Rises: Policies for Improving Women's Health for a More Equitable Post-Pandemic World","The COVID-19 pandemic has spawned crises of violence, hunger and impoverishment. Maternal and Infant Health Canada (MIHCan) conducted this policy action study to explore how changes that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic may catalyze potential improvements in global women's health toward the creation of a more equitable post-pandemic world. In this mixed methods study, 280 experts in women's health responded to our survey and 65 subsequently participated in focus groups, including professionals from India, Egypt/Sudan, Canada and the United States/Mexico. From the results of this study, our recommendations include augmenting mental health through more open dialogue, valuing and compensating those working on the frontlines through living wages, paid sick leave and enhanced benefits and expanding digital technology that facilitates flexible work locations, thereby freeing time for improving the wellbeing of caregivers and families and offering telemedicine and telecounseling, which delivers greater access to care. We also recommend bridging the digital divide through the widespread provision of reliable and affordable internet services and digital literacy training. These policy recommendations for employers, governments and health authorities aim to improve mental and physical wellbeing and working conditions, while leveraging the potential of digital technology for healthcare provision for those who identify as women, knowing that others will benefit. MIHCan took action on the recommendation to improve mental health through open conversation by facilitating campaigns in all study regions. Despite the devastation of the pandemic on global women's health, implementing these changes could yield improvements for years to come.","Shroff, Tsang, Schwartz, Alkhadragy, Vora","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610104","20220826","COVID-19; gender; global health; health equity; health policies; mental wellbeing; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36721,""
"Psychological Distress among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in Denmark during the First 12 Months of the Pandemic","This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Denmark during the first 12 months of the pandemic and to assess changes in psychological distress in the three months following discharge. A single-center prospective observational survey study among patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis between May 2020 and May 2021 was conducted. Participants completed a survey at three time points: at admission, and 1 and 3 months after discharge. Psychological distress was assessed by validated scales measuring symptoms related to depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In total, 95 patients were included. At admission, the proportion of patients with symptoms of depression was 43%, symptoms of anxiety 32%, moderate/high level of stress 39%, insomnia 52%, and probable/positive PTSD 19%. The burden of symptoms related to depression and anxiety decreased significantly over time, while there was no significant change over time in stress, insomnia, or PTSD. Suboptimal levels of physical and mental HRQoL were detected at admission but improved over time. Patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic experienced considerable levels of psychological distress at admission, with some improvements within 3 months after discharge.","Moseholm, Midtgaard, Bollerup, Apol, Olesen, Jespersen, Weis","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610097","20220826","COVID-19; HRQoL; anxiety; depression; hospitalization; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36722,""
"Factors Associated with Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia during COVID-19","(1) Background: Preventive measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are essential, but they often cause social isolation and diminish the physical and mental health of older adults. In cognitively impaired individuals, the pandemic has worsened behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Here, we explored the factors contributing to the worsening of BPSD during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: Potential patients were identified at a memory clinic in Japan between June 2017 and June 2021. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia during the study period. The outcome was BPSD, as assessed by using the Dementia Behavioral Disorders Scale. Information on patients' lifestyle habits and use of care services was obtained for use as primary explanatory variables; multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between BPSD and care services use or lifestyle habits. The model was adjusted for sociodemographic factors, and the interaction terms of the pandemic period with lifestyle and service use were included to evaluate the effects of COVID-19. (3) Results: We identified 977 participants with MCI and 1380 with dementia (MCI group: 69.8% age 75 years or older, 54.2% female; dementia group: 79.8% age 75 years or older, 64.8% female). After adjustment for possible confounders, significantly worse BPSD was demonstrated in those who used daycare services during COVID-19 (both MCI and dementia patients; <i>p</i> = 0.007 and <i>p</i> = 0.025 respectively) and in those with poor nutritional function (dementia patients; <i>p</i> = 0.040). (4) Conclusions and Implications: During COVID-19, poor nutritional status and use of daycare services were associated with BPSD in those with cognitive decline. These findings indicate the need to fully examine the quantity and quality of care services for people with cognitive decline during emergencies and to continue to provide effective services.","Kuroda, Sugimoto, Satoh, Suemoto, Matsumoto, Uchida, Kishino, Sakurai","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610094","20220826","behavioral and psychological symptoms; coronavirus disease; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36723,""
"The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and Mental Health of African Immigrants in the United States","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrants in the United States is understudied. We investigated the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of African immigrants in the United States and if subjective religiosity was a protective factor. We analyzed primary data collected using an online survey (<i>n</i> = 260). The study's outcome variable was incident mental health disorder associated with the pandemic, and the primary independent variable was religiosity. Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the distribution of variables by incident mental health disorders. Logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between predictors and the outcome. There were 39 (15.0%) new cases of mental health disorders related to the pandemic. The median scores in the three domains of religiosity of those who developed a mental health disorder and those who did not were not significantly different. Significant predictors of this outcome included having a strong religious support network and loss of household employment income. African immigrants experienced an increased rate of mental health disorders during the pandemic. Implementing community-based strategies to provide social support during a disaster may be essential in promoting mental health in the African immigrant community.","Yusuf, Madu, Kutchava, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610095","20220826","African immigrants; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36724,""

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Inpatient Admissions for Psychotic and Affective Disorders: The Experience of a Large Psychiatric Teaching Hospital in Romania","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global sanitary crisis and, in addition, elicited serious mental health consequences. The utilization of psychiatric hospital-based services acts as an indicator of public mental health. Therefore, this research sought to investigate differences in the numbers and characteristics of inpatient admissions for psychotic and affective disorders at the largest Romanian psychiatric hospital between the period of lockdown (16 March-15 May 2020) and another three corresponding periods: the same year in the pre-lockdown period (16 January-15 March 2020), the immediate post-lockdown period (16 May-15 July 2020), and two years later (16 March-15 May 2022). A retrospective analysis was performed. The study included a total of 6604 patients. Inpatient admissions decreased during lockdown in comparison with the pre-lockdown period and immediate post-lockdown period for psychotic disorders (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively) and affective disorders (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). For both psychotic and affective disorders, a decrease in the age of the patients admitted during lockdown, as compared with the pre-lockdown period (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05 and <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively), was observed. The length of the hospital stay for affective disorders was higher immediately post-lockdown in comparison with the lockdown period (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Collectively, the present findings provide a glimpse of the immediate and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on patients' access to mental healthcare in the form of hospitalization, and these findings could provide the basis for the development of a different approach to times of crisis.","Dionisie, Ciobanu, Moisa, Manea, Puiu","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081570","20220826","COVID-19; admission; affective disorder; inpatient; involuntary; lockdown; pandemic; psychiatry; psychotic disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36726,""
"News reporting of suicide in nurses: A content analysis study","Media impact on suicide is well-established. Groups at heightened risk of suicide, such as nurses, may be particularly influenced by poor news reporting. This study aimed to examine UK newspaper reporting of suicide of nurses and student nurses, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Print and online newspaper reports about suicide in nurses (including students) published in the UK between January 2018 and August 2021 were obtained and data extracted for analysis in collaboration with Samaritans' media advisory team. Content and quality of newspaper reports were examined using a content analysis approach. The study was compliant with the STROBE checklist. Nurse or student nurse suicides were reported in 134 articles, including 50 individual suicides. Most articles were acceptable against Samaritans' media guidelines. However, common problems included absence of signposting to support organizations and lack of suicide prevention messages. A minority of articles included methods of suicide within article headlines (18, 13.4%) and sensationalist or romanticizing language (14, 10.7%). Most contained occupation-related content. Many named the individual's specific hospital or university and a substantial proportion included occupation-related images. Working on the frontline was the most reported link between COVID-19 and nurse suicide. While reporting on suicide among nurses and students was largely acceptable, quality of reporting was variable. Occupation was often discussed, and most articles published during COVID-19 linked suicide to the pandemic. The research findings can help shape guidance on reporting of suicide in specific professions and occupations, including nursing, to encourage responsible reporting and reduce inadvertent promotion of suicide.","Groves, Hawley, Lascelles, Hawton","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13057","20220826","COVID-19; news reporting; nurses; students, nursing; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36727,""
"The impact of lockdown on young people with genetic neurodevelopmental disabilities: a study with the international participatory database GenIDA","Previous publications suggested that lockdown is likely to impact daily living issues of individuals with intellectual disabilities. The authors notably suspected an intensification of behavioural, eating and sleep problems. To test these hypotheses, we conducted an international online survey about the impact of COVID-19-associated first lockdown on people with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. This survey was carried out using GenIDA, an international participatory database collecting medical information on genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. Patients' relatives took part in this online survey from 30/04/2020 to 09/06/2020. This survey adapted from GenIDA standard questionnaire requested information on diagnosis, lifestyle and was based on yes/no answers to questions regarding behaviour, diet, and sleep, in the 6-months period before lockdown and during lockdown. We also asked relatives to evaluate the intensity of these problems by severity level. Finally, relatives could freely comment in open fields on the medical and/or quality of life problems they had encountered during lockdown. In total 199 participants-144 children and 45 adults-with neurodevelopmental disorders (intellectual disability (79.4%) and/or autism spectrum disorder (21.6%)) of various genetic origins, with near-equal male/female (96/103) contribution and originating mainly from Europe and Northern America, were included. The average lockdown duration at time of the survey was 57Ã‚Â days. We did not find differences in the frequency of behavioural, eating and sleep problems before and during lockdown. Moreover, there was no apparent difference in the intensity of eating and sleep disorders between both periods. However, for persons with behavioural problems at both periods, relatives reported an increase in aggressivity, self-aggressivity, depressiveness, stereotypies, and restricted interests during lockdown, all of which might be interpreted as consequences of a lack of stimulation or a reaction to unexpected changes in daily habits. Our results support previous studies that suggest that the negative impact of lockdown does not depend on the intellectual disability per se but on the associated comorbidities such as behavioural disorders. This study addresses the need for prevention of behavioural disturbance in the vulnerable population with genetic neurodevelopmental disabilities.","Coutelle, Boedec, Vermeulen, Kummeling, Koolen, Kleefstra, Fournier, Colin, Strehle, GeneviÃƒÂ¨ve, Burger, Mandel","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04213-6","20220825","Autism spectrum disorder; Behavioural problems; COVID-19; Genetic disorders; Intellectual disability; Participatory online survey; Self-report","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36728,""
"Children mirror adults for the worse: evidence of suicide rates due to air pollution and unemployment","Every year, more than 700,000 people die due to suicide, one of the most common reasons for youth death. While many studies have revealed two main factors for suicidal behavior: impulsive suicidal behavior due to mental illness and financial stress, it is not clear what happens if individuals face deterioration of mental health and economic recession. This paper attempts to answer this question and how suicide rates are correlated with these factors. We empirically investigate whether economic recessions and air pollution trigger suicides by examining Japan, a country with one of the highest suicide rates, from 2014 to 2021. We take advantage of the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the periods before the pandemic, when both economic recessions and reductions in air pollution occurred simultaneously. Using monthly and municipal- level data, we construct a triple difference model that takes air pollution and unemployment as treatments. Our findings show that high (upper half of each period) levels of air pollution and unemployment have substantial impacts on the suicide rates of adults (22.9% in the short term) and children (42.7% in the short term, 36.0% in the long term), indicating that the increase in suicide rates among children is almost twice as high as that among adults. Our study finds that unemployment and air pollution alone are not associated with increased suicide rates but their simultaneous occurrence triggers suicides during the pandemic. Our study urges suicide prevention, particularly among children, as an essential consideration for public health. Furthermore, our results indicate the need for the government to allocate resources to recover air quality and the economy simultaneously during a recession to reduce suicide mortality of both child and adults.","Okuyama, Yoo, Managi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14013-y","20220825","Children suicides; Pandemic; Public health; Suicides","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36729,""
"The lessons learned working in diagnostic and therapeutic radiography departments through the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland, UK What can we do differently the next time?","Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, a radical restructure of NHS services occurred, prioritising the acute needs of infected patients. This included suspending routine procedures, leading to an inevitable resurgence in the future, placing increased demands on the NHS, including diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers. With radiography departments already experiencing staff shortages due to COVID-19 related illnesses and vulnerable staff shielding, there is a need to implement plans within radiography departments to ensure their sustainability in the future. A mixed methods study was undertaken in Northern Ireland, involving distribution of a survey to diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers alongside conducting interviews with radiography department managers. 106 radiographers completed the survey, with 9 radiography managers and 2 band eight superintendents participating in interviews. Over 60% of participants felt that morale declined in their departments, with the majority feeling that the pandemic had a negative impact on their physical or mental health and wellbeing. Managers felt that to improve staff morale and motivation, incentives need to be offered including remuneration, flexible working and support for professional development. Whilst predicting when the next wave of a COVID-19 variant or the next pandemic will occur is impossible, preparation and planning will help manage the situation better. This requires identifying clinical areas for expansion/retraction and having access to additional staff to meet the demands on the service to ensure all patients receive care not just those acutely ill. This study has identified key lessons learned from the pandemic within the radiography departments. This will enable preparation and strategic planning for future pandemics.","Mc Fadden, Flood, Watson, Shepherd","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2022.07.006","20220825","COVID-19; Lessons learned; Radiography; Radiotherapy; Working through a pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","",36730,""

"The role of hope in language teacher's changing stress, coping, and well-being","Language teaching has been described as a â€œprofession in crisisâ€; a situation likely worsened by the effects of an emergency conversion to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examines two waves of data (from April and November 2020) on stress, coping, and well-being during those eight months. Results show an increase in teachers' stress associated with health and travel but decreases in stress due to online teaching and the shortage of goods in retail stores. There was a significant reduction in coping behavior as teachers settled into the new normal. Well-being, as measured by PERMA, declined significantly, and there was a significant increase in sadness, loneliness, and anger. However, teachers reported an increasing sense of growth during trauma. Time 2 data included a measure of hope, defined by feelings of agency and available pathways to goal achievement. Rarely has hope been studied among teachers in general or language teachers in particular. Results show significant, positive correlations between hope and various measures of successful coping and teacher well-being, including a sense of growth over time.

"AsociaciÃ³n entre alteraciones en el sueÃ±o y problemas de salud mental en los estudiantes de Medicina durante la pandemia de la COVID-19","Introduction Medical students are a population vulnerable to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation; these problems were accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to evaluate the association between sleep disturbances and the presence of depression and anxiety in medical students during the pandemic. Materials and methods Cross-sectional, analytical study in medical students of a private university in Peru. Data were collected from May 22 to June 14, 2020, after 3 months of mandatory social isolation. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; =10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7; =10) scale and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; =8) were used to assess depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. Poisson regressions with robust variance were used to calculate prevalence ratios. Results The prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia was 28.5%, 29.5% and 60.1% respectively. It was found that those who had short sleep (RPa: 1.40, CI: 1.05-1.87, p: 0.024), who slept after 2:00 hours (RPa: 2.24, CI: 1.31-3.83, p: 0.003) and who presented insomnia (RPa: 7.12, CI: 3.70-13.73, p: <0.001) had a higher prevalence of anxiety.
