"Impact of the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on French Health Students","CONTEXT: In France, care workers and health students have been intensely mobilized during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. But few studies have evaluated psychological distress on non-medical health students, in addition to the challenges posed by pedagogical continuity while universities are closed following health and safety regulations. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess COVID-19's impact on health students in France on different levels: psychological, educational and social. METHODS: An online national cross-sectional study, from April 11 to May 30 2020, included sociodemographic, work conditions and numeric scales. RESULTS: 4411 students answered. Regarding the K6 scale, 39% of students had moderate distress, and 21% had a high level of distress. Risk factors of psychological distress included being a woman (p&lt;0.001), being between 19 and 21 years old (p&lt;0.001), living alone (p=0.008), and not having the ability to isolate (p&lt;0.001). Students on the frontline had less psychological distress (57 vs 62 %, p= 0.003), better quality of sleep (34% vs 28% high quality, p&lt;0.001) but a higher consumption of medical (8.5% vs 6.5%, p=0.044) and non-medical (18% vs 10%, p&lt;0.001) psychotropic drugs. Nurse and medical students had more distress and used more non-medical psychotropic substances than other health students (15% vs 9.2%). DISCUSSION: COVID-19' crisis had an important impact on health students' mental health, social life and training with discrepancies regarding the speciality whether they were on the frontline or not. There is an urgent need for psychological and pedagogical support for students, and even more so regarding the prolongation of the COVID-19 epidemic. RÃ©sumÃ© Objectifs : Durant la premiÃ¨re vague de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 en France, les professionnels et Ã©tudiants en santÃ© ont Ã©tÃ© intensÃ©ment mobilisÃ©s pour faire face Ã  lâ€™augmentation exponentielle des besoins de soins dans le systÃ¨me de santÃ©. Une Ã©tude franÃ§aise dans 21 unitÃ©s de soins intensifs au cours du premier mois de confinement a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© que la prÃ©valence des symptÃ´mes d'anxiÃ©tÃ© et de dÃ©pression chez les soignants Ã©tait de 50,4 %, et 30,4 % respectivement. En revanche, peu Ã©tudes se sont consacrÃ©es Ã  lâ€™Ã©valuation de la dÃ©tresse psychologique des Ã©tudiants en santÃ© durant cette pÃ©riode. Dans la population gÃ©nÃ©rale des Ã©tudiants franÃ§ais, une Ã©tude a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© que la prÃ©valence des pensÃ©es suicidaires, de la dÃ©tresse grave et du niveau Ã©levÃ© de stress perÃ§u pendant la premiÃ¨re vague Ã©tait de 11,4 %, 22,4 % et 24,7 % respectivement. Lâ€™objectif de notre Ã©tude est dâ€™Ã©valuer lâ€™impact du COVID-19 sur la santÃ© mentale des Ã©tudiants en santÃ© (mÃ©decine, soins infirmiers, pharmacie, maÃ¯eutique, odontologie, ergothÃ©rapie, orthoptie, orthophonie, psychomotricitÃ©, audioprothÃ©siste) en France pendant la 1Ã¨re vague. MÃ©thodes : Un questionnaire en ligne a Ã©tÃ© proposÃ© du 11 Avril au 30 Mai 2020 auprÃ¨s des Ã©tudiants en santÃ© de France. La diffusion a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ© par lâ€™intermÃ©diaire de rÃ©seaux sociaux et de mails de diffÃ©rents groupes institutionnels (confÃ©rences des doyens, prÃ©sidents dâ€™universitÃ©, Centre National dâ€™Appui Ã  la qualitÃ© de vie des Ã©tudiants en santÃ©â€¦). Le questionnaire comprenait lâ€™Ã©chelle de Kessler en 6 items (K6), la social provision scale SPS-10, la consommation de drogues et de psychotropes et lâ€™Ã©valuation du sommeil. Les tests du chi-2 et test exact de Fisher ont Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©s pour comparer la prÃ©valence entre les groupes. Par la suite, des modÃ¨les de rÃ©gression logistique ajustÃ©s sur l'Ã¢ge et le sexe ont Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©s (analyses multivariÃ©es). RÃ©sultats : 4411 Ã©tudiants ont rÃ©pondu : 39% prÃ©sentaient une dÃ©tresse modÃ©rÃ©e et 21% une dÃ©tresse Ã©levÃ©e Ã  lâ€™Ã©chelle de dÃ©tresse psychologique de Kessler. Plusieurs facteurs de risque de dÃ©tresse psychologique ont Ã©tÃ© retrouvÃ©s : Ãªtre une femme (p&lt;0,001), avoir entre 19 et 21 ans (p&lt;0,001), vivre seul (p=0,008) et ne pas avoir la possibilitÃ© de sâ€™isoler chez soi pour travailler (p&lt;0,001). Les Ã©tudiants en Â« premiÃ¨re ligne Â» face aux patients expriment moins de dÃ©tresse que les Ã©tudiants qui sont confinÃ©s sans activitÃ© clinique (57% contre 62%, p=0,003), une meilleure qualitÃ© du sommeil (34% contre 28%, p&lt;0,001) mais une augmentation de la consommation de mÃ©dicaments (8,5% contre 6,5%, p=0,044) ou dâ€™autres substances psychoactives (18% contre 10%, p&lt;0,001). Les Ã©tudiants en soins infirmiers et Ã©tudiants en mÃ©decine prÃ©sentent une dÃ©tresse psychologique et une augmentation de la consommation de produits plus importantes que les autres Ã©tudiants (15% contre 9,2%). Conclusions : La pandÃ©mie COVID-19 a eu un impact certain sur la santÃ© mentale des Ã©tudiants en santÃ© et leur formation, bien que des disparitÃ©s existent selon les cursus, et selon la participation aux soins des Ã©tudiants. Cette Ã©tude prÃ©sente certaines limites : le taux de rÃ©ponse Ã©tait faible ;les jeunes Ã©tudiants (18-21 ans) Ã©taient surreprÃ©sentÃ©s. Il s â€˜agit de la premiÃ¨re Ã©tude nationale sur la santÃ© mentale des Ã©tudiants en santÃ© et elle pourra servir de rÃ©fÃ©rence pour comparer avec les futures Ã©tudes. Il semble urgent dâ€™intervenir pour amÃ©liorer le bien-Ãªtre des Ã©tudiants en santÃ© dâ€™autant plus que la crise sanitaire tend Ã  se prolonger.","Rolland, Franck, Frajerman, Ariel, Falissard, Bruno, Bertschy, Gilles, Diquet, Bertrand, Marra, Donata","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2021.12.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27059,""
"Lockdown Strictness and Mental Health Effects Among Older Populations in Europe","This paper investigates whether lockdown policies aggravated mental health problems of older populations (50 and over) in Europe during the first COVID-19 wave. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE COVID-19 questionnaire) and from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker for 17 countries, we estimate the causal effect of lockdown policies on mental health by combining cross-country variability in the strictness of the policies with cross-individual variability in face-to-face contacts prior to the pandemic. We find that lockdown policies worsened insomnia, anxiety, and depression by 5, 7.2 and 5.1 percentage points, respectively. This effect was stronger for women and those aged between 50 and 65. Interestingly, lockdown policies notably damaged the mental health of healthy populations. We close with a discussion of lockdown policies targeted at individuals above 65 and/or with pre-existing conditions.","GarcÃ­a-Prado, Ariadna, GonzÃ¡lez, Paula, Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2022.101116","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Economics & Human Biology;: 101116, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27060,""
"The prevalence of mental health outcomes among eating disorder patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis","Summary Background & Aims Patients with eating disorders (ED) are known to suffer from various psychological morbidities thus they are expected to be negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pooled prevalence of psychological comorbidities in ED patients. Methods Pubmed, Scopus, GoogleScholar, and medRxiv were searched using the keywords COVID19 and Eating Disorders and their related MeSH terms. The articles were included if they contained patients with diagnosed EDs and having evaluated their mental health disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the â€œassessing risk of bias in prevalence studiesâ€ tool. The heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q and I2 heterogeneity statistics. Results A total of 13 articles have been included in this meta-analysis with a sample size of 3,056. The pooled prevalence of ED patients who experienced worsening of ED symptoms was 57% (95%CI: 36%-76%), anxiety was 64% (95%CI: 39%-78%), and depression was 55% (95%CI: 12%-87%) during the pandemic. Conclusions This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting an increase in the pooled prevalence of mental health disorders among patients suffering from EDs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khraisat, Bann Rami, Al-Jeady, Ahmad Mufeed, Alqatawneh, Dana Ayman, Toubasi, Ahmad Amjad, AlRyalat, Saif Aldeen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.01.033","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Nutrition ESPEN;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27061,""

"The mental wellbeing of optometry and pharmacy students in New Zealand during COVID-19","At a time of transition into adulthood, tertiary study places additional stresses on the mental wellbeing of students. The continual assessment, long teaching hours, and expectation of professionalism that is expected from students within clinical programmes places even more burden on these students. Then in 2020, with the COVID-19 lockdown, there were significant changes to how these programs were delivered. We surveyed the mental wellbeing of our undergraduate students in the Bachelor of Optometry and Bachelor of Pharmacy programmes at the University of Auckland in 2019 and 2020. Using validated screening questionnaires, we found a high level of anxiety and depression in both years, however, in 2020 following the lockdown, anxiety levels in our students decreased. We found that the leading stressor was academic stress, and levels of anxiety were inversely correlated with perceived academic success. Therefore, we believe the lockdown, which provided both a break from clinical stresses and a change in teaching modality to online delivery, provided a period of relief, despite the potential stressful environment regarding COVID-19. To help alleviate the high level of distress in our students, lessons could be learned to decrease the stress levels in our students by continuing with alternative teaching and assessment styles. Practitioner Notes 1. A substantial proportion of tertiary clinical students face experience anxiety and depression 2. Most of the stress derives from academic pressures 3. During the COVID-19 lockdown, with enforced changes to teaching and evaluation, students experienced a significant reduction in anxiety 4. Modifications to standard clinical teaching methods to include more online and asynchronous assessment methods may improve the mental wellbeing of students","Turnbull, P. R.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL MORBIDITY IN PREGNANCY DURING COVID-19 LOCKDOWN","AIM: Study aimed to assess the burden of psychological morbidity due to lockdown in the pregnant females. MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was an observational study conducted in the department of obstetrics & gynecology, GMC Kathua during the covid lockdown period from June 2020 to August 2020. 100 antenatal patients attending OPD were included in the study after excluding those with hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, bleeding pv,IUGR,oligohydramnios,threatened preterm labour, known psychiatric illness or taking psychotropic medication, prior sleep disorder. The patients were assessed using a questionnairewhich was framed using various scales such as PHQ-9 for Depression, GAD7 for anxiety, Perceived Stress Scale and Insomnia severity index , in addition to incorporating various sociodemographic and obstetrical details.The arbitrary division of PHQ- 9 scores into ratings of minimal (0-4),mild (5-9), and moderate to severe depression (=10) suggested by Reddy et al. was used in this study. Cutoff points of 5, 10, and 15 were interpreted as representing mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Insomnia severity index scored on a fivepoint Likert's scale (0 = no problem to 4 = very severe problem). Score of 0-7 depicted absence of insomnia, 8-14 showedsubthreshold insomnia, 15-21 represented moderate, and 22-28 showed severe insomnia. RESULTS: The total number of pregnant females analyzed in the study were 100. The age of the patients ranged from 18 years to 36 years, with mean age being 25.65 years. On analyzing Perceived stress scale,66% had low stress levels, 27% had moderate while 7% had high stress levels. Also 31 subjects(31%) had anxiety as depicted by their scores above cut off of 8. 20 patients(20%) had moderate insomnia and 45% had severe insomnia. Mild depression as diagnosed by PHQ-9 score 5-9 was found in 33 subjects (33%) whereas moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 score greater than10) was seen in 10 subjects(10%). CONCLUSION:We can conclude that the main worries of pregnant women are related to threats to their lives and their baby's health because of the unknown causes of the pandemic. It is important to know that the changes in maternity care have a negative impact on them and they need more support to pass over this period.","Sadiq, S.; Chandel, R.; Mir, H.; Mehta, A.; Sharma, S.; Gul, R.; Kumar, P.; Kumar, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=PSYCHOLOGICAL+MORBIDITY+IN+PREGNANCY+DURING+COVID-19+LOCKDOWN","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Molecular and Clinical Medicine; 9(1):46-53, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27067,""
"Exploring the challenges and ethical requirements of medical sciences education during COVID 19: a qualitative stud","The controversial role of ethics in clinical education and its ability to draw the attention of a large audience is inevitable.

"ASPECTS OF COVID-19 INFODEMIC AND ITS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES","Formal education, transportation, socialization and other aspects of our lives have been affected by the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) and this has increased fear and anxiety in most people. Furthermore, lack of control, helplessness, concern about the absence of knowledge about COVID-19 and its negative impact on daily life are some of the reasons why people seek information about this disease. People often believe in the released information without adequate verification whether that information is true or false. However, nowadays, we very often encounter fake news while browsing social media. The main goal of fake news is to lead the reader to the wrong information for the purpose of damaging the personality rights of a person or entity or to profit. The infodemic and fake news have much in common, because one of the goals of fake news is to publish a large amount of misleading information and the infodemic is an overload of information. Both serve to confuse the average user who cannot interpret their truthfulness. Infodemic can often turn into infomania, a term used to describe people's tendency to obsessively check news on social media and the internet. This study has three goals: (1) to give a theoretical insight into the phenomenon of infodemic through the qualitative method of content analysis, (2) to explore students' attitudes towards infodemic concerning COVID-19 through the quantitative method of online survey which will reveal the most employed information sources and channels as well as the most retrieved topics about COVID-19 among students' population with a special emphasize of ways they check information reliability and (3) to explore, through the qualitative method of comparative analysis, the legal consequences of infodemic worldwide.","Papic, A.; Radoja, K.

"Potential secondary bioactive compounds of Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi Mushroom) against various pathogenic activity","Since the dawn of time, mankind has been enchanted by nature and has extensively researched upon natural resources. Scientists have been analyzing the composition, molecular structures, and pharmacological activities using activity-guided experiments. Although green plants have been the first preference for extraction of natural drugs recently, fungi have been also drawing attention as they have been reported to be the rich source of bioactive compounds. Among them, Reishi mushroom or Ganoderma lucidum, has been studied greatly due to its notable potential against various diseases. Bioactive compounds derived from reishi were found to be - anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-microbial in effect. Besides, they are also known to be immuno-modulators, antidepressant and neuro-protectants etc. Polysaccharides and triterpenoids are the groups which possess major pharmacological properties of reishi as compared to other chemical groups. Recent studies show that compounds such as: Colossolactone (VIII, E, G), ergosterol, heliantiriol F and velutin can act as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents as well.

"Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Exacerbated India's Mental Health Issues?: A Narrative Review","Purpose: Presently, the COVID-19 second wave is creating havoc with extensive surges in active cases and fatality in India. The country witnessed lockdowns, various prevention strategies including quarantine and social isolation for the first time in the history. Rippling impact on economy, socio cultural atmosphere, migration, sports, agriculture was observed. The drastic change affected mental health of people as well. The objective was to document pandemic's effect on the mental health of people of India. Methodology: ""COVID-19"", ""mental health"", ""psychology"", ""lockdown"", ""quarantine"" was searched in PubMed in different orders. The final selection constituted 17 articles. Findings: The review revealed symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress in adults. Quarantine children and young adults showed negative symptoms of mental health, health care professionals reflected high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress and low Quality of Life (QoL). Gender, age, education, occupation, marital status, parenthood and income were found to be the predictors of mental illness. Insomnia, fear, worry other negative mental health symptoms were documented. Research Limitations: Review of literature in this area is restricted. So, all types of research articles were selected in the review. Originality/Value: The article recognizes the symptoms of mental health experienced, vulnerable population and predictors.

"Myalgia and fatigue as long term symptoms in COVID-19 patients: A 1-year follow-up","Background. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus and in many cases lead to a pneumonia. However a number of neumuscular manifestations have been associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, multiorgan symptoms after COVID-19 are being reported by increasing numbers of patients, ranging from cough to fatigue and muscle pain. However, the long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. Methods: We evaluated 124 patients hospitalized between march and May 2020 for SARS-COV-2 associated pneumonia at 6 and 12 months. We retrospectively collected clinical, laboratory and radiological information available. for each patient, cognitive tests, scales for depression and anxiety and a specific Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were performed. Results. Twenty-five patients died during hospitalization. At 12 months follow up 85 patient were evaluated. Eighty-seven (70%) patiens were male and mean age was 67.3 years. During hospitalization 43 (36.5%) of patients complain of myalgia. This patients had higher CK levels than patients who did not (534 U/L vs 93 U/l, p &lt; 0.001). At 12 months 42% of patients complain about myalgia while 34% about fatigue. Mean FSS value were 32.93, and were significatively higher in patiets who complain about fatigue (41.52 vs 27.08 p &lt; 0.001) and Muscle pain (40.84 vs 26.80, p &lt; 0.001) compared to who did not. Conclusions. During hospitalization for COVID-19 myalgia was associated with an higher level of CK, suggesting a possible muscle involvement. At 12 month myalgia and fatigue were present in a more than a third of patient suggesting that this manifestation could be one of the main COVID-19 sequelae.","Cotti Piccinelli, S.; Pilotto, A.; Cristillo, V.; Schiano Di Cola, F.; Risi, B.; Bonzi, G.; Mazzola, M.; Filosto, M.; Padovani, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Myalgia+and+fatigue+as+long+term+symptoms+in+COVID-19+patients:+A+1-year+follow-up","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta Myologica; 40(SUPPL 1):32, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27073,""
"IMPACT OF COVID-19 PERCEPTION ON STUDENTS' ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA","Although the COVID-19 pandemic represents crisis primary caused due to health reasons, it led to the largest economic crisis since the Great depression. Almost the whole world economy has been in deep recession from the second quarter of 2020 onwards causing the uncertain future. During the crisis, the sectors which demanded continuous contact with the customers were particularly vulnerable. On the other hand, as a consequence of restrictions or even prohibitions of B2B and B2C contacts, the crisis influenced on creation of the new business models and innovative solutions focused on possibilities and maintaining of the company business operations. The economic consequences of the pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina are reflected in the increase in unemployment and the decline in economic activity at all levels. The government's response to the pandemic was bad and late. In the context of entrepreneurship, the crisis presents a risk, but also an opportunity for those who can recognize and take the advantages. Thus, the empirical part of this work includes the investigation on how perceptions of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis influenced on entrepreneurial intentions of the students from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Research on the perceptions of the Covid-19 pandemic was related to perceptions of the pandemic influence on the economy and society in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as on perceptions of the pandemic influence on an individual person. Research was conducted mostly with the students at University of Zenica and at Higher education institution ""International business-information academy"" Tuzla in December 2020 when the influences and consequences of pandemic still have been present. Apart from perceptions of crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the regression model includes elements of Theory of planned behavior.

"Assessment of the stress, anxiety, and depression in students during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Shifting of the school classes to online format owing to social distancing norms led to amplification of academic stress, independent learning pressure, dropouts, everyday life abandonment, less study chance made researchers focus on assessing the impact of coronavirus on the mental condition of the students. This requires prompt intervention as stress can further increase in subjects adopting conventional coping strategies and in subjects with pre-existing stressors. Aim: The present study was conducted to assess stress, anxiety, and depression in subjects at a defined geographical area to assess psychological needs in subjects dealing with causal factors and the pandemic. Methods: In 156 subjects, DASS 21 scale was used having 21 questionnaires that were answered by the subjects themselves and were concerned about stress, anxiety, and depression. The responses were recorded on a scale of 0 to 4 where 0 meant little time/none and 3 meant most of the time. The responses were recorded based on symptoms severity in the last week before answering the questionnaire. The interpretation of the DASS 21 scale was divided into categories of normal, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. The collected data were subjected to statistical evaluation. Results: For gender, only anxiety was statistically significant (p=0.01) which was higher in females with the value of 1.72Â±0.993 compared to males with the value of 1.47Â±0.881. For the age anxiety levels were significantly higher in subjects of age = 20 years with 1.76Â±1.01 compared to = 21 years with the value of 1.52Â±0.883 (p=0.02). For familial history also significantly correlated to anxiety with p=0.004, whereas for depression and stress the pvalues were 0.758 and 0.238 respectively and were non-significant. For family history, it was significantly related to anxiety with a p-value of 0.12, whereas, it was non-significantly related to depression and stress with respective p-values of 0.753 and 0.297. The socioeconomic status was also significantly associated with anxiety with the low socioeconomic group having a strong association having a p-value of 0.25. Conclusion: The present study concludes that the depression, anxiety, and stress in students during COVID-19 was seen ranging from mild to severe levels, whereas, majority of the students showed normal levels of DASS. Also, positive family history of COVID-19 and family income was associated with increased depression, anxiety, and stress in the students.","Basu, R.; Lahari, P.; Lahari, K.; Lahari, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Assessment+of+the+stress,+anxiety,+and+depression+in+students+during+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Molecular and Clinical Medicine; 8(4):1835-1841, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27075,""
"Longitudinal Study of Cognitive Decline before and after the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from the PA-COVID Survey","Even though several studies reported good resilience capacities in older adults in the first period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in the long run, social isolation induced by the protective measures adopted by most countries may negatively impact cognitive functioning. Taking the advantage of measures collected up to 15 years before the pandemic in participants followed up in epidemiological studies, we compared cognitive decline before and after the start of the pandemic. PA-COVID is a phone survey designed in the framework of ongoing population-based studies (PAQUID, 3-City, Approche Multidisciplinaire IntÃƒÂ©grÃƒÂ©e cohorts). Data on social functioning and mental health were collected in participants aged 80 years and older during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the participants followed up in the prospective studies completed the Mini-Mental State Examination. During the PA-COVID survey, they underwent the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. A score was computed with the 11 items shared by the 2 tests. Our analysis was carried out in the participants for whom a cognitive measure was available up to 15 years before the pandemic and during the pandemic (n = 263). Compared to the slow decline of the cognitive subscore observed during the 15 years preceding the pandemic, mixed models showed an acceleration of decline after the start of the pandemic (ÃŽÂ² = -0.289, p value &lt;0.001). With a design allowing comparing cognitive trajectory before and after the pandemic, this is the first study reporting an accelerated decline in older adults. Future COVID research in older adults will need to pay special attention to cognitive outcomes.","Amieva, Retuerto, Hernandez-Ruiz, Meillon, Dartigues, PÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨s","https://doi.org/10.1159/000521999","20220216","Cognitive decline; Coronavirus disease 2019; Mental health; Older adults; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27076,""
"Emotional processing prospectively modulates the impact of anxiety on COVID-19 pandemic-related post-traumatic stress symptoms: an ERP study","Considering that the elevated distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in some cases, led to post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), it has been proposed as a specific traumatic event. The present longitudinal study investigated pre-pandemic motivated attention to emotional stimuli, as indexed by Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitude, in relation with the potential differential role of anxiety and depressive symptoms in predicting PTSS severity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 79 university students initially completed self-report measures of Depress. Anxiety along with a passive viewing task of emotional (pleasant, unpleasant) and neutral pictures while an electroencephalogram was recorded. In December 2020, 57 participants completed a questionnaire assessing PTSS. Significant interactions between anxiety and LPP emerged in predicting pandemic-related PTSS, where greater anxiety symptoms predicted PTSS only in individuals with greater LPP to unpleasant or with reduced LPP to pleasant stimuli. The prevalence of the female sex, the relatively young age of the participants, as well as the fact that they were all enrolled in a University course might not allow the generalization of the findings. Taken together, the present longitudinal study provided novel evidence on EEG predictors of pandemic-related PTSS that might be useful for the prevention and treatment of PTSS. Indeed, assessing anxiety symptoms and pre-trauma LPP to emotional stimuli might be a useful target for identifying individuals that are more vulnerable to the development of PTSS during times of crisis.","Dell'Acqua, Moretta, BÃƒÂ², Benvenuti, Palomba","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.027","20220216","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; event-related potentials; post-traumatic stress symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27077,""
"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on women's alcohol use, mental health, and experiences of intimate partner violence in Wakiso, Uganda","Uganda confirmed its first COVID-19 case in March 2020, leading to country-wide closures and a stay-at-home order. Infectious disease pandemics can overwhelm adaptive coping capacity (e.g., general self-efficacy and resilience) and increase the risk for mental distress. For individuals experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and cohabitating with a perpetrator, stay-at-home orders can also increase risk of violence, which can further exacerbate mental distress. The present study explores women's perceived self-efficacy and resilient coping, mental health outcomes (depression and COVID-19 related anxiety), hazardous alcohol use and IPV in the context of Uganda's national 2020 lockdown. A phone-based survey was undertaken from June-August of 2020 in Wakiso District, Uganda. The study sample consisted of Africa Medical and Behavioral Sciences Organization (AMBSO) Population Health Surveillance (APHS) study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. The analytic sample was restricted to women aged 13-80 years. Bivariate analysis and multivariable models explored associations between experiences of IPV and measures of adaptive coping, mental health and alcohol use. A total of 556 women aged 13-79 years (mean age of 33.4 years) participated. Over half (55%) were currently married. The majority (60%) reported a decrease in alcohol use during the lockdown. Nearly half of the sample were experiencing physical or verbal IPV and reported an increase in violence during the lockdown. In adjusted analysis, alcohol use was associated with four times greater odds of recent physical IPV (aOR 4.06, 95% CI = 1.65-10.02, p = 0.0024), while participants had lower odds of experiencing any form of IPV as general self-efficacy increased (aOR 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99, p = 0.0308). Lockdown measures in Uganda may have mitigated increased alcohol consumption. IPV was exacerbated during lockdown; more than 2 in 5 IPV victims experienced increased physical or verbal violence. Development of programming and policies aimed at mitigating women's risk of IPV during future lockdowns are needed.","Miller, Mugamba, Bulamba, Kyasanku, Nkale, Nalugoda, Nakigozi, Kigozi, Nalwoga, Kagaayi, Watya, Wagman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263827","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27078,""
"Subjective well-being during the 2020-21 global coronavirus pandemic: Evidence from high frequency time series data","We investigate how subjective well-being varied over the course of the global COVID-19 pandemic, with a special attention to periods of lockdown. We use weekly data from YouGov's Great Britain Mood Tracker Poll, and daily reports from Google Trends, that cover the entire period from six months before until eighteen months after the global spread of COVID-19. Descriptive trends and time-series models suggest that negative mood associated with the imposition of lockdowns returned to baseline within 1-3 weeks of lockdown implementation, whereas pandemic intensity, measured by the rate of fatalities from COVID-19 infection, was persistently associated with depressed affect. The results support the hypothesis that country-specific pandemic severity was the major contributor to increases in negative affect observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that lockdowns likely ameliorated rather than exacerbated this effect.","Foa, Fabian, Gilbert","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263570","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27079,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of professionals in 77 hospitals in France","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant re-organisation of healthcare delivery in hospitals, with repercussions on all professionals working in healthcare. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of professionals working in health care institutions and to identify individual and environmental factors influencing the risk of mental health disorders. From 4 June to 22 September 2020, a total of 4370 professionals responded to an online questionnaire evaluating psychological distress, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms, stress factors, and coping strategies. About 57% of the professionals suffered from psychological distress, and 21% showed symptoms of potential post-traumatic stress. Professionals working in radiology, those working in quality/hygiene/security and nurses' aides were the most affected groups. The media focus on the crisis, and a high workload were the most prevalent stress factors, followed by uncertainty regarding the possibility of containing the epidemic, the constantly changing hygiene recommendations/protocols, and the lack of personal protective equipment. The use of coping strategies, notably positive thinking, helped to mitigate the relation between perceived stress and mental health disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching negative repercussions for all professionals, with some sectors more markedly affected. To prevent mental health disorders in professionals during a public health crisis, support services and management strategies within hospitals should take account of the importance of positive thinking and social support.","Fournier, Laurent, Lheureux, Ribeiro-Marthoud, Ecarnot, Binquet, Quenot","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263666","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27080,""
"A Cross-Linguistic Validation of the Test for Rating Emotions in Speech: Acoustic Analyses of Emotional Sentences in English, German, and Hebrew","The Test for Rating Emotions in Speech (T-RES) has been developed in order to assess the processing of emotions in spoken language. In this tool, spoken sentences, which are composed of emotional content (anger, happiness, sadness, and neutral) in both semantics and prosody in different combinations, are rated by listeners. To date, English, German, and Hebrew versions have been developed, as well as online versions, iT-RES, to adapt to COVID-19 social restrictions. Since the perception of spoken emotions may be affected by linguistic (and cultural) variables, it is important to compare the acoustic characteristics of the stimuli within and between languages. The goal of the current report was to provide cross-linguistic acoustic validation of the T-RES. T-RES sentences in the aforementioned languages were acoustically analyzed in terms of mean F0, F0 range, and speech rate to obtain profiles of acoustic parameters for different emotions. Significant within-language discriminability of prosodic emotions was found, for both mean F0 and speech rate. Similarly, these measures were associated with comparable patterns of prosodic emotions for each of the tested languages and emotional ratings. The results demonstrate the lack of dependence of prosody and semantics within the T-RES stimuli. These findings illustrate the listeners' ability to clearly distinguish between the different prosodic emotions in each language, providing a cross-linguistic validation of the T-RES and iT-RES.","Carl, Icht, Ben-David","https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00205","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27081,""
"Patient Asynchronous Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Retrospective Analysis of Patient Portal Messages","During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patient portals and their message platforms allowed remote access to healthcare. Utilization patterns in patient messaging during the COVID-19 crisis have not been studied thoroughly. In this work, we propose to characterize patients and their use of asynchronous virtual care for COVID-19 via a retrospective analysis of patient portal messages. To perform a retrospective analysis of portal messages to probe patient asynchronous response to the COVID-19 crisis. We collected over 2 million patient-generated messages (PGMs) at Mayo Clinic during February 1 - August 31, 2020. We performed descriptive statistics on PGMs related to COVID-19 and incorporated patients' sociodemographic factors into the analysis. We analyzed the PGMs on COVID-19 in terms of COVID-19 related care (e.g., COVID-19 symptom self-assessment and COVID-19 tests and results) and other health issues (e.g., appointment cancellation, anxiety, and depression). The majority of PGMs on COVID-19 pertained to COVID-19 symptom self-assessment (42.50%) and COVID-19 tests and results (30.84%). The PGMs related to COVID-19 symptom self-assessment and COVID-19 test results had dynamic patterns and peaks similar to the newly confirmed cases in the US and Minnesota. The trend of PGMs related COVID-19 care plans paralleled trends in newly hospitalized cases and deaths. After an initial peak in March, the PGMs on issues such as appointment cancellations and anxiety regarding COVID-19 had a declining trend. The majority of message senders were 30-64 years old, married, female, white, or urban residents. This majority was an even higher proportion among patients who sent portal messages on COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients increased portal messaging utilization to address healthcare issues about COVID-19 (particularly, symptom self-assessment and tests and results). Trends in message utilization closely followed national trends in new cases and hospitalizations. There is a wide disparity for minority and rural populations in utilization of PGMs for addressing the COVID-19 crisis.","Huang, Khurana, Mastorakos, Wen, He, Wang, Liu, Wang, Zong, Prigge, Costello, Shah, Ting, Fan, Patten, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/35187","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27082,""
"Influence of forced online distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived stress of post-secondary students: Cross-sectional study","One of the most significant changes in the majority of post-secondary educational institutions was the closure of those institutions and the shift of educational activities to online distance-learning formats as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Closure combined with forced online distance education was a cure with many side-effects, one of them being the effect on students' mental health and, more specifically, levels of stress. Due to the novelty of the situation, there have been no studies so far designed to link satisfaction with online study, feelings towards the study obligations and stress among students. The aim of the study was to assess the perceived stress of Slovenian post-secondary students in order to identify the online study-related factors affecting and/or acting as a covariate during the COVID-19 lockdown. Data collection was conducted through a self-reported survey as part of a large cross-sectional study based on data collected from post-secondary students from a number of higher educational institutions. The random sample consisted of 4,455 individuals. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Satisfaction with Online Study Scale (SAT-5) and Feelings Towards Study Obligations Scale (FETSOS) were used to assess the constructs and the relations observed within the study. The results indicate that more than half of all respondents reported high levels of stress. The difference in the reported levels of perceived stress between genders are statistically significant (F (N = 4,454, df = 2) = 56.719, p &lt; .001; dCohen = 0.35). Overall, the results suggest that a decline in motivation to study, the quality of internet and mobile connections and the presence of distracting factors in the study space were the three main factors related to the students' negative emotions as associated with timeliness, performance and the quality of the study obligations. Furthermore, the results show that the level of satisfaction with online study affects stress such that the higher the satisfaction, the lower the stress. Moreover, the more positive feelings connected with timeliness, performance and quality of the study obligations that the students felt, the more satisfaction they reported with online study and, thus indirectly, lower stress and less negative feelings. The findings of the present study call for implementing structures and measures targeted at stress reduction, working conditions and pedagogy with regard to forced online distance education.","Ã…Â orgo, CrnkoviÃ„Â, Gabrovec, Cesar, Selak","https://doi.org/10.2196/30778","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27083,""
"Prevalence of the Most Frequent Neuropsychiatric Diagnoses in Hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 Patients Evaluated by Liaison Psychiatry: Cross-Sectional Study","The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with the acute onset of mental and behavioural symptoms and psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the different neuropsychiatric diagnoses in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by Liaison Psychiatry. We performed a cross-sectional study in a hospital near Lisbon, Portugal. We reviewed the electronic health records from all inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test that were assessed by the Liaison Psychiatry Unit (LPU) between February and December 2020. We reviewed relevant sociodemographic and clinical data, including 15 neuropsychiatric symptoms. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was our main outcome. We also explored differences between two groups: patients with delirium (delirium group) and patients without delirium (no delirium group). We included 46 cases [Age: median = 67 years; interquartile range (IQR) = 24)], with 60.9% male individuals. Delirium was the most frequent diagnosis in our sample (43.5%), followed by major depressive disorder (21.7%). Patients with delirium were more likely to suffer from COVID-19 symptoms (delirium: 19/20, 95%; no delirium: 14/26, 53.8%; p = 0.02), and to have a longer time interval between a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and an evaluation by the LPU (delirium: median = 16.5 days, IQR = 16; no delirium: median = 8 days, IQR = 16.3; p = 0.045). Agitation (52.2%) and cognitive symptoms (47.8%) were the most reported neuropsychiatric symptoms. We found a high prevalence of delirium in our sample. This finding is in line with recent literature concerning hospitalized COVID-19 patients The higher frequency of COVID-19 symptoms found in the delirium group suggests a possible association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and delirium onset.

Revimos os processos clÃƒÂ­nicos dos pacientes internados com um resultado RT-PCR positivo para SARS-CoV-2 avaliados pela Unidade de Psiquiatria de LigaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o (UPL) entre fevereiro e dezembro de 2020. IncluÃƒÂ­mos dados sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos e clÃƒÂ­nicos, incluindo quinze sintomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos. A incidÃƒÂªncia de diferentes diagnÃƒÂ³sticos psiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos foi o nosso outcome primÃƒÂ¡rio. ExplorÃƒÂ¡mos tambÃƒÂ©m diferenÃƒÂ§as entre dois grupos: doentes com delirium e doentes sem delirium. Resultados: IncluÃƒÂ­mos 46 casos [Idade: mediana = 67 anos; amplitude interquartil (AIQ) = 24)], a maioria do sexo masculino (60,9%). Delirium foi o diagnÃƒÂ³stico mais frequente na nossa amostra (43,5%), seguido de perturbaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o depressiva major (21,7%). Doentes com delirium tiveram uma prevalÃƒÂªncia maior de sintomas de COVID-19 (delirium: 19/20, 95%; sem delirium: 14/26, 53,8%; p = 0,02), bem como um intervalo de tempo mais longo entre um teste RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivo e observaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o pela UPL (delirium: mediana = 16,5, AIQ = 16; sem delirium: mediana = 8, AIQ = 16,3; p = 0,045). AgitaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o (52,2%) e sintomas cognitivos (47,8%) foram os sintomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos mais relatados. ConclusÃƒÂ£o: Foi encontrada na nossa amostra uma elevada prevalÃƒÂªncia de delirium.

"Disparities by Sex in COVID-19 Risk and Related Harms Among People with Opioid Use Disorder","<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> (1) Report sex-specific prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test positivity among an opioid use disorder (OUD) cohort (2) Assess sex-specific rates of opioid overdose and mortality. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A retrospective cohort study was performed on all adult patients with OUD who received a COVID-19 test in calendar year 2020 at a large academic medical center in Richmond, Virginia. Our study outcomes were positive COVID-19 test, opioid overdose, and all-cause in-hospital mortality. Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression assessed sociodemographic factors associated with COVID-19 test positivity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 2,600 patients (malesÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,294, femalesÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,306) with OUD received a COVID-19 test. Approximately 5% across both sexes tested positive for COVID-19 (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.420), whereas 7% presented with an opioid overdose (males 10%; females 4%; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). However, mortality rates were similar across sex. Among males, individuals in the other racial group had increased odds of COVID-19 test positivity (adjusted odds ratio or AOR: 5.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70-14.88), whereas black females had higher odds of COVID-19 test positivity (AOR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.01-3.62) compared to their white counterparts. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Opioid overdose, more often than COVID-19, impacted the health of patients with OUD presenting to a public safety net health system. Despite a female advantage documented in the general population for COVID-19 susceptibility, COVID-19 test positivity rates were similar across sex in an OUD cohort; yet, racial disparities emerged with notable sex-related variation. Sex and gender are important variables that modify health outcomes, including OUD and COVID-19, and should be further investigated using an intersectionality framework.","Martin, Thakkar, Taylor, Chapman","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2021.0457","20220216","coronavirus/COVID-19; gender differences; substance-related and addictive disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27085,""
"Self-rated mental health, community belonging, life satisfaction and perceived change in mental health among adults during the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","Findings from the 2020 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH) suggested that the positive mental health of adults in Canada was lower during the second wave of the pandemic (fall 2020) than in 2019. With 2021 SCMH data from winter/spring 2021, we find in the current study that average life satisfaction and the prevalence of high self-rated mental health, high community belonging and perceptions of stable/improved mental health were even lower during the third wave of the pandemic as compared to the second wave in the overall adult population and in most sociodemographic groups.

"Depressive symptoms and experiences of birthing mothers during COVID-19 pandemic","It is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected postnatal women in Norway. We therefore wanted to investigate their depressive symptoms and birthing experiences during the pandemic. In April 2021, a total of 3Ã‚Â 642 postnatal women participated in an online survey. Depressive symptoms were measured using a short matrix version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS-4), and standardised questions about the ante-, peri- and post-natal periods were used to record birthing experiences. The questions were the same as those used ten years ago in the Ahus Birth Cohort study, which is the reference population here. The women were also asked questions related to the pandemic and mental health care. Twenty-nine per cent of the mothers indicated that the pandemic had had a 'large' or 'very large' impact on their mental health. Thirty-two per cent reported high scores for depressive symptoms (EPDS-4 scores Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 6), while the corresponding figure in the reference population was 10Ã‚Â %. The proportion of mothers who were dissatisfied with their pregnancy experience was almost the same in both cohorts, while the proportion that reported poor care in the maternity ward during the pandemic was higher than for the reference population (34Ã‚Â % vs. 13Ã‚Â %). Of those who had mental health problems during the pandemic, 54Ã‚Â % stated that they had not received appropriate help. One in three postnatal women reported high scores for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. The study revealed significant dissatisfaction with the care provided in maternity wards and inadequate follow-up of the mothers' mental health.","Eberhard-Gran, Engelsen, Al-Zirqi, Vangen","https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.21.0450","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27087,""
"Knowledge, attitudes, and psychosocial impacts among Brazilian Pediatric Dentists during COVID-19 pandemic","In this study, we evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and psychosocial impacts among Brazilian pediatric dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study with primary data collection was carried out using an online structured questionnaire. Data were submitted to descriptive analysis by using absolute and relative frequencies. A chi-square test was used for association analysis and log-linear regression models to estimate the prevalence ratio (5%). The population comprised mostly women and knowledge regarding COVID-19 was satisfactory (above 80% in most items). N95 masks and faceshields were used, albeit 64.22% reported difficulty in providing dental care to children due to the need for extra Personal Protective Equipment. Thirty eight percent provided urgency/emergency dental care, 59.78% performed invasive procedures, 59.56% used high speed handpieces, 8.44% started using cariostatics, and 6.22% introduced the use of chemomechanical caries removal agents. Fear for the future (PR = 1.21) and use of medications (for anxiety, depression, or insomnia) increased (PR = 1.16) among the ones who had wage losses. Brazilian pediatric dentists have knowledge about COVID-19, and attitudes in their clinical routines changed due the pandemic. Financial life was harmed and a negative impact of the pandemic in psychosocial aspects of workers was found.","Torres, Lizzi, Borsatto, Nelson Filho, De Rossi, DÃƒÂ­az-Serrano, Barros, Paula-Silva, Carvalho, Silva, Silva, Lucisano, Queiroz","https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2022.vol36.0028","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27088,""

"Two wars on one front: Experiences of gynaecological cancer patients in the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of gynaecological cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic from their own perspectives. The study is a descriptive study with a qualitative design based on thematic analysis. We conducted the study with 17 women with gynaecological cancer and receiving chemotherapy in the Medical Oncology and Chemotherapy Unit of KÃƒÂ¼tahya Training and Research Hospital. The data were collected between April 2021 and May 2021 via an in-depth individual interview form. The COREQ checklist was followed in the study. As a result of the interviews, we identified four main themes: the impacts of COVID-19 on life, the impact of COVID-19 on cancer treatment, the biggest fear during the COVID-19 pandemic and the metaphors of struggling with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruption of treatment services during the COVID-19 pandemic and women's fear of infection by the virus led to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. This situation caused the women's state of health to deteriorate, and the resultant regret and sadness that they experienced had an adverse effect on their mental health. Furthermore, women's self-isolation due to the fear of infection by the virus had a negative effect on their psychosocial health. Telehealth services should be provided for cancer patients to obtain accurate information and to easily access information about treatment processes during the pandemic, and telepsychological hotlines and peer support groups should be established to improve the psychosocial health of patients.","AydÃ„Â±n, Bostan, KabukcuoÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13562","20220216","COVID-19; gynaecological cancer; nursing; pandemic; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27090,""
"Neurocognitive Screening in Patients Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Tools for Triage","<b>Background and purpose</b> Cognitive complaints are common in patients recovering from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet their etiology is often unclear. We assess factors that contribute to cognitive impairment in ambulatory versus hospitalized patients during the sub-acute stage of recovery. <b>Methods</b> Participants were prospectively recruited from a hospital-wide registry. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerasechain-reaction assay. Patients Ã¢â€°Â¤ 18 years-of-age and those with a pre-existing major neurocognitive disorder were excluded. Participants completed an extensive neuropsychological questionnaire and a computerized cognitive screen via remote telemedicine platform. Rates of subjective and objective neuropsychological impairment were compared between the ambulatory and hospitalized groups. Factors associated with impairment were explored separately within each group. <b>Results</b> A total of 102 patients (76 ambulatory, 26 hospitalized) completed the symptom inventory and neurocognitive tests 24 Ã‚Â± 22 days following laboratory confirmation of SARSCoV-2 infection. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients self-reported high rates of cognitive impairment (27-40%), without differences between the groups. However, hospitalized patients showed higher rates of objective impairment in visual memory (30% vs. 4%; p=0.001) and psychomotor speed (41% vs. 15%; p=0.008). Objective cognitive test performance was associated with anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain in the ambulatory but not the hospitalized group. <b>Conclusions</b> Focal cognitive deficits are more common in hospitalized than ambulatory patients. Cognitive performance is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in ambulatory but not hospitalized patients. Objective neurocognitive measures can provide essential information to inform neurologic triage and should be included as endpoints in clinical trials.","Blackmon, Day, Powers, Bosch, Prabhakaran, Woolston, Pedraza","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1127420/v1","20220216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27091,""
"The Role of Threat Appraisal and Coping Style in Psychological Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among University Students","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to psychological distress among community samples and university students (Cao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Some coping behaviors and cognitive appraisals allow individuals to experience positive psychological growth amid such a crisis (Folkman et al. 1986). In the event of continuing waves of COVID-19 infection and future viral outbreaks, understanding the relationships between coping behaviors, stress appraisals, and COVID-related distress and growth can empower public health officials and university leadership to mitigate negative consequences and encourage growth. 774 undergraduate students completed online self-report measures of coping (Brief COPE; emotion, problem, avoidant), stress appraisal (SAM; threat/centrality, challenge/self-efficacy, uncontrol, other-control), neuroticism (NEO-N), health anxiety (SHAI), and COVID-19 exposure/impact (C-PIQ; distress and growth). Hypotheses were examined via simpleregressions and interactions. Increased utilization of avoidant coping was associated with high levels of distress regardless of whether it was perceived as threatening or not. Emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies were associated with more growth, whereas avoidant coping was associated with less growth. Higher emotion-focused coping and challenge appraisal together predicted the most growth. Cross-sectional design precludes the tracking of distress and growth over time; this study relied on self-report data. These results underscore the impact of stress appraisals on the mental health of students navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings may inform public health messaging-or have clinical implications, as successful interventions exist for improving coping strategies and stress appraisals.","Chu, Goger, Malaktaris, Lang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100325","20220216","Appraisal; COVID-19; Coping; Distress; Emerging adults; Health threat; Post-traumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27092,""
"A longitudinal comparison of college student mental health under the COVID-19 self-restraint policy in Japan","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial mental health problems. In addition to the fear of infection, prevention policies that result in isolation such as lockdowns or, in Japan, ""self-restraint,"" are associated with psychological symptoms. University students are vulnerable to emotional disorders because of the psychological challenges associated with the transition to adulthood. Therefore, we investigated changes in the mental health of university students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from depression screening conducted by the University of Tsukuba, Japan, during student health examinations. Students completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and an open-ended question on stress self-coping. In 2020, 9.6% of students were depressed, approximately twice as many as in previous years. The paired samples Wilcoxon test showed that PHQ-9 scores were significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019; the largest effect size was for sleep difficulties. Analysis of the open-ended responses for stress coping strategies showed that physical activity and online communication were most frequently used. The 2020 survey was web-based, whereas the surveys in previous years were completed in person. Only approximately one-sixth of participants answered the open-ended question. The percentage of students with mental health problems has doubled, and more attention to student mental health is needed. However, many students seem to be using appropriate coping measures. Education about best practices and raising awareness about establishing and maintaining sleep-wake rhythms may be useful.","Shiratori, Ogawa, Ota, Sodeyama, Sakamoto, Arai, Tachikawa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100314","20220216","COVID-19; Depression; morphological analysis; sleep disturbances; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27093,""
"Effects of an online self-help intervention on university students' mental health during COVID-19: A non-randomized controlled pilot study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on university students, particulary on their mental health. However, little is yet known about how to prevent and/or reduce this impact. Prior to COVID-19, some studies have shown that online stress management programs were successful enough to improve students' mental health and stress adjustment strategies, suggesting that these interventions should be further developed during the pandemic. Our study explored the effects on mental health of an online program that targeted stress management and learning. A total of 347 university students were initially recruited to take part in a non-randomized controlled study. After dropout, our final sample consisted of 114 participants, divided into two groups: an intervention group (participants who took part in the program) and the control group (participants who did not participate in the program). The variables measured were: anxiety and depressive symptoms, academic burnout, learned helplessness, and coping strategies. Means comparisons between baseline (T0) and an assessment at 8 weeks (T1) revealed reductions in anxiety symptoms and learned helplessness in the intervention group, but not in the control group.

"COVID-19: Contrasting experiences of South African physiotherapists based on patient exposure","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed physiotherapists to unique work-related challenges. However, there is a lack of research regarding the mental health and lived experiences of South African physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine levels of mental and physical health, burnout, depression, anxiety and resilience and coping strategies used by a sample of South African physiotherapists with and without exposure to patients with COVID-19. Lived work experience, perceived health and sources of support were also explored. A non-experimental, cross-sectional, mixed-method design was used. Physiotherapists completed an online survey comprising: a demographic questionnaire; scales assessing mental and physical health, burnout, depression, anxiety and coping strategies and six open-ended questions. A total of 171 physiotherapists participated in our study, 43.3% of whom were exposed to patients with COVID-19. The exposure group scored significantly higher on self-reported mental health, anxiety, depression and burnout than the non-exposure group. No significant differences were reported for physical health and resilience. Significantly more maladaptive coping strategies were employed by the exposure group. Participants' lived experiences highlighted similar experiences, as well as work-related challenges. Both groups reported that primary sources of support were significant others, but highlighted the lack of organisational support. Irrespective of the degree of exposure to COVID-19, the mental health and lived experiences of physiotherapists working in South Africa has been negatively impacted by COVID-19.

"Mental health distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria: Need for psychological intervention","The world began to realise the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020, and since then the number of people infected has exceeded 1 million globally. In less than 1 month following the first reported case in Nigeria, over 180 people had tested positive to the disease. Studies have shown that such rapidly spreading infectious diseases have the potential to create widespread fear, apprehension, panic and anxiety amongst the general public. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of information dissemination and public mental healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. It also hopes to determine if there is an unmet need for telepsychiatry in Nigeria. Community-based study covering the North, South and West of Nigeria. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using an on-line survey form via the snowballing sampling method. Social media was identified as the main source of information concerning COVID-19, and half of the respondents opined that information dissemination was inadequate. Psychological distress was present in 90.5% of the participants and 61.8% admitted that this distress was worsened by fake news and myths concerning COVID-19. However, 53.8% of the participants were willing to access mental healthcare services, with telepsychiatry being the preferred choice.

"[""Management of nurses specialized in the aero-evacuation of highly infectious critical patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic Systematic review""]","Aeromedical evacuation missions to transport highly infectious critical COVID-19 patients involve multiple factors, therefore planning is essential in their preparation. The management of specialist nurses is cross-cutting, as they participate in the planning, organisation and implementation of aero-evacuation protocols, delivery of care and operational safety procedures throughout the operation, with an integrated aeromedical crew working as a team alongside the air crew. To study the management of nurses specialised in the aero-evacuation of highly infectious critical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a systematic search of the biomedical literature, this study was conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and PRISMA. The literature search included articles published from 2019 to August 2020 and meta-search engines, yielding a total of 142 articles, and a triangulation of information was performed. A total of 11 articles were eventually included in the review, and the validity of each article was determined according to the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute level of evidence. The systematic review identified 11 studies that use different methodological considerations for conducting an aeromedical evacuation and covering key aspects for a successful operation. The management of specialist nurses has a direct impact on the aeromedical evacuation of the critical patient. It covers planning, organisation, and operational safety, applied in the instruction, training, execution and strict monitoring of the work of the aeromedical crew as a solid team.

"The Role of Empathy in Chinese Adolescents' Preventive Health Behavior During COVID-19","Preventive health behavior during COVID-19 protects not only oneself but also the welfare of others. However, little attention has been paid to prosocial motivation in adolescents, who are often viewed as selfish and egocentric. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the role of empathy in adolescents' preventive health behavior using longitudinal data. A total of 442 Chinese adolescents (mean age of youthÃ‚Â = 13.35Ã‚Â years; 49.5% girls and 50.5% boys) completed two-wave longitudinal surveys over the span of two months during the pandemic (Time 1: July 2020; Time 2: September 2020). At T1, participants reported on their empathic concern, perspective taking, and concern for personal health. At both T1 and T2, participants reported on their preventive health behavior and COVID-related worry. Adolescents who showed greater empathic concern tend to engage in more preventive health behavior over time (p &lt; .01). However, greater empathic concern also predicted adolescents' greater worry about COVID-19 over time (p &lt; .01). In comparison, adolescents' perspective-taking and concern for personal health did not predict their health behavior or worry over time. Notably, the longitudinal effect of empathic concern on preventive health behavior and COVID-related worry remained (ps &lt; .05) after taking into account adolescents' perspective-taking and concern for personal health. These findings highlight adolescents' prosocial motivation in engaging in preventive health behavior during the pandemic and also point out the potential negative influence of empathic concern on adolescent mental health.","Qu, Chen, Yang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.12.021","20220216","Adolescents; COVID-19; Empathy; Health behavior; Prosocial motivation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27098,""
"Staff support in a National Health Service mental health trust in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the impact work can have on healthcare workers and the importance of staff support services. Rapid guidance was published to encourage preventive and responsive support for healthcare workers. To understand mental healthcare staff's help-seeking behaviours and access to support at work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to inform iterative improvements to provision of staff support. We conducted a formative appraisal of access to support and support needs of staff in a National Health Service mental health trust. This involved 11 semi-structured individual interviews using a topic guide. Five virtual staff forums were additional sources of data. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. Peer-based, within-team support was highly valued and sought after. However, access to support was negatively affected by work pressures, physical distancing and perceived cultural barriers. Healthcare organisations need to help colleagues to support each other by facilitating open, diverse workplace cultures and providing easily accessible, safe and reflective spaces. Future research should evaluate support in the evolving work contexts imposed by COVID-19 to inform interventions that account for differences across healthcare workforces.","Smith, Zhang, Jones, Dorrington, Winter, Beck","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.12","20220216","COVID-19; Qualitative research; policy; staff support; stigma and discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","",27099,""
