"COVID-19: a study about the impact of coronavirus on physicians of La Plata, Argentina","Background: In Argentina, the burden of COVID-19 on health systems and physicians was substantial with difficulties on daily triage decisions which have to be made in the context of grave shortages of basic equipment and consumables. Purpose: this study was performed to understand what physicians were experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic in La Plata (capital city of Buenos Aires province, Argentina). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed; a questionnaire was sent by e-mail to physicians who work in this city during November 2020. The questionnaire was made based on Medscape US and International Physicians COVID-19 Experience Report: Risk, Burnout, Loneliness. Statistical analysis: test for normality was performed employing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test while Chi-square test of independence to examine the relationship between sex and workplace with nominal variables. For categorical variables, Kendall tau correlation was performed to test for independence. ANOVA was developed to examine differences between physician age. Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05 in all cases. All statistical analysis was done employing SPSS Statistics, Version 24 (IBM, USA). Results: 203 physicians answered the questionnaire; the majority of physicians (96%) considered stressful their experience during pandemic and reported distress episodes being for more than 60% the most stressful of their practices, 30% presented depression and were medically treated, while 32.7% felt loneliness with 4 physicians with suicidal thoughts. Conclusion: The results highlight the need to protect the psychological well-being of the healthcare community, and to invest resources to significantly promote the mental health of professionals.","Maria Virginia Croce; Elsa Chiappa; Adriana Moiso; Martin Enrique Rabassa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.05.21265969","20211109","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21598,""
"Women's Well-Being During a Pandemic and its Containment","The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it. Yet, there is little evidence on the impacts of these policies on women, who are likely to be especially vulnerable, in lower-income countries. We conduct a large phone survey and leverage India's geographically-varying containment policies to estimate the association between both the pandemic and its containment policies, and measures of women's well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases, we find that greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and with reduced female mental health. Average containment levels are associated with a 39-40% increase in the likelihood of sadness, depression, and hopelessness among women and with an increase in the likelihood that women feel more worried by 45% of the variable mean. Particularly vulnerable groups of women, those with daughters and those living in female-headed households, experience larger declines in mental health.","Bau, Natalie, Khanna, Gaurav, Low, Corinne, Shah, Manisha, Sharmin, Sreyashi, Voena, Alessandra","https://doi.org/10.3386/w29121","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 29121, 2021.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 29121, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21599,""
"When Innovation Goes Wrong: Technological Regress and the Opioid Epidemic","The fourfold increase in opioid deaths between 2000 and 2017 rivals even the COVID-19 pandemic as a health crisis for America. Why did it happen? Measures of demand for pain relief â€“ physical pain and despair â€“ are high and in many cases rising, but their increase was nowhere near as large as the increase in deaths. The primary shift is in supply, primarily of new forms of allegedly safer narcotics. These new pain relievers flowed in greater volume to areas with more physical pain and mental health impairment, but since their apparent safety was an illusion, opioid deaths followed. By the end of the 2000s, restrictions on legal opioids led to further supply-side innovations which created the burgeoning illegal market that accounts for the bulk of opioid deaths today. Because opioid use is easier to start than end, Americaâ€™s opioid epidemic is likely to persist for some time.","Cutler, David M.; Glaeser, Edward L.","https://doi.org/10.3386/w28873","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28873, 2021.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28873, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21600,""

"The U-shape of Happiness in Scotland","We examine well-being in Scotland using micro data from the Scottish Health Survey and the UK Annual Population Surveys. We find evidence of a midlife low in Scotland in well-being at around age fifty using a variety of measures of both happiness and unhappiness. We confirm that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with higher levels of happiness in Scotland. We compare this with evidence for England from the Health Survey of England. The decline in well-being between youth and midlife is comparable in size to the loss of a spouse or of a job and around half of the fall in well-being in the COVID-19 lockdown. We also find a mid-life peak in suicides in Scotland. Despite higher mortality and suicide rates in Scotland than in England, paradoxically we find that the Scots are happier than the English. Northern Ireland is the happiest of the four home countries. We also find evidence of U-shapes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the mid to late forties.","Bell, David N.

"The Macroeconomics of a Pandemic: A Minimalist Model","We build a minimalist model of the macroeconomics of a pandemic, with two essential components. The first is productivity-related: if the virus forces firms to shed labor beyond a certain threshold, productivity suffers. The second component is a credit market imperfection: because lenders cannot be sure a borrower will repay, they only lend against collateral. Expected productivity determines collateral value;in turn, collateral value can limit borrowing and productivity. As a result, adverse shocks have large magnification effects, in an unemployment and asset price deflation doom loop. There may be multiple equilibria, so that pessimistic expectations can push the economy to a bad equilibrium with limited borrowing and low employment and productivity. The model helps identify policies to fight the effects of the pandemic. Traditional expansionary fiscal policy has no beneficial effects, while cutting interest rates has a limited effect if the initial real interest rate is low. By contrast, several unconventional policies, including wage subsidies, helicopter drops of liquid assets, equity injections, and loan guarantees, can keep the economy in a full-employment, high-productivity equilibrium. Such policies can be fiscally expensive, so their implementation is feasible only with ample fiscal space or emergency financing from abroad.","CÃ©spedes, Luis Felipe, Chang, Roberto, Velasco, AndrÃ©s","https://doi.org/10.3386/w27228","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27228, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27228, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21603,""
"Longer-run Economic Consequences of Pandemics","What are the medium- to long-term effects of pandemics? How do they differ from other economic disasters? We study major pandemics using the rates of return on assets stretching back to the 14th century. Significant macroeconomic after-effects of pandemics persist for about decades, with real rates of return substantially depressed, in stark contrast to what happens after wars. Our findings are consistent with the neoclassical growth model: capital is destroyed in wars, but not in pandemics;pandemics instead may induce relative labor scarcity and/or a shift to greater precautionary savings.","JordÃ , Ã’scar, Singh, Sanjay R.; Taylor, Alan M.","https://doi.org/10.3386/w26934","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 26934, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 26934, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21604,""
"Incorporating Scenario Analysis into the Federal Reserveâ€™s Policy Strategy and Communications","The U.S. economy currently faces a truly extraordinary degree of uncertainty as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve could begin highlighting alternative scenarios to illustrate key risks to the economic outlook, and such scenarios could inform the Fedâ€™s policy strategy and public communications. In this paper, we present a set of illustrative scenarios, including a baseline scenario with a rapid but incomplete recovery this year (an upward-tilting checkmark), a benign scenario in which an effective cure or vaccine becomes available and facilitates a nearly complete recovery by mid-2021, and a severely adverse scenario involving persistently high unemployment and disinflationary pressures. Insights into these scenarios can be drawn from key historical episodes, including the Spanish flu, the Great Depression, the end of World War II, and the global financial crisis. We conclude by identifying key challenges that the Federal Reserve might face in adjusting its monetary policy and emergency credit facilities under each of these alternative scenarios.","Bordo, Michael D.; Levin, Andrew T.; Levy, Mickey D.","https://doi.org/10.3386/w27369","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27369, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27369, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21605,""
"The Impacts of COVID-19 on Minority Unemployment: First Evidence from April 2020 CPS Microdata","COVID-19 abruptly impacted the labor market with the unemployment rate jumping to 14.7 percent less than two months after state governments began adopting social distancing measures. Unemployment of this magnitude has not been seen since the Great Depression. This paper provides the first study of how the pandemic impacted minority unemployment using CPS microdata through April 2020. African-Americans experienced an increase in unemployment to 16.6 percent, less than anticipated based on previous recessions. In contrast, Latinx, with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent, were disproportionately hard hit by COVID-19. Adjusting for concerns of the BLS regarding misclassification of unemployment, we create an upper-bound measure of the national unemployment rate of 26.5 percent, which is higher than the peak observed in the Great Depression. The April 2020 upper-bound unemployment rates are an alarming 31.8 percent for blacks and 31.4 percent for Latinx. Difference-in-difference estimates suggest that blacks were, at most, only slightly disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Non-linear decomposition estimates indicate that a slightly favorable industry distribution partly protected them from being hit harder by COVID-19. The most impacted group are Latinx. Difference-in-difference estimates unequivocally indicate that Latinx were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to why Latinx experienced much higher unemployment rates than whites. These findings of early impacts of COVID-19 on unemployment raise important concerns about long-term economic effects for minorities.","Fairlie, Robert W.; Couch, Kenneth, Xu, Huanan","https://doi.org/10.3386/w27246","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27246, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27246, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21606,""
"How the New Fed Municipal Bond Facility Capped Muni-Treasury Yield Spreads in the Covid-19 Recession","For over two centuries, the municipal bond market has been a source of systemic risk, which returned early in the Covid-19 downturn when borrowing from securities markets became costly for many private and public entities, and some found it difficult to borrow at all. Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the municipal (muni) bond market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent a repeat, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment grade state and local government bonds at normal ratings-based interest rate spreads over Treasury bonds plus a fee of 100 basis points, later reduced to 50 basis points. Despite a modest take-up, the MLF has effectively capped muni spreads at near normal levels plus the Fed fee and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There are concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility lasts too long and could induce moral hazard among borrowers. How the MLF will be unwound will affect these downside aspects and help answer the question whether the programâ€™s benefits exceed its costs.","Bordo, Michael D.; Duca, John V.","https://doi.org/10.3386/w28437","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28437, 2021.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28437, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21607,""
"How New Fed Corporate Bond Programs Dampened the Financial Accelerator in the Covid-19 Recession","In the financial crisis and recession induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, many investment-grade firms became unable to borrow from securities markets. In response, the Fed not only reopened its commercial paper funding facility but also announced it would purchase newly issued and seasoned bonds of corporations rated as investment grade before the Covid pandemic at spreads roughly 1 percentage point above non-recession averages. A careful splicing of different unemployment rate series enables us to assess the effectiveness of recent Fed interventions in these long-term debt markets over long sample periods, spanning the Great Depression, Great Recession and the Covid Recession. Findings indicate that the announcement of forthcoming corporate bond backstop facilities have capped risk premia at levels 100 basis points above non-recession averages, akin to a â€œpenalty rateâ€ for lender of last resort interventions during financial crises. In doing so, these Fed facilities have limited the role of external finance premia in amplifying the macroeconomic impact of the Covid pandemic. Nevertheless, the corporate bond programs blend the roles of the Federal Reserve in conducting monetary policy via its balance sheet, acting as a lender of last resort, and pursuing credit policies.","Bordo, Michael D.; Duca, John V.","https://doi.org/10.3386/w28097","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28097, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28097, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21608,""
"The Great Divide: Education, Despair and Death","Deaths of despair, morbidity and emotional distress continue to rise in the US. The increases are largely borne by those without a four-year college degreeâ€”the majority of American adults. For many less-educated Americans, the economy and society are no longer providing the basis for a good life. Concurrently, all-cause mortality in the US is diverging by educationâ€”falling for the college-educated and rising for those without a degreeâ€”something not seen in other rich countries. We review the rising prevalence of pain, despair, and suicide among Americans without a BA. Pain and despair created a baseline demand for opioids, but the escalation of addiction came from pharma and its political enablers. We examine â€œthe politics of despair,â€ how less-educated people have abandoned and been abandoned by the Democratic Party. While healthier states once voted Republican in presidential elections, now the least-healthy states do. We review the evidence on whether or not deaths of despair have risen during the COVID pandemic. More broadly, excess mortality from COVID has not increased the ratio of all-cause mortality rates for those with and without a four-year degree, but has instead replicated the pre-existing mortality ratio.","Case, Anne, Deaton, Angus","https://doi.org/10.3386/w29241","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 29241, 2021.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 29241, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21609,""

Demand for workers in high contact and inflexible service occupations has declined, while parental supply of labor has been reduced by lack of access to reliable child care and in-person schooling options.

"Effects of State COVID-19 Closure Policy on NON-COVID-19 Health Care Utilization","The U.S. health care system has experienced great pressure since early March 2020 as it pivoted to providing necessary care for COVID-19 patients. But there are signs that non-COVID-19 care use declined during this time period. We examine near real time data from a nationwide electronic healthcare records system that covers over 35 million patients to provide new evidence of how non-COVID-19 acute care and preventive/primary care have been affected during the epidemic. Using event study and difference-in-difference models we find that state closure policies (stay-at-home or non-essential business closures) are associated with large declines in ambulatory visits, with effects differing by type of care. State closure policies reduced overall outpatient visits by about 15-16 percent within two weeks. Outpatient visits for health check-ups and well care experience very large declines during the epidemic, with substantial effects from state closure policies. In contrast, mental health outpatient visits declined less than other care, and appear less affected by state closure policies. We find substitution to telehealth modalities may have played an important role in mitigating the decline in mental health care utilization. Aggregate trends in outpatient visits show a 40% decline after the first week of March 2020, only a portion of which is attributed to state policy. A rebound starts around mid April that does not appear to be explained by state reopening policy. Despite this rebound, care visits still remain below the pre-epidemic levels in most cases.","Ziedan, Engy, Simon, Kosali I.; Wing, Coady","https://doi.org/10.3386/w27621","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27621, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27621, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21611,""
"Economic Studies on the Opioid Crisis: A Review","The United States has experienced an unprecedented crisis related to the misuse of and addiction to opioids. As of 2018, 128 Americans die each day of an opioid overdose, and total economic costs associated with opioid misuse are estimated to be more than $500 billion annually. The crisis has evolved in three phases, starting in the 1990s and continuing through 2010 with a massive increase in use of prescribed opioids associated with lax prescribing regulations and aggressive marketing e<U+FB00>orts by the pharmaceutical industry. A second phase included tightening restrictions on prescribed opioids, reformulation of some commonly misused prescription medications, and a shift to heroin consumption over the period 2010 to 2013. Since 2013, the third phase of the crisis has included a movement towards synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, and a continued tightening of opioid prescribing regulations, along with the growth of both harm reduction and addiction treatment access policies. Economic research, using innovative frameworks, causal methods, and rich data, has added to our understanding of the causes and consequences of the crisis. This body of research also identi<U+FB01>es intended and unintended impacts of policies designed to address the crisis. Although there is general agreement that the causes of the crisis include a combination of supply- and demand-side factors, and interactions between them, there is less consensus regarding the relative importance of each. Studies show that regulations can reduce opioid prescribing but may have less impact on root causes of the crisis and, in some cases, have spillover e<U+FB00>ects resulting in greater use of more harmful substances obtained in illicit markets, where regulation is less possible. There are e<U+FB00>ective opioid use disorder treatments available, but access, stigma, and cost hurdles have sti<U+FB02>ed utilization, resulting in a large degree of under-treatment in the U.S. How challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic may intersect with the opioid crisis is unclear. Emerging areas for future research include understanding how societal and healthcare systems disruptions a<U+FB00>ect opioid use, as well as which regulations and policies most e<U+FB00>ectively reduce potentially inappropriate prescription opioid use and illicit opioid sources without unintended negative consequences.","Maclean, Johanna Catherine, Mallatt, Justine, Ruhm, Christopher J.; Simon, Kosali","https://doi.org/10.3386/w28067","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28067, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 28067, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21612,""
"The Determinants of Fiscal and Monetary Policies During the Covid-19 Crisis","As countries around the world grapple with Covid-19, their economies are grinding to a halt. For the first time since the Great Depression both advanced economies and developing economies are in recession. Governments and central banks have responded to the pandemic and the economic crisis using both fiscal and monetary tools on a scale that the world has not witnessed before. This paper analyzes the determinants of fiscal and monetary policies during the Covid-19 crisis. We find that high-income countries announced larger fiscal policies than lower-income countries. We also find that a countryâ€™s credit rating is the most important determinant of its fiscal spending during the pandemic. High-income countries entered the crisis with historically low interest rates and as a result were more likely to use nonconventional monetary policy tools. These findings raise the concern that countries with poor credit histories â€“ those with lower credit ratings and, in particular, lower-income countries â€“ will not be able to deploy fiscal policy tools effectively during economic crises.","Benmelech, Efraim, Tzur-Ilan, Nitzan","https://doi.org/10.3386/w27461","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27461, 2020.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 27461, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21613,""
"Deaths of Despair and the Incidence of Excess Mortality in 2020","Weekly mortality through October 3 is partitioned into normal deaths, COVID, and nonCOVID excess deaths (NCEDs). Before March, the excess is negative for the elderly, likely due to the mild flu season. From March onward, excess deaths are approximately 250,000 of which about 17,000 appear to be a COVID undercount and 30,000 non-COVID. Deaths of despair (drug overdose, suicide, alcohol) in 2017 and 2018 are good predictors of the demographic groups with NCEDs in 2020.

"Canadian Labour Market Dynamics During COVID-19","The Canadian labor market experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyze the main changes using standard labor force statistics and new data on job postings. Envisaging a phase of temporary severing of employment relationships followed by a phase of more standard labor market search and matching, we use stock and flow data to understand key developments. We find dramatic changes in employment, unemployment and labor market attachment in 2020 and, looking forward to 2021, signs of an unusual recovery with co-existing strong labor demand and stubborn persistence in depressed employment rates.","Jones, Stephen R.

"Biden, COVID and Mental Health in America","Using US Census Household Pulse Survey data for the period April 2020 to June 2021 we track the evolution of the mental health of nearly 2.3 million Americans during the COVID pandemic. We find anxiety, depression and worry peaked in November 2020, coinciding with the Presidential election. The taking of prescription drugs for mental health conditions peaked two weeks later in December 2020. Mental health improved subsequently such that by April 2021 it was better than it had been a year previously. The probability of having been diagnosed with COVID did not rise significantly in the first half of 2021 but COVID infection rates were higher among the young than the old. COVID diagnoses were significantly lower in States that had voted for Biden in the Presidential Election. The probability of vaccination rose with age, was considerably higher in Biden states, and rose precipitously over the period among the young and old. Anxiety was higher among people in Biden states, whether they had been diagnosed or not, and whether they were vaccinated or not. The association between anxiety and depression and having had COVID was not significant in Biden or Trump states but being vaccinated was associated with lower anxiety and depression, with the effect being larger in Biden states. Whilst being in paid work was associated with lower anxiety, worry and depression and was associated with higher vaccination rates, it also increased the probability of having had COVID.","Blanchflower, David G.; Bryson, Alex","https://doi.org/10.3386/w29040","","Database: NBER; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 29040, 2021.; Publication details: National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series;No. 29040, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21616,""
"Wie erleben Menschen in der zweiten LebenshÃ¤lfte die Corona-Krise? Wahrgenommene Bedrohung durch die Corona-Krise und subjektive EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten auf eine mÃ¶gliche Ansteckung mit dem Corona-Virus","Im Juni und Juli 2020 wurde im Rahmen des Deutschen Alterssurveys (DEAS) eine Kurzbefragung zu den Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise durchgefÃ¼hrt. Im Mittelpunkt der Befragung standen VerÃ¤nderungen in verschiedenen Lebensbereichen, die durch die Pandemie bei Menschen in der zweiten LebenshÃ¤lfte aufgetreten sind. Zudem gaben die Befragten Auskunft Ã¼ber ihre individuelle Wahrnehmung der Corona-Krise. Die Mehrheit der Menschen in der zweiten LebenshÃ¤lfte erlebt die Corona-Krise nicht als sehr bedrohlich. UngefÃ¤hr 9 Prozent der Menschen in der zweiten LebenshÃ¤lfte (46 bis 90 Jahre) fÃ¼hlen sich durch die Corona-Krise stÃ¤rker bedroht, 42 Prozent geben eine mittlere Bedrohung an, und knapp 50 Prozent schÃ¤tzen die Bedrohung als niedrig ein. Gesundheit spielt eine wichtige Rolle fÃ¼r die wahrgenommene Bedrohung durch die Corona-Krise. Personen, die ihre Gesundheit als weniger gut einschÃ¤tzen, fÃ¼hlen sich deutlich hÃ¤ufiger durch die Pandemie bedroht als Personen, die ihre Gesundheit als sehr gut oder gut einschÃ¤tzen. Zudem fÃ¼hlen sich Personen mit niedrigem Bildungsstand stÃ¤rker bedroht als Personen mit hohem Bildungsstand. Dagegen spielen Alter, Geschlecht sowie Corona-Infektionen im persÃ¶nlichen Umfeld keine bedeutsame Rolle fÃ¼r das Bedrohungserleben. Die Mehrheit hat das GefÃ¼hl, die Ansteckungsgefahr durch das Corona-Virus zumindest in einem mittleren AusmaÃŸ beeinflussen zu kÃ¶nnen. 23 Prozent schÃ¤tzen ihren Einfluss auf eine mÃ¶gliche Ansteckung als hoch ein, 65 Prozent als mittel und 12 Prozent als gering. Auch fÃ¼r subjektive EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten auf eine Corona-Infektion spielt Gesundheit eine wichtige Rolle. Personen, die ihre Gesundheit als weniger gut einschÃ¤tzen, sehen weniger EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten auf eine Ansteckung als Personen mit guter selbsteingeschÃ¤tzter Gesundheit. Auch Bildung und Lebensalter sind von Bedeutung: HÃ¶here EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten nehmen Personen im Alter zwischen 61 und 75 Jahren sowie Personen mit hoher Bildung wahr. Geschlecht und Corona-Infektionen im persÃ¶nlichen Umfeld spielen keine wichtige Rolle fÃ¼r die subjektiven EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten. GefÃ¼hlte Bedrohung durch die Corona-Krise und subjektive EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten auf eine Infektion hÃ¤ngen kaum miteinander zusammen. Die Gruppen derer, die eine hohe Bedrohung empfinden, und derer, die glauben, das Ansteckungsrisiko nur wenig beeinflussen zu kÃ¶nnen, sind nicht deckungsgleich. Personen, die sich durch die Corona-Krise stÃ¤rker bedroht fÃ¼hlen, sind etwas hÃ¤ufiger davon Ã¼berzeugt, das Ansteckungsrisiko beeinflussen zu kÃ¶nnen, als Personen mit niedrigem Bedrohungserleben. Gleichzeitig sind Personen in dieser Gruppe jedoch auch hÃ¤ufiger der Ansicht, einen geringen Einfluss zu haben, als Personen mit niedrigem Bedrohungserleben. Personen, die eine hohe Bedrohung erleben, sowie Personen mit geringen subjektiven EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten haben ein geringeres Wohlbefinden. Personen, die sich von der Corona-KrisestÃ¤rker bedroht fÃ¼hlen, sowie Personen, die geringe EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten Ã¼ber eine mÃ¶gliche Ansteckung erleben, sind weniger mit ihrem Leben zufrieden und berichten mehr depressive Symptome als Personen mit niedrigerem Bedrohungserleben und hÃ¶heren subjektiven EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten.","Wettstein, Markus, Vogel, Claudia, Nowossadeck, Sonja, Spuling, Svenja M.; Tesch-RÃ¶mer, Clemens","https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-70568-3","","Database: Social Science Open Access Repository; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21617,""

"Mental health in the pandemic times","The primary aim of this paper is an attempt at the analysis of the prospective direct and indirect, short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 pandemic for the individuals' mental health. The secondary aim is to deconstruct the binarity of categories of ""mental health"" and ""mental disorder"" in the context of the global critical situation. The pandemic and its consequences such as isolation requirements as well as uncertainty in diverse aspects of life burden the individuals with the stress that results in the increase of anxiety and depressiveness, which challenges the public mental health care systems. Since the anxiety and depressive states are the reactions to a hazardous outside situation, the categories of ""mental health"" and ""mental disorder"" needs reconsideration. The theoretical framework of present analyses is determined by the theory of social (cultural) trauma. The method used for the present study is a meta-analysis of theoretical literature, the results of empirical research on COVID-19 pandemic published so far (mostly in medical journals), studies on psychosocial aspects of the previous pandemics (SARS and Ebola), and press publications selected on the basis of their content on mental health issues in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.","Frackowiak-Sochanska, Monika","https://doi.org/10.14746/sr.2020.4.3.03","","Database: Social Science Open Access Repository; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21620,""
"Managing the health and safety legal and psychological ramifications of COVID-19: an Australian multidisciplinary perspective","COVID-19 represents unprecedented challenges for the entire community. Much of Australiaâ€™s commercial sector has voluntarily deployed strategies to support social distancing ahead of any lock downs. Businesses are working to safely maintain operations and a productive workforce throughout social isolation/distancing for an unknown duration. Yet uncertainty, ambiguity and radical change are breeding grounds for anxiety, stress and helplessness. Conditions that contradict safe mental health practices for work. The Australian perspective includes the cumulative stressors of the bushfires, torrential rains and floods. Each of these stressors was an environmental stressor. But people and businesses knew what to do. The newest cumulative stressor is remote work becoming the norm. Workplaces have often had a mediating effect as a point of social interaction. Legally mandated safe spaces that people could connect and be productive within. There is much research on the connection between social isolation and loneliness. Organisations need to support workers in maintaining social connections, team cohesion and productivity throughout these times. This paper will explore the health and safety legal obligations that apply in this context and outline a practical framework for organisations to contribute to and reinforce a positive state of mental health during the mass remote work experiment.","Philipps, Paul, Titterton, Alena, Tooma, Michael","https://doi.org/10.14746/sr.2020.4.3.02","","Database: Social Science Open Access Repository; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21621,""
"KÃ¶rperliche AktivitÃ¤t Ã¤lterer Menschen in der Corona-Krise","KÃ¶rperliche AktivitÃ¤ten, wie Sport, aber auch Spazierengehen oder Gartenarbeit haben positive Auswirkungen auf Gesundheit, LebensqualitÃ¤t und SelbstÃ¤ndigkeit bis ins hohe Alter. Wer kÃ¶rperlich aktiv ist, steigert die Beweglichkeit und regt den Stoffwechsel sowie das Immun- und Herz-Kreislauf-System an. KÃ¶rperliche AktivitÃ¤t kann zudem das Risiko fÃ¼r bestimmte Erkrankungen wie Diabetes oder Bluthochdruck reduzieren und dabei helfen, die im Alter zunehmende Gefahr von StÃ¼rzen zu vermindern. Nicht zuletzt hat kÃ¶rperliche AktivitÃ¤t positive Auswirkungen auf die geistige LeistungsfÃ¤higkeit, die Stimmung und das psychische Wohlbefinden Ã¤lterer Menschen.

"International students' loneliness, depression and stress levels in COVID-19 crisis: The role of social media and the host university","Purpose: The move to university life is characterized by strong emotions, some of them negative, such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotions are strengthened due to the obligatory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this research is to analyze the loneliness, depression and stress levels among international students, based on the use of social media and the role of the host university. Methods: The research was focused on survey data from international students In a total of 248 valid responses, we collected 171 from female students and 71 from males. 105 students are freshmen, 94 in their second year of study, 27 at the third, 20 at the fourth and 2 students graduated last summer. The dominant nationality is the Dutch (n=62) and Vietnamese (n=37). Results: Previous research indicates association among the use of social media, university satisfaction, and aforementioned emotions. The results indicate strong correlations between anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related stress with university satisfaction, together with social capital.

Methods: We employed a rapid review method to identify relevant data sources using our university library search tool, which offers access to 1026 individual databases. We searched for sources relating to the concepts of (a) COVID-19 crisis;(b) academic integrity;and (c) mental health. We delimited our search to sources published between 01 January and 15 May 2020. Results: Our search resulted in a preliminary data set of sources (N=60). Further screening resulted in a total nine (n=9) sources, which were reviewed in detail. Data showed an amplification of studentsâ€™ anxiety and stress during the pandemic, especially for matters relating to academic integrity. E-proctoring of examinations emerged as point of particular concern, as there were early indications in the literature that such services have proliferated rapidly during the crisis, with little known about the possible impact of electronic remote proctoring on studentsâ€™ well-being.

"Coronavirus COVID-19 disease, mental: health and psychosocial support","The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a particular and rare situation. COVID-19 has affected and is likely to affect people from many countries, in many geographical locations. We are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, with cities and even entire countries shutting down. The coronavirus has affected nearly every aspect of our lives, from school to work, to sports, to where we eat and what we do. All these changes affected people physically, but also psychologically. It is understandable that during times like this, people may be feeling afraid, worried, anxious, and depressed due to the constantly changing alerts and media coverage regarding the spread of the virus. Hence, the main aim of our paper is to explore the linkage between the coronavirus COVID-19 disease and mental health conditions, such as stress, anxiety and depression. Everyone may experience fear of the consequences of the infection with a potentially fatal new virus, and might experience mental stress, anxiety, loneliness, depression. Based on experience from past global serious viral experiences, the development and implementation of mental health assessment, support, treatment, and services are crucial and pressing goals for the health response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Corona und die Arbeitswelt der Zukunft: von der gesellschaftlichen (Un-)Sichtbarkeit des Leidens an der Pandemie","Der Beitrag beschÃ¤ftigt sich anhand des in Deutschland durchgefÃ¼hrten Arbeitswelt-Monitors ""Arbeiten in der Corona-Krise"" mit den Arbeitserfahrungen verschiedener Erwerbsklassen in der Pandemie. Die Befunde gelten fÃ¼r den deutschen Fall. Allerdings spricht einiges dafÃ¼r, dass trotz der Unterschiede der Wirtschaftsstruktur und im politischen Umgang mit COVID-19 in Ã–sterreich vergleichbare Ungleichheitsdynamiken zu beobachten sind. Drei Befunde sind besonders hervorzuheben: COVID-19 verstÃ¤rkt bestehende Klassenungleichheiten: Die subjektiven gesundheitlichen Risiken, die wirtschaftlichen Lasten und der Zugang zum mobilen Arbeiten weisen ausgeprÃ¤gte vertikale und horizontale Klassenungleichheiten auf. In den unteren Klassen bilden die Benachteiligung gegenÃ¼ber den jeweiligen oberen Klassen, verbreitete Ohnmacht, auch in Pandemiezeiten kaum Einfluss auf die eigene Arbeitssituation nehmen zu kÃ¶nnen, und gesellschaftliche Unsichtbarkeit der eigenen Erfahrungen einen gemeinsamen Erfahrungshorizont. Corona-Erfahrungen der unteren Klassen sind fragmentiert: Dienstleistende erleben COVID-19 hÃ¤ufiger als GesundheitsgefÃ¤hrdung, Produktionsarbeitende und Kleingewerbetreibende als Wirtschaftskrise und die BÃ¼rokrÃ¤fte als Treiber mobilen Arbeitens. Die Fragmentierung des Erlebens der Pandemie erschwert Solidarisierungsprozesse unter den unteren Klassen. This paper deals with the work experiences of diferent social classes during the pandemic, based on the Work Monitor ""Working in Corona Crisis"" conducted in Germany. The fndings apply to the German situation. However, evidence suggests that, despite diferences in the countries' economic structures and the political handling of Covid-19, the results on the pandemic's class dynamics are to some degree transferable to Austria. Three fndings are particularly noteworthy: Covid-19 reinforces existing class inequalities: subjective health risks, economic burdens, and access to mobile work show pronounced vertical and horizontal class inequalities. The lower classes share a common set of experiences, including the disadvantages, compared to the respective upper classes, the powerlessness to exert infuence on their own work situations even in times of pandemic, and the societal invisibility of their own experiences. At the same time, the Corona experiences of the lower classes are fragmented. This fragmentation of the experience of the pandemic impedes the emergence of solidarity among the lower classes.","Fessler, Agnes, Holst, Hajo, Niehoff, Steffen","https://wien.arbeiterkammer.at/service/studienundzeitschriten/zeitschriften/","","Database: Social Science Open Access Repository; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21628,""
"Arbeitslosigkeit in Europa und den USA unter Covid-19: Besser im Korsett einer Versicherungslogik eingeengt oder den Launen eines PrÃ¤sidialsystems ausgeliefert?","Die Auswirkungen der von Covid-19 ausgelÃ¶sten Wirtschaftskrise auf die Arbeitslosigkeit kÃ¶nnten kaum unterschiedlicher sein als in den USA und Europa. Das gilt auch fÃ¼r die politischen Reaktionen: WÃ¤hrend die EU-27 die Arbeitslosigkeit bisher weitgehend durch massiven Einsatz von Kurzarbeit in Schach halten konnte, herrscht in den USA eine Massenarbeitslosigkeit, die an die GroÃŸe Weltwirtschaftskrise 1929/30 erinnert. Statt mit Kurzarbeit reagierten die USA u.a. mit massiven Sozialtransfers fÃ¼r bestimmte Gruppen von Arbeitslosen, die manche Einkommen kurzfristig sogar besserstellen als bei BeschÃ¤ftigung. Umgekehrt werden die sozialpolitischen Probleme und die wirtschaftspolitischen Grenzen der Kurzarbeit in der EU deutlicher sichtbar. Es ist also noch nicht ausgemacht, welches dieser beiden Wirtschafts- und Sozialsysteme langfristig den durch die Krise beschleunigten Strukturwandel besser bewÃ¤ltigen wird. Dieser Essay argumentiert, dass der europÃ¤ische Ansatz eine humanere und effektivere LÃ¶sung der KrisenbewÃ¤ltigung verspricht, aber nur, wenn die Mitgliedstaaten und die EuropÃ¤ische Union einen den Strukturwandel unterstÃ¼tzenden Weg aus der Kurzarbeit finden und von einigen StÃ¤rken des US-Systems lernen. The effect of the economic crisis caused by Covid-19 on unemployment could not have been more different than between the USA and Europe. This also holds true for the political reactions: While the EU-27 could keep unemployment largely in check through the massive use of short-time work, mass unemployment has occurred in the USA that recalls the Great Depression of 1929/30. Instead of short-time work, the USA responded, among others, with massive social transfers for certain groups of the unemployed which, in the short-term, may even raise some income levels to above those whilst in employment. On the other hand, the social problems and the economic limits of short-time work in the EU become more visible. It is therefore not yet clear which of the two economic and social systems will overcome the structural change accelerated by the crisis in a better way. This essay argues that the European approach promises a more human and a more effective solution of coping with the crisis, but only if the member states and the European Union find a way out of short-time work that supports structural change and if they learn from some strengths of the US system.","Fischer, Georg, Schmid, GÃ¼nther","http://hdl.handle.net/10419/222600","","Database: Social Science Open Access Repository; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21629,""
"Mask wearing increases eye involvement during smiling: a facial EMG study","The use of face masks has become ubiquitous. Although mask wearing is a convenient way to reduce the spread of disease, it is important to know how the mask affects our communication via facial expression. For example, when we are wearing the mask and meet a friend, are our facial expressions different compared to when we are not? We investigated the effect of face mask wearing on facial expression, including the area around the eyes. We measured surface electromyography from zygomaticus major, orbicularis oculi, and depressor anguli oris muscles, when people smiled and talked with or without a mask. Only the actions of the orbicularis oculi were facilitated by wearing the mask. We thus concluded that mask wearing may increase the recruitment of the eyes during smiling. In other words, we can express joy and happiness even when wearing a face mask.","Okazaki, Shuntaro; Yamanami, Haruna; Nakagawa, Fumika; Takuwa, Nozomi; Kawabata Duncan, Keith James","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99872-y","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sci Rep;11(1): 20370, 2021 Oct 13.; Publication details: Sci Rep;11(1): 20370, 2021 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21630,""

"Prevalence of stress, burnout syndrome, anxiety and depression among physicians of a teaching hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic; Prevalencia de estrÃ©s, sÃ­ndrome de desgaste profesional, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n en mÃ©dicos de un hospital universitario durante la pandemia de COVID-19","IntroducciÃ³n. Los trabajadores de la salud se encuentran sometidos a una gran tensiÃ³n en el desarrollo de sus actividades, lo que genera alta frecuencia de estrÃ©s, desgaste laboral e impacto psicopatolÃ³gico. La pandemia de COVID-19 podrÃ­a provocar un incremento de estas entidades en los mÃ©dicos. El objetivo fue describir la frecuencia de estrÃ©s, sÃ­ndrome de desgaste profesional (burnout), ansiedad  y depresiÃ³n durante la pandemia, y analizar las asociaciones con distintas variables independientes. MÃ©todos. Estudio observacional, transversal, realizado dos meses despuÃ©s del inicio de la cuarentena en Argentina. Se encuestÃ³ a mÃ©dicos de especialidades clÃ­nicas, quirÃºrgicas,  solo de emergencias, y a aquellos sin contacto directo con pacientes, mediante un cuestionario sociodemogrÃ¡fico y tres inventarios autoadministrados: Health Professions Stress Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory y la Escala de ansiedad y depresiÃ³n hospitalaria. Resultados. La prevalencia de estrÃ©s fue del 93,7 % (IC95 %: 90,33-96,2), burnout 73,5 % (IC95 %: 68,2-78,4), ansiedad 44 % (IC95 %: 38,4-49,8) y depresiÃ³n 21,9 % (IC95 %: 17,3-26,9). No se observÃ³ asociaciÃ³n entre la frecuencia y el tipo de especialidad realizada. La frecuencia de burnout, ansiedad  y  depresiÃ³n  fue  significativamente  mayor en los mÃ©dicos residentes y en aquellos que trabajan en emergencias. Conclusiones. Los mÃ©dicos residentes y quienes trabajan en emergencias en turnos de 24 horas mostraron porcentajes significativamente mÃ¡s altos de burnout, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n, en comparaciÃ³n con mÃ©dicos de planta y con aquellos en posiciones de liderazgo. Estos hallazgos pueden estar asociados con una mayor carga de trabajo y una menor experiencia. Es mandatorio tomar medidas preventivas y terapÃ©uticas para preservar a quienes hacen frente a esta pandemia.; Introduction. Health care workers experience a tremendous strain while performing their activities, very frequently leading to stress, burnout syndrome, and psychopathological impact. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause physicians to suffer these effects even to a greater extent. Our objective was to describe the frequency of stress, burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and analyze the associations with different independent outcome measures. Methods. Observational, cross-sectional study conducted 2 months after the lockdown was established in Argentina. Clinical specialists, surgeons, emergency physicians, and those with no direct contact with patients were surveyed using a sociodemographic questionnaire and 3 self-administered inventories: Health Professions Stress Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results. The prevalence of stress was 93.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 90.33-96.2),  burnout syndrome 73.5 % (95 % CI: 68.2-78.4), anxiety 44 % (95 % CI: 38.4-49.8), and depression 21.9 % (95 % CI: 17.3-26.9). No association was observed  between  the  frequency  and  medical  specialty. The frequency of burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression was significantly higher among residents and physicians working in the emergency department. Conclusions. Residents and emergency physicians working 24-hour shifts showed significantly higher percentages of burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression compared to staff and head physicians. These findings may be associated with a higher workload  and less experience. It is compulsory to take preventive and therapeutic measures to protect those in the pandemic front line.","Appiani, Francisco J; RodrÃ­guez Cairoli, Federico; Sarotto, Luis (h); Yaryour, Claudio; Basile, MarÃ­a E; Duarte, Juan M","https://www.sap.org.ar/docs/publicaciones/archivosarg/2021/v119n5a07.pdf; https://www.sap.org.ar/docs/publicaciones/archivosarg/2021/v119n5a07e.pdf","","Country: AR; ARGENTINA; ARGENTINA; ARGENTINA; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Arch. argent. pediatr;119(5): 317-324, oct. 2021. tab, ilus; Publication details: Arch. argent. pediatr;119(5): 317-324, oct. 2021. tab, ilus; Humans; Physicians; Burnout, Professional/epidemiology; COVID-19; Anxiety/epidemiology; Communicable Disease Control; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Depression/epidemiology; Pandemics; Burnout, Psychological; SARS-CoV-2; Hospitals, Teaching; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21632,""
"Anxiety in patients with CKD during the COVID-19 pandemic: Predictors and consequences among chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study participants","Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with anxiety and depression. Though the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased stressors on patients with CKD, assessments of anxiety, its predictors and consequences, including on virus mitigation behaviors are lacking. Methods: From June to October 2020, we administered a survey about anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic to 1888 participants in CRIC. We examined associations of anxiety with demographics, clinical indices, health literacy, health-related behaviors and COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. Results: Four anxiety-related constructs were assessed: one composite overall global anxiety construct and three sub-constructs: general anxiety, worry, mood/feelings. Construct scores had moderate to strong correlations with each other (0.48-0.89) and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha =0.81). In adjusted analyses, younger age, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, cardiovascular disease, household income &lt;$100,000, unemployment, and marginal or inadequate health literacy predicted higher anxiety. During the pandemic, higher global anxiety scores were associated with higher odds of eating less healthy foods, reduced physical activity, and weight gain as well as reporting always wearing a mask in public in the past week. Conclusions: Several factors predict higher anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although anxiety is typically thought to be an undesired outcome, in addition to being associated with less healthy behaviors, anxiety was associated with higher selfreported mask wearing. Our study indicates a need for interventions to support healthy behaviors and virus mitigation strategies, without provoking or worsening anxiety in patients with CKD.","Dorans, K.

"A Case of Early Reinfection With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","The efficacy and safety of vortioxetine, an antidepressant approved for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), was studied in 11 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 6/8 weeks<U+05F3> treatment duration. An aggregated study-level meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the magnitude and dose-relationship of the clinical effect of approved doses of vortioxetine (5-20mg/day). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to endpoint in Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Differences from placebo were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis, with a sensitivity analysis also conducted using last observation carried forward. Secondary outcomes included MADRS single-item scores, response rate (=50% reduction in baseline MADRS), remission rate (MADRS =10), and Clinical Global Impressions scores. Across the 11 studies, 1824 patients were treated with placebo and 3304 with vortioxetine (5mg/day: n=1001;10mg/day: n=1042;15mg/day: n=449;20mg/day: n=812). The MMRM meta-analysis demonstrated that vortioxetine 5, 10, and 20mg/day were associated with significant reductions in MADRS total score (<U+0394>-2.27, <U+0394>-3.57, and <U+0394>-4.57, respectively;p&lt;0.01) versus placebo. The effects of 15mg/day (<U+0394>-2.60;p=0.105) were not significantly different from placebo. Vortioxetine 10 and 20mg/day were associated with significant reductions in 9 of 10 MADRS single-item scores. Vortioxetine treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of response and remission and with significant improvements in other depression-related scores versus placebo. This meta-analysis of vortioxetine (5-20mg/day) in adults with MDD supports the efficacy demonstrated in the individual studies, with treatment effect increasing with dose.","Larson, Derek, Brodniak, Sterling L.; Voegtly, Logan J.; Cer, Regina Z.; Glang, Lindsay A.; Malagon, Francisco J.; Long, Kyle A.; Potocki, Ronald, Smith, Darci R.; Lanteri, Charlotte, Burgess, Timothy, Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/CID/CIAA1436","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Clinical Infectious Diseases;2020.; Publication details: Clinical Infectious Diseases;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21634,""
"Gendered health, economic, social and safety impact of COVID-19 on adolescents and young adults in Nairobi, Kenya","Infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 and their mitigation measures can exacerbate underlying gender disparities, particularly among adolescents and young adults in densely populated urban settings. An existing cohort of youth ages 16-26 in Nairobi, Kenya completed a phone-based survey in August-October 2020 (n = 1217), supplemented by virtual focus group discussions and interviews with youth and stakeholders, to examine economic, health, social, and safety experiences during COVID-19, and gender disparities therein. COVID-19 risk perception was high with a gender differential favoring young women (95.5% vs. 84.2%; p&lt;0.001); youth described mixed concern and challenges to prevention. During COVID-19, gender symmetry was observed in constrained access to contraception among contraceptive users (40.4% men; 34.6% women) and depressive symptoms (21.8% men; 24.3% women). Gender disparities rendered young women disproportionately unable to meet basic economic needs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21; p&lt;0.05) and in need of healthcare during the pandemic (aOR = 1.59; p&lt;0.001). At a bivariate level, women had lower full decisional control to leave the house (40.0% vs. 53.2%) and less consistent access to safe, private internet (26.1% vs. 40.2%), while men disproportionately experienced police interactions (60.1%, 55.2% of which included extortion). Gender-specific concerns for women included menstrual hygiene access challenges (52.0%), increased reliance on transactional partnerships, and gender-based violence, with 17.3% reporting past-year partner violence and 3.0% non-partner sexual violence. Qualitative results contextualize the mental health impact of economic disruption and isolation, and, among young women, privacy constraints. Youth and young adults face gendered impacts of COVID-19, reflecting both underlying disparities and the pandemic's economic and social shock. Economic, health and technology-based supports must ensure equitable access for young women. Gender-responsive recovery efforts are necessary and must address the unique needs of youth.","Decker, Wood, Thiongo, Byrne, Devoto, Morgan, Bevilacqua, Williams, Stuart, Wamue-Ngare, Heise, Glass, Anglewicz, Gummerson, Gichangi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259583","20211109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21635,""
"The psychological health of patients diagnosed with cancer in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single center study","The objective of this study was to assess the psychological health status of patients diagnosed with cancer in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aim was to measure the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among patients diagnosed with cancer. Secondary aims were to assess the association between depression, anxiety, and stress with sociodemographic characteristics, cancer-specific characteristics, patients' experience in healthcare visit, risk perception towards COVID-19, and health concern during the outbreak. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020 at an Oncology clinic in Baghdad. Included in the study were two hundred patients diagnosed with cancer. Data collected included: demographic variables (age, gender, residential location, marital status, education, employment status), clinical characteristics and cancer-specific parameters (duration since cancer diagnosis, cancer type, treatment duration, clinic visits frequency), experience during the pandemic (skipping or postponing treatment or periodical tests, suffering from new body pain, fear of acquiring the infection, fear of health deterioration), as well as psychological health status (depression, anxiety, stress). Pain, risk perception towards COVID-19, and health concern were measured using categorical Likert scale with responses being no, sometimes, and often. The psychological health status was measured by the ""Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale"" (DASS-21). Cut-off scores of the DASS-21 greater than 9, 7, and 14 represent a positive screen of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The prevalence of patients who screened positive for depression was 22.0%, anxiety 22.0%, and stress 13.5%. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were significantly more in those who had university or higher education (34.3%, p-value &lt;0.0001; 32.3%, p-value &lt;0.0001; 19.2%, p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02 respectively). Those were four times more likely to have depression and two times more likely to have anxiety than participants who had school education (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.40 CI [1.98-9.77], p-value &lt;0.0001; ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.55 CI [1.15-5.65], p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02, respectively). The prevalence of anxiety was significantly the highest in the age group 16-39Ã‚Â years (40.9%) compared to 22.3% in the age group 40-64 years and 10.3% in theÃ‚Â group Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã‚Â years (p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02). Patients Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã‚Â years of age were less likelyÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â develop anxiety compared to younger patients (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.44 CI [0.22-0.89], p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02). As for the patients' experience in healthcare visit, 66 patients (33.0%) skipped or postponed their treatment or tests due to the outbreak. Around (8%) sometimes suffered from new body pain. Those who sometimes suffered from new body pain had significantly more depression than patients who did not suffer new pain or often had new pain (50.0% vs. 15.0% vs. 28.1% respectively, p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002). Those were two times more likely to be depressed (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.18 CI [1.29-3.68], p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003). Around (50%) of the patients were often afraid that their health would deteriorate during the outbreak. Those were significantly more depressed (31.7%, p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002), anxious (30.7%, p-value &lt;0.0001) and stressed (21.8%, p-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002) than those who did not have fear of losing their health and were two times more likely to have anxiety and stress. These findings, especially the association between developing new pain and depression, raised concerns regarding the psychological health in patients diagnosed with cancer during COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial to implement psychological health screening for patients diagnosed with cancer during the pandemic to help prevent any psychological health problems. The DASS-21 could be used as a screening tool for distress in these patients.","Alrubai, Khalil, Zaki, Sinno, Al Tabbah","https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5851","20211109","COVID-19; Iraq; anxiety; cancer; chemotherapy; depression; pandemic; psycho-oncology; psychological health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21636,""
"Evaluation of COVID-19-related psychological distress in parents of children referring to a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic: a university hospital sample","We aimed to determine parents' levels of anxiety and fear and suspicion in relation to the COVID-19 period and the possible predictive factors for these variables in families admitted to a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Turkey. In this way, it is hoped to contribute to the identification of priority target groups in psychosocial support services. The research study group consisted of 600 patients aged 0-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and their parents who were referred to a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic of a university hospital. Parents completed the COVID-19-related psychological distress (CORPD) scale and the data recording form developed specifically for this study. All cases included in the study were examined by a child and adolescent psychiatrist for diagnostic evaluation and their current diagnoses were recorded. Parents of children with any psychiatric diagnosis had higher suspicion scores on the CORPD scale and parents of children with high COVID-19-related anxiety also had higher anxiety and fear scores on the same scale. Logistic regression analysis revealed that negative changes in family relationships increased the risk of higher maternal COVID-19-related suspicion. The most important factors associated with parental high CORPD levels were negative changes in family relationships and children with high COVID-19-related anxiety. Children's high COVID-19-related anxiety levels were associated with living with a single parent or separation from parents, negative changes in family relationships, previous COVID-19 infection in the family, and changes in daily routines.","TaÃ…Å¸ Torun, Demirci, GÃƒÂ¼l, Demir, IÃ…Å¸eri","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1994647","20211109","COVID-19; children; mental health; parents; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21637,""
"One year follow-up of physical performance and quality of life in patients surviving COVID-19: a prospective cohort study","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to affect many countries globally, with the long-term impact of the disease now being recognized. According to the latest research, some of the affected individuals continue to experience functional limitations, reduced physical performance and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) even after eight months. This prospective cohort study aimed to describe the longer-term recovery of physical performance and HRQoL in COVID-19 survivors over one year. A cohort (n = 43; 32-84 years old) hospitalized with COVID-19 between March and June 2020 was followed over one year and assessed at three time points: hospital discharge, 3 months and 12 months post-admission. Participants experienced mild (10/43) to critical (6/43) pneumonia and stayed in the hospital for a median of 10 days (IQR 9). Participants were assessed for physical performance (six-minute walk test), HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L), COVID-19 related limitations in functionality (PCFS), hospital-related anxiety and depression (HADS-A/-D), lung function (FEV1, FVC) and dyspnea during activity (mMRC). All assessments were conducted by physiotherapists trained in cardio-respiratory rehabilitation. After discharge, 8/34 showed reduced physical performance, 9/42 had lower HRQoL and 14/32 had COVID-19 induced limitations in functionality on the PCFS scale. Physical performance did not change significantly between discharge and 12-month follow-up, but 15/34 participants showed clinically relevant improvements in walking distance (&gt;30 m). However, 16/34 had a decreased walking distance &gt;30 m when comparing 3-month to 12-month follow-up. At 12 months, 12/41 of participants still perceived COVID-19 related limitations in daily life on the PCFS scale. For HRQoL, 12/41 participants still perceived moderate-to-severe symptoms of pain and discomfort and 13/41 slight-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. This cohort of adult patients hospitalized for mild to severe COVID-19 in Switzerland was generally mildly affected but still reported some limitations after one year. These results offer preliminary indications for ongoing support after hospitalization and point towards the need for specific, individualized follow-up to support their recovery.","Betschart, Rezek, Unger, Ott, Beyer, BÃƒÂ¶ni, Gisi, Shannon, Spruit, Sieber","https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.w30072","20211109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21638,""
"Precarious employment and health in the context of COVID-19: a rapid scoping umbrella review","There are widespread concerns that workers in precarious employment have suffered the most in the COVID-19 pandemic and merit special attention. The aim of this rapid scoping umbrella review was to examine what evidence exists about how COVID-19 has affected the health of this highly vulnerable group, and what gaps remain to be investigated. Five databases were searched for systematic or scoping reviews from January 2020 to May 2021. The quality of the included reviews was determined using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews. We identified 6 reviews that reported 30 unique relevant primary studies. The included studies indicate that essential (non-health) workers are at greater risk of COVID-19 infection and case fatality than others in their surrounding community. The occupational risk of exposure to COVID-19 also seems to be greater among more precarious categories of workers, including younger workers and workers in low-income and low-skilled occupations. Further, hazardous working conditions faced by many essential workers appear to have amplified the pandemic, as several occupational sites became 'super-spreaders', due to an inability to socially distance at work and high contact rates among workers. Finally, employment and financial insecurity generated by the pandemic appears to be associated with negative mental health outcomes. The quality of the included reviews however, and their primary studies, were generally weak and many gaps remain in the evidence base. Our study highlights that COVID-19 is creating new health risks for precarious workers as well as exacerbating the pre-existing health risks of precarious employment.","McNamara, McKee, Stuckler","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab159","20211109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21639,""
"The COVID-19 disaster and mental health-assessing, responding and recovering","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a disaster that has impacted lives globally. The purpose of this paper is to understand the linkage between COVID-19 and its impact on mental health. To reach this aim, we reviewed the literature on COVID-19 and mental conditions. Based on the literature, we identified COVID-19 as an unexpected, large-scale event that disrupted communities and caused death, destruction and trauma which upended normal existence. For mental conditions, effects of the pandemic are likely to manifest in different ways: development of symptoms in previously healthy individuals, new episodes in those with predisposition to mental disorders and development of symptoms that do not meet diagnostic criteria. The level of mental health problems varies depending on the stage of the pandemic, country, population groups and types of conditions. This also applies to the level of suicide, although suicides do not seem to have increased during the pandemic. Yet, we identified a net of factors contributing to mental conditions, in general. These factors include demographic factors (e.g. female gender, younger and older age), social factors (e.g. economically disadvantaged), mental factors (e.g. pre-existing mental conditions) and relationship factors (e.g. stressful relationship, lack of relationships). Additionally, we identified COVID-19-specific factors such as threat to own life and threat to life of loved ones, containment measures and interruption of services and social life.

Regardless of differences, health care and psychosocial systems were in many countries not prepared to respond to a viral disaster.

"Health workforce protection and preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic: a tool for the rapid assessment of EU health systems","This article is dedicated to the WHO International Year of Health and Care Workers in 2021 in recognition of their commitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims to strengthen health workforce preparedness, protection and ultimately resilience during a pandemic. We argue for a health system approach and introduce a tool for rapid comparative assessment based on integrated multi-level governance. We draw on secondary sources and expert information, including material from Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Romania. The results reveal similar developments across countries: action has been taken to improve physical protection, digitalization and prioritization of healthcare worker vaccination, whereas social and mental health support programmes were weak or missing. Developments were more diverse in relation to occupational and organizational preparedness: some ad-hoc transformations of work routines and tasks were observed in all countries, yet skill-mix innovation and collaboration were strongest in Demark and weak in Portugal and Romania. Major governance gaps exist in relation to education and health integration, surveillance, social and mental health support programmes, gendered issues of health workforce capacity and integration of migrant healthcare workers (HCW). There is a need to step up efforts and make health systems more accountable to the needs of HCW during global public health emergencies.","Kuhlmann, BrÃƒÂ®nzac, Burau, Correia, Ungureanu","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab152","20211109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21641,""
"Depression and anxiety associated with COVID- 19 pandemic among healthcare professionals in India- A systematic review and meta-analysis","As India is fighting against the second wave of COVID-19, Healthcare professionals are the front-line warriors on that battlefield which puts them under psychological pressure, this systematic review aims to critically look into and amalgamate the evidence on impact of COVID-19 on psychological health of healthcare professionals in India and to seek the attention of policymakers. A systematic literature search was performed using the following databases PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect. Additionally, random search in Google, Google Scholar and ResearchGate was also performed until February 2021. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Downs and Black for reporting quality. Meta-analysis was performed using revMAN. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Prevalence of depression was found to be present in 41.90% of 5796 participants in five studies (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 29.17 to 54.64), and prevalence of anxiety was found to be 42.87% common in 10 studies with a total sample size of 3059 people (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 30.26 to 55.49), Stress was found to be prevalent (58.04%) in 12 studies with 4209 participants, (95% CI: 44.81-71.28), Prevalence of sleeping problem in 3 studies with 416 participants recorded a prevalence rate of 31.94 (95% CI: 21.38-42.49). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's mental and physical health, particularly among health-care workers. Authorities should develop programmes to help health-care workers improve their mental health.","E K, Velladath, Varghese, M","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100888","20211109","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; India; Mental health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21642,""
"Age-Related Differences of Rumination on the Loneliness-Depression Relationship: Evidence From a Population-Representative Cohort","This study examined the association of loneliness with depressive symptoms across various age groups. Loneliness is a significant risk factor for precipitating depressive symptoms. Rumination, a mechanism that underpins depression, can become intense when a person feels lonely. In addition, age is a major factor associated with changes in mental and physical health. Thus, the importance of rumination and age in moderating the loneliness-depression link were investigated. This cross-sectional study was conducted during the acute phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Hong Kong (February 27 to March 17, 2020). A population-representative sample of 1,972 people (1,107 females; 18-92 years of age) was recruited and interviewed via telephone through random digit dialing. This sample includedÃ¢â‚¬â€°394 younger adults (18-30 years), 1,106 middle-aged adults (31-64 years), and 472 older adults (65 years or above). Respondents reported depressive symptoms, subjective loneliness, state rumination, and sociodemographic factors. Loneliness and rumination were positively associated with depressive symptoms, and they significantly interacted in predicting cognitive-affective symptoms. Further analysis of age showed that the interaction was significant only in middle-aged adults and older adults. Both rumination and age interacted with loneliness, respectively, in predicting cognitive-affective symptoms. These findings indicate that the strength of the association between loneliness and the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression depends on rumination levels and age. An intervention to regulate rumination offers a feasible direction for health care and social care aimed at improving older adults' mental health.","Tong, Hou, Liang, Li, Liu, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab034","20211109","Age difference; COVID-19; Depression; Loneliness; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21643,""
"Mindfulness-Based Approaches for COVID-19 Mental Health in Working from Home","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly since it was first identified in December 2019. A nation-level lockdown has been implemented in many countries, affecting workers of all sectors and forcing many to work from home. In this commentary, we discuss mental health difficulties that working from home might cause on non-key workers, based on research in New Ways of Working (NWW) and telecommuting. Moreover, we propose the use of mindfulness-based approaches to protect workforce from the potential negative impacts of working from home.","Vione, Kotera","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00647-3","20211109","COVID-19; Compassion; Mental health; Mindfulness; Remote working","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21644,""
"Short-term effects of a social media-based intervention on the physical and mental health of remotely working young software professionals: A randomised controlled trial","The present study aimed to explore the short term effects of a social media-based intervention on the physical and mental health of the software professionals working remotely during the pandemic. Sixty software professionals with poor physical and mental health were randomised to Facebook-based intervention (FIIT) and a control (CONT) group for 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Forty-six remote workers (26.25Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.49Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) completed the study (FIITÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22; CONTÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26). All the respondents had the median sitting time (7.07Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.30Ã¢â‚¬â€°h/day) during office hours on workdays. We found a significant difference in the sitting time during office hours in workday within the subjects (F<sub>1,46</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.66; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004; ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.048) and between the subjects (F<sub>1,46</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.81; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004; ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.040). Post hoc analysis revealed participants in the FIIT group reduced their sitting time by 58Ã¢â‚¬â€°min during office hours during a typical workday compared with the control group. Nevertheless, we found a significant difference in the scores of stress, anxiety and depression within and between the groups.

"Mental health, quality of life and optimism during the covid-19 pandemic: a comparison between Brazil and Portugal","Although there have been numerous studies investigating the mental health of individuals during the pandemic, a comparison between countries is still scarce in the literature. To explore this gap, the present study aimed to compare the mental health (i.e., anxiety and depression), quality of life (QoL), and optimism/pessimism among individuals from Brazil and Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated factors. A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and Portugal. Data collection was carried out between May and June 2020, using an online form which was sent through social networks. A total of 2069 participants (1156 from Brazil and 913 from Portugal) were included. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), Anxiety (GAD-7), optimism/pessimism (Revised Life Orientation Test - LOT), QoL (WHOQOL-Bref), and sociodemographic, health, and social distancing variables were assessed. Data was analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. There were remarkable differences between Brazil and Portugal in all outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and optimism for the Brazilian individuals and higher levels of QoL and pessimism for the Portuguese individuals. The following factors were associated with the mental health and QoL in both Brazilian and Portuguese populations: gender, age, being a healthcare professional, and days in social distancing. Despite the fact that Brazilians were more optimistic during the COVID-19 pandemic, they had lower levels of mental health and QoL as compared to the Portuguese individuals.","Vitorino, Sousa, Trzesniak, de Sousa Valentim, Yoshinari JÃƒÂºnior, JosÃƒÂ©, Lucchetti","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-03031-9","20211109","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Mental health; Quality of life, social distancing; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21647,""

"Disparities in Marijuana and Tobacco Smoke Incursions Among New York City Families During Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Once the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in New York City (NYC), stay-at-home orders led to more time spent indoors, potentially increasing exposure to secondhand marijuana and tobacco smoke via incursions from common areas or neighbors. The objective of this study was to characterize housing-based disparities in marijuana and tobacco incursions in NYC housing during the pandemic. We surveyed a random sample of families from May to July 2020 and collected sociodemographic data, housing characteristics, and the presence, frequency, and pandemic-related change in incursions. Five pediatric practices affiliated with a large NYC health care system. In total, 230 caregivers of children attending the practices. Prevalence and change in tobacco and marijuana smoke incursions. Tobacco and marijuana smoke incursions were reported by 22.9% and 30.7%, respectively. Twenty-two percent of families received financial housing support (public housing, Section-8). Compared with families in private housing, families with financial housing support had 3.8 times the odds of tobacco incursions (95% CI, 1.4-10.1) and 3.7 times the odds of worsening incursions during pandemic (95% CI, 1.1-12.5). Families with financially supported housing had 6.9 times the odds of marijuana incursions (95% CI, 2.4-19.5) and 5 times the odds of worsening incursions during pandemic (95% CI, 1.9-12.8). Children in financially supported housing spent more time inside the home during pandemic (median 24 hours vs 21.6 hours, P = .02) and were more likely to have asthma (37% vs 12.9%, P = .001) than children in private housing. Incursions were higher among families with financially supported housing. Better enforcement of existing regulations (eg, Smoke-Free Public Housing Rule) and implementation of additional policies to limit secondhand tobacco and marijuana exposure in children are needed. Such actions should prioritize equitable access to cessation and mental health services and consider structural systems leading to poverty and health disparities.","Zajac, Gallate, Gu, Liu, Elaiho, Lin, Mogilner, Oliver, Vangeepuram, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1097/PHH.0000000000001440","20211109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21649,""
"Study protocol for a pilot high-intensity interval training intervention in inpatient mental health settings: a two-part study using a randomised controlled trial and naturalistic study design","Severe mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, are associated with physical health comorbidities and premature mortality. Physical activity and structured exercise have a beneficial impact on cardiometabolic risk and ameliorate mental health symptomology and cognition. This protocol describes a feasibility study for a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention among inpatients with SMI, to improve their physical and mental health. The feasibility study follows a two-part design owing to COVID-19-related adaptations to project design: (a) a non-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 12 weeks of bicycle-based HIIT, delivered twice weekly in a face-to-face, one-to-one setting, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) and (b) a naturalistic study of inpatient HIIT; eligible participants will be invited to two sessions of HIIT per week, delivered by the research team remotely or in person. Additionally, participants in the naturalistic study may use the bike to conduct self-directed sessions of their chosen length and intensity. We will measure the feasibility and acceptability of the HIIT intervention as primary outcomes, alongside secondary and tertiary outcomes evaluating the physical, mental and cognitive effects of HIIT. The study aims to recruit 40 patients to the RCT and 6-8 patients to the naturalistic design. Exercise is a modifiable lifestyle barrier that can reverse cardiometabolic disease risk. If HIIT is found to be feasible and acceptable in inpatients with SMI, there would be scope for large-scale work to evaluate the clinical, cost and implementation effectiveness of HIIT in inpatient mental health settings.

"Exploring factors associated with pregnant women's experiences of material hardship during COVID-19: a cross-sectional Qualtrics survey in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the financial insecurity of women and their families globally. Some studies have explored the impact of financial strain among pregnant women, in particular, during the pandemic. However, less is known about the factors associated with pregnant women's experiences of material hardship. This cross-sectional study used a non-probability sample to examine the factors associated with pregnant women's experiences of material hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, 183 pregnant women living in the United States participated in an online Qualtrics panel survey. In addition to socio-demographic characteristics, individuals were asked about their finances and predictors of financial well-being, mental health symptoms, and intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences. Chi-square analysis and one-way ANOVA were used to examine whether women's experiences with material hardship and associated factors differed by income level (i.e., less than $20,000; $20,000 to $60,000; more than $60,000). Ordinary least squares regression was used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted estimates. Study findings showed that the majority of women in the sample experienced at least one form of material hardship in the past year. Individuals with an annual household income less than $20,000 reported the highest average number of material hardships experienced (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.7, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.8). Compared to women with household incomes less than $20,000, women with incomes of more than $60,000 reported significantly fewer material hardships, less financial strain, and higher levels of financial support, economic self-efficacy, and economic-self-sufficiency. Women with incomes of $60,000 or more also reported significantly lower levels of psychological abuse, and a smaller percentage met the cut-off for anxiety. Economic self-sufficiency, financial strain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and economic abuse were all significantly associated with material hardship. A contribution of this study is that it highlights the significant, positive association between economic abuse, a unique form of IPV, and material hardship among pregnant women during the pandemic. These findings suggest the need for policy and practice interventions that help to ameliorate the financial insecurity experienced by some pregnant women, as well as respond to associated bidirectional vulnerabilities (e.g., mental health symptoms, experiences of IPV).","Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04234-1","20211109","COVID-19; Financial strain; Intimate partner violence; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21651,""

Research suggests associations between household job loss, harsher parenting practices, and mental health challenges in the general population. Sexual minority adolescents (SMA) face high rates of family stress and rejection, but evidence linking household job loss to SMA mental health is lacking. This study evaluated associations between household job loss, family rejection, and mental health with a national sample of SMA who were sheltering in place with families during the pandemic. SMA from an ongoing prospective study completed an online questionnaire between May 13-31, 2020. It was hypothesized that household job loss during the pandemic would be associated with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms through family rejection. Household job loss during the pandemic was indirectly associated with SMA mental health through family rejection. These findings highlight how socioeconomic change and policy carry implications for SMA health.","Parra, O'Brien, Schrager, Goldbach","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.1977604","20211109","COVID-19; anxiety symptoms; depressive symptoms; family rejection; household job loss; sexual minority adolescents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21652,""

This article presents data from before and during the confinement due to COVID-19 in Spain. 120 men and 89 women who were part of a couple at the time of confinement and completed an online survey participated in the study. The sample was obtained during the de-escalation months, from May 9<sup>th</sup> until July 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020. Three questionnaires were administered. The results that were obtained from the T-student, Pearson correlations and regression analyses show a decline in couples' adjustment during the months of confinement. Regarding the Sexuality Scale, the results showed that the sexual-depression subscale and the sexual self-esteem subscale had a statistically significant role in predicting the dyadic adjustment during confinement. Overall, our findings suggest that confinement had a negative effect on sexuality because the sexual-depression of the sample increased and couple adjustment decreased during the confinement due to COVID-19.","Torres-Cruz, Aznar-MartÃƒÂ­nez, PÃƒÂ©rez-Testor","https://doi.org/10.1080/0092623X.2021.1998271","20211109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21653,""
"Association of Substance Use With Behavioral Adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines for COVID-19 Mitigation: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey","Substance use is a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and adverse outcomes. However, reasons for elevated risk for COVID-19 in substance users are not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether alcohol or other drug use is associated with adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for COVID-19 mitigation. Preregistered analyses tested the hypothesis that greater use of alcohol and other drugs would be associated with lower CDC guideline adherence. A secondary objective was to determine whether substance use was associated with the likelihood of COVID-19 testing or outcome. A cross-sectional web-based survey was administered to a convenience sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform from June 18 to July 19, 2020. Individuals aged 18 years or older and residing in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or Rhode Island were eligible to participate. The exposure of interest was past 7-day use of alcohol, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cannabis, stimulants, and nonmedical opioids. The primary outcome was CDC guideline adherence measured using a scale developed from behaviors advised to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were likelihood of COVID-19 testing and a positive COVID-19 test result. All analyses accounted for the sociodemographic characteristics. The sample consisted of 1084 individuals (mean age 40.9 [SD 13.4] years): 529 (48.8%) men, 543 (50.1%) women, 12 (1.1%) other gender identity, 742 (68.5%) White individuals, 267 (24.6%) Black individuals, and 276 (25.5%) Hispanic individuals. Daily opioid users reported lower CDC guideline adherence than nondaily users (B=-0.24, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.05) and nonusers (B=-0.57, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.38). Daily alcohol drinkers reported lower adherence than nondaily drinkers (B=-0.16, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.02). Nondaily alcohol drinkers reported higher adherence than nondrinkers (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.17). Daily opioid use was related to greater odds of COVID-19 testing, and daily stimulant use was related to greater odds of a positive COVID-19 test. In a regionally-specific, racially, and ethnically diverse convenience sample, adults who engaged in daily alcohol or opioid use reported lower CDC guideline adherence for COVID-19 mitigation. Any opioid use was associated with greater odds of COVID-19 testing, and daily stimulant use was associated with greater odds of COVID-19 infection. Cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cannabis, or stimulant use were not statistically associated with CDC guideline adherence, after accounting for sociodemographic covariates and other substance use variables. Findings support further investigation into whether COVID-19 testing and vaccination should be expanded among individuals with substance-related risk factors.","Monnig, Treloar Padovano, Sokolovsky, DeCost, Aston, Haass-Koffler, Szapary, Moyo, Avila, Tidey, Monti, Ahluwalia","https://doi.org/10.2196/29319","20211109","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; addiction; alcohol drinking; alcohol use; mental health; nicotine; novel coronavirus; opioid use; pandemic; smoking; stimulant use; substance abuse; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-10","",21654,""
