"Prevalence and contributory factors of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China","Pregnant women are emotionally vulnerable and have suffered great psychological impacts. Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China. A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression. Our study revealed factors associated with psychological symptoms among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19-pandemic era. These results should help to update guidance for psychological interventions for pregnant women during the period of COVID-19.","Wu, Lin, Liu, Zhang, Huang, Chen, Li, Huang, Zhong, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.014","20210529","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14157,""
"Physical and mental health complications post-COVID-19: Scoping review","Several long-lasting health complications have been reported in previous coronavirus infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated physical and mental health problems post-COVID-19. Articles for inclusion in this scoping review were identified by searching the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for items dated from 1 January to 7 November 2020. Observational studies evaluating physical health (musculoskeletal symptoms, functional status) or mental health status with a follow-up period longer than 1Ã‚Â month after discharge or after the onset of symptoms were included. This scoping review included 34 studies with follow-up periods of up to 3Ã‚Â months post-COVID-19. The most commonly reported physical health problems were fatigue (range 28% to 87%), pain (myalgia 4.5% to 36%), arthralgia (6.0% to 27%), reduced physical capacity (six-minute walking test range 180 to 561Ã‚Â m), and declines in physical role functioning, usual care and daily activities (reduced in 15% to 54% of patients). Common mental health problems were anxiety (range 6.5% to 63%), depression (4% to 31%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (12.1% to 46.9%). Greater fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were reported in female patients and individuals admitted to intensive care. An overall lower quality of life was seen up to 3Ã‚Â months post-COVID-19. This review highlights the presence of several physical and mental health problems up to 3Ã‚Â months post-COVID-19. The findings point to the need for comprehensive evaluation and rehabilitation post-COVID-19 to promote quality of life.","Shanbehzadeh, Tavahomi, Zanjari, Ebrahimi-Takamjani, Amiri-Arimi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110525","20210529","Coronavirus; Follow up; Health; Post-discharge; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14158,""
"Psychological burden in patients with COVID-19 and their relatives 90Ã‚Â days after hospitalization: A prospective observational cohort study","COVID-19 causes psychological distress for patients and their relatives at short term. However, little research addressed the longer-term psychological outcomes in this population. Therefore, we aimed to prospectively assess clinically relevant psychological distress in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and their relatives 90Ã‚Â days after hospital discharge. This exploratory, prospective, observational cohort study included consecutive adult patients hospitalized in two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals between March and June 2020 for confirmed COVID-19 and their relatives. The primary outcome was psychological distress defined as clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 90Ã‚Â days after discharge. Clinically relevant psychological distress 90Ã‚Â days after hospital discharge was present in 23/108 patients (21.3%) and 22/120 relatives (18.3%). For patients, risk and protective factors associated with clinically relevant psychological distress included sociodemographic, illness-related, psychosocial, and hospital-related factors. A model including these factors showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84. For relatives, relevant risk factors were illness-related, psychosocial, and hospital-related factors. Resilience was negatively associated with anxiety and depression in both patients and relatives and regarding PTSD in relatives only. COVID-19 is linked to clinically relevant psychological distress in a subgroup of patients and their relatives 90Ã‚Â days after hospitalization. If confirmed in an independent and larger patient cohort, knowledge about these potential risk and protective factors might help to develop preventive strategies.","Vincent, Beck, Becker, Zumbrunn, Ramin-Wright, Urben, Quinto, Schaefert, Meinlschmidt, Gaab, Reinhardt, Bassetti, Schuetz, Hunziker","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110526","20210529","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; PTSD; Psychological distress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14159,""
"Rheumatology and psychiatry: allies in times of COVID-19","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has had a significant global impact. Physical, emotional, and psychological health, particularly its specific mental health area, has been affected. Patients with rheumatic diseases are more likely to be concerned about COVID-19 than the public in general. Depression and anxiety are the symptoms most commonly reported by these patients. Therefore, now more than ever before, rheumatologists and psychiatrists should work together to improve the care of rheumatic disease patients, identifying the symptoms that uniquely reflect mental health problems, so the patients' quality of life can be substantially improved.","Elera-Fitzcarrald, Huarcaya-Victoria, AlarcÃƒÂ³n, Ugarte-Gil","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-021-05792-7","20210529","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease 2019; Mental health; Psychiatrists; Rheumatic diseases; Rheumatologists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14160,""
"Mindfulness practice for protecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Emerging evidence shows that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is negatively affecting mental health around the globe. Interventions to alleviate the psychological impact of the pandemic are urgently needed. Whether mindfulness practice may protect against the harmful emotional effects of a pandemic crisis remains hitherto unknown. We investigated the influence of mindfulness training on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We hypothesized that mindfulness practitioners might manifest less pandemic-related distress, depression, anxiety, and stress than non-practitioners and that more frequent practice would be associated with an improvement in mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, we assessed pandemic-related distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the frequency of meditation practice at the peak of new infections (Feb 4-5; NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°673) and three weeks later (Feb 29-30; NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°521) in mindfulness practitioners via online questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms were also collected from non-practitioners at peak time only (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1550). We found lower scores of pandemic-related distress in mindfulness practitioners compared to non-practitioners. In general, older participants showed fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. In younger practitioners, pandemic-related distress decreased from peak to follow-up. Importantly, increased mindfulness training during the preceding two weeks was associated with lower scores of depression and anxiety at both assessments. Likewise, practice frequency predicted individual improvement in scores of depression, anxiety, and stress at follow-up. Our results indicate that mindfulness meditation might be a viable low-cost intervention to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.","Zhu, SchÃƒÂ¼lke, Vatansever, Xi, Yan, Zhao, Xie, Feng, Chen, Sahakian, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01459-8","20210529","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14161,""
"Longitudinal study of early adaptation to the coronavirus disease pandemic among youth with chronic pain and their parents: effects of direct exposures and economic stress","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused prolonged disruptions in daily life for many communities. Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of youth with chronic pain and their families. We conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study to characterize early adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic among 250 families of youth (ages 12-21 years) diagnosed with chronic headache (64%) or other chronic pain conditions (36%) and to determine whether direct exposures to COVID-19 and secondary economic stress modified symptom trajectories. Youth and parents reported on pain interference, anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms at 4 waves of data collection from April 2020 to July 2020. We also collected qualitative data on the impact of the pandemic on the youth's pain problem. Nearly half of our sample (49.6%) experienced direct exposures to COVID-19. Secondary economic stress was also common, affecting 44.4% of families. Symptom trajectories for pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety remained stable or improved for most participants, indicating adaptive adjustment. However, overall symptom burden was high with persistent and clinically elevated depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms common among youth and parents. Direct exposures to COVID-19 did not modify symptom trajectories. However, youth pain interference and parent insomnia worsened in families who experienced secondary economic stress. Qualitative data revealed perceived benefits and harms from school closures on the youth's pain problem. Our findings of high symptom burden suggest that pediatric pain clinicians should offer distance assessment and treatment (eg, through telemedicine) to avoid pandemic-related disruptions in pain care.","Law, Zhou, Seung, Perry, Palermo","https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002290","20210529","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14162,""
"Cutting Edge: Distinct B Cell Repertoires Characterize Patients with Mild and Severe COVID-19","Protective immunity against COVID-19 likely depends on the production of SARS-CoV-2-specific plasma cells and memory B cells postinfection or postvaccination. Previous work has found that germinal center reactions are disrupted in severe COVID-19. This may adversely affect long-term immunity against reinfection. Consistent with an extrafollicular B cell response, patients with severe COVID-19 have elevated frequencies of clonally expanded, class-switched, unmutated plasmablasts. However, it is unclear whether B cell populations in individuals with mild COVID-19 are similarly skewed. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing of B cells to show that in contrast to patients with severe COVID-19, subjects with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 have B cell repertoires enriched for clonally diverse, somatically hypermutated memory B cells Ã¢Ë†Â¼30 d after the onset of symptoms. This provides evidence that B cell responses are less disrupted in mild COVID-19 and result in the production of memory B cells.","Hoehn, Ramanathan, Unterman, Sumida, Asashima, Hafler, Kaminski, Dela Cruz, Sealfon, Bukreyev, Kleinstein","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100135","20210529","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","",14163,""
