"Experiences of staff providing specialist palliative care during COVID-19: A multiple qualitative case study","Objectives: To explore the experiences of, and impact on, staff working in palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative multiple case study using semi-structured interviews between November 2020 and April 2021 as part of the CovPall study. Data were analysed using thematic framework analysis. Setting: Organisations providing specialist palliative services in any setting. Participants: Staff working in specialist palliative care, purposefully sampled by the criteria of role, care setting and COVID-19 experience. Main outcome measures: Experiences of working in palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Five cases and 24 participants were recruited (n=12 nurses, 4 clinical managers, 4 doctors, 2 senior managers, 1 healthcare assistant, 1 allied healthcare professional). Central themes demonstrate how infection control constraints prohibited and diluted participants ability to provide care that reflected their core values, resulting in experiences of moral distress. Despite organisational, team, and individual support strategies, continually managing these constraints led to a crescendo effect in which the impacts of moral distress accumulated over time, sometimes leading to burnout. Solidarity with colleagues and making a valued contribution provided moral comfort for some. Conclusions: This study provides a unique insight into why and how healthcare staff have experienced moral distress during the pandemic, and how organisations have responded. Despite their experience of dealing with death and dying, the mental health and well-being of palliative care staff was affected by the pandemic. Organisational, structural, and policy changes are urgently required to mitigate and manage these impacts.","Andy Bradshaw; Lesley Dunleavy; Ian Garner; Nancy Preston; Sabrina Bajwah; Rachel Cripps; Lorna K Fraser; Matthew Maddocks; Mevhibe Hocaoglu; Fliss E Murtagh; Adejoke O Oluyase; Katherine E Sleeman; Irene J Higginson; Catherine Walshe","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.17.21266437","20211120","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-21","",22399,""
"A Qualitative Examination of Emotional Experiences During Physical Activity Post-metabolic/Bariatric Surgery","Physical activity is critical for weight loss maintenance and cardiometabolic disease prevention after metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS), but few patients meet recommended levels. While difficulties meeting physical activity recommendations are common in the general population, those who have undergone MBS may have unique psychological barriers to activity that impede success, including negative associations with physical activity that are related to a long history with obesity, weight stigma, and physical limitations. This qualitative study aimed to better understand the positive and negative emotional experiences of post-MBS patients with regard to physical activity to inform the development of an emotion-focused intervention to increase physical activity after MBS. Adults who had MBS in the past 2 years completed semi-structured interviews and psychological/behavioral questionnaires. After transcription, a codebook was developed using inductive and deductive methods. Coded data were analyzed using content analysis. Participants were 23 adults (78% female). Contexts that contributed to positive emotions during physical activity included an enjoyable type of exercise, social interaction, mindfulness during exercise, and mastery. Contexts that contributed to negative affect were more unique to the MBS population, including all-or-nothing thinking about exercise, using distraction, depression, negative body image, exercising only for weight loss, and the COVID-19 pandemic. For most participants, emotional factors were relevant in the decision to be physically active and in their ability to maintain their habits. An intervention that encourages factors that lead to positive affect and addresses factors that lead to negative affect could be effective in increasing physical activity following MBS.","Feig, Harnedy, Golden, Thorndike, Huffman, Psaros","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05807-x","20211120","Bariatric surgery; Health behavior change; Physical activity; Positive emotions; Psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-21","",22400,""
"Comparing efficacy of telehealth to in-person mental health care in intensive-treatment-seeking adults","The heightened acuity in anxiety and depressive symptoms catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent need for effective, feasible alternatives to in-person mental health treatment. While tele-mental healthcare has been investigated for practicability and accessibility, its efficacy as a successful mode for delivering high-quality, high-intensity treatment remains unclear. This study compares the clinical outcomes of a matched sample of patients in a private, nation-wide behavioral health treatment system who received in-person, intensive psychological treatment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,192) to the outcomes of a distinctive group of patients who received telehealth treatment during the pandemic (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,192). Outcomes are measured with respect to depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report; QIDS-SR) and quality of life (Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire; Q-LES-Q). There were no significant differences in admission score on either assessment comparing in-person and telehealth groups. Patients in the partial hospitalization level of care stayed longer when treatment was remote. Results suggest telehealth as a viable care alternative with no significant differences between in-person and telehealth groups in depressive symptom reduction, and significant increases in self-reported quality of life across both groups. Future research is needed to replicate these findings in other healthcare organizations in other geographical locations and diverse patient populations.","Bulkes, Davis, Kay, Riemann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.11.003","20211120","Behavioral health; COVID-19; Mental health; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-21","",22401,""
