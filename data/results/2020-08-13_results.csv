"Strategies to Increase Peer Support Specialists' Capacity to Use Digital Technology in the Era of COVID-19: Pre-Post Study","BACKGROUND: Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), telemental health to support mental health services was primarily designed for individuals with professional clinical degrees, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, registered nurses, and licensed clinical social workers. For the first the time in history, peer support specialists are offering Medicaid-reimbursable telemental health services during the COVID-19 crisis; however, little effort has been made to train peer support specialists on telehealth practice and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use digital peer support technology. METHODS: The Digital Peer Support Certification was co-produced with peer support specialists and included an education and simulation training session, synchronous and asynchronous support services, and audit and feedback. Participants included 9 certified peer support specialists between the ages of 25 and 54 years (mean 39 years) who were employed as peer support specialists for 1 to 11 years (mean 4.25 years) and had access to a work-funded smartphone device and data plan. A pre-post design was implemented to examine the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use technology over a 3-month timeframe. Data were collected at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. RESULTS: Overall, an upward trend in peer support specialists' capacity to offer digital peer support occurred during the 3-month certification period. CONCLUSIONS: The Digital Peer Support Certification shows promising evidence of increasing the capacity of peer support specialists to use specific digital peer support technology features. Our findings also highlighted that this capacity was less likely to increase with training alone and that a combinational knowledge translation approach that includes both training and management will be more successful.","Fortuna, Karen L; Myers, Amanda L; Walsh, Danielle; Walker, Robert; Mois, George; Brooks, Jessica M","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20429","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(7): e20429, 2020 Jul 23.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(7): e20429, 2020 Jul 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-13","",3838,""
"Factors affecting the anxiety levels of adolescents in home-quarantine during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","The long-term closing of schools and home-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic cause negative effects on the physical and mental health of young people. Studies evaluating the mental health of adolescents during the pandemic are limited in the literature. In our study, it was aimed to determine the results of home-quarantine measures taken for adolescents during the pandemic and the affecting factors. This study was conducted as an online cross-sectional self-report questionnaire and included children aged between 12 and 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The data were obtained from the children of volunteer families via Facebook family groups, and Google Forms questionnaires sent by the child psychiatry clinic to their smartphones. Sociodemographic form, State-Trait anxiety scale, and UCLA loneliness survey were used as data collection tools. We examined the data of 745 adolescents. The average age of the study group was 16.83Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.66Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, and 69.5% were females. It was determined that 88.2% of the adolescents followed the developments in the COVID-19 process and obtained most information from the television.

The consequences of the pandemic unfold daily and they extend beyond physical health. Current research suggests that it is a public mental health crisis. With regards to the physical effects of COVID-19, policy makers have drawn from past experiences, such as the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, to craft unique responses. A similar approach must be taken to address the mental health effects of the pandemic. Because COVID-19 can fit the definitions of a mental health disaster, it can be addressed using the principles of disaster mental health management.

For example, prior to the pandemic, per capita health expenditure and ratio of health care personnel to the general population were low (Institute of Health Matrix and Evaluation 2020); moreover, there is a poor political will to improve health care generally. To compound this in Nigeria is the fact that insurgence is common, especially in the Northeastern part of the country, and that has produced many internally displaced persons who live in various camps. In addition, there are many street children begging for alms partly due to religious and cultural reasons; these again are more common in Northern Nigeria. It therefore looks like the ground is fertile for a rapid spread of Covid-19.","Baiyewu, Elugbadebo, Oshodi","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610220001726","20200812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-13","",3843,""

"Digital phenotyping of complex psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. A large scale study on psychological reactions to the pandemic to inform ongoing population-level symptom tracking and response to treatment is currently lacking. Methods: Average intake scores for standard depression and anxiety symptom scales were tracked from January 1, 2017 to June 9, 2020 for patients seeking treatment from a digital mental health service to gauge the relationship between COVID-19 and self-reported symptoms. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to unstructured therapy transcript data from patients seeking treatment during the height of the pandemic in the United States between March 1, 2020 and June 9, 2020 to identify words associated with COVID-19 mentions. This analysis was used to identify symptoms that were present beyond those assessed by standard depression and anxiety measures. Results: Depression and anxiety symptoms reported by 169,889 patients between January 1, 2017 and June 9, 2020 were identified. There was no detectable change in intake depression symptom scores. Intake anxiety symptom scores increased 1.42 scale points [95% CI: 1.18, 1.65] between March 15, 2020 and April 1, 2020, when scores peaked. In the transcript data of these 169,889 patients, plus an expanded sample of 49,267 patients without symptom reports, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) identified 2,377 positively correlated and 661 negatively correlated terms that were significantly (FDR<.01) associated with mentions of the virus. These terms were classifiable into 24 symptoms beyond those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased intake anxiety symptoms for individuals seeking digital mental health treatment. NLP analyses suggest that standard symptom scales for depression and anxiety alone are inadequate to fully assess and track psychological reactions to the pandemic. Symptoms of grief, trauma, obsession-compulsion, agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, panic, and non- suicidal self-injury should be monitored as part of a new COVID-19 Syndrome category.","Thomas Hull et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-7D5-3B8","20200813","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-13","",3848,""
