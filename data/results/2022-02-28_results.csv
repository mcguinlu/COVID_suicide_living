"Short-term improvement of mental health after a COVID-19 vaccination","Abstract Importance: The role of COVID-19 vaccination on the mental health of the general population remains poorly understood. Objective: To assess the short-term change of depressive and anxiety symptoms in relation to COVID-19 vaccination among Swedish adults. Design: A prospective cohort study with monthly data collections on self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021. Setting: The Omtanke2020 Study, Sweden. Participants: 7,925 participants of the Omtanke2020 study with complete data on depressive and anxiety symptoms and vaccination status. Intervention(s) or Exposure(s): Receiving the first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Main outcomes(s) and Measure(s): Binary measures of depression (PHQ-9, cut-off [&ge;] 10) and anxiety (GAD-7, cut-off [&ge;] 10) one month before the first dose, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or chose to not report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability. Results: 5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety among vaccinated, compared with unvaccinated, individuals, especially after the second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was lower after both first (aRR=0.82, 95%CI 0.76-0.88 for depression; aRR=0.81, 95%CI 0.73-0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR=0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.85 for depression; aRR=0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared with before vaccination. Similar results were observed among individuals receiving only one dose (aRR=0.76, 95%CI 0.68-0.84 for depression; aRR=0.82, 95%CI 0.72-0.94 for anxiety, comparing after first dose to before vaccination). These results were independent of age, sex, recruitment type, body mass index, smoking, relationship status, history of psychiatric disorder, number of comorbidities, COVID-19 infection status, and seasonality. Conclusions and Relevance: We observed a positive short-term change in depressive and anxiety symptoms among adults receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in the current pandemic.","Charilaos Chourpiliadis; Aniko Lovik; Anna K.
