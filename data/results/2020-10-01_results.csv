"Behavioral and sociodemographic predictors of anxiety and depression in patients under epidemiological surveillance for COVID-19 in Ecuador","Ecuador has been one of the most affected countries by the Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, by April 2020 this country presented the highest rates of mortality in Latin America. The purpose of the present study was to identify behaviors during confinement and sociodemographic variables associated with the mental health status of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients who were part of the epidemiological surveillance program in Ecuador that included mandatory confinement and self-isolation. A cross-sectional study was performed from March 22th to April 18th, 2020 using an online survey. The survey collected socio-demographic information and severity of depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and anxiety symptoms through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. A total of 759 patients completed the questionnaire, 20.3% presented moderate to severe symptoms of depression and 22.5% moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety. Being a woman and from the Coastal region were risk factors. Exercising, maintaining daily routines, and keeping informed about the COVID-19 but limiting to an hour was associated with better mental health. Regression analysis indicated that the mentioned behaviors explained approximately 17% of the variance for depression sum scores and 11.8% of the variance for anxiety sum scores while controlling for gender and region. Understanding the association between sociodemographic variables and psychological states in patients with COVID-19 is relevant to tackle future public mental health problems and to implement health policies that are intended to palliate further psychiatric complications. Promotion of modifiable behaviors such as exercising, maintaining daily routines, and keeping informed about the COVID-19 but limiting to less than an hour is recommended.","Paz, Mascialino, Adana-DÃƒÂ­az, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Lorenzana, SimbaÃƒÂ±a-Rivera, GÃƒÂ³mez-Barreno, Troya, Paez, CÃƒÂ¡rdenas, Gerstner, Ortiz-Prado","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240008","20200930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5335,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health of undergraduate students in New Jersey, cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of upheaval for college students. The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among a sample of undergraduate college students in Northern New Jersey, the region of the U.S. severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. College students (N = 162) enrolled in an introductory core curriculum course completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 information, behavior changes, academic and everyday difficulties, and mental health measurements (depression, anxiety, somatization, and stress). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Descriptive findings indicate that students have a fundamental knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and common symptoms. Students tend to use and trust the official sources and have changed their behaviors in accordance with public health recommendations (i.e., increased hand washing, wearing mask). However, students reported a number of academic and everyday difficulties and high levels of mental health distress. High levels of depression were associated with difficulties in focusing on academic work and with employment losses, while higher levels of anxiety were more likely to be reported by students other than freshmen and those who spend more than one hour per day looking for information on COVID-19. Inability to focus on academic work and an elevated concern with COVID-19 were more likely to be associated with higher levels of somatization, while trusting news sources was associated with lower levels of somatization. Those with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to be females, unable to focus on academic work, and report difficulties in obtaining medications and cleaning supplies. The COVID-19 pandemic is making a significant negative impact on mental health of college students. Proactive efforts to support the mental health and well-being of students are needed.","Kecojevic, Basch, Sullivan, Davi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239696","20200930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5336,""
"Online Physical Education and the Relationship with Mental Health of College Students during the Outbreak of COVID-19: Online Survey Study in Wuhan","Outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the global health. For college students, online physical education was a challenge as an outdoor course. The study used data from an online survey to evaluate the relationship of mental health status and sports-related lifestyle, and the problems of online physical education has been stated as well. An online survey was conducted by snowball sampling from May 8th to May 11th. Demographic data, mental health status, sports-related lifestyle of college students in Wuhan and the issues of online physical education were collected. Mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The study included 1607 respondents from 267 cities. The average scores of DASS-21 subscales were significantly lower in our study (for depression, 2.46; for anxiety, 1.48; for stress, 2.59) than previous study (P&lt;.05). Lower scores of DASS-21 were significantly correlated with regular exercise, keeping exercise habits during the outbreak of COVID-19, exercising more than 1 to 2 times a week, exercise duration more than 1 hour, and steps on pedometer more than 2000(P&lt;.05). None of the 3 forms of the online physical education was preferred by more than 50% respondents. Frequent technical problems were confronted by 1087 (67.6%) students. Shape-up exercise (846, 52.6%), designed combination of exercise (710, 44.2%) and Chinese Kungfu (559, 34.8%) were suggested sports for online physical education. The mental status was significantly correlated with regular exercise and sufficient exercise duration. Professional physical guidance was in need for college students in selected sports. Exercises not meeting students' preferences, frequent technical problems, and distant interaction of online physical education were the main problems that should be solved in future.","Deng, Wang, Zhu, Liu, Guo, Peng, Shao, Xia","https://doi.org/10.2196/21301","20200930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5337,""
"Epidemiology of trauma presentations to a major trauma centre in the North West of England during the COVID-19 level 4 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare systems globally, little is known about the trauma patterns during a national lockdown. The aim of this study is to delineate the trauma patterns and outcomes at Aintree University Teaching Hospital level 1 Major Trauma Centre (MTC) during the COVID-19 lockdown imposed by the U.K. government. A retrospective cohort study data from the Merseyside and Cheshire Trauma Audit and Research Network database were analysed. The 7-week 'lockdown period' was compared to a 7-week period prior to the lockdown and also to an equivalent 7-week period corresponding to the previous year. A total of 488 patients were included in the study. Overall, there was 37.6% and 30.0% reduction in the number of traumatic injuries during lockdown. Road traffic collisions (RTC) reduced by 42.6% and 46.6%. RTC involving a car significantly reduced during lockdown, conversely, bike-related RTC significantly increased. No significant changes were noted in deliberate self-harm, trauma severity and crude mortality during lockdown. There was 1 mortality from COVID-19 infection in the lockdown cohort. Trauma continues during lockdown, our MTC has continued to provide a full service during lockdown. However, trauma patterns have changed and departments should adapt to balance these alongside the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.K. starts its cautious transition out of lockdown, trauma services are required to be flexible during changes in national social restrictions and changing trauma patterns. COVID-19 and lockdown state were found to have no significant impact on survival outcomes for trauma.","Rajput, Sud, Rees, Rutka","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-020-01507-w","20200930","COVID-19; Emergency surgery; Lockdown; Pandemic; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5338,""
"Neuropsychiatric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple sclerosis patients","This study reported on a variety of psychological reactions related to anxiety, sleep quality, depression, fatigue, and quality of life in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), related to the Covid-19 quarantine experience. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychiatric effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in MS patients and to analyze the risk factors contributing to psychological stress. The study was designed as a prospective, cross-sectional survey study. Multiple assessment tools that are used in neurological practice, including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) were administered prospectively both during the early and the peak stages of COVID-19 outbreak (ESO and PSO, respectively). The survey forms were designed using SurveyMonkey and the participants were participating in the survey via a web link and QR code. Fifty patients were included in the study. BDI scores, PSQI and FSI measurements, cognitive and social subscale scores and total FIS score, MSQOL-54 measurements, physical and mental subscale scores, and total MSQOL-54 score at PSO were significantly different than those at ESO. The body mass index values of the patients increased significantly at PSO compared to those measured at ESO. The results provide a basis for the development of psychological interventions that could minimize the prevalence of sleep disorders and depression and could improve patients' quality of life during the outbreak.","Demir, Bilek, Balgetir","https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282X20200122","20200930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5339,""
"Impact of initial COVID-19 restrictions on psychiatry presentations to the Emergency Department of a large academic teaching hospital","To determine if the initial COVID-19 societal restrictions, introduced in Ireland in March 2020, impacted on the number and nature of psychiatry presentations to the emergency department (ED) of a large academic teaching hospital. We examined anonymised clinical data of psychiatry presentations to the ED during the initial 8-week period of COVID-19 restrictions. Data from corresponding 8-week periods in 2018 and 2019 were also extracted for comparison. Psychiatry presentations to ED reduced by 21% during the COVID-19 restrictions, from 24/week to 19/week when compared with corresponding periods in 2018/2019 (1-way 2-sample Poisson Rate Test estimate of difference -5.2/week, 95% CI 1.3-9.1, p = 0.012). Numbers attending for out of hours assessment remained unchanged (81 vs 80), but numbers seeking assessment during normal hours decreased (71 vs 114). We observed increased presentations from the &lt;18 age group, but decreased presentations from the 18-29 age group (Pearson Chi-Square 20.363, DF = 6, p = 0.002). We recorded an increase in anxiety disorders during the initial COVID-19 restrictions (31 vs 23), and a reduction in alcohol disorders (28 vs 52). The proportion of presentations with suicidal ideation or self-harm as factors remained unchanged. Rates of emergency presentation with mental illness reduced during the initial COVID-19 restrictions. This may represent an unmet burden of mental health need. Younger people may be experiencing greater distress and mental illness during the current crisis. More people sought help for anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 restrictions compared with corresponding data from 2018/2019.","McAndrew, O'Leary, Cotter, Cannon, MacHale, Murphy, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.115","20200930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5340,""
"The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - A resource for COVID-19 research: Questionnaire data capture May-July 2020","The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective population-based cohort study which recruited pregnant women in 1990-1992 and has followed these women, their partners and their offspring ever since. The study reacted rapidly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, deploying an online questionnaire early on during lockdown (from 9 <sup>th</sup> April to 15 <sup>th</sup> May). In late May 2020, a second questionnaire was developed asking about physical and mental health, lifestyle and behaviours, employment and finances. The online questionnaire was deployed across the parent and offspring generations between the 26th May and 5 <sup>th</sup> July 2020. 6482 participants completed the questionnaire (2639 original mothers, 1039 original fathers/partners, 2711 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 93 partners of offspring). 1039 new participants who did not respond to the first questionnaire deployed in April completed the second questionnaire. Ã‚Â A positive COVID-19 was reported by 36 (0.6%) participants (12 G0 and 24 G1), 91 (1.4%; 35 G0 and 56 G1) reported that they had been told by a doctor they likely had COVID-19 and 838 (13%; 422 G0 and 416 G1) suspected that they have had COVID-19.Ã‚ Using algorithmically estimated cases based on symptoms, we estimate that the predicted prevalence of COVID-19 from mid-April to time of questionnaire completion was 3.1%. Data from both COVID questionnaires will be complemented with linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. Data has been released as an update to the original dataset released in May 2020. It comprises: 1) a standard dataset containing <i>all</i> participant responses to both questionnaires with key sociodemographic factors and 2) as a composite release coordinating data from the existing resource, thus enabling bespoke research across all areas supported by the study.

"COVID-19 and its Effect on Emergency Presentations to a Tertiary Hospital with Self-Harm in Ireland","This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on presentations to an acute hospital with self-harm. All presentations to University Hospital Galway with self-harm were assessed during the peak period of the coronavirus crisis in Ireland, over the three months from 1st March to 31st May 2020. These data were compared with presentations in the same months in the three years preceding (2017-2019). Data were obtained from the anonymised service database. This study found that in 2020, the rate of presentation with self-harm dropped by 35% from March to April and rose by 104% from April to May, peaking from mid-May. When trends over a four-year period were examined, there was a significantly higher lethality of attempt (p&lt;0.001), and significant differences in diagnosis (p=0.031) in 2020 in comparison with the three previous years. The increased lethality of presentations remained significant after age and gender were controlled for (p=0.036). There were also significant differences in the underlying psychiatric diagnoses(p=0.018), notably with a significant increase in substance misuse disorders presenting during the 2020 study period. COVID-19 showed a reduction in self-harm presentations initially, followed by a sharp increase in May 2020. If a period of economic instability follows as predicted, it is likely that this will further impact the mental health of the population, along with rates of self-harm and suicidal behaviours. There is a need for research into the longer-term effect of the restrictions and changes due to Covid-19, especially with respect to self-harm.","McIntyre, Tong, McMahon, Doherty","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.116","20200930","COVID-19; attempted; psychiatry; self-harm; self-injurious behaviour; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5342,""
"Personalised health education against health damage of COVID-19 epidemic in the elderly Hungarian population (PROACTIVE-19): protocol of an adaptive randomised controlled clinical trial","Early reports indicate that COVID-19 may require intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 5-26% and overall mortality can rise to 11% of the recognised cases, particularly affecting the elderly. There is a lack of evidence-based targeted pharmacological therapy for its prevention and treatment. We aim to compare the effects of a World Health Organization recommendation-based education and a personalised complex preventive lifestyle intervention package (based on the same WHO recommendation) on the outcomes of the COVID-19. PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomised controlled clinical trial with adaptive &quot;sample size re-estimation&quot; design. Hungarian population over the age of 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years without confirmed COVID-19 will be approached to participate in a telephone health assessment and lifestyle counselling voluntarily. Volunteers will be randomised into two groups: (A) general health education and (B) personalised health education. Participants will go through questioning and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health, (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity, (4) dietary habits, and (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. Assessment will be done weekly during the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. The composite primary endpoint will include the rate of ICU admission, hospital admission (longer than 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°h), and mortality in COVID-19-positive cases. The estimated sample size is 3788 subjects per study arm. The planned duration of the follow-up is a minimum of 1Ã‚Â year. These interventions may boost the body's cardiovascular and pulmonary reserve capacities, leading to improved resistance against the damage caused by COVID-19. Consequently, lifestyle changes can reduce the incidence of life-threatening conditions and attenuate the detrimental effects of the pandemic seriously affecting the older population. The study has been approved by the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Hungarian Medical Research Council (IV/2428- 2 /2020/EKU) and has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04321928 ) on 25 March 2020.","ErÃ…â€˜ss, MolnÃƒÂ¡r, SzakÃƒÂ¡cs, ZÃƒÂ¡dori, SzakÃƒÂ³, VÃƒÂ¡ncsa, JuhÃƒÂ¡sz, Ocskay, VÃƒÂ¶rhendi, MÃƒÂ¡rta, Szentesi, PÃƒÂ¡rniczky, Hegyi, Kiss, FÃƒÂ¶ldi, Dembrovszky, Kanjo, PÃƒÂ¡zmÃƒÂ¡ny, VarrÃƒÂ³, CsathÃƒÂ³, Helyes, PÃƒÂ©terfi, Czopf, Kiss, ZemplÃƒÂ©nyi, CzapÃƒÂ¡ri, Hegyi, Dobszai, MiklÃƒÂ³s, MÃƒÂ¡rta, TÃƒÂ³th, Farkas, Farkas, BirkÃƒÂ¡s, PintÃƒÂ©r, PethÃ…â€˜, Zsigmond, SÃƒÂ¡rkÃƒÂ¶zi, Nagy, Hegyi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-04733-0","20200930","COVID-19; Prevention; Public health; Randomised controlled trial; SARS-CoV-2; nCov-2019","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5343,""
"Mental Health and the SARS-COV-2 Epidemic-Polish Research Study","<i>Background</i>: The aim of this study was to assess the mental state of Poles in the first weeks of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. <i>Methods</i>: In the study, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-18), The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Mini-Cope were used. <i>Results</i>: The study was conducted on a group of 443 individuals, including 348 women (78.6%) and 95 men (21.4%). There were more women (<i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> = 6.42, <i>p</i> = 0.02) in the group of people with high results in the GHQ-28 questionnaire and the differentiating factors between those with sten scores above 7 (significantly deteriorated mental health) and those with average or low results (sten score below 7) turned out to be: treatment for mental disorders before the pandemic (<i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> = 19.57, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and the use of psychotherapy during the pandemic (<i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> = 4.21, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and psychiatric pharmacotherapy (<i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> = 8.31, <i>p</i> = 0.01). The presence of suicidal thoughts since the appearance of the pandemic-related restraints and limitations significantly differentiates the compared groups (<i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> = 38.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <i>Conclusions</i>: Every fourth person in the examined group (over 26% of the respondents) recorded results that indicate a high probability of mental functioning disorders. Approximately 10% of the respondents signalled the occurrence of suicidal thoughts since the beginning of the pandemic. The respondents complain mainly about problems in everyday life, lack of satisfaction from one's own activities, tension, trouble sleeping, and feelings of exhaustion. Individuals with significantly reduced mental well-being use non-adaptive coping strategies, such as denying problems, emotional discharge, taking substances, discontinuation of action, and blaming themselves for the situation. The risk factors for the deterioration of the mental state of the respondents during the pandemic include psychiatric treatment before the beginning of the pandemic, the presence of suicidal thoughts during forced isolation, and the use of non-adaptive coping strategies (denial of the existence of problems, emotional discharge, use of psychoactive substances, discontinuation of action, and blaming oneself for the situation).","Talarowska, Chodkiewicz, Nawrocka, Miniszewska, BiliÃ…â€žski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197015","20200930","COVID-19; GHQ-28; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5344,""
"Emotion Regulation and Psychological and Physical Health during a Nationwide COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic poses considerable challenges that threaten health and well-being. Initial data supports that many people experienced elevated psychological distress as the pandemic emerged. Yet, prior examinations of average changes in well-being fail to identify who is at greater risk for poor psychological health. The aim of the current research was to examine whether the use of different emotion regulation strategies (emotional suppression, rumination, cognitive reappraisal) predicted residual changes in psychological and physical health during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. We leveraged an ongoing study in which participants had reported on their psychological and physical health prior to the pandemic. Participants then reported on the same health outcomes as well as their use of emotion regulation strategies, stress and emotion control difficulties during a nationwide lockdown involving confinement in the home for 5 weeks. Accounting for pre-pandemic psychological health, greater emotional suppression and rumination predicted greater depressive symptoms, lower emotional well-being, greater limitations due to emotional problems, and poorer social functioning during the lockdown, even when controlling for the detrimental effects of stress and emotion control difficulties. Accounting for pre-pandemic physical health, greater rumination predicted greater fatigue and poorer physical health, but the amount of stress people experienced was a stronger predictor across physical health outcomes. The results validate concerns that the stress of the pandemic risks declines in psychological and physical health and identify emotional suppression and rumination as important risk factors of poor psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rachel Low et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BA-DE9-044","20201001","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; stress; emotion regulation; health; well-being; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5345,""
"Exploring Household Food Security and Malnutrition Risk with Psychosocial Indicators of Healthy Ageing in Place: The Food Train - Eat Well Age Well Partnership Project","In Scotland, and United Kingdom, there are stark inequalities in the experience of older age, particularly for those with limited social contact, poorer health, located in deprived neighbourhoods (Centre for Ageing Better 2015). This mixed-methodology research, reports survey findings with n=169 community dwelling older adults in Scotland (average age 79.5), supported with qualitative interviews to evidence the underexplored connection between food insecurity and physiological risk indicators of undernutrition (malnutrition), with psychosocial indicators of healthy ageing. Findings are grounded in collaboration with a third sector social enterprise â€“ Food Train, who provide food shopping and volunteer meal making for those aged 65+. Findings revealed correlations between food insecurity and early indicators of malnutrition risk with poorer wellbeing, and social connectedness. Supported food access mitigates the negative cycle of food insecurity on mental health, via empowerment (locus of control) over oneâ€™s life. Qualitative findings suggest that risks of food insecurity may not be financial (food poverty), or attributable to health realities associated with ageing. Rather, psychosocial health and wellbeing diverge as older adults attempt to draw upon available resources, reflective of their own social capital. Mitigators of malnutrition risk includes empowerment through social care located in the third sector, as well as social aspects of food access e.g. social eating, warranting future investigation. These findings are considered post Covid-19, with key policy implications.","Kate Reid et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-866-997","20201001","SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Law; SocArXiv|Law|Human Rights Law; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; undernutrition; older adult; third sector; social connections; ageing in place; wellbeing; food insecurity; healthy ageing; malnutrition; active ageing","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-01","",5346,""
