"Compassion Fatigue in Laboratory Animal Personnel during the COVIDÂ­19 Pandemic","Compassion Fatigue (CF) is commonly observed in professions associated with human and animal care. The COVID-19 pandemic compelled laboratory animal research institutions to implement new work practices in order to maintain essential animal care operations. These modifications ranged from shift changes to last-resort measures, such as culling animal colonies, to accommodate reduced staffing. Such changes could cause personnel to experience increased stress, isolation, and helplessness-all of which can increase CF risk. In the current study, 200 persons involved with animal research completed an online survey to gauge whether CF among laboratory animal personnel had increased during the pandemic. The survey examined professional quality of life, self-assessed levels of CF, institutional changes, perceived changes in animal welfare, and institutional measures intended to alleviate CF. A total of 86% of participants had experienced CF at some point in their career, with 41% experiencing a CF event (new or worsening symptoms of CF) during the pandemic. In addition, 90% of participants who reported a CF event also reported subsequent effects on their personal or professional lives. Health, employment, and animal-related stress that arose due to the pandemic were all found to influence CF scores significantly. Although 96% of respondents were considered essential workers, 67% did not feel as valued for their work as other essential personnel. Furthermore, 88% of personnel responsible for the euthanasia of healthy animals who experienced a CF event reported that CF also affected their personal life, professional life, or both, and 78% responded that interventions from internal CF programs or leadership did not help to alleviate symptoms of CF. The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant institutional changes will likely have lasting effects on persons and organizations. By determining and subsequently mitigating sources of CF, we can better assist the laboratory animal community during future crises.","Thurston, Sarah E; Chan, Goldia; Burlingame, Lisa A; Jones, Jennifer A; Lester, Patrick A; Martin, Tara L","https://dx.doi.org/10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-21-000030","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Assoc Lab Anim Sci;2021 Oct 28.; Publication details: J Am Assoc Lab Anim Sci;2021 Oct 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21441,""
"Tweens are not teens: the problem of amalgamating broad age groups when making pandemic recommendations","Demarcating childhood into two distinct and broad 10-year age bands of over and under age 10 is a disservice to our tween population (9-12Â years), and may be overlooking our role in understanding the negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) during a formative period of development. In this commentary, we discuss the importance of considering tweens as a unique population of youth who are differentially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We first describe the distinctive progress of tweens across various facets of developmental health, followed by recommendations to improve understanding and address impact of the pandemic and its restrictions on tweens. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the day-to-day lives of tweens and what we do now will have long-lasting effects on their lifelong trajectories.","McArthur, Brae Anne; Madigan, Sheri; Korczak, Daphne J","https://dx.doi.org/10.17269/s41997-021-00585-6","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Public Health;2021 Oct 29.; Publication details: Can J Public Health;2021 Oct 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21442,""
"Remote and Hands-on: Informal Environmental Health Science Education in a Socially Distant World","The Covid-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for informal health science education, which traditionally involves face-to-face programming. We describe the adaptation of hands-on environmental health science kits for online and socially distanced informal education with diverse audiences. These hands-on science kits were traditionally used for in-person, whole group instruction. Because the kits include all the materials needed to complete the activities, they provide hands-on science experiences without the need for a science lab facility. We developed a logistics plan for online use of the kits, taking into account the use of technology, kit distribution, virtual instruction, and audience engagement. We also developed Covid-safe practices for in-person instruction that supported social distancing while engaging learners in hands-on science. The strategic adaptation and creative implementation of these kits allowed us to engage our community's youth in environmental health learning during the isolated and uncertain times of the pandemic. Lessons learned from this experience may inform future efforts to provide remote, interactive informal science education to respond to diverse learners' needs.","Fallone, Caitlin M; Korfmacher, Katrina S; Brosnick, Lisa; Markowitz, Dina G","https://dx.doi.org/10.15695/jstem/v4i2.04","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J STEM Outreach;4(2)2021 Jul.; Publication details: J STEM Outreach;4(2)2021 Jul.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21443,""
"Brain Fog: A Bit of Clarity Regarding Etiology, Prognosis, and Treatment","Brain fog is a lay term used to describe cognitive difficulties. Brain fog can be a response to lack of sleep, poor nutrition, medications, or drugs; however, the term is often used to describe the subjective experience of neuroinflammation. Chronic low-level inflammation is the most detrimental to the mind and body. The purpose of the current article is to examine the mechanisms, associated symptoms, and treatments for neuroinflammation and brain fog. The state of the science is lacking evidence for specific treatments targeting the mechanisms/pathways of neuroinflammation for precision-based care, yet there are pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions that can reduce inflammation and improve functioning.

"An Online Assessment to Evaluate the Role of Cognitive Biases and Emotion Regulation Strategies for Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown of 2020: Structural Equation Modeling Study","BACKGROUND: Extant research supports causal roles of cognitive biases in stress regulation under experimental conditions. However, their contribution to psychological adjustment in the face of ecological major stressors has been largely unstudied. OBJECTIVE: We developed a novel online method for the ecological examination of attention and interpretation biases during major stress (ie, the COVID-19 lockdown in March/April 2020) and tested their relations with the use of emotion regulation strategies (ie, reappraisal and rumination) to account for individual differences in psychological adjustment to major COVID-19-related stressors (ie, low depression and anxiety, and high well-being and resilience). METHODS: Participants completed an online protocol evaluating the psychological impact of COVID-19-related stressors and the use of emotion regulation strategies in response to them, during the initial weeks of the lockdown of March/April 2020. They also completed a new online cognitive task designed to remotely assess attention and interpretation biases for negative information. The psychometric properties of the online cognitive bias assessments were very good, supporting their feasibility for ecological evaluation. RESULTS: Structural equation models showed that negative interpretation bias was a direct predictor of worst psychological adjustment (higher depression and anxiety, and lower well-being and resilience; &#967;29=7.57; root mean square error of approximation=0.000). Further, rumination mediated the influence of interpretation bias in anxiety (P=.045; 95% CI 0.03-3.25) and resilience (P=.001; 95% CI -6.34 to -1.65), whereas reappraisal acted as a mediator of the influence of both attention (P=.047; 95% CI -38.71 to -0.16) and interpretation biases (P=.04; 95% CI -5.25 to -0.12) in well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights the relevance of individual processes of attention and interpretation during periods of adversity and identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted through online interventions.","Blanco, Ivan; Boemo, Teresa; Sanchez-Lopez, Alvaro","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/30961","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(11): e30961, 2021 Nov 02.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(11): e30961, 2021 Nov 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21445,""
"Professional Care Experiences of Persons With Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Model Development Based on a Qualitative Meta-Synthesis","BACKGROUND: Health care professionals (HCPs) are challenged in caring for persons with suicidal ideation or behavior. For affected persons, professional care is essential, and being interviewed about their experiences can be stressful. The experiences of persons ideating or attempting suicide are essential to designing eHealth products to support them in crises and provide continuous care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize published qualitative research about how persons with suicidal thoughts or behavior experience inpatient or outpatient care. A model will be derived from the meta-synthesis to guide HCPs in their work with affected persons and provide a thorough needs assessment for eHealth development. METHODS: A qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted using an inductive approach, as proposed by Sandelowski and Barroso. The inclusion criteria were studies in English and German that dealt with persons who ideated or attempted suicide. Relevant articles were identified by searching the PubMed and Cinahl databases and by hand searching relevant journals and reference lists. The findings of each study were analyzed using initial and axial coding, followed by selective coding. Finally, a conceptual model was derived. RESULTS: In total, 3170 articles were identified in the systematic literature search. Articles were screened independently by 2 researchers based on the eligibility criteria. Finally, 12 studies were included. The central phenomenon observed among persons ideating or attempting suicide is their process from feeling unanchored to feeling anchored in life again. During inpatient and outpatient care, they experience being dependent on the skills and attitudes of HCPs. While helpful skills and attitudes support persons ideating or attempting suicide to reach their feeling of being anchored in life again, adverse interactions are experienced negatively and might lead to prolonging or maintaining the feeling of being unanchored in life. CONCLUSIONS: The study promotes a differentiated view of the experiences of persons ideating or attempting suicide. The derived conceptual model can guide HCPs in their work with affected persons to support affected persons during their recovery. Moreover, the conceptual model is useable as a springboard to develop eHealth solutions for crisis situations and long-term care.","Hechinger, Mareike; Fringer, AndrÃ©","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27676","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e27676, 2021 Oct 28.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e27676, 2021 Oct 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21446,""
"A Text Messaging Intervention (StayWell at Home) to Counteract Depression and Anxiety During COVID-19 Social Distancing: Pre-Post Study","BACKGROUND: Social distancing and stay-at-home orders are critical interventions to slow down person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. While these societal changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19-related depression and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants' anxiety and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used 2-tailed paired t tests to detect changes in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later. RESULTS: The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an average reduction of -1.72 (95% CI -2.35 to -1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and -0.48 (95% CI -0.71 to -0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during the 60-day intervention period. Text messaging interventions could serve as an important public health tool for disseminating strategies to manage mental health.

"Digital Biomarkers for Depression Screening With Wearable Devices: Cross-sectional Study With Machine Learning Modeling","BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that is undiagnosed and untreated in half of all cases. Wearable activity trackers collect fine-grained sensor data characterizing the behavior and physiology of users (ie, digital biomarkers), which could be used for timely, unobtrusive, and scalable depression screening. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive ability of digital biomarkers, based on sensor data from consumer-grade wearables, to detect risk of depression in a working population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 290 healthy working adults. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 2 devices for 14 consecutive days and completed a health survey, including screening for depressive symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), at baseline and 2 weeks later. We extracted a range of known and novel digital biomarkers characterizing physical activity, sleep patterns, and circadian rhythms from wearables using steps, heart rate, energy expenditure, and sleep data. Associations between severity of depressive symptoms and digital biomarkers were examined with Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders, including sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol consumption, smoking, self-rated health, subjective sleep characteristics, and loneliness. Supervised machine learning with statistically selected digital biomarkers was used to predict risk of depression (ie, symptom severity and screening status). We used varying cutoff scores from an acceptable PHQ-9 score range to define the depression group and different subsamples for classification, while the set of statistically selected digital biomarkers remained the same. For the performance evaluation, we used k-fold cross-validation and obtained accuracy measures from the holdout folds. RESULTS: A total of 267 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 33 (SD 8.6, range 21-64) years. Out of 267 participants, there was a mild female bias displayed (n=170, 63.7%). The majority of the participants were Chinese (n=211, 79.0%), single (n=163, 61.0%), and had a university degree (n=238, 89.1%). We found that a greater severity of depressive symptoms was robustly associated with greater variation of nighttime heart rate between 2 AM and 4 AM and between 4 AM and 6 AM; it was also associated with lower regularity of weekday circadian rhythms based on steps and estimated with nonparametric measures of interdaily stability and autocorrelation as well as fewer steps-based daily peaks. Despite several reliable associations, our evidence showed limited ability of digital biomarkers to detect depression in the whole sample of working adults. However, in balanced and contrasted subsamples comprised of depressed and healthy participants with no risk of depression (ie, no or minimal depressive symptoms), the model achieved an accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 78% in detecting subjects at high risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Digital biomarkers that have been discovered and are based on behavioral and physiological data from consumer wearables could detect increased risk of depression and have the potential to assist in depression screening, yet current evidence shows limited predictive ability. Machine learning models combining these digital biomarkers could discriminate between individuals with a high risk of depression and individuals with no risk.","Rykov, Yuri; Thach, Thuan-Quoc; Bojic, Iva; Christopoulos, George; Car, Josip","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24872","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;9(10): e24872, 2021 10 25.; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;9(10): e24872, 2021 10 25.; Depression; Fitness Trackers; Adult; Biomarkers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/diagnosis; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21448,""
"Unemployment, Bankruptcies, and Deaths From Multiple Causes in the COVID-19 Recession Compared With the 2000Ã¢<U+0080><U+0092>2018 Great Recession Impact","Objectives. To determine whether unemployment and bankruptcy rates are related to increased excess deaths during the COVID-19 recession and to examine whether the current recession-based mortality rate not only is dependent on COVID-19 but also continues the pattern of recessions, especially the Great Recession, in relation to chronic disease mortality rates and mental health disturbances (e.g., including suicide) from 2000 to 2018. Methods. This study used pooled cross-sectional time series analysis to determine the impact of unemployment and bankruptcy rates on excess deaths from February to November 2020 for US states. The study used a second pooled cross-sectional time series analysis to determine whether the COVID-19Ã¢<U+0080><U+0092> era recessional mortality continues the impact of prepandemic recessions (2000-2018) on multiple causes of mortality. Results. When unemployment was at ten percent in January 2021, it was associated with approximately 48 149 excess deaths. At the same time, if bankruptcies are also accounted for at a similar recessional level, the combined effect of both produces 35 700 and 144 483 excess deaths, for unemployment and bankruptcies, respectively. These health-damaging COVID-19Ã¢<U+0080><U+0092>recessional findings suggest a reiteration of the significantly increased major causeÃ¢<U+0080><U+0092>specific mortality during 2000 to 2018, mitigated by the size of the health care workforce. Conclusions. Minimization of deaths attributable to the COVID-19 recession requires ample funding for the unemployed and underemployed, especially Black and Hispanic communities, along with significant investments in the health workforce.

"[Minimum Wage Companies in the Second Wave of the Corona Crisis]; Mindestlohnbetriebe in der zweiten Corona-Welle","For a number of reasons, businesses affected by minimum wage may have a particularly hard time during the coronavirus pandemic. We have found that minimum wage establishments were more frequently affected by the Corona pandemic than the rest of the economy at the beginning of 2021 due to the industry composition of these establishments rather than to minimum wage itself. The findings also indicate that minimum-wage establishments use short-time work more often and that the volume of work is reduced more frequently than in other establishments by cutting back on overtime. Finally, salary increases and special payments are also reduced or suspended more frequently.","Kagerl, Christian; Ohlert, Clemens","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10273-021-3028-9","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Wirtschaftsdienst;101(10): 804-808, 2021.; Publication details: Wirtschaftsdienst;101(10): 804-808, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21455,""
"Risk factors for burnout and depression in healthcare workers: The national AMADEUS study protocol","CONTEXT: Burnout is an international phenomenon defined as a state of professional exhaustion. It can lead to depression and have major economic and organizational impacts. Previous studies of healthcare professionals in France have focused on physicians, but none to date have explored other healthcare professions. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of our study is to determine the prevalence of burnout among healthcare workers. The secondary objectives are to explore the associations of burnout with professional and psycho-social factors and the risk of depression, professional harassment, sexual harassment, sexual-orientation based discrimination, consumption of antidepressants, anxiolytics and also the lifestyle of the individual: smoking, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, physical activity and sleep quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey will take the form of a voluntary and anonymous online questionnaire carried out on the FramaForm1Â® platform and will be disseminated via social networks, professional networks and mailings. STUDY POPULATION: Senior doctors, interns, directors of care, nurses, head nurses and senior head nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, dieticians, radiology technicians, laboratory technicians, psychologists, nurses' aides, auxiliary nurses and midwives will be included. COLLECTED DATA: Burnout will be measured with the Maslach Inventory burnout (MBI) questionnaire, work environment with the Karasek questionnaire and anxiety, depression risk with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies- Depression (CES-D), physical activity with the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). ETHICS: This protocol has been accepted by the ethical committee (IRB nÂ°C08/21.01.06.93911, CNIL). EXPECTED RESULTS: Based on international studies, we expect a high rate of burnout with disparities according to profession, socio-demographic data, seniority and type of service. We also expect a significant rate of untreated depression. This study will provide evidence for policy makers to implement collective strategies to reduce burnout and depression in the different populations studied.","Lucas, G; Colson, S; Boyer, L; Inthavong, K; Haller, P H; Lancon, C; Auquier, P; Gentile, S; Fond, G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2021.06.001","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Encephale;2021 Oct 16.; Publication details: Encephale;2021 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21456,""

"Identifying the risk features for occupational stress in medical workers: a cross-sectional study","OBJECTIVE: Occupational stress is considered a worldwide epidemic experienced by a large proportion of the working population. The identification of characteristics that place people at high risk for occupational stress is the basis of managing and intervening in this condition. In this study, we aimed to identify and validate the risk features for occupational stress among medical workers using a risk model and nomogram. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1988 eligible participants from Henan Province in China. Occupational stress and worker-occupation fit were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Worker-Occupation Fit Inventory (WOFI). The identification of risk features was achieved through constructing multiple logistic regression model, and the risk features were used to develop the risk model and nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots were generated to assess the effectiveness and calibration of the risk model. RESULTS: Among 1988 participants in our study, there were 42.5% (845/1988) medical workers experienced occupational stress. The risk features for occupational stress included poor work-occupation fit (WOF score < 25, expected risk: 77.3%), nurse population (expected risk: 63.1%), male sex (expected risk: 67.2%), work experience duration of 11-19Â years (expected risk: 54.5%), experience of a traumatic event (expected risk: 65.3%) and the lack of a regular exercise habit (expected risk: 60.2%). For medical workers who have these risk features, the expected risk probability of occupational stress would be 90.2%. CONCLUSION: The current data can be used to identify medical workers at risk of developing occupational stress. Identifying risk features for occupational stress and the work-occupation fit can support hierarchical stress management in hospitals.","Sun, Ruican; Zhang, Cailin; Lv, Keyao; Lan, Yajia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01762-3","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Arch Occup Environ Health;2021 Oct 01.; Publication details: Int Arch Occup Environ Health;2021 Oct 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21458,""
"Psychiatric conditions not only influence the severity of clinical outcome of covid-19 but also the medication of mental diseases","The disease process in psychiatric patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection might become more severe because of their impaired general health, comorbidities and unhealthy lifestyle. However, among all psychiatric conditions statistically significant correlation with severe and lethal outcome have been found only in schizophrenia with possible association of multiple immune dysfunctions. While the antipsychotic clozapine used in treatment resistant schizophrenia seems to decrease the likelihood of recovery of patients who underwent COVID-19 infection, antidepressants treatment for major depression may result in more favourable outcome. Mainly the antidepressant fluvoxamine has been reliably found effective by inhibiting cytokine storms observed in some COVID-19 infected patients. Â© 2021 Literatura Medica Publishing House.

"Exergaming: an effective way to maintain physical and mental health at home during COVID-19 pandemic","The recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has adversely affected the life of masses all across the world. The ones who got infected by this deadly virus have been quarantined and self-isolated for months. In the best interests of general public, the government of Pakistan implemented the state of lockdown in the country dating back in the month of March, 2020 and it led to a situation where everyone including adults, kids and elderly were home struck with little healthy recreational physical activities;and the situation is still the same. The physical and mental health have also been seriously affected among all age groups. Gyms, parks and sports clubs are all closed and people are left with quite limited health promoting alternatives. So, in this scenario, exergaming is an advisable option to maintain and promote physical as well as mental health. He worked on the virtual reality concept in which integration between sport and physical activity took place through digital games. Exercising covers a wide variety of physical activities including walking, running, cycling, swimming, climbing stairs, rowing, baseball, tennis, frisbee, boxing, golf, stretching and strengthening exercises, dancing and yoga, etc. Gaming devices have been found to improve physical and mental health and are very safe for home use. Exercising has also been observed to reduce anxiety and stress that occurs due to isolation in the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, staying active also enhances immunity, which plays an important role in combating microorganism-mediated disorders, including COVID-19. In addition to strengthening the immune system, exercise, which may not prevent progression of the disease, reduces the negative effects caused by the stress of living in isolation. The literature also claims that physically active patients have shorter recovery periods with more severe symptoms. not too severe. Physical exercise using an exercise platform not only improves fitness in healthy people, but also in those who are sick.","Nasir, Sultan, Kiran, Khushnood, Aliawan, M.

"Mental health consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic","This article aims to raise awareness of the psychological problems that emerged after the outbreak of COVID-19 around the world. Based on empirical research on COVID-19, psychological services and crisis interventions are needed to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. New terminology has been introduced, such as ""coronaphobia"", which describes the gravity of the situation. Further studies are needed to explore the trajectory of coronary-specific psychological complications over time. Special psychological support is needed from people who already have some mental illness or pre-existing illness, fears themselves or has suffered the death of a loved one has lost their job and little social or material support, first line workers and medical personnel, with a history of suicide, and people who were isolated and withdrawn. In addition to women, children, youth, minorities, students and the people with disabilities and drug use need considerable attention. Providing sufficient financial support from the government will help reduce psychiatric complications.

"Pharmacotherapeutic modifications in cardiopulmonary patients during COVID-19 outbreak","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has a well-established host cell entry mechanism by the angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2 receptor) most commonly found in epithelial cells of blood vessels, respiratory tract including lungs, intestines and kidney. Cardiopulmonary disorders were the most important comorbidities for COVID-19 patients. Recent studies conducted in Wuhan, China (the epicenter of the COVID19 outbreak) showed that an alarming 1,099 patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID19 had serious illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus both types, diseases coronary heart disease (CAD), kidney and cerebrovascular disease. Chronic inflammation and respiratory tract infections are usually treated with fluoroquinolones and corticosteroids. Fluoroquinolones increase the QT interval and threaten the evolution of arrhythmias and overuse of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19;expanding the threat of developing arrhythmias;on the other hand, corticosteroids mask the immune response resulting in worsening of the condition. While inhibitors cause respiratory depression, it increases the severity in COVID-19 patients. Based on available pharmacological data, there are no studies showing that calcium channel blocker increases ACE2 expression. Therefore, calcium channel blockers may be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients. Macrolides (azithromycin) may be a better choice than fluoroquinolones, as they are reported to be more effective in reducing secondary infection in COVID-19, paracetamol can be used than ibuprofen and diclofenac in COVID-19 patients. It is suggested that by modifying pharmacotherapy, the severity in cardiopulmonary patients during this COVID-19 outbreak can be reduced.","Khan, I.

"Academic Advisement in Higher Education: Critical Practices in a Global Pandemic","This article will describe critical practices for academic advisors in higher education, particularly during a time of global pandemic and crisis in the 2020-2021 academic year, prior to the widespread availability of preventative vaccines. Academic institutions at all levels transitioned to remote delivery during the lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Some such transitions were seamless while others took months to streamline to offer user-friendly and effective instructional delivery. Many administrators and educators had little time to adequately plan and prepare for this transition and others had serious deficiencies in navigating synchronous and asynchronous instructional methodologies. They simultaneously dealt with the universal upheaval of crisis, trauma, illness, fear, and death at astounding rates across communities (Daniel, 2020;Izumi et al., 2021). Students and families likewise may have had insufficient or no preparation in online instructional forums, and in impoverished communities, their access to technological devices and reliable Internet access was further limited. Achievement gaps grew wider and depression and anxiety also increased at alarming rates. To bridge these gaps, many educators and student support specialists reached beyond their job descriptions to offer a range of services, particularly in supporting students in crisis and those with special needs. Student wellness, resilience, and retention trumped curricular objectives, and the importance of academic advisement services emerged as a significant bridge to reaching students who were struggling and underserved. The functions of academic advising in maintaining rapport, screening for crisis and trauma, and providing information and resources will be reviewed (Dorn et al., 2020;Abumalloh et al., 2021).","Cicco, Gina","https://doi.org/10.26634/jet.18.3.18350","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal of Educational Technology; 18(3):10-15, 2021.; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal of Educational Technology; 18(3):10-15, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21466,""
"THE REORGANIZATION OF A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTER FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The heath crisis caused by COVID-19 has caused a reorganization of mental health centers. This article describes the reorganization proposal that was applied in a child and adolescent mental health unit (outpatient and community care).

In addition, the number of visits made during March-July 2020 are compared to the same period in 2019. We conclude that there has been a rapid adaptation from the face-to-face care framework to a telematic approach through a flexible reorganization. However, the decrease in face-to-face assistance and the cancellation of therapeutic groups have significantly increased the pressure of care. A rise in autolytic behaviors and eating pathologies has been observed that should be investigated in future studies.","Escalona-Zorita, P.; Moreno-Mayos, A.; Bellido-Zanin, G.; Vilagra-Ruiz, R.; Junyent-Freixenet, N.; Franco, J.

"An observational cross-sectional study on the neuropsychiatric manifestations of covid-19 pandemic in suspected and positive patients in northern India","Psychotherapy and grief reduction have been the mainstays of mental health care. Mental health on the other hand, is distinct from the lack of â€˜Mental Illness in that it encompasses psychological, social, and psychological wellbeing. The purpose of this study is to assess the Hamilton Depression Rating in COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care facility in Northern India. An observational study of Covid-19 positive individuals hospitalized to a tertiary healthcare centre in northern India was conducted. Over the course of six months, 1040 Covid-19 positive/ suspected individuals were enrolled in this study. The HDRS (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) was designed with hospital patients in mind, stressing the physical signs and symptoms of depression. The HAM-D scale is used to assess the severity of depression in patients with Covid-19. Despite the fact that there are 21 sections, the patient's score is based on the first 17 responses. During the six-month research period, a total of 1040 covid-19 suspected and positive patients were admitted. There were 240 covid-19 positive patients and 800 covid-19 suspicious patients out of a total of 1040. In positive patients, anxiety was present in 95.83 percent, mood change in 55 percent, and fear of death 23.33 percent;in suspected covid-19 patients, anxiety was present in 57 percent, mood alteration in 19 percent, and fear of death 13.5 percent.

"Old believersâ€™ customs of â€œnon-desecrationâ€ during the spread of the new viral infection covid-19 (Based on materials from the novosibirsk region)","The article analyzes the customs of overcoming â€œdesecrationâ€ (self-isolation from the modern world), actualizing among the Siberian Old Believers of different religious trends (accepting and not accepting the priesthood) during the spread of the new viral infection COVID-19. These interviews show that the Novosibirsk Old Believers have a firm conviction about the sinfulness of the â€œworldâ€ and its inhabitants as the root cause of the spread of the dangerous epidemic, but there is a difference in views between supporters of different directions, as well as on the acceptability of vaccination. Social upheavals throughout the history of mankind were accompanied by many concomitant factors, one of which was an appeal to the patterns included in the ethnocultural memory of peoples. At the beginning of the 21st century, the ideas and customs of the Old Believers were updated, which helped them to survive earlier during periods of epidemics (for example, the plague of 1771). As in the 18th â€“ 19th centuries this is the observance of the tradition of eating exclusively from â€œtheir own dishesâ€, minimizing communication with the worldly (atheists, infidels, etc.), greeting each other with a bow at a distance, etc. New original materials (interview in 2021) on the actualization of the customs of avoiding contacts and the traditional self-isolation of the Old Believers of Siberia, collected by the author, testify to the existence of a living connection between times and their transmission from generation to generation, even if there was a gap between two or three generations during the existence of the Soviet Union. This allows us to speak about ethnocultural memory as that part of knowledge, cultural practices and ideas of peoples that is not subject to state indoctrination. â€œUsefulâ€ knowledge and practices are actualized at certain periods of life, which are labeled by the citizens themselves as â€œimportantâ€ or â€œcriticalâ€. It is important that modern Old Believers emphasize the fact of the acceptability of a lifestyle that excludes gatherings and entertainment, without any protest or depressive moods.

"Psychological implications of Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in patients with chronic diseases: a systematic review","BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, patients with chronic diseases faced many challenges like greater risk of Covid-19 and delay in treatment which increase the possibility of psychological problems in these individuals. In this regard, the present study was conducted to investigate the psychological consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic in this group of patients. METHODS: In this systematic review study, published articles on the psychological consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 were reviewed. Keywords including Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), Psychological Implications, Epidemic, Mental Health, and Chronic diseases were searched in the title and abstract of articles published in reputable international scientific databases and all related English articles were listed and 30 qualified articles were reviewed. RESULTS: According to the collected data, loneliness increased stress and anxiety, and decreased sleep quality. Moreover, post-traumatic stress, panic attacks, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were the most important psychological consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic for people with chronic diseases. Female gender, old age, longer history of chronic disease, and lack of social support were associated with increased psychological problems. Increased fear and anxiety in caregivers and related health personnel were other results of the study. CONCLUSION: Many people with chronic illnesses have suffered from psychological problems during the outbreak of COVID-19. Furthermore, the extent of these problems depends on the characteristics of the chronic disease, and individuals' demographic and ecological characteristics, which emphasizes the need for designing individualized programs.","Sheykhangafshe, F.

"Online Teaching in an Un-prepared Country during COVID-19: An Interview Study on Final Year Medical and Dental Students","Aims: To assess medical students' perception of online teaching to suggest transforming the future curriculum in low-economic countries. Study Design: Cross-sectional online interview study. Place and Duration of Study: A team of collaborators interviewed final year medical and dental students of Pakistan from 07/08/2020 till 17/09/2020. Methodology: A questionnaire was developed based on open and close-ended questions in Google forms;focusing on institutional preparedness, views on online education, the institute's closure and COVID-19, and long-term effects of closure of the institute. Independent fellow researchers systematically analyzed the unaltered transcripts of the responses, and themes were then identified and coded to conclude the results. SPSS version 23 used for analysis. As this study was based on final year students. Results: In response to an invitation email, 2442/2661 (91.77%) students voluntarily participate in this qualitative study. Most participants were females (1614, 66.10%). Closing down institutes was directly linked to a lack of motivation and feel of helplessness. As most showed dissatisfaction with online teaching compounded by psychological effects, students feared losing clinical skills and life during the pandemic. Conclusion: The psychological impact of the crisis led to resistance to accepting the change for a better outcome. Incorporating telemedicine, different interactive learning style to online teaching, and resilience training would result in fruitful outcomes. Developed countries may also guide build infrastructure in developing countries to develop a more robust online teaching methodology in the long-run.","Dhahri, A. A.; Memon, A.

"Recovery of Surgical Training Through Extended Laparoscopic Simulation Training","Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected surgical training internationally. Laparoscopic surgery has a steep learning curve necessitating repetitive procedural practice. We evaluate the efficacy of short-and long-duration simulation training on participant skill acquisition to support the recovery of surgical training. Methods A prospective, observational study involving 18 novice medical students enrolled in a five-week course. Nodal timed assessments involved three tasks: hoop placement, stacking of sugar cubes and surgical cutting. One month post-completion, we compared the ability of six novice course participants to that of six surgical trainees who completed a smaller portion of the course curriculum. Results Course participants (n=18) completed tasks 111% faster on their third and last course attempt. The surgical trainee group (n=6) took 46% longer to complete tasks compared to the six re-invited course participants, whose ability continued to advance on their fourth effort with a combined 154% earlier completion time compared to try one. Conclusions This study supports the adoption of a structured, extended, regular and spaced-out simulation course or curriculum to cultivate greater skill acquisition and retention amongst surgical trainees, and improve patient care.","Hamid, M.; Siddiqui, Z.; Joiya, S.

"Planting seeds of victory: creating shared meaning while gardening amidst a pandemic","The Victory2020 Garden Community Program was established by faculty members within the University of Florida (UF), Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) in Marion and Columbia County Extension offices. In response to COVID-19, the purpose of the program was to provide online-mediated programs that could be completed at the desired pace of the participants, while promoting a self-reliant, science-based approach to learning about home food production through gardening. Due to food insecurity rates in both Marion (14.4%) and Columbia (15.2%) counties ranking above the statewide average in Florida, an immediate need to provide educational resources on becoming self-sufficient in growing one's own food became increasingly important due to nationwide supply-chain shortages (Feeding America, 2020). 2,548 participants representing 43 states and six countries were provided access to eight learning modules hosted by Canvas, an online tool through UF. Participants were provided a package of free seeds, including corn, squash, cucumber, and cowpea to plant their Victory2020 Garden. A purposeful online community was established by extension agents in Marion and Columbia counties to facilitate quality discussion and growth, culminating in over 225,000 total impressions. The findings of the program revealed that 88% of gardening households began eating more fruits and vegetables while 73% are embracing new food safety techniques in both the garden and kitchen. Primary investigators and co-pi's recommend an implementation of a program timeline to benefit the participants through diverse, online learning options. Continued programming addressing mental health, nutrition, and gardening is recommended across extension programs nationally.","Cannon, E. C.; Mulvaney, C.

"A Prospective Study on Anxiety and Blood Pressure Levels in Hemodialysis Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has currently been one of the leading causes of psychosocial stress throughout the world. We hypothesized that possible changes in anxiety status during the COVID-19 pandemic might affect blood pressure in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: This is an observational cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were applied to 71 prevalent HD patients. Pre-dialysis blood pressure was measured, and the systolic blood pressure measurements of 6 consecutive HD sessions were averaged. All assessments were performed both at the beginning (March) and after the end (June) of the partial lockdown, which was officially instituted by the Government in Turkey. Results: The mean age (+/- SD) was 59.2 +/- 14.8 years and 52% of the patients were female. The STAI-State score was higher in March than in June (44.6 +/- 12.6 vs. 42.3 +/- 11.5, respectively, P =.047), whereas the HADS-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, and STAI-Trait scores were not different. The pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in March than in June (127.9 +/- 20.3 vs. 124.8 +/- 22.8 mmHg, respectively, P =.029). The change in state anxiety score from March to June was remarkable, particularly in patients not taking a beta-blocker (49.3 +/- 9.6 to 43.8 +/- 11.1, P =.001) and in patients younger than the median age of 64 years (48.6 +/- 12.8 to 45.3 +/- 12.5, P =.029). The change in blood pressure level from March to June was found to be significant only in patients not taking a beta-blocker (123.4 +/- 20.2 to 118.2 +/- 20.6 mmHg, P &lt;.001), while it did not reach a statistically significant level in the others. Conclusion: Our findings revealed an association between a higher state of anxiety and a higher blood pressure level in HD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was remarkable particularly in patients not taking a beta-blocker.","Sadioglu, R.

"Qtc interval and electrocardiographic findings of covid-19 patients","Aim: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using the QTc interval and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings to predict 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods: Patients aged 18 or older who visited ED with complaints of fever, cough and shortness of breath were tested using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, were imaged with CCT, underwent ECG, and consequently, diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Results: A total of 276 patients were included in the study. When at least one comorbid disease, reduced oxygen saturation, ECG findings of prolonged QTc interval, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, left bundle branch block and ST segment elevation/depression or severe lung involvement (four or five lobes) on CCT scans were detected, patients had a higher 28-day all-cause mortality rate. Compared to surviving individuals, deceased patients had approximately 4.5-fold increased D-dimer levels, and approximately 5-fold increased C-reactive protein and troponin T levels. Among the deceased patients, 40% had sinus tachycardia. Discussion: Usage of comorbidities, ECG, laboratory tests and CCT together is useful for predicting 28-day all-cause mortality rate in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Ay, M.

"Is it possible that antidepressants protect against covid-19?","Aim: The neuroinflammatory hypothesis suggests that proinflammatory cytokines or the immune system may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of depression. COVID-19 affects older people the most because their immune systems are weakened. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of using antidepressant use on mortality in patients infected with COVID-19. Material and Methods: Our study was developed as a retrospective examination of unique central patient records. In our study, the diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnostics (U07.3) was between the ICD-10 classification (U07.3) and the diagnosis of depressive emotional state disorders (F31, F32, F33, F34) and patients with the diagnosis of COVID 19 confirmed by the test result were included. Results: Considering the relationship between the use of antidepressants and mortality in COVID-19 patients, it was seen that the mortality rate was significantly lower in those using antidepressants (p &lt;0.05). The presence of chronic disease was found to be significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19. The mortality rates of patients with chronic diseases were found to be higher (p &lt;0.01). Discussion: In our study, we found that antidepressants did not have any superiority over each other in terms of mortality in COVID-19 patients.However, when all anti depressants were evaluated in our study, we observed that drug use had a positive effect on statistically significant mortality (p &lt;0.05).

"Correlates of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and suicidal ideas in COVID-associated mucormycosis patients and the effects of treatment","Aim: The aim was to study the correlates of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and suicidal ideas in patients of COVID-associated mucormycosis (CAM) and effects of treatment. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, analytical study was performed in a tertiary care center in Western Maharashtra. By purposive sampling, 34 patients of CAM were included in the study with their informed consent and after obtaining ethical clearance. A self-made questionnaire to include demographic and clinical details was filled. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) were applied after initial diagnosis. The HADS, RSES, and SIDAS were reapplied after their operative treatment. Results: A significant reduction in anxiety and depression scores postoperatively was seen. No significant difference was found in self-esteem or suicidal ideas postoperatively in the study population. However, patients who underwent orbital exenteration showed a significant reduction in level of self-esteem with anxiety and depression postoperatively. No specific correlation was found between the computed tomography score, family history, intensive care unit admission, or orbital exenteration with anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and suicidal ideas. Conclusion: Levels of anxiety and depression in patients of CAM reduced significantly after treatment, but self-esteem worsened in males more than females owing to disfigurement. There is a need of psychological counseling in patients of mucormycosis undergoing a debilitating surgery both pre- and postoperatively for a better outcome and recovery.","Ahuja, Amod, Samudra, Madhura, Prasad, Shashi, Chaudhury, Suprakash, Bora, Shivangi, Singh, Varsha, Dhore, Nilay","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-6748.328863","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):75-82, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):75-82, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21479,""
"COVID-19 pandemic, mental health care, and the UK","The unprecedented SARS-2 COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and societies worldwide. The impact of the illness does not only directly relate to poor health on infection but also social and political determinants of health. As such, the secondary effects of the pandemic have been profound. Mental health and well-being have been one such area of concern, with the causal links thought to occur in three ways. First: the impact on general population, particularly vulnerable groups such as BAME individuals;Second: the impact on people with pre-existing psychiatric disorders;Third: mental health of COVID patients and those who have recovered and their careers. There are lessons to be learnt from previous pandemics and the impact on mental health. There are high levels of anxiety, depression, substance use (particularly alcohol), posttraumatic stress symptoms, and survivor guilt. Within this context, there is a need to consider the differential impact on underprivileged populations. Vulnerable groups include women, children, elderly, minority racial and ethnic groups, LGBT + individuals and the poor. It is noted that these classifications are met with challenges related to definition, and there is significant heterogeneity within the groups and the focus on race, gender, and poverty must be seen through an intersectional lens.","Bhugra, Dinesh, Molodynski, Andrew, Gnanapragasam, Sam","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-6748.328862","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):5-9, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):5-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21480,""

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers","The COVID-19 pandemic is a healthcare crisis that has led to unprecedented impact on healthcare services. At the heart of the unparalleled crisis, doctors face several challenges in treating patients with COVID-19. The psychological burden and overall wellness of healthcare workers (HCWs) have received heightened awareness, with research continuing to show high rates of burnout, psychological stress, and suicide. Detrimental effects include high rates of infection and death, excessive financial hardships, stress related to known and particularly unknown information, and fear of uncertainty regarding continued impact. Some researchers focused specifically on COVID-19's impact on HCW sleep. Anxiety and stress were significantly increased, leading to negative impacts on both self-efficacy and sleep. Stress is an important factor in drug use. Efforts should be made to explore the factors that are associated with psychological distress, which may lead to symptoms of anxiety, depression, or provoke suicidal ideation, and efforts should be made to control the factors that are modifiable. There needs to be more awareness among doctors and further long-term studies focusing on their mental health as adverse mental health conditions will further affect them as the disease advances.","Gupta, Nishtha, Dhamija, Sana, Patil, Jaideep, Chaudhari, Bhushan","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-6748.328830","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):282-284, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):282-284, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21482,""

"Mental health impact of COVID-19 among health-care workers: An exposure-based cross-sectional study","Background: Health-care workers (HCWs) in COVID-19 pandemic have faced the major impact in providing care to infected persons. Most of the studies on mental health impact among HCW have not incorporated paramedical staff. Furthermore, they have not compared psychological morbidity among HCW on the basis of high COVID exposure (HCE) and low COVID exposure (LCE). To address the above gap, this study aimed at evaluating mental health impact among HCW and its associated risk factors. Materials and Methods: Consecutive 200 HCWs each in the HCE and LCE groups (between the age group of 18 and 60 years) were enrolled from two tertiary care hospitals providing COVID-19 treatment from August 1, 2020. After collection of sociodemographic data, participants were administered Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale. Results: The difference in stress, depression, and anxiety symptom scores between the HCE and LCE groups was not statistically significant. Multiple regression analysis revealed that female sex was associated with higher scores in all the three domains. The effect remained significant even after adjusting for effect of other risk factors. Conclusion: HCE or LCE was associated with similar impact in terms of stress, depression, and anxiety among HCWs. Female HCWs had a higher prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics had a similar prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety when odds were adjusted.","Chauhan, V.; Chatterjee, Kaushik, Yadav, Arun, Srivastava, Kalpana, Prakash, Jyoti, Yadav, Prateek, Dangi, Ankit","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-6748.328791","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):63-68, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):63-68, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21484,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of health-care workers in a tertiary care teaching and dedicated COVID-19 hospital","Aim: We aimed to assess the consequences of dealing with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period on the mental state of health-care workers. Materials and Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 353 participants using a self-made questionnaire comparing the prevalence of low mood, apprehension, tension, and coping skills used and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. The data were analyzed to compare the mental health of male and female doctors. To identify predictors of mental health outcomes, a multivariate logistic regression was carried out. Results: Both men and women were almost equally affected in terms of developing features of low mood, with easy physical and mental exhaustion. While the feeling of being isolated and irritability was slightly higher in females, both sexes were equally affected by the media. It was observed that the prevalence of smoking (tobacco/marijuana, etc.) had increased in both with slightly higher percentage in males as compared to females while there was a considerable increase in caffeine and alcohol consumption in males. The sleeping pattern and appetite were equally affected in both sexes. The sexual drive was also altered in both male and female residents, but the change was considerably more in males. The significant predictors of anxiety were age, depression, mental exhaustion, burden of increased quantity of work, and feeling of having no choice but to work due to obligation. Conclusion: Both male and female doctors working during the COVID-19 pandemic developed anxiety and depression. While substance use and altered sexual drive were more in males, exhaustion and stress were more in females.","Gupta, Nishtha, Luthra, Avinav, Shailaja, B.; Chaudhury, Suprakash, Saldanha, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-6748.328790","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):56-62, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):56-62, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21485,""
"Psychological aspect of common people during lockdown","Background: Lockdown was implemented to restrict the transmission of COVID-19. This brought upon many unforeseen hurdles, including mental health problems. Aim: The aim of the study is to assess the impact of lockdown on mental health. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using Google Form, which the participants were requested to complete online. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information and general health questionnaire (GHQ)-12, which was used to screen for mental health. Results: A total of 343 participants took part in the study in which 113 participants (32.9%) were having GHQ score of less than or equal to 12. The study showed that people aged less than 41 years were able to concentrate more during lockdown (75.6%) as compared to people aged more than 41 years (65%). Younger participants who were less than 41 years reported sleep disorders associated with late-night entertainment and TV viewing (24.5%). Many experienced stress during lockdown, but it was more in people over 60 years (63.7%). Conclusions: An appreciable proportion of the participants faced stress during lockdown. Elderly people were more affected. Sleeping disorders were associated with late-night entertainment and TV viewing in younger people.","Chaklader, Biswajit, Srivastava, Kajal, Rathod, Hetal, Banerjee, Amitav","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-6748.328789","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):52-55, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(3):52-55, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21486,""
"Efficacy of psychological intervention in patients with post-COVID-19 anxiety","Background: Individuals who suffered from COVID-19 remain stressed and worried about anxiety issues for significant changes in daily living activities, causing strong emotional distress. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of psychological intervention in patients with post-COVID-19 anxiety. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients recovered from COVID-19 were selected for the study of age group 20â€“45 years of both the sexes. Initially, sociodemographic data sheet was filled, and after that, Mental Health Inventory (MHI) was administered. The patients who scored less on MHI were taken for the study, and psychoeducation, relaxation exercises, and activity scheduling were given to them. The goal of intervention was to prepare the patients to learn, interpret, and react to physical and psychological symptoms related after recovering from COVID-19 infection. The intervention was done for 30 min twice a week for 1 month, after that again postassessment was done to see the efficacy of psychological intervention. Results: Result reveals a significant improvement in mental health-related issues after psychological intervention as assessed by the MHI.

"E-Therapy Critical Success Factors: The Immediate Impact of COVID-19","The overall impact of COVID-19 removed the traditional barriers to e-therapy, creating a seismic shift in attitudes and incentives that allowed therapists to apply virtual meeting technologies in service to their patients mental health needs. A post-COVID-19 Delphi study, using the same study design conducted in 2011, found that Internet communication technologies used by patients and therapists, the implementation of secure applications and procedures, and the removal of legal obstacles allowed e-therapy to become an effective treatment option and opened doors to treat more patients. Therapists utilized information technology to enhance patient interactions in remote settings, allowing for more empathy and improved service quality than reported in past studies. A comparison of the findings between the studies conducted in 2020 and 2011 indicates a decline of information system management oversight and suggests that organizational leadership was in tune with common issues facing therapists delivering services under trying circumstances. E-therapy works, but a return to pre-COVID-19 legal restrictions, institutional hurdles, organizational impediments, and technological costs may limit future opportunities to implement and use mobile technologies to provide better treatment for patients.","Hackbarth, Gary, Cata, Teuta","https://doi.org/10.2979/eservicej.13.1.01","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: E - Service Journal; 13(1):1-29,67-68, 2021.; Publication details: E - Service Journal; 13(1):1-29,67-68, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21491,""
"The economics of patient safety part IV: safety in the workplace: occupational safety as the bedrock of resilient health systems","Patient harm is the 14th leading cause of the global burden of disease;available evidence suggests that 15% of hospital expenditure and activity in OECD countries can be attributed to treating safety failures. Adverse events occur in about one in ten hospital admissions, and it is estimated that every adult in the United States will experience a diagnostic error at least once during their lifetime. In addition to patient harm, health care settings can be unsafe places for health workers, who experience a number of harms, including exposure to infectious disease, physical harm (accidents, injury, and violence), and psychological harm (burn out, depression). The recent COVID-19 crisis has amplified the importance of ensuring that the care that is provided is safe- for patients and health workers alike. The COVID-19 crisis has brought renewed attention to the occupational hazards of health workers, as countries have faced staffing shortages, lack of appropriate training, and shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Numerous countries have now labelled COVID-19 as an occupational disease. In Italy, which faced one of the most acute outbreaks, as much as 10% of all COVID infections were those of health workers. For many patient safety events, there are second victims, health workers who are involved in adverse events who experience negative personal and professional repercussions. Research in the US have found that health workers who experience a highimpact patient event (i.e. an adverse patient safety event) are more likely to leave their job, creating high turnover costs for hospitals and other health settings. The COVID-19 situation is emphasizing the need for safety at the work place, whilst at the same time requiring more flexibility in the size and nature of the health care workforce. A flexible workforce, with appropriate worker protections, is required to address the need for upscaling and downscaling of specific health care services such as ICU capacity, safety policies in nursing homes with COVID-19 cases, and capacity for tracking of personal contacts by municipal public health offices. However, to date, analysis of the economic impact of patient safety has largely excluded the costs of safety issues that affect health workers, which adversely affect staff leave, turnover, and productivity. Salaries for health care staff are one of the top cost inputs of health across reporting OECD countries. Improving safety not only improves patient outcomes, but it also improves the bottom line for health systems, both by reducing costs spent on treating adverse events and by decreasing staff costs associated with them. In particular, the current pandemic has highlighted the need for strong and resilient safety governance beyond the hospital, and the importance of ensuring safe working environments for workers in the long-term care and ambulatory care settings with continuous investment in staff competences, safety and numbers. The safety of both patients and health workers should be protected through appropriate mechanisms to ensure the safety of protective equipment and sufficient supplies, appropriate staffing levels, training and support at the workplace. These governance mechanisms will become even more relevant when policy makers face trade-offs between health, safety and economic concerns.","Bienassisi, K. de, Slawomirskii, L.; Klazingai, N.

"System-wide depression screening implementation in ambulatory oncology care: Key strategies and early implementation outcomes","Background: Oncology Care Model (OCM) requires cancer programs to provide depression screening during each care episode to meet the quality measure benchmark of 85% screening rate. This quality improvement (QI) project aims to assess 1) key strategies to integrate systemwide depression screening into routine cancer care, and 2) early outcomes of depression screening implementation. Methods: A mixed method study design was used to assess strategies to implement routine depression screening in a southeast comprehensive cancer center between July 2019 and December 2020. Two top high-volume hematological oncology clinics that covers sixty percent of ambulatory care participated in the depression screening implementation. Data were collected using 1) depression screening completion rate during OCM performance periods, 2) needs assessment to identify barriers and facilitators of implementation, and 3) semi-structured interviews to assess staff and provider feedback on sustainable implementation strategies. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis for quantitative outcomes and thematic analysis for qualitative outcomes. Results: A total of 64 hematological oncology providers (n = 22) and staff (n = 42) participated in the depression screening implementation training during three OCM performance periods. Depression screening rate of total ambulatory oncology care increased from 12% (OCM-PR 5, Jul-Dec 19), to 51% (OCM-PR 6, Jan-Jun 20) to 77% (OCM-PR 7, Jul-Dec 20) after the two top-volume clinics integrated depression screening into clinic intake process. Themes emerged from needs assessment revealed multi-level implementation strategies including 1) patient education and psycho-oncological care, 2) staff training and practice modification, 3) provider education & interdisciplinary Care, 4) leadership, administration, and staffing support, and 5) clinical informatics collaboration to build the infrastructure for integrating depression screen with clinic intake in the electronic medical record (EMR). Feedback from staff and provider interviews indicated high receptiveness and buy-in, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic to improve timely identification and triage of patients with depressive symptoms across all oncology care services. Conclusions: Depression screening is a key component of quality comprehensive cancer care that aims to provide timely identification and triage of cancer patients needing follow-up psychosocial care. Early implementation outcomes revealed significant improvement in depression screening completion rate after two clinics adopted depression screening into intake process. Further investigation is needed to refine system-wide implementation strategies across all ambulatory oncology sites and to assess long-term implementation outcomes meet the psychosocial care needs of cancer patients.","Huang, C.

"Feasibility of a child life specialist program for oncology patients with minor children at home: Demand and implementation","Background: Up to 24% of adult oncology patients have minor children at home. Children may experience emotional problems, somatic complaints, social isolation, depression, and post-traumatic stress as a result. Typical support networks often fail to meet the needs of these families. To address this gap, an innovative Child Life Specialist (CLS) program for patients with minor children at home was offered at a tertiary oncology center. Methods: To understand the feasibility of this program, we examined the demand for and implementation of the CLS program over its initial 10 months. Demand was characterized using administrative data (referred patient/family demographics, referral details, and disease/treatment characteristics). Implementation was described through encounter data (audience, type of visit, interventions provided, time for preparation, and time of direct interaction for each encounter). Results: The program received 100 referrals, 93 of whom accessed the program. Patients were most often female (66%) with a median age of 45 years (range: 19 to 72). 81% were parents of minor children, 10% grandparents, and 9% other. Families predominantly had multiple children (98%), most commonly school-aged (ages 5-9, 39%;10-14, 37%). 53% of families had two birth parents co-parenting in the same household;the remainder had alternate parent/living scenarios. Most referrals came from social work (57%). Median time from diagnosis to referral was 79 days (range: 9d-6.5y). Breast cancer (26%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by gastrointestinal (19%) and hematologic (16%). Cancer phase at referral was defined as at new diagnosis (within 30d, 18%), undergoing treatment with curative intent (20%), undergoing treatment with palliative intent (39%), at end of life (within 30d, 16%) and after death/bereavement (5%). 1 patient (1%) did not have cancer. The CLS recorded 257 unique encounters. 55% of encounters included patients, 40% non-patient parents, 21% children, and 21% others. 75% were individual encounters, while 25% were group encounters. 95% of encounters that included children also included an adult. Phone calls were the most frequent encounter type (43%), but hospital visits consumed the largest proportion of recorded CLS time (38%). Mean encounter time (all visit types) included 20min for preparation and 51min of direct interaction. CLS interventions included: Guidance on talking with children (67% of encounters), providing resources (37%), diagnostic teaching (21%), end-of-life support (18%), discussing change in status (10%), grief (8%), and emotional expression (4%). Conclusions: This study characterized the demand for this program and described its implementation over the pilot period. This period occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, which dramatically altered healthcare and family visitation, likely influencing the results of this study.","Lysecki, D.; Bainbridge, D.; Akitt, T.; Georgiou, G.; Meyer, R.

"Increased suicidal ideation in the COVID-19 pandemic: an employee cohort in Japan","ObjectivesThis study investigated the change in suicidal ideation and its risk factors among employees. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted, starting with the baseline online survey in March 2020 (T1), followed by May (T2), and August (T3). The change in suicidal ideation from T2 to T3 and relevant factors associated with suicidal ideation at T3 were examined. Suicidal ideation significantly increased between May and August 2020 among females, younger (under 39 years old), highly educated population, and those without pre-existing mental health conditions. Factors significantly associated with suicidal ideation were younger age, suicidal ideation at T2, and with pre-existing mental health conditions. Loneliness at T2 showed a significant association with suicidal ideation, if adjusting those without pre-existing mental health conditions.

"Newly enacted mental health law in Bangladesh","Mental health problems are almost ignored in Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The lack of overall health literacy and human resources due to an ineffectively updated legal and regulatory framework, coupled with very limited but misused budget allocation, are some of the factors responsible for this. The country's Constitution recognises the importance of public health and stipulates the improvement of public health as an important primary duty of the state. Nevertheless, it is often compromised or neglected in favour of other socioeconomic development priorities. The Lunacy Act 1912 was recently repealed and substituted by the Mental Health Act 2018 to fill in various gaps in mental health law. This is a welcome development, but there remain limitations and scope for further improvement. We highlight some important provisions of this newly enacted law, identify some limitations and propose some issues for consideration in future policy reform.","Karim, Mohammad Ershadul, Shaikh, Sabuj","https://doi.org/10.1192/bji.2021.1","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych International; 18(4):85-87, 2021.; Publication details: BJPsych International; 18(4):85-87, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21497,""
"Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder post-COVID-19: a case presentation","BackgroundSince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant changes that impacted because of it, people around the world have been left dealing with its consequencesâ€”fear of becoming ill and dying, fear of losing loved ones, uncertainty about the future, and imposed social isolationâ€”several elements which could lead to psychological consequences. Moreover, as suggested by recent evidence, the virus acts as a factor in causing psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder.Case presentationHere, we report a case of a patient with new-onset OCD after his recovery from the coronavirus disease, which presented in the form of recurrent and persistent intrusive thoughts and doubts which responded to medication.ConclusionsThis case shows the potential of COVID-19-associated inflammatory triggers to precipitate or induce obsessiveâ€“compulsive symptoms.

"A year with the fear of COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis patients: Examination of depression, sleep quality and quality of life before and after the pandemic","Introduction: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the whole world, on individuals with MS is not clear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate depression, sleep, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors. Methods: Eighty-nine MS patients and 262 healthy control (HC) individuals were included in this study. The data of the study were collected between 15-30 December 2020. To collect data were used patient/person information form, COVID-19 Fear Scale (FCV-19S), Worry and Anxiety Questionnaire (WAQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MS Quality of Life Scale (MSQoL-54). Results: It was determined that the mean of the patients was 41.08 (Â± 10.2), 62% of them were female. The mean of EDSS and duration of disease were 1.33 (Â± 1.6) and 7.73 (Â± 6.1), respectively. It was determined that patients and control groups were mostly affected socially (MS 79.8% vs HC 89.3%) and psychologically (61.8% MS vs HC 51.9%), respectively, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic period, 19% of the patients reported an increase in the frequency of attacks. During the pandemic period it was found that sleep quality deteriorated (p &lt;0.05), but there was no significant change in depression and quality of life total scores (p&gt; 0.05). In addition, significant improvements were observed in some sub-dimensions of quality of life. According to regression analysis, anxiety, depression, and sleep problems negatively affected the quality of life (p&lt;0.001), while fear of coronavirus had no significant effect (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions: MS patients were psychosocially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and their sleep quality deteriorated significantly compared to before. Nevertheless, there was no significant change in the depression and quality of life of the patients, and even significant improvements were observed in some subdimensions of the quality of life.","Yeni, K.; Tulek, Z.; Terzi, M.","https://doi.org/10.1177/13524585211044667","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis Journal; 27(2 SUPPL):192, 2021.; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis Journal; 27(2 SUPPL):192, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21499,""

In Singapore, the structural context of hire amplifies conditions of servitude, indebtedness, and subalternity that have implications for mental health. This study documents mental health narratives by migrant domestic workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, registering how mental health is negotiated amid dissension in the performance of precarious labor. While functional employment structures enabled and empowered well-being, dysfunctional structures disrupted mental health meanings, creating layers of constant contention for domestic workers to broker, limiting opportunities for mental health and well-being.

"The effect of the teachers' experience in online education during the pandemic on their views of strengths and weaknesses of e-learning (SU case)","E-learning has never been so proliferated as it was and still is at a time of global Covid-19 pandemic when higher education institutions globally were forced to switch to fully online education. The strengths and weakness of e-learning have long been discussed in the literature. Most of the claimed strengths depend on an appropriate pedagogy approach with a combination of relevant technologies. At the same time the limitations are mainly associated with the technological issues arising in the context of e-learning. Teachers' perspectives on the benefits and limitations of e-learning are seriously affected by a number of factors, such as their digital competences and experience in e-learning. The study of these factors and their effect on teachers' perspectives could support the increase of the objectivity of teachers' evaluation and attitudes towards e-learning in general. Thus this research aimed to identify the impact of experience of Sofia University (SU) academic staff in forced introduction of online education on their views and perspectives about e-learning and its strengths and limitations in particular. The research method was an online survey, conducted at the end of the academic 2019/2020 with 383 teachers from all 16 SU faculties. The paper focused on three main aspects - 1) teachers' experience in online education before and during pandemic;2) teachers' views on strengths and weaknesses of e-learning;and 3) the impact of their experience on their views. Findings from data analysis revealed the existence of statistical dependencies between the experience in e-learning and the digital competencies of teachers before the pandemic, on the one hand, and different aspects of the online teaching during the pandemic, such as: the choice of e-learning environment;the ratio of synchronous / asynchronous forms of online learning;the frequency and variety of using e-resources in teaching and in supporting students' self-preparation;the tools and forms of e-assessment, on the other hand. It appeared that far more negative attitudes are formed in inexperienced teachers, which in turn has affected their assessments of benefits and limitations that quality e-learning provides for students - they did not recognize the strengths of e-learning proven in theory and practice and exaggerated its negative aspects. Thus conclusions imposed that the forced introduction of online education has enriched the experience of teachers in this form of education, but also has discredited its quality from their perspective.

"â€˜Wellness wednesdayâ€™ â€“ the little things that make a big difference","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on mental health (Pierce, Hope, Ford, et al., 2020;Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 2020). Workplace challenges like home-working, furlough, shielding, self-isolating and concerns about safety, meant that everybody was affected by the circumstances (Chandola, Kumari, Booker C, et al., 2020;White & Van Der Boor, 2020). Early on, feelings of isolation, anxiety, worry, grief, uncertainty and stress were becoming the norm. This led to a recognition that paying attention to mental health and wellbeing was as important as the direct health consequences of the virus.AimA Wellbeing Survey was conducted in May 2020. In response to the feedback, and as part of a wider plan to support physical and mental wellbeing, we developed the following objectives:To keep in touch with staff regularly.To mitigate feelings of isolation and disengagement.To provide advice on how to look after oneself during challenging times.MethodA â€˜Wellness Wednesdayâ€™ email was identified as a way of raising awareness of wellbeing. Our staff receive a weekly email about mental health and wellbeing-related subjects, including resilience, coping with change and uncertainty, and anxiety management. Online talks, webinars and events are also shared, along with raising awareness about diversity and inclusion. The email is written in a relaxed and upbeat tone to facilitate connections with staff.ResultsA survey reflected that 91% of staff working from home, and 92% of staff working at the hospice valued email as the most useful form of communication. Feedback received about our â€˜Wellness Wednesdayâ€™ emails reflects that staff find the support valuable and useful during these challenging times: â€˜Thank you, thatâ€™s exactly what I needed to hear today!â€™ConclusionsOur â€˜Wellness Wednesdayâ€™ email is an example of how small things can have a significant impact. We have identified this email as contributing to positive levels of staff engagement and we plan to continue to support our staff in this way going forward.","Carreja, Natalia, Garforth, Karen","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.202","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A76, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A76, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21503,""
"How to ensure that those who deliver care are themselves well looked after- thrive or survive!","BackgroundA pilot scheme was delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic to support staff at a local hospital to cope with the unprecedented traumatic situation. This highlighted shortfalls and the need to promote systemic change in wellbeing provision, to encourage a more robust and accessible programme of support for healthcare professionals in multi-disciplinary organisations working with grief, loss, and trauma pre/post bereavement.AimsTo develop multidisciplinary tailor-made support for healthcare professionals, embracing cultural diversity, self-sustaining resilience, and empowerment. This support will incorporate various approaches and will be developed to meet presenting needs. It will aim to improve communication and develop a greater understanding between staff teams and organisations, encouraging working in partnership. It will promote transparency and openness as opportunities for learning and improvement rather than blame and punishment. It will lessen work-related stress and anxiety, create a happier and more compassionate environment, which in turn will improve quality of care.MethodsReview of literature. Feedback analysis. Internal consultation via multidisciplinary steering group meetings. Liaise with wellbeing department to work in collaboration. Consultation with relevant local organisations. Secure premises.

"A joint agency approach to promoting wellbeing and resilience in care home staff","A regular multi-agency meeting â€˜The Ethical Task Force Groupâ€™ was created in response to COVID-19 pandemic. It was recognised that staff, managers and owners of care homes were experiencing unique challenges during the pandemic. The task force comprised the Isle of Wight council, the Isle of Wight-Care Partnership and Mountbatten Hospice. The group met weekly to discuss concerns and issues relevant to all parties in order to respond to the needs of care home staff.One main concern raised was the emotional impact the pandemic was having on care home staff. Many homes lost multiple residents in a short space of time. Often they had known their residents for many years and described their bereavement as the same as losing a family member. They were unable to acknowledge the death in the usual way and therefore were left coping with the ongoing stress of caring for their residents, whilst unable to access their usual support networks and process their bereavement. Both owners and managers of care homes were keen to access strategies and services to support their staff. In the early stages of the pandemic there was a plethora of information outlining ways of managing the emotional impact of the pandemic. However, the information was not reaching the staff in an accessible way.To address this we developed a simple guide to resilience and wellbeing for all staff. This joint project outlined different levels of support from informal peer led support and individual strategies, to formal referrals to bereavement or mental health services.The guide received a national award from Skills for Care as an example of best practice. Following on from this work both Southampton CCG and West Hampshire CCG asked for the same guide to be sent to all care homes in Southampton city and West Hampshire.","Hazeldine, Jane","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.195","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A73-A74, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A73-A74, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21505,""
"Bereavement services during a pandemic;an adapted model of care","St Helena Hospice bereavement services provides therapeutic support to adults, irrespective of cause of death, and sits within a catchment that has approximately 360,000 individuals across North and Mid Essex. On average the service supports approximately 255 bereaved service users at any one time. The majority of these clients have no prior affiliation with the hospice and have frequently been bereaved in traumatic circumstances and may also have pre-existing mental health conditions.The bereavement service adapted its model of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, from a â€˜face-to-faceâ€™ counselling and support service to a virtual one. The entire team moved â€˜out of the officeâ€™ and began a new routine of home working, with just 36 hoursâ€™ notice, which continued for 15 months (to date).Counsellors, support workers and support volunteers offered video or telephone consultation to all clients in service and found that the vast majority opted for telephone support instead of video consultation. In the first nine months of home working, as well as providing support to clients already referred, the team reached out to all care homes and GP surgeries in the vicinity and offered emotional support to staff, service users and families. In total, the service supported 98 care homes to manage the devastating impact of COVID-19 deaths of residents and staff.Service waiting lists grew in the final six months of the pandemic as referral numbers increased. To manage this, the service reduced the length of support sessions from 50 minutes to 30 minutes and staff were asked to increase their caseloads to ensure that we offered support to as many individuals as possible. The service is working to seek funding via external sources, but also working positively with commissioners to recognise the service need locally.","Blanking, Lorraine","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.115","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A44, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A44, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21506,""
"Growing connections","BackgroundIn March 2020, due to COVID-19 the Social and Therapeutic Horticulture (STH) group in day services had to close. The hospice occupational therapist (OT) wanted to support the group to stay connected to nature and each other, so decided to introduce an interactive monthly newsletter.AimsTo encourage and support patients and volunteers to connect with nature (and each other) to support their mental health and sense of wellbeing through a period of shielding and isolation.ApproachApril 2020 â€“ monthly newsletters were posted to patients and volunteers.June 2021 â€“ reviewed and agreed plans to relaunch the STH face-to-face groups (following the social distancing and PPE requirements).August 2021 â€“ face-to-face â€˜wellbeing through natureâ€™ sessions to start and newsletters to continue.Results32 people have accessed the monthly newsletter, whereas the face-to-face session only had six per session (on average). It has reached patients who had been unable to attend sessions at the centre due to logistics and care needs. It has enabled new patients to connect and benefit. It has kept people connected as they shared their news and stories together in the â€˜grapevineâ€™ section of the newsletter. The OT has inspired good practice for other health professionals.ConclusionThe newsletter has proven to be a fantastic medium for patients and volunteers to stay connected to the hospice and their peers through the pandemic. It has gathered a great deal of positive feedback from patients and families/carers alike. It has enabled the service to demonstrate that even through the pandemic we have been able to keep to our hospice core values. The newsletter will continue post COVID-19. It has enabled our patients to connect in a virtual way. We now look forward to restarting our face-to-face STH sessions in our day service.","Heaps, Lucy","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.77","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A30, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21507,""
"Online delivery of mindfulness and meditation psychological support group","BackgroundSocial connectedness is a strong predictor of mental health (Saeri, Cruwys, Barlow, et al., 2018), yet the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing government-ordered lockdowns forced the UK population to limit their social contact. This presented a challenge to the provision of in-person psychological services to the clinically vulnerable patients of the Health and Wellbeing Centre at North London Hospice. Online social contact has been associated with positive psychological outcomes (Grieve, Indian, Witteveen, et al., 2013) and online mindfulness-based interventions have shown to reduce psychological distress (Ma, She, Siu, et al., 2018). After a number of patients reported a willingness to try an online group, we trialled a six-week online Mindfulness and Meditation group.Aim(s)To discuss the principles of mindfulness and how it can benefit those living with life-limiting illnesses;deliver tangible experience of mindfulness practice;and provide social connectedness to patients with symptoms of anxiety shielding in their homes.MethodsNovember - December 2020: course scoping and planning;December 2020 - January 2021: patient recruitment;27 January - 3 March 2021: course delivered via presentation slides on Zoom and weekly homework tasks;March - April 2021: evaluation and service user feedback. Outcome measures: number of attendees, service user feedback.ResultsAttendee numbers: 11 patients signed up with between five and eight attending each session. Six patients provided feedback: 100% reported the course helped them a) feel less stressed and overwhelmed, b) change the way they view their thoughts, and c) change their behaviours. 83% were either â€˜satisfiedâ€™ or â€˜very satisfiedâ€™ with the course.ConclusionsThe online Mindfulness and Meditation group had good and regular attendance, and service users indicated that it contributed to positive changes in their mental health. The course will run online again in July 2021, this time with pre- and post-questionnaires to assess the reduction in symptoms of anxiety more robustly.","Naylor, Abigail","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.76","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A29-A30, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A29-A30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21508,""
"â€˜Maintaining emotional bonds during Covid-19 pandemicâ€™","BackgroundVisiting restrictions have been challenging, fewer interactions increase anxiety and isolation (Mansfield, Mathur, Tazare, et al., 2021). Finding ways to maintain emotional bonds has been crucial to hospice care (Aghaei, Vanaki, Mohammadi, 2020;Mental Health Safety Improvement Team, [Royal College of Psychiatrists]) to help maintain connections (Azoulay, Kentish-Barnes, 2020). Using recordable cards and albums has had a positive impact on our service users, their family and on hospice staff.AimsTo maintain emotional connections between those receiving hospice care and their family given the impact of COVID-19. To elucidate the experiences of those using recordable cards and albums, those who received them and hospice staff who supported their use.MethodsIn 2018/19 the Hospice Admiral Nurse (HAN) started the use of recordable albums as part of life story work. When the pandemic hit the hospice introduced recordable cards and provided them free for all service users using grant funding and the HAN continued to support the community in their use, finding carers whose loved one had transitioned into a care home particularly benefitted. An evaluation form was attached to each card or album given out, with a good return rate.ResultsPeople receiving inpatient hospice care preferred the recordable cards due to fatigue (age range 57-89). Evaluation received 5 out of 5 rating -â€˜Comfortingâ€™, â€˜Meaningfulâ€™ and â€˜Worthwhileâ€™ were the most used words â€“with some family members crying with joy at receiving a recorded card. Albums were mostly used in the community and given a 5 rating;carers described the comfort of sending their album into the care home which not only maintained an emotional connection but also allowed staff to get to know the person quickly.ConclusionsEvaluations demonstrated the emotional impact using recordable cards and albums had on hospice service users and their family. Hospice staff found being alongside, supporting people recording messages improved their own mental wellbeing and job satisfaction.","Veigas, Debby, Wild, M.

"Developing a â€˜keep connectedâ€™ helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impact on how services, such as the hospice social programme and bereavement groups, were able to operate;many were either suspended or had to move to an online model. Understandably this affected individuals who relied on that social contact to manage and cope with their well-being and grief. In recognition of this Mountbatten created a helpline for all individuals living on the Isle of Wight affected by isolation, loneliness and bereavement. The 24/7 â€˜Keep Connected Helplineâ€™ was developed in March 2020 and was supported by both staff and volunteers. Mountbatten recruited volunteers with the willingness and skills to manage the helpline. All volunteers received comprehensive training to respond to sometimes very complex calls. They received regular support and supervision from trained staff.The numbers of calls received were low but these calls were often complex. It was clear that some individuals with mental health needs were finding it hard to manage in the lockdown, and many bereaved individuals were struggling to cope with their grief in the absence of their usual peer and social network. One call was received on a bank holiday from a couple who were expressing suicidal thoughts and intentions. The volunteer was able to listen to their distress, contact the local crisis team and ensure they had access to the appropriate services to help them cope with their mental health needs. Another caller rang to talk through their experience of loss and grief following the death of a family member. They didnâ€™t have a close support network and needed a listening ear to help with their grief.ImpactItâ€™s clear the helpline provided a vital service during very stressful times for many needing a listening ear at any time of day or night. The helpline will remain part of Mountbattenâ€™s clinical services.","Hazeldine, Jane","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.73","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A28-A29, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A28-A29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21510,""
"Supporting teachers to help children affected by Covid-19 and bereavement","BackgroundDuring the pandemic, the hospice social workers recognised that schools were supporting children affected by COVID-19. With intense media coverage about the virus and daily reporting of death tolls, the public were talking about death more openly. The team recognised that â€˜children need adults to help them understand whatâ€™s going on, to help them talk about what frightens them and to help reassure themâ€™ (The Irish Childhood Bereavement Network, 2020).AimsSupporting children and families before and following bereavement is part of the hospice social work role. During lockdown the team supported children struggling with social isolation, missing their peers, anxiety about exams, fears for their future, and concerns for loved ones. Focus on ideas to help teachers support children in school but also whilst schools were closed felt important.MethodsThe team consulted with other bereavement services, and developed three virtual workshops providing guidance on supporting children through COVID-19. The aim was to encourage schools to support pupils, during and after lockdown, and help teachers recognise the need for additional support and how to refer into bereavement services. Over 250 school and nursery staff attended the online workshops.ResultsAttendees reported that the training informed their practice through:Use of direct, compassionate language for dealing with death/and worries about death.Strategies to help children remember loved ones.Listening and giving children time, to make them feel safe.Need good communication lines with parents.The first session was recorded and added to the hospice website, information could be accessed at a later date.ConclusionsThe full impact of COVID-19 on children and young peopleâ€™s mental health is yet to be fully understood. Work is ongoing to support schools to develop staff skills in supporting grieving children. Also, to implement bereavement policies and school bereavement champions.","Popplestone-Helm, Sarah, Sparks, Rebecka, Schwab, Andy, Woodall, Pam, Macleod, Laura","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.49","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A20, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A20, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21511,""
"A collaborative initiative to provide support to a Mental Health Unit during a COVID-19 outbreak","BackgroundIn January 2021 there was an outbreak of COVID-19 at a local mental health unit. This adult unit with 67 beds cared for multiple psychiatric conditions. The appropriate transfer to the acute hospital of ill patients and support for the psychiatric team in managing those patients not for escalation was required.AimsTo promote equality of access for psychiatric inpatients who became ill with COVID-19 to appropriate management including from acute medicine and from palliative care.Readily available palliative care support to medical and psychiatric teams regarding symptom control.To enable decisions to be made re appropriately not escalating care to the acute hospital with the security of timely access to palliative care support.MethodsEstablishment of a virtual ward round (VWR) at a set time daily attended by the psychiatric team, an Acute medical consultant and consultant or SpR in palliative care. Inclusion criteria were agreed for which patients to bring to the VWR. A treatment escalation plan was discussed for each patient.ResultsVWR ran daily for three weeks and alternate days for a further two weeks. Twenty-five patients aged 20-80 years were referred to the VWR with a range of psychiatric conditions and medical co-morbidities. Twenty-three of the 25 were judged appropriate for escalation of treatment. Eight of the 23 were admitted to the acute hospital, two of whom died. For the remaining two patients the decision was made not for escalation, care to continue at MHU.ConclusionThe VWR provided a clear and timely process for referral and discussion of symptomatic patients. Treatment escalation plans were made in collaboration with the psychiatric team who knew the patients well, together with the expertise of acute medicine in the context of support from the palliative care service should the MHT need to care for those at end-of-life.","Goggin, Anne, Lewis, Kirsty","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.42","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A17, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A17, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21512,""
"â€˜Exhausted, emotional, at breaking pointâ€™: the mental wellbeing of young adults with shortened lives","BackgroundYoung adults with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions (LLTCs) are ordinarily extremely challenged in terms of health and wellbeing and especially vulnerable to social isolation and exclusion (Johnson & Hodgson, 2018;Knighting K, Bray L, Downing J, et al., 2018). Societyâ€™s response to COVID-19 poses an additional threat to this group who are at risk of being further left behind, creating long-lasting consequences for their mental wellbeing.AimsTo examine the unintended consequences of (COVID-19) epidemic-control decisions on young adults with LLTCs to (a) understand the needs of this group (b) develop guidance and support and, (c) determine how consequences could be mitigated.MethodsThis inclusive research project, underpinned by an interpretive qualitative framework (Denzin, 2003) draws on the principles of co-design (Nind, 2014). Research participants were recruited using purposive and theoretical sampling using a variety of methods including advertising for participants, existing networks and snowballing. During July-September 2020, in-depth interviews were conducted via video-conference with 28 young adults aged 18-40. Data were analysed iteratively using constructivist Grounded Theory Method (cGTM) (Charmaz, 2006) and using the qualitative software analysis package QSR NVivo.ResultsParticipants experienced a decline in mental wellbeing with those with pre-existing mental health issues showing the most significant decline;in these cases, participants spoke about suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety and an increased need for medication and therapy. Many participants described a â€˜rollercoasterâ€™ of emotions and said that they had felt â€˜petrifiedâ€™ â€˜overwhelmed, â€˜worriedâ€™ and â€˜forgottenâ€™. Key themes included (a) the constant management of risk to avoid (physical) harm from COVID-19 while protecting mental health (b) the desire to â€˜keep busyâ€™ as a means of â€˜thinking lessâ€™ in order stay mentally well (c) a re-evaluation of what matters in life.ConclusionMain learning points: (1) acknowledgement that although people with LLTCs are typically isolated and excluded that the pandemic has magnified and exacerbated this;(2) the need for regular communication;(3) enhanced mental health support.","Earle, Sarah, Blackburn, Maddie, Chambers, Liz, Downing, Julia, Flemming, Kate, Hale, Jamie, Marston, Hannah, Lindsay, Oâ€™Dell, Watts, Lucy, Whitney, Sally","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.20","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A8-A9, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care; 11(Suppl 2):A8-A9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21513,""
"â€˜Going against the grain of all we doâ€™: hospice staff experiences of moral distress during COVID-19","BackgroundCOVID-19 has placed huge stress on healthcare systems and services, often impacting the well-being of staff across all settings (Mehta, Machado, Kwizera, et al., 2021). Little is known about the pandemicâ€™s impact on hospice staff.AimsIdentify how responding to COVID-19 has impacted hospice staff, whether and why this resulted in experiences of moral distress, and how hospices have responded in supporting staff well-being.MethodsQualitative multiple case study (Yin, 2017) (n= five cases), as part of the CovPall study which explored the multinational response of specialist palliative services to the pandemic. Cases were hospices in England providing specialist palliative care services in any setting. Data collection involved individual interviews with hospice professionals and analysed using framework analysis (Ritchie, Lewis, Nicholls, et al., 2013).Results24 participants sampled by role, experience, and setting. Themes demonstrated how infection control constraints (i.e., visiting restrictions) prohibited and diluted staffâ€™s capacity to provide care that reflected their professional values. This caused moral distress. Despite organisational, team, and individual support strategies to address moral distress, continually managing these constraints led to a â€˜crescendo effectâ€™ with cumulative effects of moral distress (e.g., sadness, guilt, frustration, and fatigue) sometimes leading to burnout. Solidarity with colleagues and the feeling of making a valued contribution provided â€˜moral comfortâ€™ for some.ConclusionsDespite their experience of dealing with death and dying, the well-being of hospice staff has been, and continues to be, affected by experiences of moral distress during the pandemic.How innovative or of interest is the abstractWe provide an in-depth insight into why and how hospice staff experienced moral distress during the pandemic, alongside how voluntary organisations responded. Given that prolonged experiences of moral distress has detrimental effects on staff and the quality of patient care, (Burston & Tuckett, 2013) national and organisational changes need to be implemented to alleviate and manage the short and long-term impact of moral distress (Jameton, 2017).Funding statementThe CovPall study is jointly funded by UKRI and NIHR [COV0011;MR/V012908/1].

"Assessing mental health presentations to the paediatric emergency Department : An inconsistent process evaluating staff agreement using video vignettes","Background The rise in mental health presentations to Paediatric Emergency Departments (PED) during the Covid pandemic has been well documented. Whilst it has never been more important to accurately assess the mental health risk posed to young people on their arrival in PED, staff undertaking these assessments often have little formal training or oversight. Whilst physical presentations can be quantified by clinical parameters and evidenced investigations, the accurate assessment of mental health cases is inherently subjective, yet just as crucial. Objectives To assess the level of agreement between professionals routinely assessing undifferentiated mental health presentations in PED using video vignettes. Methods We identified mental health-related presentations to a tertiary PED over a one-month period. We selected six cases by random number generation, carefully altered/anonymised the details and engaged actors to re-create the presentations. Using an existing assessment matrix, participating PED and CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health service) staff watched the video vignettes and allocated presentations to 'green', 'amber' or 'red' risk categories. A free marginal multi-rater Kappa was used to assess the level of agreement between responses (0 indicating no agreement and 1 perfect agreement). Staff were asked to rate their confidence in assessing the vignettes on a modified likert scale numbered 1-5 (5 = very confident). This was undertaken as a service evaluation project after discussion with relevant Trust R&D teams. Results The Kappa for all responses was Kfree=0.21 (95%CI 0.04-0.38). Table 1 outlines Kappa values and self-reported confidence within each staff category. Conclusions When assessing the severity of mental health presentations on a simple traffic-light system, the agreement between PED staff was very low. This was lowest amongst nursing staff, who may be less familiar with the assessment matrix. Concordance was high amongst CAMHS staff, admittedly with few participants. This likely reflects their greater exposure and training. Despite the wide variation in responses, each staff group reported their collective confidence in assessing the cases similarly. This may point to a lack of standardised training and staff awareness. In order to best support young people during mental health difficulties, an accurate, objective and standardised assessment is key. This keeps young people safe, informs the level of support/ supervision they require and is crucial to de-escalate crises. This process starts in PED but practice is widely variable in our single-centre study - a level of inconsistency we would not tolerate in the assessment of physical symptoms. We plan to undertake regular multi-disciplinary training led by CAMHS to encourage standardised and robust assessments. We hope to improve the productivity and accuracy of discussions between PED and CAMHS and improve the patient journey for young people. We plan to repeat the vignettes following this intervention.","Malley, M.; Hall, M.; Costelloe, M.; Sutton, H.; Falla, A.; Swift, C.; Wright, J.; Everson, L.; Copson, S.; Cuellar, B.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.828","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A476-A477, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A476-A477, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21516,""
"Wellbeing of international fellows during the COVID pandemic","Background The COVID 19 pandemic has affected our society adversely. The International Clinical Fellows have also faced the brunt personally and professionally.In the conundrum of mounting pressures of the pandemic and increasing patient workload the morale of the larger team needed some attention and boosting. Objectives To address the concerns and challenges faced by the International Clinical fellows and provide a forum to make them feel heard.We wanted to include Pastoral support. We wanted to introduce a forum to share possible solutions and support Methods We would have quick corridor conversations but in their brevity a sense of low morale was palpable. We formed a group as a social network and collected email ids from the International Fellows across the Trust. We requested each member to briefly write points that they were concerned about and also compile positive opinions. We compiled these under various headings. A forum of the International Fellows was conceived and we all met virtually. Concerns ranged from workload disparity to lack of learning opportunities. Some of them were missing their Home as the Pandemic restrictions prevented them visiting families. The positive opinions were that their teams were supportive and most believed that their colleagues were their new families.They were advised and mentored during these sessions The minutes of this forum would be then taken to higher authorities in the Trust to address and acknowledge. Results Results An overwhelming feedback revealed how the Fellows appreciated this initiative. Their performance was enhanced and we had a happier lot of high performing International Fellows. They mentioned that they had a feeling of inclusion. The need for a structured pathway for training with end goals was identified. Ideas and experience from other Trusts will be explored and evaluated. Conclusions Conclusion These Forums are crucial as a platform to share worries and concerns, especially during these challenging times. It will also help people to share coping strategies and ideas that will aid colleagues to adapt and cope with rapidly changing work environment. The need of the hour is to look out for each other and by communicating and mentoring International Fellows , it would not only boost their morale but also aid in more International Fellows being recruited from overseas due to positive feedback.

"Involving and engaging children, young people and carers in the echild project","Background Involving children, young people and parents in research about them is essential. However, best practice specific to research involvement and engagement using administrative data is under-explored, yet particularly important given past high-profile cases of big data mismanagement and security breaches that have reduced public confidence. We describe our approach and interim findings from a programme of research involvement for the ECHILD (Education and Child Health Insight Linked Data) project. ECHILD links the Hospital Episode Statistics database with the National Pupil Database, to examine relationships between health and education for children and young people in England, with particular emphasis on understanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups. Objectives We planned a programme of child, young person, parent and public involvement and engagement throughout the duration of the project. Our objectives were to i) understand the diversity of views on linking these two datasets, ii) explore how definitions of 'vulnerability' might differ to those applied by Government Departments, and iii) identify priorities for research questions that can be answered by the linked dataset. Methods We accessed three standalone patient and public involvement groups comprising 30 children, young people and parents/carers through our partner, the National Children's Bureau (NCB). The groups were i) the Young Research Advisors, ii) the Family Research Advisory Group, and iii) FLARE, which is organised through the Council for Disabled Children and commissioned by the Department for Education. Sessions were online, semi-structured and facilitated by the NCB between August - December 2020. Content was captured through facilitator note-taking, flipchart paper with sticky notes and digital posts created by members in the groups. Results Children, young people and parents were keen to discuss the ECHILD Covid-19 project and have further ongoing engagement with project. Young people emphasised a need to raise awareness about the data that is routinely collected about them, and how it should contribute to research. They supported the use of the linked data - when in de-identified form and with secure access - for research to improve the health and education of children and young people. The term 'vulnerability' was rejected by all groups and, while consensus on an alternative was not reached, group members generally preferred terms that reflected 'additional service needs'. Young people were particularly concerned with the impact of school closures on mental health and would like future research to address this area Conclusions Engagement with children, young people and parents/carers is crucial to the ECHILD project and for inspiring trust in using linked administrative data for research. Our findings highlight the need for greater awareness of research using administrative data and that engagement should span the project lifetime. We have planned further meetings with these groups and other relevant stakeholders to ensure research conducted is timely and meets the needs of children and young people accessing health and education services.","Walker, E.; Gilbert, R.; Blackburn, R.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.750","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A431-A432, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A431-A432, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21518,""
"Virtual youth work: Meeting the increased psychosocial needs of children and young people with a long term condition during the covid-19 pandemic","Background Studies show that young people (YP) aged 16-30 years with a long-term condition (LTC) do less well than their healthy peers in terms of their mental health and employability. 30% of YP with a LTC have mental health issues compared to 15% of the general population. They have higher rates of unemployment. Such adverse outcomes often originate in childhood as a result of depression, anxiety, educational difficulties, relationship issues, low self-esteem and social isolation. To address these issues a Childrens' Hospital, in early 2019, developed a charity funded youth project, called PEEER, to improve Patient Empowerment, self Esteem, Employability and Resilience. PEEER youth workers bring Children and YP (CYP) with a LTC together to participate in activities to build self-esteem, build peer support, reduce isolation and help CYP gain accredited awards. Activities include rock climbing, cooking, football, Glow golf, art;ASDAN qualifications;Duke of Edinburgh Award. The current COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the psycho-social wellbeing of CYP, especially those with a LTC. There has been an increase in demand for psychosocial support-posing the challenge how such needs might be met. To meet these increasing psychosocial needs during the pandemic the PEEER project was moved to zoom-a virtual platform, with modification of activities. Objectives To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering the PEEER youth Project virtually compared to face to face youth work. Methods From 1.1.20-31.7.20: CYP received PEEER youth worker support. Group 1: Pre-Covid-19 lockdown: (1.1.2020-23.3.2020). PEEER youth support delivered face to face (F2F). Group 2: Covid-19 lockdown: (23.3.2020-31.7.2020) PEEER youth support delivered virtually Both groups CYP received 1:1 sessions, group activities and workshops, Feedback was collected on the effectiveness of the sessions: enjoyment of activities, self-esteem, building friendship, improved mood, confidence and feeling good about themselves. Results Group 1 (N= 109);Group 2 (N= 236). Both Groups (table 1): 100% enjoyed the sessions, would like to attend future sessions, agreed with the statements: they felt part of a friendship group, the sessions allowed them to socialise with their peers, they felt more confident and more independent, the activities gave them the opportunity to learn or improve a skill and they felt good about themselves. Conclusions PEEER youth support delivered virtually on Zoom is effective in helping CYP build confidence and self-esteem, reduce sense of isolation, and develop independence. Restrictions imposed by the pandemic have helped drive the development of a more widely accessible resource for patient benefit.","Arvind, N.; Stubbs, E.; Shameti, S.; Anderson, C.; Haq, S.; Gilbert, R.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.704","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A405-A406, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A405-A406, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21519,""
"The effects of pre-admission isolation on the education and wellbeing of elective surgical patients and their families during the SARSCoV-2 pandemic","Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted all areas of healthcare. Elective surgery ceased during the first lockdown but restarted once SARS-CoV-2 cases decreased, with a strict regime of 14 days pre-admission and post-admission isolation and PCR testing as recommended by Public Health England. In July 2020, RCPCH produced evidence-based recommendations advising that preoperative isolation (PI) was unnecessary in paediatric patients, although this was met with reluctance by many trusts. Our trust revised their guideline with a decrease in PI to 3 days for all but clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients, (based on guidelines covering all age groups, not incorporating RCPCH criteria), and those requiring elective HDU admission. We were concerned that children and young people (CYP) were adversely affected, with unnecessary enforced time away from school, impacting on both education and mental health. Objectives To assess compliance with the trust PI policy that patients and their families were asked to adhere to, and the subsequent impact on education and school attendance and any wider family concerns. We also looked at how this would have differed if RCPCH vulnerability criteria were used. Methods Direct questioning of all admitted paediatric patients and their families using a semi structured questionnaire with a mixture of closed and open-ended questions over a 3-week period. Results A total of 72 patients were admitted during the study period, 47% (34/72) were asked to preoperatively isolate for 14 days. Of these 11 were classified as ECV using trust guidance, only 3 were ECV by RCPCH criteria. 10 did not fulfil any local criteria. The remainder required elective HDU admission. None of the patients asked to isolate for 3 days fulfilled criteria for longer PI. No patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR during the study period. . 53 CYP (34 patients and 19 siblings) each missed 10 days off school, totalling 530 lost schooldays. . 59 CYP in the 3-day PI group missed between 1 and 3 days each (allowing for isolation periods to span weekends). 59- 177 lost schooldays. We also saw a significant impact on parents - many reporting financial losses or the use of annual leave or unpaid leave to conform with isolation guidance. Conclusions Our study showed a discrepancy between clinical practice and trust guidelines, with 14% of admissions asked to isolate unnecessarily for 14 days. Our trust guideline did not differentiate between paediatric and adult patients. Following the study, guidance was revised with a separate paediatric pathway using RCPCH CEV criteria to decide between 3 and 14 days PI. HDU admission was removed from high-risk paediatric criteria. Siblings were now exempt from isolation and could attend school. If our revised trust criteria had been applied to the studied cohort between 428-532 additional schooldays could have been attended (allowing for isolation periods to span weekends). The impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic including school closure is well documented to have adversely affected the mental health of CYP. As paediatricians it is important to advocate for our patients and their families ensuring CYP centred care within NHS trusts.","Andrews, C.; Hoddes, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.586","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A337, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A337, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21520,""
"The effects of SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) on nicu health care providers","Background The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) has risks of burnout and psychological morbidity for health care providers. The COVID-19 pandemic has required the rapid adaptation of work practices to accommodate social distancing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) policy changes. Many departments have recognized the wellbeing implications to staff and made changes to try and mitigate this risk. Objectives In this study, we aim to begin to understand how COVID-19 and its associated workplace practice changes have impacted the existing situation. Methods An online survey was distributed to tertiary NICU physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists and allied health professionals in British Columbia and Alberta (table 1). We employed a combination of closed- and openended questions to understand the participants' views on work in the NICU during the pandemic and how this has impacted their wellbeing. Results 142 replies of which 121 were complete. 93 were from Alberta, 45 from British Columbia, and 4 did not provide their province. Of the respondents, 33 (22.7%) had cared for a patient with COVID-19. 98.3% reported a major change as a result of COVID-19. These included homeschooling children (40, 33.3%), caring for vulnerable relatives (19, 15.8%), shielding vulnerable relatives (107, 89.2%), changes to a family member's employment (36, 30%) and being unable to connect with friends and family outside their city/province (101, 84.2%) Respondents also cited themes of personal isolation, delayed care for their or their family's non-COVID-19 physical and mental health conditions, anxiety at working on multiple sites and a lack of access to their usual daily coping strategies such as sports. There were a series of Likert-scale question, with 0 = 'Completely disagree' and 100 = 'Completely agree'. Conclusions All NICUs have made significant adaptions to their operating procedures and sought to support their staff through the pandemic, and these data suggest that this is recognised by the majority of participants. This is necessary but not sufficient. The successes we can demonstrate in the logistical response must be taken in context of a global change affecting staff 's physical, psychological and social circumstances which changes their relationship with the NICU. In future work, we aim to use quantitative and qualitative analysis from this survey in order to better understand the current state of staff wellbeing, the nature of the difficulties experienced by staff and their perception of the interventions used to support them.","Hopkins, A.; Albersheim, S.; Albert, A.; Ziabakhsh, S.; Manhas, D.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.562","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A323, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A323, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21521,""
"Paediatric eating disorder presentations to a district general hospital prior to, and during, the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly spread worldwide during 2020, with the first UK case seen at the end of January. During the pandemic a global increase in the number of eating disorder presentations to acute paediatric departments has been noted.1 Assessing the impact of this locally is essential for determining changes in policies, training and service provision to ensure the needs of these young people are met. Objectives This retrospective study compared the number, type and acuity of patients presenting with eating disorders to a single district general hospital in England, before and during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The potential impact of related national events, such as lockdowns and school closures, on these admissions was considered. Methods Information was collected on all patients aged &lt;18 years admitted to the ward with a primary diagnosis of eating disorder (falling under the ICD-10 classification F50) over a 26 month period, 'pre-COVID' (January 2019-January 2020) and 'post-COVID' (February 2020-February 2021). Data recorded included: monthly admission numbers, need for nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding or registered mental health nurse (RMN) support during admission, length of stay and discharge location. Results During the COVID pandemic ('post-COVID' period) there has been a significant increase in eating disorder admissions for acute nutritional support with a 283% increase in inpatient numbers (average 0.6 admissions/month pre-COVID vs 2.3 post-COVID). Despite the higher admission numbers, those admitted 'post-COVID' were less likely to: . require NGT feeding (63% required NGT feeding in the pre- COVID period, compared with 33% in the post-COVID period) . need RMN support (25% pre vs 10% post) . be discharged to a tier 4 bed (50% in the pre-COVID period compared with 13% in the post-COVID period) However 'post-COVID' a proportion of young people required sectioning under the Mental Health Act (7% vs 0% pre) to enable assessment and treatment and the average length of stay was increased by over 50% (pre average 7.5 days vs post 11.3 days) (p=0.058). Conclusions Such significant increases in the number of eating disorder patients admitted to paediatric inpatient units will have a significant impact on acute services, even if the co-existent mental health acuity appears equivalent or lower than pre-pandemic. The look of inpatient paediatric wards may be forever changed and staff training, inpatient facilities and multidisciplinary services need to adapt accordingly. Post-pandemic changes will also need to be monitored to review how further service modifications may be necessary in the future.","Broomfield, A.

"Paediatric Emergency Department usage during the April 2020 COVID19 lockdown","Background On March 23, 2020, the UK prime minister declared a public lockdown to decrease the spread of the SARS CoV 2 virus. This led to a change in health care organization and utilization, with GP surgeries and outpatient clinics changing to predominantly telephone or online consultations, and altered presentations to emergency departments. Objectives We aimed to understand the impact of the lockdown on the presentation of medical conditions in children presenting to our paediatric emergency department (PED). Methods We retrospectively analysed the Electronic Patient Records (EPR) for all children (aged 0 to 16 years) presenting to our PED in the first month of lockdown (April 2020) and looked at the number of discharge diagnoses within clinical groups (surgical, medical, trauma, mental health, other) and specific subgroups. We then compared the attendance in each of these groups with the average attendance in the previous 4 years (2016-2019), looking at the same month (April) to control for seasonal fluctuation in medical and trauma PED presentations. Results 624 patients were seen in our PED in April 2020, compared to between 1620-1710 patients in previous years. All clinical groups showed reduced numbers, with medical, surgical, trauma, mental health and 'other' presentations reduced by respectively 67%, 46%, 66%, 20% and 43% compared with the average in preceding years. There was a significant decrease in children presenting with respiratory tract infections (63%), febrile seizures (41%), afebrile seizures (27%), urinary tract infections (67%), fractures (65%), and head injuries (44%). There was a decrease in head injuries (56%) and fractures in children less than 18 months (44%), the group most at risk for non-accidental injury. The number of children presenting with appendicitis, testicular torsion, overdoses, and children aged less than 3 months with presumed sepsis, were within the expected range. In April 2020 there were three cases of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (compared to only two in 2016 and none in 2017, 2018 and 2019). Conclusions The lockdown significantly decreased PED attendance, and our data highlights several potential reasons, including a reduced burden of respiratory disease, changes in parental health seeking behaviour and possible barriers to attendance. The reduction in attendance was mainly in medical and trauma presentations. This could be explained by a decreased burden of infectious respiratory disease, and a reduction in injuries due to less road traffic and sport. Interestingly, non communicable medical conditions (urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis) and afebrile seizures also demonstrated a decreased rate, pointing to potential changes in parental health seeking behaviour. The increase in severe DKA presentations could indicate barriers (logistical or psychological) to attending primary/secondary health care. Overall, though the surgical attendances were decreased, presentations for surgical emergencies remained the same. Intriguingly, there was no increased attendance for mental health reasons. We found no evidence of increased domestic violence involving children in our population. Our data highlights that the lockdown was effective in decreasing the burden of both respiratory infections, and trauma patients presenting to ED. Our study will support workforce planning and resource allocation in paediatric ED, especially during staff redeployment.","Sell, T.; Steensma, J.; Rao, S.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.307","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A176-A177, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A176-A177, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21523,""
"Ethical considerations of COVID-19 vaccination in children and young people","Background Children and young people under 18 years are often asymptomatically infected with COVID-19 but have much lower rates of mortality or morbidity than adults. Infection and transmission in schools tends to mirror that in the local community. Pandemic impact, research and the UK vaccination programme are rapidly evolving. The public perception of risk/ uncertainty and media messaging are key factors. The programme will shortly include all adults over the age of 18, thereby including education staff. Only high risk children/ young people with severe neurodisabilities are currently included in vaccine priority groups. Vaccines reduce transmission as well as giving individual protection but there is insufficient evidence at present to judge the wider population benefits of child vaccination. One vaccine is currently licensed for young people between 16 and 17 years of age. If a safe and effective vaccine were to be approved in UK for children under the age of 16, would mass vaccination in this age group be ethically justified ? Objectives To examine the ethical aspects of COVID vaccination in UK for children and young people under the age of 18 years. Methods A seven point framework for ethical principles of mass vaccination programmes will be used to analyse arguments for and against the extension of the UK COVID vaccination programme. Safety, efficacy, risks and benefits of the vaccine and the vaccination programme, the just distribution of burdens and benefits and a comparison with alternatives such as non pharmaceutical interventions or extra adult vaccinations require assessment. The programme should be voluntary, cause least disruption to education and protect and honour public trust. Valid consent would require a factual, culturally sensitive, age appropriate explanation of risks and benefits of vaccination/ non-vaccination. Young people between 16 and 17 could give their own consent;parents would consent for younger children. Results Argument for vaccination: Children and young people have already suffered significant losses due to the pandemic in terms of interrupted education, social contact, safeguarding and mental health support. COVID has become a major driver in increasing health inequalities in this group. It is therefore in their interests to maintain school attendance. Vaccination could reduce transmission of infection between students and education staff. This, coupled with other measures, could ensure that school/education settings remained open. Young people aged 16-17 may wish to express their autonomy to be vaccinated making altruistic choices to protect their families or wider community or to allay their own anxiety. Argument against vaccination: In terms of national equity, the direct benefit of the vaccine to individual healthy children is minimal. As with all vaccination programmes, benefits, uncertainty and risks such as side effects would need factual, balanced information in order to allow informed decision making. Adverse experiences could impact vaccine confidence and trust in health professionals more generally. Vaccinating younger children would require more specialised services than currently required for adults. This could adversely affect other routine child health and immunisation programmes, especially those based in schools. In terms of global equity, the moral aspects of vaccine supply to countries most adversely affected by the pandemic require international political co-operation and are outside the scope of this paper. Conclusions This decision is finely balanced. It depends on timing and dynamics of COVID infection in UK. It is important that alternatives to mass child vaccination are fully assessed before decisions are made. Public attitude to personal risk and common good is, and always has been, vital to the success of the programme. The opinions of young people are especially relevant and should be actively sought.","Wearmouth, E.

"Innovative use of videoconference tool for parental education during COVID19","Background The COVID19 pandemic brought a lot of questions and concerns from parents about the impact of the virus on their children's health. The widespread presence of 'fake news' was adding to the confusion. Our Paediatric Integrated Care team based in a tertiary centre in London approached local parents and community centres to organise online child health workshops. Objectives . To support parents and carers in gaining knowledge and confidence to care for children and young people during the pandemic . To reassure and reduce anxiety related to child health concerns . To be responsive to our community and their health needs . To make innovative use of video-conference technology and group teaching methods . To make best use of professionals' time Methods We worked closely with Community and Maternity Champions, who organise groups of local volunteers to promote health and wellbeing in North West London. Two Community Champions showed interest in having a webinar for parents on COVID19 and its impact on children in May 2020. We agreed dates and times for the 2 webinars. The Community hosts promoted the sessions and asked participants to submit any questions in advance so that the webinars could be tailored around the audience's needs. The session lead (paediatric senior registrar) and other paediatric junior doctors prepared a presentation and answers to the pre-submitted questions. The format for the webinars was flexible, co-designing the sessions with the champions. The first had a 15-minute presentation followed by Q&As, the second did not have a presentation to allow more conversation with the families who joined. After each webinar, we sent resources for the community hosts to share. After trialling two webinars in May, we were contacted by other community centres. We organised six more webinars from June to December 2020. We captured data during the webinars, such as teaching material used, duration, session breakdown, size and type of audience. We tested different approaches for feedback, sharing survey links at the event and following up with the hosts two weeks after the event. Results From May to December 2020, we organised 8 webinars with 5 Community Centres, two youth groups and one secondary school, with a total of 72 attendees. Initially they were focused on COVID19, then we introduced other topics, including mental health, asthma and common childhood illnesses, depending on what the community hosts and local families requested. On average we ran the webinars for 1 hour. Formal and informal feedback confirmed that the webinars addressed concerns and that the attendees and community hosts found the session useful and reassuring. Peer to peer learning during the sessions was encouraged and this was key to improving audience's confidence in addressing health concerns. Conclusions The COVID19 pandemic has opened up innovative ways to collaborate with community centres and have conversations on health-related topics sharing expertise. This project has also provided an important learning opportunity for paediatricians in training. The success of this programme is likely to lead to implementation of similar and related programmes, even after the end of the pandemic.","Braccio, S.; Rutherford, P.; Watson, M.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.260","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A149-A150, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A149-A150, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21525,""
"What impact has COVID-19 had on paediatric workforce and services?","Background Child health services in the UK had to respond rapidly to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no precedence or playbook. There was large variation in how services were affected, depending on local incidence rates, location, and the systems they were working in. There was a lack of data about how services were coping, what types of pressures they were under, and how things are changed over time. We launched a project to collect and report data about the impact of COVID-19 on child health services. The first phase ran from April to July 2020 and the second from December 2020 to February 2021. This project collected data on a weekly basis to track trends and patterns, highlight service pressures, and help identify pinch points. Objectives 1. To capture a picture of how COVID-19 is affecting paediatric services throughout winter. 2. To provide members with information to help with workforce and service planning and recovery. 3. To ensure RCPCH members feel listened to and supported, and provided with a way of alerting us to issues in their service. 4. To make the responsible bodies in each of the UK nations aware of the problems facing paediatric services throughout winter. Methods We asked representatives, such as the paediatric clinical lead, to respond on behalf of their Trust or Health Board on a weekly basis. The first phase covered 12 weeks from April to July 2020 and the second phase covered 14 weeks from December 2020 to February 2021. Respondent were asked to submit data about 'the 7 days up to 08:00 on [date of Friday in the current collection week]'. Questions were answered as compared to 'normal' levels of staffing and capacity i.e., the same week in previous years. Some questions were changed over the data collection period in response to changing priorities. Results Response rate per week varied from 30% to 53%. In the first phase of collection (Spring 2020), up to 10% of all paediatric staff were not available to work (e.g., shielding). Up to 22% of junior paediatric medical staff (on the tier 1 rota) were redeployed to adult services, and up to 46% of community child health trainees and 14% of community career grade staff were also redeployed within paediatrics. In the second phase (Winter 2020-21), 16% of paediatric staff were reported absent due to stress and up to 28% of services reported trainee redeployment to adult services. We also found that paediatric inpatient beds occupied with children admitted due to a mental health issue had doubled from 6% in 2019 to 12% in 2020. Conclusions The paediatric workforce has been working intensely and beyond their usual scope for the past year. Prior to the pandemic, paediatric services and workforce already could not meet the demand for care. Redeployment and staff shortages due to the pandemic have therefore posed further challenges on an already stretched system. Staff and services must be supported to restore and recover.","Rogers, M.; Carzedda, D.; Boodhun, N.; Jay, N.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.189","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A109, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A109, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21526,""
"Parent preference: Comparing telephone with face to face consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The Covid-19 pandemic led to a strong government response in attempts to limit spread of this virulent infectious disease. Societal measures included social distancing, hand hygiene with 'stay-at-home' advice, colloquially referred to as 'lockdown'. Medical practice had to respond quickly, respecting these measures whilst trying to offer ongoing patient services. Objectives There has been a proliferation of virtual appointments, offered either via telephone or video call. For a paediatrics department in a major district general hospital, phone consultations were the immediately available option. Our study objective was to implement an online survey questionnaire to explore family perceptions on virtual telephone appointments. Methods 168 families who participated in general paediatric follow up telephone consultations over a two-week period in May were contacted for consent to send them an online survey comparing telephone and face-to-face consultations. This group was targeted because they had at least one face-to-face appointment previously. The online survey consisted of 10 questions to compare different modes of consultations, including satisfaction rating using the Likert scale, and open text responses. Results 40 families (response rate 44%) of 92 who consented, completed the online survey. 4 (10%) parents had a strong preference for face-to-face appointments, with roughly 25% each slightly preferring telephone or face-toface appointments (9 and 12 respectively). 35% (14) did not mind either option. Despite this, if given the choice, 12 (30%) would choose face-to-face appointments in the future as opposed to 5 (12.5%) who would chose the telephone consultation. Parents rated convenience as greater for telephone appointments (33 responses, 85%). Some parents mentioned in feedback slightly better ability to remember information and ask questions. However, there was limited possibility for involving other adults and the child or young person. Positive comments about virtual clinics included not having to pay for parking (6, 15%). Parents gave constructive feedback, saying they could be asked to be ready to provide information, for example child's current weight. Few children were involved, and this needs to be borne in mind, especially as visual ques can be missed over telephone. 3 families (8%) however did report that children were happy not to be involved in the discussions. Conclusions Parents were grateful that some efforts had been made to maintain contact in difficult times, and responses may have been different in normal circumstances. There are some limitations to telephone consultations;mainly not being able to clinically examine or talk to children. Telephone consultations may result in silencing of the child's voice, with possible mental health and safeguarding issues. Some of these issues could be addressed with video calling. Interestingly despite convenience of telephone consultations, more parents indicated a preference for physical face-to-face consultations suggesting that, as the world returns to normal, whilst both options should be made available to them, we may not see significant changes in practice. Going forwards it may be beneficial to ask parents after initial consultation and if appropriate, if they would like a telephone or physical face-to-face appointment in the future.","Popat, R.; Cohn, A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.112","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A65-A66, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A65-A66, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21527,""
"'abuse hidden from the view'-COVID-19 lockdown child abuse audit","Background Recently there have been high-profile publications about in surge in child abuse cases during the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown beginning on the 23rd of March 2020. Due to limited services and increased isolation, it was difficult to identify this abuse and intervene through the traditional channels. This study used a proxy measure, that is to see if there was an increase in referrals to Paediatricians for child protection medicals. Objectives This study intends to assess the impact of lockdown on child abuse during school closure. Methods We performed a retrospective observational study of all child protection medical examinations undertaken at the Pinderfields General Hospital, England during April and May 2019, in comparison to the same period of 2020. The outcome measurements included the number and sources of referrals, previous contact with social services, risk factors for abuse, and the outcome at discharge. Results The difference in age and gender referrals was insignificant. The highest numbers of referrals were for physical abuse in both years. Although neglect remained the second highest cause for referral in 2020, this could be due to the reasons previously stated. Domestic violence, mental health, and drug abuse in parents have remained the predominant causes of risk factors for abuse in children in both years. The majority of children in 2020 went home with social services' input rather than the support of family members like grandparents (due to isolation or shielding). This caused a high financial impact on the Government. Conclusions COVID-19 has led to a demonstrable increase in child abuse, with the possibility of gross underestimation due to school closures. The results show fewer children are being referred by schools and there are fewer referrals from children who are not under the radar of social services with child protection plans. This may reflect an increase in hidden abuse. The direct impact of the increased presence of children within the home and the indirect impact of the virus on unemployment, mental health, domestic violence and substance abuse may offer some explanation to rising levels of child abuse All Paediatric referrals should be treated with a higher degree of suspicion during this pandemic. School closure risks rising levels of hidden abuse in the UK, this needs to be considered by policymakers.","Handi, M.; Wright, S.; Lokhandwala, Z.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.95","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A55-A56, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(SUPPL 1):A55-A56, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21528,""
"Changing patterns of emergency paediatric presentations during the first wave of COVID-19: Learning for the second wave from a UK Tertiary Emergency Department","Background The SARS-CoV2 pandemic and initial public health response led to significant changes in health service delivery, access and utilisation. The SARS-CoV2 illness burden in children and young people (CYP) is significantly lower than in adults. To inform effective child public health interventions we aimed to compare patterns of paediatric emergency department presentations. Objectives Describe the ED attendance pattern of CYP during COVID-19 compared to the same period in 2019. Methods Retrospective review of all attendances (0-18yrs) over the initial pandemic (02/03/20-03/05/20) compared to 2019. Outcome measures included demographics, number of attendances, source of referral, presenting complaint, discharge diagnosis and disposal. Descriptive statistics, with subgroup analysis by age/sex/ethnicity and pandemic time-periods (prelockdown, lockdown weeks 1-3 and lockdown weeks 4-6) were performed. Results 4417 attendances (57% illness;43% injuries) occurred between 02/03/20-03/05/20, compared to 8813 (57% illness;43% injuries), a reduction of 50%, maximal in lockdown week 2 (-73%). Presenting complaints 2529 (57%) attendances were illnesses and 1868 (43%) injuries, compared to 5005 (57%) and 3764 (43%) respectively in 2019. The top five illness complaints were breathing difficulty, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea & vomiting and rash, unchanged from 2019. Ranking of top 3 illness presentations changed across the pandemic weeks. Breathing difficulty dropped from 1st (300;25%) to 2nd (117;21%) to 3rd (59;11%);(p&lt;0.001). Abdominal pain rose from 3rd pre-lockdown (87;7%) and lockdown weeks 1-3 (37;7%) to 2nd in weeks 4-6 (62;12%;p=0.004). Fever ranked 2nd (235;19%) pre-lockdown, 1st (134;24%) in week 1-3 and week 4-6 (94;18%;p=0.035). Triage category 88 (2%) attendances were triaged as a category 1 (CAT1) and 544 (12%) attendances as a category 2 (CAT2);this is compared to 146 (2%) and 1134 (13%) in 2019. There was no variation in CAT1 across pre-lockdown (2%), lockdown weeks 1-3 (2%) and lockdown weeks 4-6 (2%) and minimal variation in CAT2 (12%, 13% and 11% respectively across pandemic weeks), indicating no change in severity of presentations. Source of referral (SOR) 3065/4417 attendances (69%) were by self-referral, proportionally the same as in 2019 (6149/8813;70%). Emergency services/urgent care were the second most common SOR for 487 (11%) attendances, similar to 2019 (762/8813;9%). NHS111 referral ranked third (416/4417;8%) and GP ranked 4th (315/4417;7%). This was different to 2019, where GP referral ranked 3rd (755/8813;9%) and NHS111 ranked 4th (734/8813;8%). Disposal 708 (16%) attendances resulted in admission, 3647 (83%) were discharged, 61 (1%) did not wait (DNW) and 1 patient died during the pandemic period. This was compared to 1675 (19%) admissions, 6755 (77%) discharges, 383 (4%) who DNW and no deaths in 2019. Conclusions Despite a 50% reduction in attendances there was no significant change in proportions of illness/injury, acuity of illness, source of referral or disposal. Rank of illness presentations changed, with abdominal pain ranking second, and fever first, an important change which should prompt further research into causes. Clear public health messaging for CYP and collaborative guidance for primary care is required in this second wave to ensure CYP have access to appropriate emergency, routine and mental health services.","Shanmugavadivel, S.; Liu, J.

"White, older men are less affected by the changes of the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose: This study explores quality of life and lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic among pre- and post- liver (LT) and kidney (KT) transplant patients across race, age, and gender. Methods: Patients listed (pre) for liver transplant (LT) or kidney transplant (KT) and recipients (post) of LT and KT were prospectively enrolled at a large single center from 5/2020 - 1/2021. Demographics were collected from the EHR. The Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities (C3) survey was administered via phone by trained research assistants to ascertain patient knowledge about COVID-19. Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact tests were used (p&lt;0.05). Results: A total of 310 pre- and post-LT and KT patients were enrolled (Table 1), with 187 (60%) KT patients and 122 (40%) LT patients. The mean age group for the cohort was 55-64, 104 (34%) were female, 228 (74%) were White, 45 (15%) were Black, 43 (14%) were Hispanic, and 251 (87%) had some college education. 26 (8%) patients had known COVID-19, 22 (85%) were post- LT or KT. There were no significant differences in COVID-19 diagnoses between genders or organ category (Table 2). Compared to men, women felt lonelier (Fig 1A, p=0.0159), more nervous or stressed (Fig 1C, p= 0.0138), and left their home less frequently (Fig 1B, p= 0.0006) due to the pandemic. Specifically, white men left their homes more (Fig 3C, p= 0.0092) than white women, and a higher percentage of white men â€œneverâ€ felt nervous or stressed (Fig 3B, p= 0.004) or were â€œneverâ€ lonely because of the coronavirus (Fig 3A, p=0.0321) compared to white women. Further, women =55 reported that their routines changed more (Fig 2A, p= 0.0041 and felt lonelier (Fig 2B, p= 0.0249) than men =55 because of the coronavirus. Conclusions: It has been previously demonstrated that women have shouldered a bigger mental health burden during the pandemic. Our findings show that this holds within the transplant population across age and race. Though our population is primarily male and chronically ill, that did not seem to affect behaviors and attitudes towards COVID-19. Thus, targeted social support for this particularly vulnerable population may be beneficial in closing this mental health gap. (Table Presented).","Berkowitz, R.

"Solid organ transplant recipient attitudes towards a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine","Purpose: An effective and widely-accepted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could protect the community and vulnerable populations. We investigated the attitudes of solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) towards a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and identified potential barriers to vaccination. Methods: We conducted a national survey of SOTRs between November 11 - December 2, 2020 through the network and social media platforms of the National Kidney Foundation. We studied 3 major domains: a) attitudes towards a vaccine, b) impact of the pandemic on daily life, and c) impact on mental health. Results: Among 1308 SOTRs, 783 (59.9%) were female and 1035 (79.1%) were White. Respondents were evenly distributed throughout the US and were largely college graduates (829, 63.4%) and married (830, 63.5%). Half (647, 49.5%) of SOTRs would be either unsure or unwilling to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once available (Table 1). Major concerns included side effects (537, 85.2%), lack of rigor in vaccine development (439, 69.7%), and incompatibility with organ transplant (482, 75.4%). However, 1135 (86.8%) SOTRs would be willing to receive a vaccine if recommended by a transplant provider. A small fraction (161 12.3%) were in self-isolation and severe anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic remained low (25, 1.9%). There were no significant differences in vaccine attitudes after the announcement of 94.5% efficacy in the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna, Inc.). Conclusions: Transplant recipients expressed large amounts of skepticism in a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, even after announcements of high vaccine efficacy. However, transplant providers may be the defining influence in vaccine acceptance due to the trust vested in them.","Ou, M.; Boyarsky, B.; Zeiser, L.; Chiang, T.; Ruddy, J.; Rasmussen, S.; Martin, J.; Russell, J.; Durand, C.; Avery, R.; Werbel, W.; Cooper, M.; Massie, A.; Segev, D.; Garonzik-Wang, J.","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16847","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: American Journal of Transplantation; 21(SUPPL 4):295-296, 2021.; Publication details: American Journal of Transplantation; 21(SUPPL 4):295-296, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21531,""
"Towards Estimating UV Exposure Using GPS Signal Strength from a Carrying Smartphone","Owing to lifestyle changes, urbanization, and the COVID-19 pandemic, many people spend more time indoors and tend to receive less direct sunlight than before. Although excessive or inadequate ultraviolet (UV) exposure can be harmful to our physical and mental health, moderate UV exposure is essential for vitamin D (VD) production in the body. In this study, we estimate the UV exposure using an off-the-shelf smartphone, and explore the relationship between the UV values and GPS signal strength (C/N0). The results demonstrate that a strong correlation (R2 = 0.73) between the UV values and carrier to noise density (C/N0) even if the smartphone and UV sensor are moved. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the UV exposure to some extent from a person's location, even while carrying a smartphone.

"Understanding the Societal Disruption due to COVID-19 via User Tweets","In this paper, we collect data from Twitter and conduct a linguistic analysis of the user tweets to understand the social and economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To better appreciate peoples' opinions and concerns with regards to the socio-economic conditions of addiction, mental health, unemployment and immigration, we collect data for a period of approximately 3 months in the beginning of the pandemic. We analyze the term and co-occurrence frequencies to identify the most commonly occurring words and bigrams in the discussion for each of the four categories. We conduct semantic role labeling to determine the action words in each category and then adopt a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to identify the main nouns linked with these action words. We then adopt a seeded topic modeling approach to automatically identify the main topics of discussion in each category. We finally conclude with a sentiment analysis of the tweets in each category to determine the overall sentiment associated with each category. Our fine-grained linguistic study unearths the difficulties experienced by the people (e.g., action verb need associated with nouns such as aid and assistance in the unemployment category). We also observe that the overall sentiment in the tweets is negative, driven by people experiencing the pains of job loss, deportation, and the difficulty in accessing programs and treatments related to addiction. Our analysis highlights the main challenges experienced by the people during the start of the COVID-19 crisis and lays the foundation for recognizing and developing the most pertinent public and social policies so as to minimize peoples' suffering in case of a future pandemic.

"Special Issue on â€œToward Intelligent Internet of Medical Things and its COVID-19 Applications and Beyondâ€","The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an extension and specialization of that original Internet of Things (IoT) concept, and applies to the interconnectedness of devices, software applications, and data which are specific to the medical industry. IoMT can add smart technologies to medical devices to monitor the progression of a disease away from the doctorâ€™s office and learn things that could impact future care guidelines and patients. It can also provide a better way to care for our elderly by tracking vitals and heart performance, glucose and other body systems, and activity and sleeping levels. During the outbreak of pandemic (e.g., COVID-19), IoMT can even be used to detect main symptoms ubiquitously using intelligent sensors and trace the origin of the outbreak based on aggregated IoT data (e.g., geographic mobile data and purchase history). Although most of the contemporary IoMT systems can measure risks, make decisions, and take actions automatically, the lack of emotion-aware abilities will be an obstacle to more harmonious humanâ€“machine interaction and more efficient medical process. Besides, mental disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety, have become a more noticeable cause of suffering. The integration of emotion-aware abilities into IoMT can also contribute to monitor emotional dysregulation continuously in subjects with mental disorders or undergoing serious pandemic such as COVID-19, and give these patients personalized therapy recommendations. Research on affective computing has defined a framework to recognize, interpret, and process human affects, but more research is needed to investigate its application to biomedical applications, especially â€œin the wildâ€ and over extended periods of time, and how to integrate emotion-aware abilities into IoMT organically is still an open question. This special issue aims to create a platform for researchers, developers, and practitioners from both academia and industry to disseminate the state-of-the-art results and to advance the Emotion-Aware ubiquitous computing in IoMT.","Hu, Xiping, Ngai, Edith C.

"Analysis of sentiment optimization on social networks based on statistical data","As technology is much more developed, it has already merged with the daily life of people. Because of the characteristic of the network - no limitation, part of people believe that they are closer to their family and friends, while it makes people feel lonelier since companions are virtual. Therefore, it is easier to cause negative emotions and then lead to a more serious downside such as depression if those emotions cannot be alleviated or even eliminated on time. In this paper, the author focuses on the analysis of how to minimize the negative emotions so that to avoid more serious problems.

"Long-term effects of disaster exposure on health care workersâ€™ resilience: A comparison of the Wenchuan earthquake-exposed and unexposed groups","Background Resilience is an important trait of health care workers (HCWs), especially those who are exposed to disasters and disaster rescue efforts. However, few studies have examined the long-term impact of disaster exposure on HCWsâ€™ resilience. Objectives This study aimed to compare the resilience of HCWs exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake to those who were not exposed 11 years after the earthquake. Additionally, it aimed to examine the effect of HCWsâ€™ workplaces, individual sociodemographic factors and post-trauma growth on their resilience. Methods A cross-sectional self-administrated survey was used. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC25) was used to measure resilience. Sociodemographic factors were evaluated using descriptive statistical analyses and the relationship between resilience and exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake was assessed using multilevel regression analysis. Results Both exposed and unexposed HCWs reported low levels of resilience. Disaster exposure was not significantly associated with their resilience 11 years post-earthquake. Participants who worked in larger hospitals reported a higher level of resilience. Females and those with higher educational levels, longer service length or higher post-trauma growth scores had significantly increased resilience across different regression models. Conclusions The findings suggest the need for resilience interventions for all HCWs in disaster-prone areas, especially in the case of junior HCWs with lower educational levels working in small hospitals. Further research is warranted to identify optimal strategies to build and advance HCWsâ€™ resilience and sustain their mental health when responding to disasters.","Guo, Chunlan, Li, Sijian, Chan, Sunshine S.

"""Social-Distancing"" as a Chance to Revise the Paradoxes of Humanistic Philosophy: Personality Vs Identity in Online Artistic Practices of the Pandemic","In the article, the author investigates the correlations between the bounds of individual freedom and external constraints, aiming to view the present pandemic as an opportunity to study the boundaries of freedom. She supports the point of view, which understands the whole period since the end of the Middle Ages till nowadays as a period of constant liberation of human's creative forces. Nevertheless, she agrees that the philosophy of humanism contains a paradox in itself. The more one affirms oneself, liberating his/her personality - the more he/she loses this inner self. This loss of self results in a feeling of individual isolation and powerlessness when a personality is dissolved in different behavioral patterns adopted from the outside. The author also pays much attention to distinguishing between the notions of personality and identity. She claims that despite the fact that these two concepts are very close to each other and are often used as synonyms, they still are of different nature, and there is a significant difference between them. Based on the understanding of freedom in Immanuel Kant's philosophy and Erich Fromm's approach, the author turns to sociological surveys of the artistic sphere in 2020 to show that despite the obvious loss caused by the pandemics, and the fact that art as a professional sphere suffers a deep crisis, the pandemic has unexpectedly become a stimulus for a search of a new combination of ""personality"" and ""identity."" Several lockdowns in Europe and the US have suddenly become the stimuli for more personal freedom, which is found in art as a way to break the chain of causality.","Dorfman, N.","https://doi.org/10.29202/phil-cosm/27/8","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Philos.

"Impacts of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Training in US Professional Endurance Athletes","OBJECTIVE: We examined how professional athletes are affected by COVID-19. Our primary aim was to assess changes in mental health that occurred after COVID-19 restrictions, and our secondary aim was to assess changes in exercise volume and intensity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Strava professional endurance athletes. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS: Participants completed a survey, and a subset of participants consented to have their activity data analyzed. The survey included questions on COVID-19 symptoms, exercise, and mental health, as measured by a modified Patient Health Questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were asked about 2 periods in 2020: before COVID-19 (January 1-March 14) and during COVID-19 (March 15-August 25), and activity data from both periods were downloaded. Activity data consisted of Global Positioning System and self-reported uploads. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one male and female Strava athletes were enrolled, and a subset of athletes (n = 114) consented to have their activity data analyzed. During COVID-19 restrictions, 22.2% of participants reported feeling down or depressed and 27.4% of participants reported feeling nervous or anxious at least half the days in a week compared with 3.8% and 4.6% before COVID-19 restrictions, respectively (P < 0.0001). Activity data revealed a significant increase (P < 0.0001) in exercise minutes per day during COVID-19 (mean = 103.00, SD = 42.1) compared with before COVID-19 restrictions (mean = 92.4, SD = 41.3), with no significant changes in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes reported significant increases in feeling down or depressed and nervous or anxious despite an increase in exercise duration during COVID-19. Future research should assess how to support athletes with mental health resources.","Roche, Megan; Sainani, Kristin; Noordsy, Douglas; Fredericson, Michael","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000983","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Clin J Sport Med;2021 Oct 27.; Publication details: Clin J Sport Med;2021 Oct 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21539,""
"A cross-sectional study of the psychological status of 33,706 hospital workers at the late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: Hospital workers have been under intense psychological pressure since the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed the psychological status of hospital staff in the late period of the COVID-19 to provide a basis for the construction of global health care after the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used online surveys to assess participants' self-reported symptoms at the late stage of the outbreak. This study collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, epidemic-related factors, psychological status (PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PHQ-15), psychological assistance needs, perceived stress and support, PTSD symptoms (PCL-C) and suicidal and self-injurious ideation (SSI). Participants were hospital workers in all positions from 46 hospitals. Chi-square tests to compare the scales and logistic regression analysis were used to identify risk factors for PTSD and SSI. RESULTS: Among the 33,706 participants, the prevalences of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and SSI were 35.8%, 24.4%, 49.7%, 5.0%, and 1.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that work in a general ward, attention to the epidemic, high education, work in non-first-line departments, insufficient social support, and anxiety and somatization symptoms were influencing factors of PTSD (P<0.05). The independent risk factors for SSI were female gender; psychological assistance needs; contact with severe COVID-19 patients; high stress at work; single or divorced marital status; insufficient social support; and depression, anxiety or PTSD symptoms (P<0.05). LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional study could not reveal causality, and voluntary participation may have led to selection bias. The longer longitudinal studies are needed to determine the long-term psychological impact. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19 pandemic had a sustained, strong psychological impact on hospital workers, and hospital workers with PTSD symptoms were a high-risk group for SSI in the later period of the epidemic. Continuous attention and positive psychological intervention are of great significance for specific populations.","Lixia, Wang; Xiaoming, Xu; Lei, Shi; Su, Hong; Wo, Wang; Xin, Fang; Jianmei, Chen; Qi, Zhang; Ming, Ai; Li, Kuang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.013","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;297: 156-168, 2021 Oct 20.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;297: 156-168, 2021 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21540,""

"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Patients With Epilepsy or Other Chronic Conditions","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the opinions of different groups of people in Iran on their willingness to receive a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed a sample (based on consecutive referrals) of 5 groups of people in late 2020: a group of the general population from Shiraz (without a history of any chronic medical or psychiatric problems), patients with epilepsy, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), patients with cardiac problems, and patients with psychiatric problems. The survey included 4 general questions and 3 COVID-19-specific questions. RESULTS: A total of 582 people participated. In total, 66 (11.3%) people expressed that they were not willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Psychiatric disorders (odds ratio [OR]: 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-7.60; P = 0.006) and male sex (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.23-3.58; P = 0.010) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSION: Vaccine hesitancy is a global issue. Patients with psychiatric disorders had the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy. Previous studies have shown that depression and anxiety are associated with a reduced adherence to the recommended medical advice. Why male sex is associated with vaccine hesitancy is not clear. Researchers should investigate the rates and the factors affecting the vaccine hesitancy in their corresponding communities.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Barzegar, Zohreh; Sadeghian, Saeid; Nezafat, Abdullah; Shahisavandi, Mina; Nabavizadeh, Seyed Ali","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.311","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Disaster Med Public Health Prep;: 1-3, 2021 Oct 11.; Publication details: Disaster Med Public Health Prep;: 1-3, 2021 Oct 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21542,""
"Association between Decreased Social Participation and Depressive Symptom Onset among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Longitudinal Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed restrictions on people's social behavior. However, there is limited evidence regarding the relationship between changes in social participation and depressive symptom onset among older adults during the pandemic. We examined the association between changes in social participation and the onset of depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This was a longitudinal study. SETTING: Communities in Minokamo City, a semi-urban area in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited community-dwelling older adults aged &#8805; 65 years using random sampling. Participants completed a questionnaire survey at baseline (March 2020) and follow-up (October 2020). MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Two-Question Screen. Based on their social participation status in March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: ""continued participation,"" ""decreased participation,"" ""increased participation,"" and ""consistent non-participation."" RESULTS: A total of 597 older adults without depressive symptoms at baseline were analyzed (mean age = 79.8 years; 50.4% females). Depressive symptoms occurred in 20.1% of the participants during the observation period. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis showed that decreased social participation was significantly associated with the onset of the depressive symptoms, compared to continued participation, after adjusting for all covariates (incidence rate ratio = 1.59, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-2.50, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Older adults with decreased social participation during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated a high risk of developing depressive symptoms. We recommend that resuming community activities and promoting the participation of older adults, with sufficient consideration for infection prevention, are needed to maintain mental health among older adults.","Noguchi, T; Hayashi, T; Kubo, Y; Tomiyama, N; Ochi, A; Hayashi, H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-021-1674-7","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Nutr Health Aging;25(9): 1070-1075, 2021.; Publication details: J Nutr Health Aging;25(9): 1070-1075, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21543,""
"Anxiety, depression, and stress: Can mental health variables predict panic buying?","The study aims to verify the predictive power of anxiety, depression, and stress over panic buying, and to assess gender differences. Data was collected in Brazil during May 2020 through an online questionnaire which was composed of sociodemographic questions, the Panic Buying Scale (PBS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to assess anxiety and depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess stress. 2297 Brazilians (520 men and 1777 women) aged between 18 and 85 years (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 39.18 years; SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.10 years) answered the questionnaire. Women reported statistically significant higher means' values for anxiety, depression, and stress than men. Though men reported higher panic buying levels than women, the difference was not statistically significant. The regression models revealed that anxiety and stress were panic buying predictors. Comparing gender, the regression models showed that mental health variables (anxiety and stress) explained a higher variance of men's panic buying values than women's values. Hence, there is a significant moderator gender effect between mental health variables and panic buying, as they explained more of the variance of panic buying for men than for women. Psychological support should be provided to individuals, and they should be alerted and educated to the potentially prejudicial outcomes of this type of consumer behavior. Further studies should investigate antecedents and consequences of panic buying.","Lins, Koch, Aquino, de Freitas Melo, Costa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.11.008","20211108","Anxiety; Brazil; COVID-19 pandemic; Consumer behavior; Depression; Fear; Mental health; Panic buying; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21544,""
"Alcohol and other substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","Although evidence suggests substance and alcohol use may change during the Covid-19 pandemic there has been no full review of the evidence around this. A systematic review of all available evidence was carried out to document and interpret the frequency and severity of alcohol and other substance use during the Covid-19 pandemic and their relationship to demographic and mental health variables that may suggest further clinical implications. Peer reviewed articles in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL complete and Sociological Abstracts were searched from December 2019 until November 2020. The search and screening identified 45 articles from 513 deduplicated records. The evidence suggests a mixed picture for alcohol use. Overall, there was a trend towards increased alcohol consumption. The proportion of people consuming alcohol during the pandemic ranged from 21.7% to 72.9% in general population samples. Unlike alcohol use, there was a clear trend towards increased use of other substances use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of people consuming other substances during the pandemic ranged from 3.6% to 17.5% in the general population. Mental health factors were the most common correlates or triggers for increased use of both alcohol and other substances. There is an increased need for treatment for alcohol and other substance use related problems during the pandemic. Increased targeting and evidence-based interventions will also be important in the period which follows this pandemic, to improve the quality of life for individuals and families, but also to prevent additional costs to society and health systems.","Roberts, Rogers, Mason, Siriwardena, Hogue, Whitley, Law","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109150","20211108","Alcohol use; Covid-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Substance use; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21545,""
"Establishing a COVID-positive mental health ward: an Australian-first case study","Managing mental health patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a global challenge. Current workforce arrangements tend to separate those skilled in caring for highly infectious medical patients from those whose specialism is in managing co-morbid mental health, substance misuse and/or behaviours of concern, including potential non-compliance with community or health care directives. This paper reports an innovative service development through the emergency establishment of a temporary COVID-positive mental health ward in response to a local outbreak in Melbourne. A case study of service reorientation is presented, examining barriers and enablers to effective care of co-morbid mental illness, addiction and COVID-19. Establishing a skilled multidisciplinary workforce across mental health and infectious disease is the most important consideration in optimising care. Other issues included suitable physical space, security arrangements and inter-disciplinary communication. The paper holds insights for managing mental health care during potential future infectious disease outbreaks across the country.","Keppich-Arnold, Hopkins","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211045086","20211108","COVID-19; emergency response; infectious disease; mental health workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21546,""
"MT-nCov-Net: A Multitask Deep-Learning Framework for Efficient Diagnosis of COVID-19 Using Tomography Scans","The localization and segmentation of the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) lesions from computerized tomography (CT) scans are of great significance for developing an efficient computer-aided diagnosis system. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as one of the best choices for developing such a system. However, several challenges limit the efficiency of DL approaches, including data heterogeneity, considerable variety in the shape and size of the lesions, lesion imbalance, and scarce annotation. In this article, a novel multitask regression network for segmenting COVID-19 lesions is proposed to address these challenges. We name the framework MT-nCov-Net. We formulate lesion segmentation as a multitask shape regression problem that enables partaking the poor-, intermediate-, and high-quality features between various tasks. A multiscale feature learning (MFL) module is presented to capture the multiscale semantic information, which helps to efficiently learn small and large lesion features while reducing the semantic gap between different scale representations. In addition, a fine-grained lesion localization (FLL) module is introduced to detect infection lesions using an adaptive dual-attention mechanism. The generated location map and the fused multiscale representations are subsequently passed to the lesion regression (LR) module to segment the infection lesions. MT-nCov-Net enables learning complete lesion properties to accurately segment the COVID-19 lesion by regressing its shape. MT-nCov-Net is experimentally evaluated on two public multisource datasets, and the overall performance validates its superiority over the current cutting-edge approaches and demonstrates its effectiveness in tackling the problems facing the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Ding, Abdel-Basset, Hawash, Elkomy","https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2021.3123173","20211108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21547,""
"The mental health of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there was a tremendous increase in adverse mental and behavioral health symptoms. People with disabilities who are Medicare beneficiaries (under 65) are a vulnerable population, frequently having multiple chronic conditions, and facing a number of social disadvantages, even before the pandemic. As a result of the lack of attention drawn to the pandemic needs and experiences of people with disabilities, as well as the increased needs of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities, the aim of this study is to examine the mental health of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we conducted a secondary analysis of United States Census Bureau <i>COVID-19 Household Pulse Survey</i> data from 65,639 (unweighted) people with disabilities who were Medicare beneficiaries. Generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), respectively. Our findings (weighted) revealed, during the pandemic, 43.3% of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities had symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, and 36.8% had symptoms of major depressive disorder. In addition, 15.3% said they needed counseling/therapy from a mental health professional but did not get it. Many Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder during the pandemic, and a lack of access to needed mental health services. As the pandemic continues, and in wake of recovery from the pandemic, it is important to pay attention to, and target the, mental health disparities unearthed in this study.

"Never too late to plan: ""Refocus on planning"" as an effective way to lower symptoms and difficulties in emotion regulation during the COVID-19 first lockdown","Lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic have put people in stressful situations. Recent research showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression during this period, but no study has so far evaluated to what extent emotions and regulation difficulties were perceived by people as having changed with the lockdown. This was the major aim of the present study, together with investigating whether the emotion regulation strategy of ""Refocus on planning"" could be an effective strategy in this context. With a 1 time-point online survey, 635 French-, Italian-, and English- speaking participants (57.6% males, mean age of 48.48 years, SD = 15.7) evaluated (a) emotion changes, (b) anxiety, depression, and difficulties in emotion regulation, and (c) use of planning. Participants retrospectively indicated their state when thinking about the period of the Spring 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, as well as their state when thinking about the period just before. Results show that the lockdown period was associated with a perceived increase in negative and positive feelings, as well as a perceived increase in anxiety, depression, and regulation difficulties. Despite people used less planning during the lockdown, absolute and heightened use of planning was associated with more positive emotions, as well as less negative emotions, depression symptoms and difficulties in emotion regulation, whereas anxiety symptoms were lower only when more planning was adopted. This study suggests that planning is an effective emotion regulation strategy. More importantly, planning works as soon as implemented, suggesting it is never too late to start planning to alleviate emotion-related symptoms and difficulties.

"School support, chaos, routines, and parents' mental health during COVID-19 remote schooling","Remote schooling due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) created profound challenges for families. In this investigation, we examined parents' depression and anxiety during remote schooling and their associations with parents' reports of school support. We also evaluated indirect and interactive (i.e., moderation) associations. Participants were parents (N = 152, 92.8% mothers, 65.1% Black) from an urban area with high rates of COVID-19. Of the 152 parents, 27.6% reported elevated levels of depression and 34.2% reported elevated anxiety. Regression analyses showed that school support was negatively associated with parents' depression (ÃŽÂ² = -.33, p &lt; .01) and anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = -.21, p &lt; .01). There was an indirect association between school support and parents' mental health via household chaos and daily routines. Reported COVID-19 impact moderated the direct association between school support and parental depression and anxiety. There was a statistically significant association between school support and parents' depression and anxiety when COVID-19 impact was low or moderate, but not when COVID-19 impact was high. These results may suggest that for parents who were not highly impacted by the pandemic, school support buffered the association between stress and parents' mental health problems; parents most impacted by COVID-19 may need additional support.

"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic at a major Danish trauma center in 2020 compared with 2018-2019: a retrospective cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic demanded changes in societal behavior and health care worldwide. Previous studies have compared trauma patient admissions in COVID-19 related lockdowns to prior years. This study describes the COVID-19 impact on trauma patient admissions during entire 2020 at a major trauma center in Denmark. We retrospectively analyzed trauma patients received by a trauma team and admitted at Aarhus University Hospital in 2020 compared with 2018-2019. The incidence of injuries, mechanism of injury, 30-day mortality and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were investigated. The incidence of minor injuries (ISS 1-15) increased by 24% in 2020 compared with 2018-2019 (incidence rate ratio 1.24 [95% CI 1.11-1.39]). The incidence of severe injuries (ISS &gt; 15) in 2020 did not change compared with 2018-2019 (incidence rate ratio 0.97 [95% CI 0.80-1.17]). The 30-day mortality was similar in 2020 compared with 2018-2019. Comparing 2020 with 2018-2019, the risk ratio of traffic injuries decreased (0.90 [95% CI: 0.82-0.99]), risk ratio for fall injuries was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.97-1.30), for violence 1.13 (95% CI: 0.51-2.50) and for self-harm 1.94 (95% CI: 0.95-3.94). During the first lockdown of 2020, trauma team activations declined from 49.5 to 42 and the risk ratio for traffic injuries was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.50-1.10) compared with the same period in 2018-2019. The incidence of minor injuries increased, but the incidence of severe injuries was similar in 2020 compared with 2018-2019. Societal restrictions might alter mechanism of injuries. The first lockdown indicated an association with reduced traffic injuries.","Trier, FjÃƒÂ¸lner, Raaber, SÃƒÂ¸rensen, Kirkegaard","https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13997","20211108","COVID-19; Denmark; Injury; Lockdown; Pandemic; Scandinavia; Trauma; Trauma center","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21551,""
"Experiences and priorities of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been prioritized in public health campaigns to limit social interactions and 'cocoon' in their homes. This limits the autonomy of older people and may have unintended adverse consequences. To ascertain the self-reported physical and psychological effects of 'cocooning' and the expressed priorities of older adults themselves during the pandemic. This is a cross-sectional, survey-based study involving 93 patients aged 65 and older, attending geriatric medicine out-patient and ambulatory day hospital services or our in-patient rehabilitation units. Demographic data was obtained from the medical records. Frailty level was calculated using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and disease burden was calculated with the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Mean age was 79.1 (range 66-96), 24% had dementia, and most were mildly frail (CFSÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°5). One-third reported new feelings of depression, decreased mobility, and loss of enjoyment as a consequence 'cocooning'. Loneliness was more prevalent amongst in-patients (38% vs 9%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Respondents worried more about the risks of COVID-19 to their family than themselves. Expressed priorities varied from 'enjoying life as much as possible' to 'protecting the development of children'. Adverse consequences of 'cocooning' were commonly expressed amongst older adults. Public health policy should take into account the heterogeneity of this population and be sensitive to their self-expressed wishes and priorities.","Mello, Fitzhenry, Pierpoint, Collins","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02804-y","20211108","COVID-19 pandemic; Experiences; Older adults; Social gerontology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21552,""
"Association of Self-reported COVID-19 Infection and SARS-CoV-2 Serology Test Results With Persistent Physical Symptoms Among French Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","After an infection by SARS-CoV-2, many patients present with persistent physical symptoms that may impair their quality of life. Beliefs regarding the causes of these symptoms may influence their perception and promote maladaptive health behaviors. To examine the associations of self-reported COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV-2 serology test results with persistent physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, breathlessness, or impaired attention) in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in this cross-sectional analysis were 26Ã¢â‚¬Â¯823 individuals from the French population-based CONSTANCES cohort, included between 2012 and 2019, who took part in the nested SAPRIS and SAPRIS-SERO surveys. Between May and November 2020, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Between December 2020 and January 2021, the participants reported whether they believed they had experienced COVID-19 infection and had physical symptoms during the previous 4 weeks that had persisted for at least 8 weeks. Participants who reported having an initial COVID-19 infection only after completing the serology test were excluded. Logistic regressions for each persistent symptom as the outcome were computed in models including both self-reported COVID-19 infection and serology test results and adjusting for age, sex, income, and educational level. Of 35Ã¢â‚¬Â¯852 volunteers invited to participate in the study, 26Ã¢â‚¬Â¯823 (74.8%) with complete data were included in the present study (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [12.9] years; 13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯731 women [51.2%]). Self-reported infection was positively associated with persistent physical symptoms, with odds ratios ranging from 1.39 (95% CI, 1.03-1.86) to 16.37 (95% CI, 10.21-26.24) except for hearing impairment (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.82-2.55) and sleep problems (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.89-1.46). A serology test result positive for SARS-COV-2 was positively associated only with persistent anosmia (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.66-4.46), even when restricting the analyses to participants who attributed their symptoms to COVID-19 infection. Further adjusting for self-rated health or depressive symptoms yielded similar results. There was no significant interaction between belief and serology test results. The findings of this cross-sectional analysis of a large, population-based French cohort suggest that persistent physical symptoms after COVID-19 infection may be associated more with the belief in having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than with having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Further research in this area should consider underlying mechanisms that may not be specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A medical evaluation of these patients may be needed to prevent symptoms due to another disease being erroneously attributed to ""long COVID.""","Matta, Wiernik, Robineau, Carrat, Touvier, Severi, de Lamballerie, BlanchÃƒÂ©, Deleuze, Gouraud, Hoertel, Ranque, Goldberg, Zins, Lemogne, Kab, Renuy, Le-Got, Ribet, Wiernik, Goldberg, Zins, Artaud, Gerbouin-RÃƒÂ©rolle, Enguix, Laplanche, Gomes-Rima, Hoang, Correia, Barry, Senina, Severi, Allegre, Szabo de Edelenyi, Druesne-Pecollo, Esseddik, Hercberg, Touvier, Charles, Ancel, Benhammou, Ritmi, Marchand, Zaros, Lordmi, Candea, de Visme, Simeon, Thierry, Geay, Dufourg, Milcent, Rahib, Lydie, Lusivika-Nzinga, Pannetier, Lapidus, Goderel, Dorival, Nicol, Carrat, Lai, Belhadji, Esperou, Couffin-Cadiergues, Gagliolo, BlanchÃƒÂ©, SÃƒÂ©baoun, Beaudoin, Gressin, Morel, Ouili, Deleuze, Ninove, Priet, Saba Villarroel, FouriÃƒÂ©, Mohamed Ali, Amroun, Seston, Ayhan, Pastorino, de Lamballerie","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.6454","20211108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21553,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Perceptions of Health and Well-Being Among Sexual and Gender Minority Adolescents and Emerging Adults","<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> The study purpose was to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic may be differentially impacting the well-being of sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth compared with their non-SGM counterparts. Specifically, we looked at perceptions of mental and physical health impact and relevant aspects of coping with the pandemic such as engagement in prosocial activities that might ultimately promote resilience. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Survey data were collected between November 27, 2020, and December 11, 2020, from 990 adolescents and emerging adults aged 13-23 years. Participants were recruited through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram with an effort to overrecruit SGM youth. Questions asked youth about their perception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their physical and mental health, the types of prosocial activities engaged in during the pandemic, and how they felt they were doing now versus before the pandemic. <b><i>Results:</i></b> SGM youth reported a significantly greater impact from the pandemic than non-SGM youth. Both SGM youth and cisgender heterosexual females reported greater impact on their mental health compared with cisgender heterosexual males, with cisgender sexual minority females and gender minority youth reporting the highest mental health impact. Gender minority youth also reported feeling less connected to their families and less safe at home as a result of the pandemic. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Health professionals, educators, and advocates need to help assess SGM youth for negative impact from the pandemic and help them connect with other youth and support resources online as they move forward. Youth may also benefit from programs connecting them to volunteer work and neighbors.","Mitchell, Ybarra, Banyard, Goodman, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2021.0238","20211108","COVID-19; gender minority; health; sexual minority; well-being; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21554,""

"Asian in the Time of COVID-19: Creating a Social Work Agenda for Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities","The health of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities remains an understudied area of racial/ethnic minority research in the United States, and even more so in the field of social work. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how AAPI health and social welfare issues have not received adequate attention in social policy, social work practice, and research. Contrary to model minority myths, AAPIs are subject to racialized attitudes and discrimination, which have been associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including increased anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Drawing from the theoretical framework of AsianCrit, which is grounded in critical race theory, authors analyze health disparities among AAPI communities as reflected in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, as well as increases in acts of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia. Better understanding health disparities of AAPI communities needs to be a key research issue for social workers in future years. The authors conclude by offering a short set of recommendations to improve social policy, social work practice, and research to more aptly address contemporary social issues impacting AAPI communities.","Azhar, Farina, Alvarez, Klumpner","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swab044","20211108","Asian Americans; COVID-19; Pacific Islanders; racism; xenophobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21556,""

After the worldwide spread of COVID-19, common symptoms are already well known as fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pneumonia, abdominal pain and diarrhea, either loss of olfaction or sense of taste. Neurological complications are perhaps less known as headache, dizziness, agitation, executive dysfunction or, in particular cases, viral encephalitis and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis may also occur. In COVID-19 patients, ischemic stroke or cerebral vein thrombosis are also more commonly related to the increased risk of thrombosis. In the long term, so called post-COVID syndrome can emerge in the form of fatigue, depression or many other mental disorders. The most common disease of the peripheral nervous system is Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome. This chapter reviews a case of a 41-year-old man presented to the Department of Neurology with facial diplegia, dysarthria and intermittent paresthesia of the upper and lower extremities. 10-14 days before the onset of neurological symptoms, he has gone through COVID-19 infection that involved fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Electrophysiology and liquor samples showed typical signs of a rare Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome subtype - bifacial weakness with paresthesias. We are reviewing the neurological complications of the virus due to the expected increase of case numbers.

"Cognitive emotion regulation strategies and psychological distress during lockdown due to COVID-19","Several governments have implemented strict measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdown measures. However, these measures have brought negative consequences at an individual level by exacerbating the psychological distress caused by the pandemic. We evaluated the role of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) on the levels of anxiety and depression during the lockdown in a sample of 663 Spanish-speaking adults, while controlling for variables related to social support, hobbies, seeking information related to COVID-19, perceived risk of infection, time of assessment, number of deaths and contagions during the assessment and age. Using multiple regression analyses with a stepwise model selection procedure, 29% of the variance in anxiety and 38% of the variance of depression were found to be predicted by specific CERS. The impact of CERS on anxiety and depression was moderated by the sex of participants and the time of assessment, indicating that CERS did not have the same protective or harmful effects in all participants and situations. Based on our results, recommendations are provided for improving coping with stressful events where lockdown measures are taken.","Rodas, Jara-Rizzo, Greene, Moreta-Herrera, Oleas","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12818","20211108","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Emotion regulation; Lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21558,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric health service use within one year after the first pandemic outbreak in New South Wales Australia - a time series analysis","The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit New South Wales (NSW) Australia in early 2020, followed by a sharp state-wide lockdown from mid-March to mid-May. After the lockdown, there had been a low level of community transmission of COVID-19 over a year. Such pandemic experiences provide unique opportunity to understand the impact of the pandemic on paediatric health service use as countries emerge from the pandemic. We examined the difference between the observed and the predicted numbers of inpatient admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances, respectively, related to chronic, acute infectious and injury conditions, for each month during the COVID-19 period (January 2020-February 2021), based on the numbers from 2016 to 2019, using records from two major paediatric hospitals in NSW. All analyses were conducted using autoregressive error models and were stratified by patient age, sex and socioeconomic status. Health service use was significantly lower than predicted for admissions and/or ED attendances related to chronic conditions, acute infections, and injury during the lockdown in 2020. Change in health service use varied by chronic conditions, from the largest decrease for respiratory conditions (40-78%) to non-significant change for cancer and mental health disorders. After the lockdown, health service use for most health conditions returned to pre-COVID-19 predicted levels. However, for mental health disorders, increased health service use persisted from June 2020 up to February 2021 by 30-55%, with higher increase among girls aged 12-17 years and those from socioeconomically advantaged areas. There was persistently lower health service use for acute infections and increased health service use for injuries. Differences by socio-demographic factors were noted for mental health disorders and injuries. The immediate return to pre-COVID-19 levels for most chronic conditions after the first lockdown in NSW highlights the healthcare needs for children affected by chronic conditions. Persistently lower health service use for acute infections is likely attributable to the decreased social contact. Sustained and targeted mental health support is essential to address the potentially increased demand for services among children during and beyond the pandemic.

"Brain correlates of depression, post-traumatic distress, and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 survivors: A multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study","Psychiatric sequelae substantially contribute to the post-acute burden of disease associated with COVID-19, persisting months after clearance of the virus. Brain imaging shows white matter (WM) hypodensities/hyperintensities, and the involvement of grey matter (GM) in prefrontal, anterior cingulate (ACC) and insular cortex after COVID, but little is known about brain correlates of persistent psychopathology. With a multimodal approach, we studied whole brain voxel-based morphometry, diffusion-tensor imaging, and resting-state connectivity, to correlate MRI measures with depression and post-traumatic distress (PTSD) in 42 COVID-19 survivors without brain lesions, at 90.59Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯54.66 days after COVID. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) measured in the emergency department, which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, predicted worse self-rated depression and PTSD, widespread lower diffusivity along the main axis of WM tracts, and abnormal functional connectivity (FC) among resting state networks. Self-rated depression and PTSD inversely correlated with GM volumes in ACC and insula, axial diffusivity, and associated with FC. We observed overlapping associations between severity of inflammation during acute COVID-19, brain structure and function, and severity of depression and post-traumatic distress in survivors, thus warranting interest for further study of brain correlates of the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Beyond COVID-19, these findings support the hypothesis that regional GM, WM microstructure, and FC could mediate the relationship between a medical illness and its psychopathological sequelae, and are in agreement with current perspectives on the brain structural and functional underpinnings of depressive psychopathology.","Benedetti, Palladini, Paolini, Melloni, Vai, De Lorenzo, Furlan, Rovere-Querini, Falini, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100387","20211108","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Diffusion-tensor imaging; Functional connectivity; Grey matter; Magnetic resonance imaging; PTSD; Resting state; SARS-COV-2; White matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21561,""
"Targeting Sedentary Behavior in Minority Populations as a Feasible Health Strategy During and Beyond COVID-19: On Behalf of ACSM-EIM and HL-PIVOT","Increased sedentary behavior has been an unintended consequence of social and physical distancing restrictions needed to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Sedentary behavior is defined as any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure Ã¢â€°Â¤1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs), while in a sitting, reclining, or lying posture. These restrictions negatively impact peoples' cardiometabolic and mental health and disproportionately affect certain sectors of the population, including racial/ethnic minorities. In part, the higher risk for complications of COVID-19 could be the result of increased prevalence of comorbid diseases. Further, regular participation and adherence to current physical activity guidelines, defined as at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity or muscle strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week, is challenging for many and may be especially difficult to achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic. A practical strategy to promote health and well-being during COVID-19 is reducing sedentary behavior. Reducing sedentary behaviors (e.g., breaking up periods of prolonged sitting with light-intensity physical activity) may be more easily achieved than physical activity for all individuals, including individuals of racial/ethnic decent, as it does not require purchasing equipment nor require compromising the physical restrictions necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19. The purpose of this commentary is to argue that sedentary behavior is a feasible, independent target to modify during COVID-19, particularly in minority populations, and to address this behavior we need to consider individual, environmental and policy-level factors.","Pagan Lassalle, Meyer, Conners, Zieff, Rojas, Faghy, Arena, Vermeesch, Joseph, Stoner","https://doi.org/10.1249/tjx.0000000000000174","20211108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21562,""

"Social Media Use, Psychological Distress and Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Regarding the COVID-19 Among a Sample of the Population of Pakistan","This study was conducted to assess social media (SM) use, psychological distress, and knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among a sample of the population of Pakistan. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Multan, Pakistan between April and May 2020. Demographics details, SM use, psychological distress, and KAP on the COVID-19 were investigated. A total of 800 respondents were analyzed out of which 33.5% (<i>n</i> = 268) were women. No gender-wise difference was found in the terms of SM use and duration of SM use. Women were prone to have psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and stress than men in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The mean knowledge score of men was significantly higher compared to women (18.69 Ã‚Â± 4.20 vs. 16.89 Ã‚Â± 3.04, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while the mean score of the attitude and practices on the COVID-19 prevention measures was significantly better in women (<i>p</i> = 0.012 and <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). The psychological problems such as anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and depression scores (<i>p</i> = 0.033) were higher among women than men. The stress score was also higher in women but not significantly higher (<i>p</i> = 0.079). The knowledge was significantly correlated with attitude, anxiety, depression, and stress. The regression analysis showed that the COVID-19-related KAPs are the predictors of psychological suffering of an individual. The female gender was positively associated with anxiety and depression. The SM use was the predictor of the stress. Male respondents had significantly more knowledge of the COVID-19 than female respondents, but women had significantly better attitudes and practiced the COVID-19 prevention measures. Gender is a significant determinant of psychological distress and KAP about the COVID-19.

"Resilience and Higher Education Support as Protective Factors for Student Academic Stress and Depression During Covid-19 in the Netherlands","<b>Background:</b> The corona pandemic has forced higher education (HE) institutes to transition to online learning, with subsequent implications for student wellbeing. <b>Aims:</b> This study explored influences on student wellbeing throughout the first wave of the corona crisis in the Netherlands by testing serial mediation models of the relationships between perceived academic stress, depression, resilience, and HE support. <b>Methods:</b> The Covid-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS) was used, with a total sample of 2,480 higher education students studying at InHolland Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Student subgroups were created, so that students with low and high perceived academic stress could be assessed, in addition to depressed and non-depressed students. Predictive model fit was tested using Macro PROCESS. <b>Results:</b> A significant serial mediation model for the total student sample was revealed, including protective mediating effects of resilience and HE support on the positive direct effect of perceived academic stress on depression. At subgroup level, significant (partial) predictive effects of resilience on depression scores were noted. A partial serial effect between resilience and HE support was found for students with low perceived stress levels, whereas a parallel partial mediation model was present among highly academically stressed students. Regarding non-depressed students, a full parallel mediation model was found, whereas the model for depressed students inadequately explained the data. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, resilience and HE support mediate the predictive effect of academic stress on depressive symptoms among students. In addition, substantial differences in model fit arise when inspecting the students on a subgroup level. These findings contribute to the gap in knowledge regarding student wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, in addition to providing novel insights on student subgroup dynamics. While Covid-19 restrictions continue to demand online learning, student wellbeing may be enhanced overall by targeting resilience and increasing awareness and availability of HE support services. The current study also highlights the need for differential approaches when examining wellbeing for specific student groups.","Versteeg, Kappe","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.737223","20211108","Covid-19; academic stress; depression; higher education; resilience; students; support; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21565,""
"Mental Health Needs Assessment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Consensus Based on Delphi Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed significant gaps in mental health in terms of unrecognized and unmet needs. The goal was to accurately assess the needs and identify gaps in this area during the epidemiological crisis. A Delphi study to identify the needs was conducted with a group of decision-makers, experts, and users of mental health services. A starting point of the Delphi study was prepared in two working groups, based on recognizable international recommendations and experiences of the practitioners from the field situation. This initial set of emergency measures was supplemented through the first Delphi round, and consensus about the importance was reached in the second round. A total of 41 activities were derived, the vast majority of which were rated with a score of 4 or more. Mental health activities, which should be addressed in terms of needs, can be divided into systemic measures and service measures. This study recognizes a need to reorganize services in the direction of improving local accessibility and strengthening the network of services for immediate responses to the psychological, health, and social needs of individuals, including those arising from crisis situations, such as COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study are in line with the international recommendations and also influenced the formulation of the Action Plan of the National Mental Health Program, while some of the measures were already implemented during the publication of the research results.","MakiviÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â vab, Selak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.732539","20211108","COVID-19; health plan implementation; mental health; needs assessment; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21566,""
"Gender Differences in Anxiety Among COVID-19 Inpatients Under Isolation: A Questionnaire Survey During the First and Second Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","This study assesses the gender differences in health and anxiety, especially pertaining to mental health problems and time-course effects. We surveyed 121 patients admitted to a hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1 and August 31, 2020. Their mental status was evaluated on admission using the Japanese General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form JYZ (STAI). The patients were divided into two groups depending on the period of prevalence, that is, the first and second waves of the pandemic in Japan (from the beginning of March to the end of May 2020, Time 1 = T1; and from the beginning of June to the end of August 2020, Time 2 = T2). A multivariate analysis of covariance revealed significant differences in gender by time interactions in the GHQ-28 subscale ""Insomnia and anxiety"" and STAI subscale ""State-Anxiety."" <i>Post-hoc t</i>-tests revealed that the scores of ""Insomnia and Anxiety"" and ""State-Anxiety"" were higher in women than in men at T1. However, no difference was observed at T2. Further, ""Insomnia and Anxiety"" and ""State-Anxiety"" were significantly higher at T1 than at T2 in female patients. There was no significant difference in males. Thus, female patients were more anxious and depressed in the early phase of the pandemic, whereas male patients had difficulties in coping with anxiety. We suggest more gender-specific mental care, particularly for women at the early stages of infection.","Tsukamoto, Kataoka, Mino, Ishibashi, Shibata, Matsuo, Fujiwara","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.708965","20211108","COVID-19; Japan; anxiety; coping; gender differences; isolation; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21567,""
"Sexual Minority Orientation Is Associated With Greater Psychological Impact Due to the COVID-19 Crisis-Evidence From a Longitudinal Cohort Study of Young Swiss Men","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic and its countermeasures may have had a significant impact on the psychological well-being of specific population subgroups. The present study investigated whether sexual minority men (defined here as attracted partly or exclusively to men) from an ongoing cohort study of young Swiss men experienced different psychological impacts, levels of substance use and addictive behaviors, and to which degree pre-existing vulnerabilities and participants experiences during the crisis might explain these differences. <b>Methods:</b> An ongoing cohort sample based on the general population of young Swiss men (mean age = 29.07 years; SD = 1.27) was assessed before and during the COVID-19 crisis for depression, stress, sleep quality, substance use and addictive behaviors. Additionally, during the crisis, we assessed its impact in form of fear, isolation and traumatic experiences. Potential associations between these outcomes and sexual orientation (sexual minority vs. heterosexual) were tested using linear regression models. It was additionally estimated to which degree these associations were attenuated if adjusted for differences in mental health, personality and socioeconomic status before the crisis, as well as the experience of the COVID-19 crisis (infection with the virus and changes to work situation). <b>Results:</b> Compared to heterosexual men, sexual minority men showed higher levels of psychological trauma (<i>b</i> = 0.37 [0.25, 0.49]), fear (<i>b</i> = 0.18 [0.06, 0.30]) and isolation (<i>b</i> = 0.32 [0.20, 0.44]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher levels of depression (<i>b</i> = 0.31 [0.20, 0.41]) and lower sleep quality (<i>b</i> = -0.13 [-0.24, -0.02]) during the crisis. These differences were to a large degree explained by higher pre-crisis levels of mental health problems and the personality dimension of neuroticism-anxiety. Sexual minority men showed higher overall levels of substance use and addictive behaviors, but these differences were already present before the crisis. <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 crisis may have worsened pre-existing vulnerabilities in sexual minority men, leading to its greater psychological impact on them than on heterosexual men. Reducing minority stress due to sexual orientation may help not only to improve mental health among important proportions of the population but also to reduce their vulnerability to crises. Services offering psychological support to sexual minorities may need to be reinforced during crises.","Marmet, Wicki, Gmel, Gachoud, Bertholet, Studer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.692884","20211108","COVID-19; Switzerland; mental health; sexual minorities; sexual orientation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21568,""
"Elena+ Care for COVID-19, a Pandemic Lifestyle Care Intervention: Intervention Design and Study Protocol","<b>Background:</b> The current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is an emergency on a global scale, with huge swathes of the population required to remain indoors for prolonged periods to tackle the virus. In this new context, individuals' health-promoting routines are under greater strain, contributing to poorer mental and physical health. Additionally, individuals are required to keep up to date with latest health guidelines about the virus, which may be confusing in an age of social-media disinformation and shifting guidelines. To tackle these factors, we developed Elena+, a smartphone-based and conversational agent (CA) delivered pandemic lifestyle care intervention. <b>Methods:</b> Elena+ utilizes varied intervention components to deliver a psychoeducation-focused coaching program on the topics of: COVID-19 information, physical activity, mental health (anxiety, loneliness, mental resources), sleep and diet and nutrition. Over 43 subtopics, a CA guides individuals through content and tracks progress over time, such as changes in health outcome assessments per topic, alongside user-set behavioral intentions and user-reported actual behaviors. Ratings of the usage experience, social demographics and the user profile are also captured. Elena+ is available for public download on iOS and Android devices in English, European Spanish and Latin American Spanish with future languages and launch countries planned, and no limits on planned recruitment. Panel data methods will be used to track user progress over time in subsequent analyses. The Elena+ intervention is open-source under the Apache 2 license (MobileCoach software) and the Creative Commons 4.0 license CC BY-NC-SA (intervention logic and content), allowing future collaborations; such as cultural adaptions, integration of new sensor-related features or the development of new topics. <b>Discussion:</b> Digital health applications offer a low-cost and scalable route to meet challenges to public health. As Elena+ was developed by an international and interdisciplinary team in a short time frame to meet the COVID-19 pandemic, empirical data are required to discern how effective such solutions can be in meeting real world, emergent health crises. Additionally, clustering Elena+ users based on characteristics and usage behaviors could help public health practitioners understand how population-level digital health interventions can reach at-risk and sub-populations.","Ollier, Neff, Dworschak, Sejdiji, Santhanam, Keller, Xiao, Asisof, RÃƒÂ¼egger, BÃƒÂ©rubÃƒÂ©, Hilfiker Tomas, Neff, Yao, Alattas, Varela-Mato, Pitkethly, Vara, Herrero, BaÃƒÂ±os, Parada, Agatheswaran, Villalobos, Keller, Chan, Mishra, Jacobson, Stanger, He, von Wyl, Weidt, Haug, Schaub, Kleim, Barth, Witt, Scholz, Fleisch, von Wangenheim, Car, MÃƒÂ¼ller-Riemenschneider, Hauser-Ulrich, Asomoza, Salamanca-Sanabria, Mair, Kowatsch","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.625640","20211108","chatbot; conversational agent (CA); coronavirusÃ¢â‚¬â€œCOVID-19; digital coaching; digital health; gamification; mental health; pandemic lifestyle care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21569,""
"Inducing wellbeing through staycation programs in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis","The COVID-19 pandemic aftermath has aggravated its traumatic effect to engender a mental health crisis. With increasingly worsened psychological wellbeing, it is the responsibility of tourism scholars and operators alike to explore how contemporary tourism offerings can enable individuals to rebuild hope and optimism through relishing tourism's restorative appeals amid rigid border lockdowns. However, it remains unclear whether tourists are able to restore themselves from staycation programs, since tourists have a tendency to favor a novel space, as opposed to a usual travel environment. To address this question, we relied upon a government-funded staycation campaign using a survey to assess a transformative process leading from travel motivation and restoration to fortifying psychological capital and wellbeing. Drawing on theories pertaining to attention restoration, psychological capital, and involvement, our findings unravel a travel transformative mechanism of staycation programs that build a linkage between travel motivation and favorable psychological outcomes amid adverse circumstances.","Lin, Wong, Kou, Zhen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2021.100907","20211108","COVID-19; Psychological capital; Restoration; Staycation; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21570,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on health of the older persons in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 is impacting the health of the population, including older persons. Available evidence shows that older people are highly vulnerable and more likely to have adverse health outcomes. In Bangladesh, the older population is rapidly increasing, living with various disadvantaged socio-economic conditions, including inadequate access and healthcare services. These disparities are likely to increase during the COVID-19, resulting in high morbidity and mortality among them. Thus, we have examined the health vulnerabilities of older persons due to the COVID-19 pandemic using content analysis. We have analyzed 102 content collected from various online and printed articles published in newspapers, journals, and other relevant sources. The study has found increased health risks, deteriorated mental health, and poor health system functioning during the pandemic and its impact on older persons in Bangladesh. Strengthening health systems through an integrated model with capacity development of existing health care providers to deal with elderly health problems, including mental health and psychosocial wellbeing; promoting preventive measures, facilitating access to healthcare is required. Bangladesh can learn the Chinese experience to adopt innovative, specialized, and advanced systems to efficiently fight against the COVID-19.","Islam, Sultan, Hossain","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42379-021-00095-5","20211108","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Geriatrics; Health; Older persons","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21571,""
"Employing Multimodal Machine Learning for Stress Detection","In the current information age, the human lifestyle has become more knowledge-oriented, leading to sedentary employment. This has given rise to a number of health and mental disorders. Mental wellness is one of the most neglected, however crucial, aspects of today's fast-paced world. Mental health issues can, both directly and indirectly, affect other sections of human physiology and impede an individual's day-to-day activities and performance. However, identifying the stress and finding the stress trend for an individual that may lead to serious mental ailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can be achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various factors) arising from a person's behavioral patterns. Specific techniques are identified in the literature for this purpose; however, very few machine learning-based methods are proposed for such multimodal fusion tasks. In this work, a multimodal AI-based framework is proposed to monitor a person's working behavior and stress levels. We propose a methodology for efficiently detecting stress due to workload by concatenating heterogeneous raw sensor data streams (e.g., face expressions, posture, heart rate, and computer interaction). This data can be securely stored and analyzed to understand and discover personalized unique behavioral patterns leading to mental strain and fatigue. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, proposing a multimodal AI-based strategy for fusion to detect stress and its level and, secondly, identifying a stress pattern over a period of time. We were able to achieve 96.09% accuracy on the test set in stress detection and classification. Further, we were able to reduce the stress scale prediction model loss to 0.036 using these modalities. This work can prove important for the community at large, specifically those working sedentary jobs, to monitor and identify stress levels, especially in current times of COVID-19.","Walambe, Nayak, Bhardwaj, Kotecha","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9356452","20211108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21572,""
"Development of RESTORE: an online intervention to improve mental health symptoms associated with COVID-19-related traumatic and extreme stressors","Frontline healthcare workers, recovered COVID+ patients who had severe illness, and close others of COVID+ patients who have recovered or died are at risk for clinical levels of mental health symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19 through a trauma lens","This special issue of the <i>European Journal of Psychotraumatology</i> (EJPT) presents the first studies published by EJPT on COVID-19. We present 26 qualitative and quantitative studies assessing the prevalence of trauma-related symptoms and psychopathology within specific vulnerable populations such as health-care workers, students, children, and managers, or more broadly at a country level with a diverse set of outcomes including post-traumatic stress, moral injury, grief and post-traumatic growth. Intervention studies focus on whether telehealth delivery of mental health therapy in the pandemic environment was useful and effective. It is clear that the pandemic has brought with it a rise in trauma exposure and consequently impacted on trauma-related mental health. While for many individuals, COVID-19-related events met criteria for a DSM-5 Criterion A event, challenges remain in disentangling trauma exposure from stress, anxiety, and other phenomena. It is important to determine the contexts in which a trauma lens makes a useful contribution to understanding the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and the ways in which this may facilitate recovery. The papers included in this Special Issue provide an important and much-needed evidence-based foundation for developing trauma-informed understanding and responses to the pandemic. Este nÃƒÂºmero especial de la <i>Revista Europea de PsicotraumatologÃƒÂ­a</i> <i>(European Journal of Psychotraumatology</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€EJPT) presenta los primeros estudios publicados por EJPT sobre COVID-19. Presentamos 26 estudios cualitativos y cuantitativos que evalÃƒÂºan la prevalencia de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas y la psicopatologÃƒÂ­a relacionados con el trauma en poblaciones vulnerables especÃƒÂ­ficas, como trabajadores de la salud, estudiantes, niÃƒÂ±os y niÃƒÂ±as, administradores o, en general, a nivel de paÃƒÂ­s con un conjunto diverso de resultados que incluyen el estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico, el daÃƒÂ±o moral, el dolour, y el crecimiento postraumÃƒÂ¡tico. Los estudios de intervenciones se centran en si la prestaciÃƒÂ³n de telesalud de terapia de salud mental en el entorno pandÃƒÂ©mico fue ÃƒÂºtil y eficaz.EstÃƒÂ¡ claro que la pandemia ha traÃƒÂ­do consigo un aumento en la exposiciÃƒÂ³n al trauma y, en consecuencia, ha tenido un impacto en la salud mental relacionada con el trauma. Si bien para muchas personas los eventos relacionados con el COVID-19 cumplieron los criterios para un evento del Criterio A del DSM-5, persisten los desafÃƒÂ­os para desenredar la exposiciÃƒÂ³n al trauma del estrÃƒÂ©s, la ansiedad, y otros fenÃƒÂ³menos.

"Evaluation of Berberine as an Adjunct to TB Treatment","Tuberculosis (TB) is the global health problem with the second highest number of deaths from a communicable disease after COVID-19. Although TB is curable, poor health infrastructure, long and grueling TB treatments have led to the spread of TB pandemic with alarmingly increasing multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB prevalence. Alternative host modulating therapies can be employed to improve TB drug efficacies or dampen the exaggerated inflammatory responses to improve lung function. Here, we investigated the adjunct therapy of natural immune-modulatory compound berberine in C57BL/6 mouse model of pulmonary TB. Berberine treatment did not affect <i>Mtb</i> growth in axenic cultures; however, it showed increased bacterial killing in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages. <i>Ad libitum</i> berberine administration was beneficial to the host in combination with rifampicin and isoniazid. Berberine adjunctive treatment resulted in decreased lung pathology with no additive or synergistic effects on bacterial burdens in mice. Lung immune cell flow cytometry analysis showed that adjunctive berberine treatment decreased neutrophil, CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cell and recruited interstitial macrophage numbers. Late onset of adjunctive berberine treatment resulted in a similar phenotype with consistently reduced numbers of neutrophils both in lungs and the spleen. Together, our results suggest that berberine can be supplemented as an immunomodulatory agent depending on the disease stage and inflammatory status of the host.","Ozturk, Chia, Hazra, Saqib, Maine, Guler, Suzuki, Mishra, Brombacher, Parihar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.656419","20211108","C57BL/6 and C3Heb/FeJ Kramnik mice; anti-inflammatory; berberine; host-directed therapy; tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21576,""
"Radiological Manifestation of Neurological Complications in the Course of SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Many reports suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in neurological complications. A wide spectrum of clinical syndromes have been reported, including both central and peripheral nervous system. Such symptoms may be a consequence of a direct viral injury, secondary to systemic inflammatory response, autoimmune processes, ischemic lesions or combination of these. Anosmia and dysgeusia are highly prevalent in the early stage of infection. Cerebrovascular events in patients with COVID-19 have also been documented with increasing frequency. Some cases of parainfectious autoimmune neurologic manifestations concurrent with active SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described, including hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© and Miller-Fisher syndromes. There are also a few reports documenting encephalitis and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in the course of COVID-19. There is also a growing number of cases of patients after recovery from COVID-19 with psychosomatic disorders, manifesting with memory disfunction, cognitive functions disorders, depression or other affective disorders, which may lead to a decrease of intellectual functions. Many of these neurological manifestations of the infection are possible to distinguish using radiological imaging techniques. It plays a very important role in evaluating the course of COVID-19 as well as diagnosing respiratory complications and choosing a proper management of infected patients. Similarly, radiological techniques play crucial role in identifying the cause of neurological symptoms connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection, being one of the most important elements of diagnostics. Especially in case of the presence of nervous system implication, using radiological imaging techniques to monitor the emerging onset of various symptoms is crucial to assess the severity and scope of involvement. Quick diagnostic process and identifying complications as fast as possible in order to implement specific treatment can be crucial to avoid long-term secondary conditions and accelerate the recovery period. In this review, we present the most important neurological complications that may occur in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and summarize their radiological manifestations.","Sklinda, Dorobek, Wasilewski, DreÃ…Â¼ewski, DÃˆÂ©bicka, Walecki, Mruk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.711026","20211108","COVID-19; CT; MRI; SARS-CoV-2; neurological complications; radiological image","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21577,""
"Mental Health and the Role of Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and its related public health restrictions are having an increasingly serious impact on mental health, and measures need to be taken to curb this trend. The positive relationship between physical exercise and mental health has been well-established, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, with various restrictions, the space and facilities for physical exercise are limited. This article explores the relationship between physical exercise and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the latest research findings published in 2019-2021. We offer a novel model that consists of three central arguments. First, physical exercises during COVID-19, especially supervised exercises, are conducive to enhancing happiness and improving mental health. Second, physical exercise reduces people's anxiety, sadness and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, the maintenance and improvement of mental health are related to the intensity and frequency of physical exercise. Intensive and frequent physical exercise are conducive to maintaining mental health. Finally, this article proposes important directions for future research.","Ai, Yang, Lin, Wan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.759987","20211108","COVID-19 pandemic; coping behavior; integrated framework; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21578,""
"Analysis of Psychological Trends and Policy Recommendations of Medical Staff in Northern China in the Latter Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Aim:</b> Since the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, medical staff have faced greater psychological stress and are prone to psychological problems such as anxiety and depression, as confirmed by several studies. This study further clarifies the psychological status of Chinese medical staff during the stable phase of the pandemic through a cross-sectional investigation in a large population sample in northern China. <b>Methods:</b> Subjects: Clinical frontline medical staff from seven hospitals in Liaoning Province were recruited from November 2020 to February 2021. <b>Research Tools:</b> The research tools used were the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and General Status Questionnaire. <b>Statistical Analysis:</b> SPSS 22.0, ANOVA variance analysis, and multiple logistics regression were used for statistical analysis. <i>P</i>-values of &lt;0.05 indicated significant statistical differences. <b>Results:</b> A total of 3,144 medical staff completed the survey (599 men [19.1%] and 2,545 women [80.9%]; 1,020 doctors [32.4%] and 2,124 nurses [67.6%]). Among all subjects, the rates of anxiety and depression were 21.1% (663/3, 144) and 43.9% (1,381/3,144), respectively. Multiple logistic comparative analysis revealed that age (OR = 1.272, 95% CI = 1.036-1.561, <i>P</i> = 0.022), the need for psychological counseling (OR = 1.566, 95% CI = 1.339-1.830, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and the coexistence of depression (OR = 0.050, 95% CI = 0.038-0.066, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with anxiety. Coexisting anxiety was also associated with the occurrence of depression (OR = 0.050, 95% CI = 0.038-0.065, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> In the later stages of the pandemic in China, the occurrence rates of anxiety and depression among medical staff remain high. In addition to age, there is little correlation between anxiety or depression and general factors such as gender and profession. As a special group, medical staff show different psychological changes at various times during a stressful event. Concerning for the psychological needs of medical staff and different psychologically oriented policy implementation are needed.","Yang, Miao, Fan, Wang, Sun, Li, Wang, Wang, Lin, He","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.747557","20211108","COVID-19; China; anxiety; depression; medical staff; psychological status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21579,""
"An Emerging Preventive Mental Health Care Strategy: The Neurobiological and Functional Basis of Positive Psychological Traits","Even with the expanding burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, our approach to mental health care remains largely reactive rather than preventive. This trend is problematic because the majority of outpatient visits to primary care providers across the country is related to unmet mental health needs. Positive psychology has the potential to address these issues within mental health care and provide primary care providers with strategies to serve their patients more effectively. Positive psychology has many frameworks like hope, which can be measured using simple questionnaires in the waiting room. Moreover, there is a growing body of neurobiological evidence that lends credence to positive psychology concepts in the context of differential neuronal activation patterns. Many positive psychological instruments not only have high construct validity but also have connections to observable neurobiological differences tied to differences in psychosocial functioning. Despite the current evidence, we still need robust research that explores if such psychometric measurements and related interventions lead to clinically significant and favorable health outcomes in patients outside of controlled environments.","Duncan, Daugherty, Carmichael","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.728797","20211108","clinical settings; hope theory; neurobiology; positive psychology; preventive mental health care; psychometrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21580,""
"The Effectiveness of a Centering Meditation Intervention on College Stress and Mindfulness: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<b>Background:</b> Mental health concerns are climbing steadily on college campuses, and universities do not have the staffing and financial resources to address the overwhelming needs of students seeking counseling services. College counselors generally must place students on waitlists or refer them to external resources. Further, during the COVID-19 pandemic, university counselors have been working tirelessly to treat students through online formats. Alternative, online, evidence-based interventions offer college counselors a significant advantage in effectively treating their students. We seek to expand the empirical evidence for mindfulness interventions through online formats for the college population. We registered the study (ISRCTN13587045) at www.isrctn.com. <b>Objective:</b> We examined the effectiveness of a unique online centering meditation and its impact on stress and trait mindfulness in the college population. <b>Methods:</b> Through a randomized controlled trial, the treatment group participated in a 4-week intervention of centering for 10 min each morning and night. We measured stress and mindfulness in both groups through the Perceived Stress Scale and Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. <b>Results:</b> The centering meditation treatment had a statistically significant positive impact on stress and mindfulness compared to a waitlist control group. The meditation group had an average of 64% adherence rate. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study findings indicate that individuals who participate in a 4-week online centering intervention showed improved levels of stress and trait mindfulness over time. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> WHO International Clinical Registry Platform, identifier: ISRCTN13587045.","Dorais, Gutierrez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.720824","20211108","centering meditation; college health; efficacy; intervention delivery; linear mixed model; online mindfulness; randomized controlled trial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21581,""
"Belief in Protecting Others and Social Perceptions of Face Mask Wearing Were Associated With Frequent Mask Use in the Early Stages of the COVID Pandemic in the UK","Face masks are now seen as a key tool in the world's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, during the early stages of the outbreak, face mask use in the United Kingdom (UK) was significantly lower than that of countries equally impacted by the virus. We were interested to explore whether social cognitions played a role in levels of mask wearing. A cross-sectional online survey of UK adults (<i>n</i>=908) was conducted in July 2020. Estimated face mask use and thoughts about wearing face masks were assessed using measures developed for this study. Participants also answered questions about their general mood, social anxiety and basic demographic data. Multiple regression was used to examine factors associated with mask wearing. Participants' estimated mask wearing was low when in public spaces, such as the park (17%) or walking on the high street (36%). However, broadly fitting with UK guidance at the time, rates were considerably higher when in situations of closer proximity to others, such as on public transport (94%), in a shop or cafÃƒÂ© (62%), when speaking to somebody in an enclosed public space (67%) or in a busy area when social distancing was not possible (79%). When looking at estimated mask wearing when in proximity to others, positive social cognitions (e.g., I'll look confident and competent wearing a mask) were associated with more wearing, whereas negative social cognitions (e.g., I'll look anxious, I'll look foolish) were associated with less wearing. These results remained after controlling for factors that have indicated increased risk from COVID-19 (age, gender, ethnicity, presence of a health condition or pregnancy), belief about the health benefit for others and levels of depression and social anxiety. The largest predictors of mask wearing were the amount of people believed wearing a mask would keep others safe and the presence of an underlying health condition. The study findings indicate that future public health campaigns would benefit from a focus on strengthening beliefs about the protective benefits of masks, but also promoting positive social messages about wearing in public (e.g., mask wearing means you are confident and competent).","Warnock-Parkes, Thew, Clark","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.680552","20211108","COVID Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 19; beliefs; cognition; face-mask; social fear; social perceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21582,""
"An Observational Study of OCD Patients Treated With Cognitive Behavioral Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background and Objectives:</b> While the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for general mental health and the increase in anxiety and depression are clear, less is known about the potential effect of the pandemic on OCD. The purpose of this study is to collect new data to monitor the symptomatic status of patients with OCD during the period of emergency due to COVID-19 and to make a comparison between two psychodiagnostic evaluations. <b>Methods:</b> Eleven OCD patients and their psychotherapists were recruited. All patients had a specific psychodiagnostic assessment for OCD (SCL-90; OCI-R; Y-BOCS self-report) performed between December 2019 and January 2020 (t0), and undertook cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure and prevention of response protocol (ERP) before the lockdown. The psychodiagnostic assessment carried out at t0 was re-administered (t1) to all patients, together with a set of qualitative questions collected through an online survey. The respective therapists were asked to document the status of the therapy and the monitoring of symptoms through use of a semi-structured interview (Y-BOCS) and a qualitative interview. Non-parametric analyses were conducted. <b>Results:</b> Patients reported a significant decrease in OCD symptoms. Data analysis showed a decrease in the scores across t0 and at t1 on the Y-BOCS (SR) total self-report, and on OCD symptoms' severity assessed by means of the OCI-r and SCL-90 r OC subscale, for 11 participants. Relating to the measures detected by psychotherapists, marginally significant improvements and lower scores were found in the Y-BOCS (I). An improvement in symptoms was noticed by 90.9% of the clinical sample; this was confirmed by 45.4% of the therapists, who claimed moderate progress in their patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> The data collected through standardized measurements at two different times, albeit relative to a small sample, assume relevance from a clinical point of view. In the literature, some studies document the worsening of OCD. However, in many studies, the type of treatment, the detection time, and the intervention period are not well-specified. These results confirm the effectiveness of CBT/ERP as an elective treatment for OCD through a specific intervention procedure.","Zaccari, Gragnani, Pellegrini, Caiazzo, D'Arienzo, Magno, Femia, Mancini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.755744","20211108","COVID-19; Y-BOCS; adults; cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); obsessive-compulsive symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21583,""
"Genetic Predisposition Between COVID-19 and Four Mental Illnesses: A Bidirectional, Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Although it has long been suspected that COVID-19 could contribute to the development of mental illness, and individuals with a pre-existing mental illness may have a higher risk of and poorer outcomes from COVID-19 infection, no evidence has established a causal association between them thus far. <b>Methods:</b> To investigate associations in support of a causal association between the severity of COVID-19 and mental illnesses, we leveraged large-scale genetic summary data from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<i>n</i> = 55,374), schizophrenia (<i>n</i> = 77,096), bipolar disorder (<i>n</i> = 51,710), and depression (<i>n</i> = 173,005), based on a previous observational study. The random-effects inverse-variance weighted method was conducted for the main analyses, with a complementary analysis of the weighted median and MR-Egger approaches and multiple sensitivity analyses assessing horizontal pleiotropy and removing outliers in two different COVID-19 databases. <b>Results:</b> The Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis indicated that ADHD [odds ratio (OR) = 1.297; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.029-1.634; <i>p</i> = 0.028] increased the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. A similar association was obtained in MR sensitivity analyses of the weighted median. In addition, genetically predicted COVID-19 was significantly associated with schizophrenia (OR = 1.043; 95% CI, 1.005-1.082; <i>p</i> = 0.027). <b>Conclusions:</b> Although many studies have reported a causal relationship between COVID-19 and mental illness, our study shows that this increased risk is modest. However, considering the characteristics of ADHD that might further increase the individuals' vulnerability to being infected by COVID-19, the ongoing massive worldwide exposure to COVID-19, and the high burden of schizophrenia, we believe that it is necessary to offer preventative measures to these populations and to provide more evidence in understanding the neurological impact of COVID-19.","Liu, Tan, Liu, Wang, Hua, Qian","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.746276","20211108","COVID-19; GWAS; Mendelian randomization; mental illness; risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21584,""
"The Moderating Role of Resilience in the Personality-Mental Health Relationship During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Associations between personality traits and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress) have rarely been assessed in a population-representative sample of a high-income country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, as far as we know, the role of health and social behaviors as well as resilience in the personality-mental health relationship has yet to be explored. <b>Methods:</b> A representative sample of 1,828 residents of Luxembourg filled in validated scales to assess personality traits and resilience, depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, loneliness, and stress, indicating mental health, in mid-April 2020. <b>Results:</b> Approximately 21% of the participants scored above the cut-off for moderate depression and moderate loneliness. Moderate anxiety and moderate stress were present in 6.2 and 0.3% of the participants, respectively. Higher-educated respondents and those living in higher-value housing reported better mental health. Agreeableness and conscientiousness were most consistently associated with better mental health; neuroticism was most consistently associated with worse mental health. Spending more time on social media was also associated with elevated levels of all four mental health outcomes. Social and health behaviors did not change the personality-mental health relationships. Resilience moderated some of the personality-mental health associations, most consistently in neuroticism. <b>Conclusions:</b> Findings suggest educational and socioeconomic inequalities in mental health in a nationally representative sample during the COVID-19 confinement measures. Personality traits, particularly agreeableness, conscientiousness, and low neuroticism were associated with mental health. The moderating role of resilience in the personality-mental health relationship suggests intervention potential to improve mental health during periods of confinement.","Pauly, Ribeiro, SchrÃƒÂ¶der, Pauly, KrÃƒÂ¼ger, Leist","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.745636","20211108","Big Five; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; mental health; personality; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21585,""
"Anxiety and Depressive Disorders and Quality of Life Assessment of Poles-A Study Covering Two Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> More than a year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) viral pneumonia, the world is still engulfed by the pandemic, and we know that this condition has an enormous impact not only on individuals but also on the social order in virtually every aspect of daily life, deteriorating our mental health. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the subjective assessment of the quality of life in the different stages of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic based on a nationwide online survey. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The study was conducted using an original questionnaire assessing the sociodemographic status and standardized psychometric tools: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). The study was conducted in two stages corresponding to the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> In total, 4,083 respondents participated in the survey. The first observation stage took place between 17 and 26 April 2020 and comprised 2,457 respondents; the repeated survey that took place between 1 and 30 December 2020 comprised 1,626 respondents. In both cases, women constituted the majority of respondents (82.5% in the first stage and 79.6% in the second stage). Statistically significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety were found in second stage, with mean scores of BDI and GAD-7. In the case of MANSA, participants in the different stages of the pandemic showed no significant differences in terms of mean scores. However, women were more susceptible to developing the depression and anxiety symptoms and it was obtained in both waves of the pandemic <b>Conclusions:</b> As the Covid-19 pandemic progressed, there was higher level of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Poles.","Babicki, BogudziÃ…â€žska, Kowalski, Mastalerz-Migas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.704248","20211108","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21586,""
"The Aftermath: Post-pandemic Psychiatric Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a South Korean Perspective","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our everyday life. Along with the fear of getting infected or of having loved ones infected, the lifestyle changes and the socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic have profound impact on mental health of the general population. While numerous studies on immediate psychological responses to COVID-19 are being published, there is a lack of discussion on its possible long-term sequelae. In this study, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed longitudinal studies that examined mental health of the general population prior to and during the pandemic. Furthermore, we explored the long-term psychiatric implications of the pandemic with data from South Korea. Our analysis showed that the number of suicidal deaths during the pandemic was lower than the previous years in many countries, which is in contrast with the increased depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in the general population in South Korea as well as in other countries. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a possibility of delayed impacts. The post-traumatic stress, long-term consequences of social restrictions, and maladaptive response to the ""new normal"" are discussed in the paper. COVID-19 being an unprecedented global crisis, more research and international collaboration are needed to understand, to treat, and to prevent its long-term effects on our mental health.","Min, Jeong, Kim, Koo, Ahn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.671722","20211108","COVID-19; South Korea; general populations; honeymoon phase; mental health; new normal; post-pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21587,""

"How personality affects reaction A mental health behavioral insight review during the Pandemic","The fear caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is changing our psychology and behavior. This ongoing negative event, imposing restrictions such as home isolation and social distancing, can result in heightened anxiety, depression and a sense of loneliness, with immediate effects on mental health. This study investigates adolescents' reaction to the pandemic, by analyzing the behavioral mental health trends of depression, anxiety and sense of loneliness, in relation to personality traits. After controlling for demographics and family background, our results reveal strong relationships between several personality traits and psychological health indicators, during the pandemic in Greece. A total of 419 secondary school students (aged 12-18) were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Big Five Inventory for measuring personality (BFI) and the Children's Loneliness Questionnaire (CLS) during two time periods within pandemic. Overall, it appears that depression increased significantly in line with the escalation of the pandemic, while anxiety decreased, with the strongest predictors being the personality variables of extraversion, neuroticism and openness. Surprisingly, the study also revealed that the level of extraversion has a positive effect on changes in anxiety, while a negative one on changes in depression. On the other hand, neuroticism and openness seem to negatively correlate with anxiety changes and positively with depression changes. These findings highlight the importance of considering these variables in addressing individuals' mental health behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic and elucidate the literature by offering a deeper understanding of the strong relationship between personality, depression and anxiety.","Mourelatos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02425-9","20211108","Anxiety; Behavior; Big Five Personality traits; Covid-19; Depression; Individual differences; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21589,""
"Better Access: substantial shift to telehealth for allied mental health services during COVID-19 in Australia","ObjectiveTo quantify the introduction of new, temporary telehealth Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items delivered by allied mental health professionals (AMHPs) through the Better Access initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.MethodsMBS-item service data for clinical psychologists, registered psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists were extracted for existing face-to-face, remote videoconferencing and new, temporary telehealth items for the study period April-December 2020. The total number of services in Australia were compared with the baseline period of 2019. Given the second wave of increased COVID-19 infections and prolonged lockdowns in the state of Victoria, we compared the per capita rate of services for Victoria versus other states and territories.ResultsDuring the study period, there was an overall 11% increase in all allied mental health consultations. Telehealth use was substantial with 37% of all sessions conducted by videoconferencing or telephone consultations. The peak month was April 2020, during the first wave of increasing COVID-19 cases, when 53% of consultations were via telehealth. In terms of Victoria, there was an overall 15% increase in all consultations compared with the same period in 2019.ConclusionsAllied mental health services via MBS-subsidised telehealth items greatly increased during 2020. Telehealth is an effective, flexible option for receiving psychological care which should be made available beyond the pandemic.What is known about the topic?Little is known about the transition to and delivery of new, temporary Better Access telehealth services by AMHPs during the COVID-19 pandemic.What does this paper add?This paper provides valuable data on the rapid transition to telehealth by AMHPs to provide levels of psychological care commensurate to 2019. Data extends from April to December 2020 and includes the overall number of services provided for each profession, and the proportion of services delivered via face-to-face and telehealth. We highlight the impact of the new, additional items which temporarily raised the cap on sessions. We also illustrate the substantial use of the scheme by those living in Victoria who experienced greater COVID-19-related hardships.What are the implications for practitioners?The continuation of Better Access telehealth services by AMHPs has the potential to extend the reach of mental health care beyond the pandemic.","Reay, Kisely, Looi","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH21162","20211108","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21590,""
"Factors influencing access and utilization of health services among older people during the COVID -Ã¢â‚¬â€°19 pandemic: a scoping review","Access to healthcare and service utilization are both considered essential factors for improving the general health and wellbeing of older people, especially at the time of COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study is to explore factors affecting healthcare access and health service utilization for older people during the pandemic. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase were systematically searched for relevant articles. Access, utilization, health, elderly and COVID-19 were used as keywords in the search strategy. A total of 4308 articles were identified through the initial database search; 50 articles were included in the review as passing the eligibility criteria. The searches were conducted up to August 2021. Data extraction was performed, and evidence was descriptively illustrated. Thematic analysis was used to explore factors influencing the elderly's access and utilization of healthcare services, using Max QDA<sub>10</sub>, a qualitative analysis software. Among articles included in the review (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50), a majority of the studies were from the United States (36%), followed by India (8%). According to the main healthcare services, a large number of articles (18%) were related to mental health services, followed by digital health services (16%). Factors were identified at an individual, provider and systems level. Seven main themes emerged from the thematic analysis, as determinants of elderly's access and utilization of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic. These included: access to non-COVID related services, access to COVID-related services, literacy and education, accommodation challenges, perceived attitudes of aging, and policies and structures, and social determinants. Mental health and digital health services were identified as major issues influencing or contributing to or influencing older people's health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also argue on the importance of a rounded view, as attention to a range of factors is vital for policy decisions towards sustainable care and equitable interventions for improving the health of older people.","Bastani, Mohammadpour, Samadbeik, Bastani, Rossi-Fedele, Balasubramanian","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00719-9","20211108","Access; COVID-19; Elderly; Healthcare services; Utilization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21591,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown measures on lifestyle behaviors and wellbeing in children and adolescents with severe obesity","COVID-19 lockdown measures have large impact on lifestyle behaviors and wellbeing of children. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on eating styles and behaviors, physical activity (PA), screen time, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children (0-18 years) with severe obesity. During the first COVID-19 wave (April 2020), validated questionnaires were completed and semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with parents of children with severe obesity (adult BMI-equivalent Ã¢â€°Â¥35kg/m2) and/or with the children themselves. Changes in pre-pandemic versus lockdown scores of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire Children (DEBQ-C), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM), and Dutch PA Questionnaire were assessed. Qualitative analyses were performed according to the Grounded Theory. Ninety families were approached of which 83 families were included. Characteristics of the included children were: mean age 11.2 Ã‚Â± 4.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 52% female, mean BMI SD-score +3.8 Ã‚Â± 1.0. Emotional, restrained, and external eating styles, HRQoL, and (non-educational) screen time did not change on group level (all p&gt;0.05). However, weekly PA decreased (mean difference -1.9 hours/week, p=0.02), mostly in adolescents. In the majority of children, mean weekly PA decreased to Ã¢â€°Â¤2 hours/week. Children with high emotional and external eating scores during lockdown or pre-existent psychosocial problems had the lowest HRQoL (p&lt;0.01). Qualitative analyses revealed an increased demand for food in a significant proportion of children (n=21), mostly in children &lt;10 years (19/21). This was often attributed to loss of daily structure and perceived stress. Families who reported no changes (n=15) or improved eating behaviors (n=11) attributed this to already existing strict eating schemes that they kept adhering to during lockdown. This study shows differing responses to COVID-19 lockdown measures in children with severe obesity. On group level, PA significantly decreased and in substantial minorities eating styles and HRQoL deteriorated. Children with pre-existent psychosocial problems or pre-pandemic high external or emotional eating scores were most at risk. These children and their families should be targeted by health care professionals to minimize negative physical and mental health consequences.","Welling, Abawi, van den Eynde, van Rossum, Halberstadt, Brandsma, Kleinendorst, van den Akker, van der Voorn","https://doi.org/10.1159/000520718","20211107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21592,""
"Changes in Emergency Department Visits, Diagnostic Groups, and 28-Day Mortality Associated With the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Territory-Wide, Retrospective, Cohort Study","We aimed to evaluate and characterize the scale and relationships of emergency department (ED) visits and excess mortality associated with the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the territory of Hong Kong. We conducted a territory-wide, retrospective cohort study to compare ED visits and the related impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality. All ED visits at 18 public acute hospitals in Hong Kong between January 1 and August 31 of 2019 (n=1,426,259) and 2020 (n=1,035,562) were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality in the 28 days following an ED visit. The secondary outcomes were weekly number of ED visits and diagnosis-specific mortality. ED visits decreased by 27.4%, from 1,426,259 in 2019 to 1,035,562 in 2020. Overall period mortality increased from 28,686 (2.0%) in 2019 to 29,737 (2.9%) in 2020. The adjusted odds ratio for 28-day, all-cause mortality in the pandemic period of 2020 relative to 2019 was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.28). Both sexes, age more than 45 years, all triage categories, all social classes, all ED visit periods, epilepsy (odds ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.07), lower respiratory tract infection, and airway disease had higher adjusted ORs for all-cause mortality. A significant reduction in ED visits in the first 8 months of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in deaths certified in the ED.

"Innovations in virtual education for clinical and simulation learning","The global impact of COVID-19 forced nursing education to provide an alternative for scheduled clinical experiences during the Spring and Fall of 2020. Many programs selected the pre-packaged, web-based solutions at the onset of the pandemic due to the uncertainty and recommendation of social distancing. Clinical and simulation faculty began to look for educational alternatives to provide meaningful learning experiences that more closely replicated clinical learning because students expressed displeasure with the asynchronous web-based options. This article outlines how an innovative partnership between clinical faculty, simulation faculty, and the Theatre Department modified an in-person simulation activity designed for groups of two students into a web-based ""clinical"" experience that included the assigned clinical faculty, eight nursing students, and one simulated patient. This active learning strategy was able to meet the course objectives, required little additional resources, and most importantly, underwent positive evaluation by the weary, screen-based learners.","Cowperthwait, Graber, Carlsen, Cowperthwait, Mekulski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.profnurs.2021.06.010","20211107","Clinical education; Mental health; Psychiatric nursing; Simulated participant; Simulated patient; Simulation; Standardized patient; Web-based education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21594,""
"No one is safe! But who's more susceptible? Locus of control moderates pandemic perceptions' effects on job insecurity and psychosocial factors amongst MENA hospitality frontliners: a PLS-SEM approach","The research aimed to formulate and test a model concerning COVID-19 perceptions effects on job insecurity and a set of psychosocial factors comprising anxiety, depression, job burnout and job alienation in the Middle East and North African (hereafter, MENA) regional context. Also, the study attempted to examine whether locus of control can moderate these hypothesised linkages amongst customer service employees working in MENA hospitality organisations. The study is based on a sample of 885 responses to an online survey and Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The main findings show the existence of a significant correlation between COVID perceptions and job insecurity and all psychosocial factors, i.e., more intense COVID-19 perceptions accompany higher levels of job insecurity, anxiety, depression, job burnout and job alienation. Furthermore, our results revealed that, in pandemic time, hospitality customer service employees with external locus of control are more likely to suffer higher alienation, anxiety and depression than those with internal locus of control. The research originality centres on the establishment that COVID-19 has a severe negative impact within the hospitality customer service labour force (in the MENA region). These effects were more profound for participants who claimed external locus of control than those with internal locus of control.","Mahmoud, Reisel, Hack-Polay, Fuxman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12071-2","20211107","COVID-19; Hospitality sector; Individual differences; Job insecurity; Locus of control; Middle East; North Africa; Personality; Psychosocial factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-09","",21595,""
"Digital mental health literacy -program for the first-year medical students' wellbeing: a one group quasi-experimental study","Medical students are prone to mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and their psychological burden is mainly related to their highly demanding studies. Interventions are needed to improve medical students' mental health literacy (MHL) and wellbeing. This study assessed the digital Transitions, a MHL program for medical students that covered blended life skills and mindfulness activities. This was a one group, quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study. The study population was 374 first-year students who started attending the medical faculty at the University of Turku, Finland, in 2018-2019. Transitions was provided as an elective course and 220 students chose to attend and 182 agreed to participate in our research. Transitions included two 60-minute lectures, four weeks apart, with online self-learning material in between. The content focused on life and academic skills, stress management, positive mental health, mental health problems and disorders. It included mindfulness audiotapes. Mental health knowledge, stigma and help-seeking questionnaires were used to measure MHL. The Perceived Stress Scale and General Health Questionnaire measured the students' stress and health, respectively. A single group design, with repeated measurements of analysis of variance, was used to analyze the differences in the mean outcome scores for the 158 students who completed all three stages: the pre-test (before the first lecture), the post-test (after the second lecture) and the two-month follow-up evaluation. The students' mean scores for mental health knowledge improved (-1.6, 95% Cl -1.9 to -1.3, P&lt;.001) and their emotional symptoms were alleviated immediately after the program (0.5, 95% Cl 0.0 to 1.1, P=.040). The changes were maintained at the two-month follow up (-1.7, 95% Cl -2.0 to -1.4, P&lt;.001 and 1.0, 95% Cl 0.2 to 1.8, P=.019, respectively). The students' stress levels reduced (P=.022) and their attitudes towards help-seeking improved after the program (P&lt;.001), but these changes were not maintained at the two-month follow up. The stigma of mental illness did not change during the study (P=.13). The digital Transitions program was easily integrated into the university curriculum and it improved the students' mental health literacy and wellbeing. The program may respond to the increasing global need for universal digital services, especially during the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
