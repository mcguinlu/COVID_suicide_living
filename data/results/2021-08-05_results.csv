"Self-reported neurocognitive symptoms during COVID-19 lockdown and its associated factors in a sample of psychiatric patients Results from the BRIS-MHC study","Lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on mental health. The aim was to assess self-reported neurocognitive symptoms during the lockdown and identify associated vulnerable and protective factors in a sample of psychiatric patients in a Spanish population. These results are part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Neurocognitive symptoms were assessed through an online survey considering the five items that represented self-reported neurocognitive complaints. We split the sample into two groups based on the severity of the self-reported neurocognitive complaints: intact cognitive function/mild cognitive impairment (CI-) and moderate/severe cognitive impairment (CI+). Univariate analyses were used to compare both groups in terms of sociodemographic and clinical variables. Multiple logistic regression models were carried out to identify clinical variables and coping strategies associated with neurocognitive symptoms. 198 patients with different psychiatric diagnoses were included in this study. One hundred seventeen patients were classified in the CI- group and 81 in the CI+ group. Depressive symptoms and negative psychotic-like symptoms were vulnerable factors for neurocognitive impairment. Coping strategies of performing physical activity, carrying out relaxing activities and maintaining a routine were protective factors against cognitive impairment. Lockdown situation negatively impact on neurocognitive function. Psychopathological symptoms and coping strategies were associated with neurocognitive symptoms during lockdown in subjects with psychiatric illness. The early treatment of psychopathological symptoms in psychiatric patients and promoting coping strategies during lockdown should be considered an intervention strategy against cognitive impairment.","Montejo, SolÃƒÂ©, Verdolini, MartÃƒÂ­nez-ArÃƒÂ¡n, BonnÃƒÂ­n, Radua, MartÃƒÂ­n-Villalba, Williams, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Rizo, Mezquida, Bernardo, Vieta, Torrent, Amoretti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.07.006","20210804","Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Cognition; Lockdown; Mental illness; Psychiatric disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16794,""
"Prevalence and risk factors for mental health symptoms in community epidemic prevention workers during the postpandemic era of COVID-19 in China","Few people have paid attention to community epidemic prevention workers in the postpandemic era of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and risk factors for mental health symptoms in community epidemic prevention workers during the postpandemic era. Mental health status was evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey. The results showed that a considerable proportion of community epidemic prevention workers reported symptoms of depression (39.7%), anxiety (29.5%), high stress (51.1%), insomnia (30.8%), and burnout (53.3%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety in community epidemic prevention workers was higher than in community residents. Among community epidemic prevention workers, short sleep duration was a risk factor for depression, anxiety, high stress and insomnia. Concurrent engagement in work unrelated to epidemic prevention and current use of hypnotics were risk factors for depression, anxiety and insomnia. Our study suggests that during the postpandemic era, the mental health problems of community epidemic prevention workers are more serious than those of community residents. Several variables, such as short sleep duration and concurrent engagement in work unrelated to epidemic prevention, are associated with mental health among community epidemic prevention workers.","Yang, Liu, Chen, Zhang, Zhong, Du, Zhang, Mo, Chen, Ning, Du","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114132","20210804","Anxiety; COVID-19; Community epidemic prevention workers; Depression; Insomnia; Mental health symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16795,""
"Is Google Trends a useful tool for tracking mental and social distress during a public health emergency? A time-series analysis","Google Trends data are increasingly used by researchers as an indicator of population mental health, but few studies have investigated the validity of this approach during a public health emergency. Relative search volumes (RSV) for the topics depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and abuse were obtained from Google Trends. We used graphical and time-series approaches to compare daily trends in searches for these topics against population measures of these outcomes recorded using validated self-report scales (PHQ-9; GAD-7; UCLA-3) in a weekly survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â ~70,000) of the impact COVID-19 on psychological and social experiences in the UK population (21/03/2020 to 21/08/ 2020). Self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, self-harm/suicidal ideation, self-harm, loneliness and abuse decreased during the period studied. There was no evidence of an association between self-reported anxiety, self-harm, abuse and RSV on Google Trends. Trends in Google topic RSV for depression and suicidal ideation were inversely associated with self-reports of these outcomes (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03 and pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04, respectively). However, there was statistical and graphical evidence that self-report and Google searches for loneliness (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) tracked one another. No age/sex breakdown of Google Trends data available. Survey respondents were not representative of the UK population and no pre-pandemic data were available. Google Trends data do not appear to be a useful indicator of changing levels of population mental health during a public health emergency, but may have some value as an indicator of loneliness.","Knipe, Gunnell, Evans, John, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.086","20210804","Anxiety; Depression; Domestic violence; Loneliness; Mental Health; Pandemic; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16796,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated fear, panic, distress, anxiety, and depression among many people in Bangladesh. In this cross-sectional study, we examined factors associated with different levels of psychological impact as a result of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. From April 1 to 30, 2020, we used a self-administered online questionnaire to collect data from 10,609 respondents. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents, we categorized the levels of impact as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the associated factors. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe psychological impact was 10.2%, 4.8%, and 45.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of reporting normal vs mild, moderate, or severe psychological impact were 5.9 times higher for people living in the Chittagong Division, 1.7 times higher for women with lower education levels, 3.0 times higher among those who were divorced or separated, 1.8 times higher for those working full time, and 2.4 times higher for those living in shared apartments. The odds of reporting a psychological impact were also higher among people who did not enforce protective measures inside the home, those in self-quarantine, those who did not wear face masks, and those who did not comply with World Health Organization precautionary measures. Increased psychological health risks due to COVID-19 were significantly higher among people who experienced chills, headache, cough, breathing difficulties, dizziness, and sore throat before data collection. Our results showed that 1 in 2 respondents experienced a significant psychological impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health researchers should consider these factors when targeting interventions that would have a protective effect on the individual's psychological health during a pandemic or future disease outbreak.","Abir, Osuagwu, Kalimullah, Yazdani, Husain, Basak, Goson, Mamun, Permarupan, Milton, Rahman, Rahman, Agho","https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0205","20210804","COVID-19; Consequence management; Epidemic management/response; Mental health; Psychological impacts; Public health preparedness/response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16797,""
"COVID-19 and psychological distress: Lessons for India","The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly altered the routine of life and caused unanticipated changes resulting in severe psychological responses and mental health crisis. The study aimed to identify psycho-social factors that predicted distress among Indian population during the spread of novel Coronavirus. An online survey was conducted to assess the predictors of distress. A global logistic regression model was built, by identifying significant factors from individual logistic regression models built on various groups of independent variables. The prediction capability of the model was compared with the random forest classifier. The respondents (N = 1060) who are more likely to be distressed, are in the age group of 21-35 years, are females (OR = 1.425), those working on site (OR = 1.592), have pre-existing medical conditions (OR = 1.682), do not have health insurance policy covering COVID-19 (OR = 1.884), have perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (OR = 1.239), have lack of trust in government (OR = 1.246) and whose basic needs' fulfillment are unsatisfactory (OR = 1.592). The ones who are less likely to be distressed, have higher social support and psychological capital. Random forest classifier correctly classified 2.3% and 17.1% of people under lower and higher distress respectively, with respect to logistic regression. This study confirms the prevalence of high distress experienced by Indians at the time of COVID-19 and provides pragmatic implications for psychological health at macro and micro levels during an epidemiological crisis.","Anand, Verma, Aggarwal, Nanjundappa, Rai","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255683","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16798,""
"Mental health among healthcare workers and other vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic and other coronavirus outbreaks: A rapid systematic review","Although most countries and healthcare systems worldwide have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, some groups of the population may be more vulnerable to detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental health than others. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence currently available from systematic reviews on the impact of COVID-19 and other coronavirus outbreaks on mental health for groups of the population thought to be at increased risk of detrimental mental health impacts. We conducted a systematic review of reviews on adults and children residing in a country affected by a coronavirus outbreak and belonging to a group considered to be at risk of experiencing mental health inequalities. Data were collected on symptoms or diagnoses of any mental health condition, quality of life, suicide or attempted suicide. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in the online PROSPERO database prior to commencing the review (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=194264). We included 25 systematic reviews. Most reviews included primary studies of hospital workers from multiple countries. Reviews reported variable estimates for the burden of symptoms of mental health problems among acute healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients with physical comorbidities, and children and adolescents. No evaluations of interventions were identified. Risk- and protective factors, mostly for healthcare workers, showed the importance of personal factors, the work environment, and social networks for mental health. This review of reviews based on primary studies conducted in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of evidence on mental health interventions and mental health impacts on vulnerable groups in the population.","Uphoff, Lombardo, Johnston, Weeks, Rodgers, Dawson, Seymour, Kousoulis, Churchill","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254821","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16799,""
"The Persistence of The Impact of COVID-19 Related Distress, Mood Inertia and Loneliness on Mental Health During a Post-lockdown Phase in Germany: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 increased global mental health problems. However, little is known about mental health problems during a low incidence phase without strict public health measures. We aim to investigate whether COVID-19 related risk factors for mental health problems remain beyond lockdown measures. We targeted a vulnerable population, who is at risk of developing low mental health and assessed their daily dynamics of mood and emotion regulation after strict lockdown. During a post-lockdown phase in Germany (between 8 August 2020 and 1 November 2020), we conducted an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with 131 participants, who experienced at least mild COVID-19 related distress and loneliness. To estimate negative mood inertia, we built a lag 1 three-level autoregressive model. We found that information exposure and active daily COVID-19 cases did not have an impact on negative mood amid a post-lockdown phase. However, there was a day-to-day carry over effect of negative mood. Also, worrying about COVID-19, feeling restricted by COVID-19, and feeling lonely increased negative mood. Mental health of a vulnerable population remains to be challenged by COVID-19 related stressors after strict lockdown. This study highlights the need to protect mental health during a post-pandemic phase.","Haucke, Liu, Heinzel","https://doi.org/10.2196/29419","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16800,""

"Domestic Violence and Mental Health During COVID-19 in Bangladesh","The Lock down, work from home and other unprecedented events have created multi layer and multidimensional impact on our personal, social and occupational life. The mental health condition is deteriorating, the financial crisis is mounting up and staying at home is creating potential threat for domestic violence. In Bangladesh where domestic violence is already prevalent, the lockdown period and stay at home orders can cause more opportunities and scope for perpetrators. In this study, we aimed to find out the prevalence of domestic violence during this COVID-19 period and its relation with mental health. We conducted an online survey among the Bangladeshi population to understand the pattern of domestic violence and its relation on mental health during August to September 2020. The questionnaire was disseminated through three websites and social media. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS 22.0). We found 36.8% respondents faced domestic violence at any time of their lives and 24.2% of the participants experienced domestic violence during this period of lockdown. More than 96% and 93% of the participants respectively considered the victims and the perpetrator need mental health care. However, only 25% of them has the idea of how and where they could avail the mental health service. Domestic violence is one of the old hidden psychosocial and health problems and the crisis has increased during this COVID-19 crisis. The cry for mental health support is obvious and it is necessary to provide them the service to them in a convenient and cost-effective manner. Telepsychiatry can be good option for ensuring immediate mental health support.","Rashid Soron, Ashiq, Al-Hakeem, Chowdhury, Uddin Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.2196/24624","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16802,""
"""It's like the stages of grief"": A Qualitative Study of the Psychological Experience of Frontline Perioperative Healthcare Staff in Responding to COVID-19","The rapid spread of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) has presented immeasurable challenges to healthcare workers who remain at the frontline of the pandemic. A rapidly evolving body of literature has quantitatively demonstrated significant psychological impacts of the pandemic on healthcare workers. However, little is known about the lived experience of the pandemic for frontline medical staff. This study aimed to explore the qualitative experience of peri-operative staff from a large trauma hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Inductive thematic analysis using a critical realist approach was used to analyse data from nine semi-structured interviews. Four key themes were identified. Hospital preparedness related to the perceived readiness of the hospital to respond to the pandemic and encompassed key subthemes around communication of policy changes, team leadership and resource availability. Perceptions of readiness contributed to the perceived psychological impacts of the pandemic, which were highly varied and ranged from anger to anxiety. A number of coping strategies were identified in response to psychological impacts which incorporated both internal and external coping mechanisms. Finally, adaptation with time reflected change and growth over time, and encompassed all other themes. While frontline staff and hospitals have rapidly marshalled a response to managing the virus, relatively less consideration was seen regarding staff mental health in our study. Findings highlight the vulnerability of healthcare workers in response to the pandemic and reinforce the need for a coordinated approach to managing mental health.","Withiel, Barson, Ng, Segal, Williams, Krieser, Lee, Mezzavia, Sindoni, Chen, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.2196/27166","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16803,""
"Exploring the Expression Differences Between Professionals and Laypeople Toward the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Text Mining Approach","COVID-19 is still rampant all over the world. Until now, the COVID-19 vaccine is the most promising measure to subdue contagion and achieve herd immunity. However, public vaccination intention is suboptimal. A clear division lies between medical professionals and laypeople. While most professionals eagerly promote the vaccination campaign, some laypeople exude suspicion, hesitancy, and even opposition toward COVID-19 vaccines. This study aims to employ a text mining approach to examine expression differences and thematic disparities between the professionals and laypeople within the COVID-19 vaccine context. We collect 3,196 answers under 65 filtered questions concerning the COVID-19 vaccine from a China-based Q&amp;A forum named Zhihu. The questions were classified into five categories depending on their contents and description, including adverse reactions, vaccination, vaccine effectiveness, social implications of vaccine, and vaccine development. Respondents were also manually coded into two groups: professional and laypeople. Automated text analysis was performed to calculate fundamental expression characteristics of the two groups, containing answer length, attitude distribution, and high-frequency words. Besides, structural topic modeling (STM), as a cutting-edge branch in the topic modeling family, was utilized to extract topics under each question category, along with evaluating thematic disparities between the two groups. Laypeople are more prevailing in the COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion. Regarding differences in expression characteristics, the professionals posted longer answers and showed a conservative stance towards vaccine effectiveness compared to laypeople. Laypeople mentioned countries more frequently, while professionals were inclined to raise medical jargon. STM discloses prominent topics under each question category. The statistical tests demonstrated that laypeople preferred the ""safety of Chinese-made vaccine"" topic and other vaccine-related issues in other countries. However, the professionals paid more attention to medical principles and professional standards behind the COVID-19 vaccine. Respecting topics associated with the social implications of vaccines, the two groups showed no significant difference. Our findings indicate that laypeople and professionals share some common grounds but also hold divergent focuses toward the COVID-19 vaccine issue. Those incongruities can be summarized as ""qualitatively different"" in perspective rather than ""quantitatively different"" in scientific knowledge. Among those questions closely associated with medical expertise, the ""qualitatively different"" characteristic is quite conspicuous. This study boosts the current understanding of how the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine in a more nuanced way. Online Q&amp;A forum is a bonanza to examine perception discrepancies among various identities. STM further exhibits unique strengths over the traditional topic modeling method in statistically testing the topic preference of diverse groups. Public health practitioners should be keenly aware of the cognitive differences between professionals and laypeople, also pay special attention to the topics with significant inconsistency across groups so as to build consensus and promote vaccination effectively.","Luo, Ji, Tang, Du","https://doi.org/10.2196/30715","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16804,""

"What can we learn from the experiences and expectations of patients on growing waiting lists for planned care in the COVID-19 pandemic?","COVID-19 has compounded a growing waiting list problem, with over 4.5 million patients now waiting for planned elective care in the UK. Views of patients on waiting lists are rarely considered in prioritization. Our primary aim was to understand how to support patients on waiting lists by hearing their experiences, concerns, and expectations. The secondary aim was to capture objective change in disability and coping mechanisms. A minimum representative sample of 824 patients was required for quantitative analysis to provide a 3% margin of error. Sampling was stratified by body region (upper/lower limb, spine) and duration on the waiting list. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of elective orthopaedic waiting list patients with their planned intervention paused due to COVID-19. Analyzed parameters included baseline health, change in physical/mental health status, challenges and coping strategies, preferences/concerns regarding treatment, and objective quality of life (EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item scale (GAD-2)). Qualitative analysis was performed via the Normalization Process Theory. A total of 888 patients responded. Better health, pain, and mood scores were reported by upper limb patients. The longest waiters reported better health but poorer mood and anxiety scores. Overall, 82% had tried self-help measures to ease symptoms; 94% wished to proceed with their intervention; and 21% were prepared to tolerate deferral. Qualitative analysis highlighted the overall patient mood to be represented by the terms 'understandable', 'frustrated', 'pain', 'disappointed', and 'not happy/depressed'. COVID-19-mandated health and safety measures and technology solutions were felt to be implemented well. However, patients struggled with access to doctors and pain management, quality of life (physical and psychosocial) deterioration, and delay updates. This is the largest study to hear the views of this 'hidden' cohort. Our findings are widely relevant to ensure provision of better ongoing support and communication, mostly within the constraints of current resources.

"[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19: Not just a pediatric disease]","Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a hyperinflammatory syndrome has appeared which develops weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described mainly in children (MIS-C), but lately has also been found in adults (MIS-A). We present a case of a woman with MIS-A. She had fever, diarrhoea, hypotension, laboratory abnormalities with high inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, troponin-T, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Her electrocardiogram had marked diffuse ST-depressions. She was diagnosed in an early stage of MIS-A and treated successfully with immune suppression, antiaggregants and anticoagulants. MIS-A and MIS-C are similar, potentially life-threatening inflammatory syndromes which can lead to severe cardiac dysfunction and cardiovascular failure. For effective treatment and prevention of complications, timely recognition is essential. Clinicians should therefore be mindful of this multisystem inflammatory syndrome, not just in children but also in adults.","Kuijpers, Pries, Rook, Labots, Goekoop, Filippini","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Multisystem+inflammatory+syndrome+associated+with+COVID-19:+Not+just+a+pediatric+disease].","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16809,""
"""Concerns and Psychological Wellbeing of Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Care Hospital in NSW""","In early 2020, the impending COVID-19 pandemic placed a once-in-a-generation professional and personal challenge upon healthcare workers. Publications on direct physical disease abound. The authors wished to focus on doctors' psychological wellbeing. To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the doctors' wellbeing and evaluate their concerns as the pandemic progressed. A mixed-methods, hospital-based survey was sent to the doctors at the 650-bed tertiary referral hospital in NSW at two different periods (late-March and early-May 2020). A validated mental wellbeing tool (SWEMWBS, Short Warwick Edinburgh Scale) was combined with COVID-19 specific questions. 235 responses were obtained from 450 doctors, with a response rate of 32% in the first survey and 20% in the second. The majority (35%) of respondents were doctors-in-training, followed by staff-specialists (23%). The highest response was from frontline workers in both surveys, including the intensive-care unit (27%), anaesthesia (21%), and emergency department (13%). ""Extreme concern"" regarding PPE shortage dropped from 22.6% to 2.2% and ""extreme concern"" of contracting COVID-19 fell from 22.6% to 3.4% in the second survey. The proportion of respondents with a ""low"" psychological wellbeing score improved from 38% to 27% between the two surveys. The resulting mean improvement in the SWEMWBS was 3.49 (95% CI: 3.06 to 3.91, P &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Both COVID-19 specific concerns and psychological wellbeing improved greatly in the second survey. Possible explanations are the fall in COVID-19 cases in the district, improvements in PPE supply, and supportive measures communicated to doctors during this period.

"A cross-sectional study of infection control measures against COVID-19 and psychological distress among Japanese workers","This study examined the relationship between the status of infection control efforts against COVID-19 in the workplace and workers' mental health using a large-scale Internet-based study. This cross-sectional study was based on an Internet monitoring survey conducted during the third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. Of the 33Ã‚Â 302 people who participated in the survey, 27Ã‚Â 036 were included in the analyses. Participants answered whether or not each of 10 different infection control measures was in place at their workplace (eg, wearing masks at all times during working hours). A Kessler 6 (K6) score of Ã¢â€°Â¥13 was defined as mild psychological distress. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with infection control measures at the workplace were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefectures of residence. The OR of subjects working at facilities with 4 or 5 infection control measures for psychological distress was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.34, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .010), that in facilities with 2 or 3 infection control measures was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.25-1.64, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), and that in facilities with 1 or no infection control measures was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.63-2.14, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) compared to subjects whose workplaces had Ã¢â€°Â¥6 infection control measures.

"Anxiety, depression, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms following COVID-19 infection at long-term follow-up","A developing finding from the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in COVID-19 survivors. While studies have shown clinically significant rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after COVID-19, little is known about how these symptoms evolve over time. Here, we report findings from a cohort study of 52 participants recruited from the greater New York City area following acute COVID-19 infection. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety-related symptoms, the Insomnia Severity Scale (ISS) from sleep-related symptoms, and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) for trauma-related symptoms both at baseline and at long-term (24 to 60 weeks post-infection) follow-up. We found a high degree of correlation between psychiatric symptom scales within participants. More participants met established cutoffs for clinically significant insomnia and post-traumatic stress at follow-up compared to baseline. Symptom scales for depression, insomnia, and PTSD were increased at long-term follow-up, with only increased PCL-C scores surviving correction for multiple comparisons (Z=2.92, W=434, <i>p</i>=0.004). Our results present evidence from a small cohort that neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly those related to PTSD, may worsen over time in COVID-19 survivors. Future studies should continue to investigate these questions in broader populations, while additionally exploring the potential biological and sociological mechanisms that may contribute to neuropsychiatric pathology after COVID-19 infection.","Kyzar, Purpura, Shah, Cantos, Nordvig, Yin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100315","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16812,""

However, the capacity to distinguish patients who would benefit from immunosuppressive or immune stimulatory therapies remains insufficient. Here, we present a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 with a defective immune response, treated successfully with interleukin-7 on compassionate basis with resultant improved adaptive immune function. A previously healthy 43-year-old male developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and persistent, profound lymphopenia. Functional analysis demonstrated depressed lymphocyte function and few antigen-specific T cells. Interleukin-7 administration resulted in reversal of lymphopenia and improved T-cell function. Respiratory function and clinical status rapidly improved, and he was discharged home. Whole exome sequencing identified a deleterious autosomal dominant mutation in <i>TICAM1</i>, associated with a dysfunctional type I interferon antiviral response with increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 disease.

"Employment Status and Its Association With Psychological Distress and Alcohol Consumption","The objective of this analysis was to find an association between employment status, psychological distress, and alcohol consumption. Data from the 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) data was used. Patient health questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) data and an average number of drinks per week were used to assess psychological distress and drinking status. Out of the 3865 people who answered the survey in the year 2020, 1890 (59.11%) were employed in one or multiple jobs during the time of the survey. The sample included 1561 men and 2204 women with an average age of 48.4 years. More than half (58.7%) of them were Non-Hispanic White followed by Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black at 15.73% and 10.32%, respectively. Bivariate analysis showed a significant association between employment, psychological distress (p value=0.032), and alcohol drinking (p value=0.002); 60.59% of participants reporting severe distress (PHQ-4 score of 9-12) were unemployed. Alternatively, 73.1% of the employed respondents reported no stress (PHQ-4 score of 0-2). While more than half (75.97%) of those who were unemployed consumed only 1-2 drinks per week on an average, 7.27% consumed &gt;13 drinks per week on an average. After adjusting for covariates, the regression analysis showed a highly significant association (p value&lt; 0.001) between unemployment and psychological distress (OR=1.55; 95% CI 1.03, 2.31), and alcohol consumption (OR=0.67; 95% CI 0.48, 0.92).

"Prevalence of depressive symptoms due to COVID-19 and associated factors among healthcare workers in Southern Ethiopia","Globally, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly since it was first identified and challenging the provision of essential services for low-resource countries. Healthcare workers involved in providing care are at high risk of developing mental health problems. The aim of this was to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms due to COVID-19 and associated factors among healthcare workers in the West Guji zone in public health facilities, southern Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in public health facilities found in the West Guji zone. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 283 study subjects. This study was used to assess the prevalence of depression symptoms using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, a depression subscale. Descriptive statistics, binary and multiple logistic regressions were used. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence interval will be estimated to assess the strength of associations and statistical significance will be declared at a <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.05. Out of 283 eligible healthcare workers, 275 respondents had participated in this study with a 97.2% response rate. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 21.5%.

"How Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Impacted Internet Use Behaviors and Facilitated Problematic Internet Use? A Bangladeshi Study","The COVID-19 pandemic-related ""stay-at-home"" and confinement orders has led individuals to be more engaged with technology use (eg, internet use). For a minority of individuals, excessive use can become problematic and addictive. However, the investigation of problematic internet use in the COVID-19 context is only just emerging. Therefore, the present study investigated the changes in internet use behaviors and addiction rates in comparison with prior Bangladeshi studies. An online cross-sectional study was carried out among a total of 601 Bangladeshi students between October 7 and November 2, 2020. The survey included questions relating to socio-demographic, behavioral health, online use behaviors, and psychopathological variables. A quarter of the participants (26%) reported having low levels of internet addiction, whereas 58.6% were classed as having moderate internet addiction and 13% severe internet addiction. A total of 4% of the sample were classed as being at risk of severe internet dependency (ie, scoring over Ã¢â€°Â¥80 on IAT). Risk factors for internet addiction included smartphone addiction, Facebook addiction, depression, and anxiety. However, the final hierarchical regression model comprising all variables explained a total of 70.6% variance of problematic internet use. Based on the present findings, it is concluded that individuals are at elevated risk of problematic internet use like other psychological impacts that have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, risk-reducing measures and healthy control use strategies should be implemented for vulnerable individuals.","Jahan, Hosen, Al Mamun, Kaggwa, Griffiths, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S323570","20210804","Bangladeshi students; COVID-19 and internet addiction; anxiety; depression; online use behaviors; problematic internet use; smartphone and Facebook addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16816,""

"Analysis of primary care prescription trends in England during the COVID-19 pandemic compared against a predictive model","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact across primary care. Primary care services have seen an upheaval, and more and more patients are engaging in telephone consultations in order to maintain social distancing. In the present study, we seek to quantify the effect of the pandemic on primary care prescribing. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the English Prescribing Dataset from January 2014 to November 2020, totalling 7 542 293 921 prescriptions. Data were separated into prepandemic and pandemic sets. A Holt-Winters predictive model was used to forecast individual drug prescribing based on historic trends. Observed data were compared with the forecast quantitatively and qualitatively. All prescriptions signed in England and dispensed during the years 2014-2020. All residents of England who received a prescription from primary care facilities during 2014-2020. Prescribing of numerous health-critical medications was above predicted in March 2020, including salbutamol (53.0% (99% CI (41.2% to 66.9%))), insulin aspart (26.9% (99% CI (18.5% to 36.6%))) and tacrolimus (18.6% (99% CI (8.3% to 31.1%))). Medications for end-of-life symptom control increased in April, including levomepromazine hydrochloride (94.7% (99% CI (54.6% to 163.0%))). Medications requiring face-to-face visits decreased, including the local anaesthetic bupivacaine hydrochloride (86.6% (99% CI (89.3% to 82.0%))). There was no observed change in medications relating to type 2 diabetes, hypertension or mental health conditions. Significantly increased prescribing of several medications was observed, especially among those critical for health. A dramatic spike in end-of-life prescribing highlights the adversity faced by community practitioners during 2020. Medications involving face-to-face consultations declined, as did contraceptives, travel-related vaccines and drugs used in dementia and Parkinson's disease. Drugs relating to type 2 diabetes, hypertension and mental health were unchanged.","Frazer, Frazer","https://doi.org/10.1136/fmch-2021-001143","20210804","COVID-19; general practice; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16818,""

"Perceptions and experiences of healthcare providers during COVID-19 pandemic in Karachi, Pakistan: an exploratory qualitative study","To explore healthcare provider's perspectives and experiences of the barriers and facilitators to treat and manage COVID-19 cases. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at a private tertiary care teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Study data were analysed manually using the conventional content analysis technique. Key-informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with senior management and hospital leadership and in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with front-line healthcare providers. A total of 31 interviews (KIIs=19; IDIs=12) were conducted, between April and May 2020. Three overarching themes emerged. The first was 'challenges faced by front-line healthcare providers working in COVID-19 wards. Healthcare workers experienced increased anxiety due to the fear of acquiring infection and transmitting it to their family members. They felt overwhelmed due to the exhaustive donning and doffing process, intense work and stigmatisation. The second theme was 'enablers supporting healthcare providers to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic'. Front liners pointed out several enabling factors that supported hospital staff including a safe hospital environment, adequate training, a strong system of information sharing and supportive management. The third theme was 'recommendations to support the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 crisis'. Healthcare workers recommended measures to mitigate current challenges including providing risk allowance to front-line healthcare providers, preparing a backup health workforce, and establishing a platform to address the mental health needs of the healthcare providers. This study provides an initial evidence base of healthcare providers' experiences of managing patients with COVID-19 in the early stage of the pandemic and highlights measures needed to address the encountered challenges. It offers lessons for hospitals in low-income and middle-income countries to ensure a safe working environment for front-line workers in their fight against COVID-19.","Shahil Feroz, Pradhan, Hussain Ahmed, Shah, Asad, Saleem, Siddiqi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048984","20210804","COVID-19; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16820,""
"Decreased human respiratory syncytial virus activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: an ecological time-series analysis","Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as sanitary measures and travel restrictions, aimed at controlling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may affect the transmission dynamics of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). We aimed to quantify the contribution of the sales of hand hygiene products and the number of international and domestic airline passenger arrivals on HRSV epidemic in Japan. The monthly number of HRSV cases per sentinel site (HRSV activity) in 2020 was compared with the average of the corresponding period in the previous 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (from January 2014 to December 2020) using a monthly paired t-test. A generalized linear gamma regression model was used to regress the time-series of the monthly HRSV activity against NPI indicators, including sale of hand hygiene products and the number of domestic and international airline passengers, while controlling for meteorological conditions (monthly average temperature and relative humidity) and seasonal variations between years (2014-2020). The average number of monthly HRSV case notifications in 2020 decreased by approximately 85% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared to those in the preceding 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (2014-2019). For every average Ã‚Â¥1 billion (approximately Ã‚Â£680,000/$9,000,000) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month before there was a 0.29% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) decrease in HRSV infections. An increase of average 1000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1-2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months was associated with a 3.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>-Ã¢â‚¬â€°4</sup>% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and 1.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>-Ã¢â‚¬â€°3</sup>% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively. This study suggests that there is an association between the decrease in the monthly number of HRSV cases and improved hygiene and sanitary measures and travel restrictions for COVID-19 in Japan, indicating that these public health interventions can contribute to the suppression of HRSV activity. These findings may help in public health policy and decision making.","Wagatsuma, Koolhof, Shobugawa, Saito","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06461-5","20210804","COVID-19; Epidemics; HRSV; NPIs; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16821,""
"Perceptions of Covid-19 lockdowns and related public health measures in Austria: a longitudinal online survey","Introducing national lockdown has been effective in containing Covid-19. However, several studies indicated negative impacts of lockdowns on the well-being and mental health of many people. In Austria, the first Covid-19-related lockdown was introduced on 16 March 2020 with most restrictions being lifted 1 month later. Seven months after that, in November 2020, the second full lockdown was implemented. The aim of this study was to compare the perceptions and experiences of the general population related to the first and second Covid-19 lockdowns in Austria. Two waves of an online survey were conducted in May and December 2020 asking respondents about their concerns related to the Covid-19 illness, personal experiences of the lockdowns, perceptions of and compliance with imposed public health measures, and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on different aspects of life during the two lockdowns. Descriptive statistics including frequency analysis were used to compare respondents' answers collected in the two waves of the survey. T-test and chi-square tests were used to test differences between the two lockdowns. Five hundred sixty participants were included in the first wave and a sub-sample of 134 participants in the second wave of data collection. During the second lockdown, study respondents were more concerned about their family members contracting Covid-19 when compared with the first lockdown. Compliance with public health measures was overall lower during the second lockdown, although it varied according to the type of the measure. Closure of schools was seen as the least essential restriction during the second lockdown, while wearing masks gained additional approval between the first and the second lockdown. Larger negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on friendships, leisure activities, education and community were reported during the second lockdown. The study found that the extended duration of the pandemic and recurring lockdowns restricting freedom of movement and social contacts appear to have caused significant disruptions to many areas of life. Furthermore, declining adherence to most public health measures over time raises a question about the effectiveness of future lockdown measures.","Ã…Âaszewska, Helter, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11476-3","20210804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16822,""
"Mental health consequences during alerting situations and recovering to a new normal of coronavirus epidemic in 2019: a cross-sectional study based on the affected population","As a major virus outbreak in the twenty-first century, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. We performed a cross-sectional study based on the results of an online survey. The survey was conducted 1 month after the outbreak (February 18-29, 2020) and repeated at the time of resuming activity (April 8-14, 2020). The 15-item Death Anxiety Scale (T-DAS) was used to assess the degree of death anxiety, and the Chinese version of PTSD checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), for PTSD symptom clusters. Through convenient sampling, a total of 7678 cases were collected. Our findings showed that even after the lockdown was lifted, the prevalence of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and death anxiety remained significantly high in the general population affected by the outbreak. Regression model analysis showed that PTSD was significantly associated with ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, contact history/living community, poor health status of participants, past traumatic experience (PTE), and medical occupation. Moreover, death anxiety mediated the relationship between life-threatening PTE and PTSD, indicating that reducing death anxiety could buffer the negative effects of PTE on PTSD. Despite the lifting of the lockdown, long-term adverse psychological effects remain in the affected general population. The management of mental health after major public health events is important, and high-risk groups such as the elderly and healthcare workers should receive targeted interventions. In addition, the study suggests that methods for alleviating death anxiety must be included in plans to manage the psychological impact of public health emergencies.","Zhang, Zheng, Fu, Mu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11550-w","20210804","COVID-19; Death anxiety; Mental; PTSD; Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16823,""
"COVID-19 related poor mental health and sleep disorders in rheumatic patients: a citizen science project","Patients with chronic rheumatic diseases (RDs) are more vulnerable and the containment measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic might have severe psychological consequences. We investigated the presence of and risk factors associated with poor mental health, sleep disorders among RDs during the pandemic. This cross-sectional Italian citizen science project evaluated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with RDs. Between May and September 2020, eleven RD patients' associations sent the survey by using their mailing list and the related webpage and social network. 507 RD patients completed an ad-hoc anonymous online survey including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The mean scores on the PSS-10 and the IES-R were 18.1 and 29.7, respectively. Higher PSS scores were associated with younger age (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01), female gender (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01), overweight/obesity (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), psychiatric pharmacotherapy (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01), and anxiety for loss of income (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01). Higher IES-R scores were associated with female gender (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01), intestinal diseases (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01), and health concern (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.01). Among 375 patients with inflammatory arthritis, 246 (65.6%) had trouble staying asleep, 238 (63.5%) falling asleep, and 112 (29.9%) had dreams about the pandemic. Older age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.038, CI 1.002-1.076), psychiatric pharmacotherapy (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.819, CI 11.465-58.143), and COVID infection (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.783, CI 1.215-6.372) were predictive of insomnia during the pandemic. A considerable COVID-19 related psychosocial burden has been detected in RDs. Different factors were predictive of poor mental health and sleep disorders in these patients.

"Dynamic monitor on psychological problems of medical aid teams in the context of corona virus disease 2019: a multi-stage and multi-factor quantitative study","To explore the psychological status and vulnerability characteristics of medical staff with the progress of the epidemic. This study investigated the prevalence of mental problems of 2748 medical staff in four stages. The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), SSS (Somatization Symptom Checklist), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and PCL-C (Self-rating scale for post-traumatic stress disorder) were used for the psychological evaluation, and univariate logistic standardised analysis, and multivariate logistic regression for data analysis. The prevalence of mental problems showed a statistically significant difference. In Stage 1, mild anxiety and mild depression reached the highest value of 41.4 and 40.72% respectively. Between 4 and 17 March that of mild depression rose from 16.07 to 26.7%, and between 17 and 26 March the prevalence of mild anxiety increased from 17.28 to 20.02%. Female, unmarried, and working in Wuhan are the risk factors of mental health of medical staff (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The psychological status of the medical staff has changed dynamically.

"Living Through the Pandemic: The Voices of Persons With Dementia and Their Caregivers","Social-distancing guidelines from the COVID-19 pandemic have potential to compound morbidity in persons with dementia (PwD) and increase caregiver burden. This qualitative study utilized semi-structured interviews between August-November 2020 to explore the impact of COVID-19 on PwD and caregivers. Conventional qualitative content analysis was used. Inter-coder reliability was confirmed using the kappa coefficient. Twenty-five interviews were completed with four themes emerging: disruption of socialization, fear and risk mitigation, coping strategies, and caregiver burden. Participants described how lack of socialization and confinement led to feelings of loneliness, depression, and worsening memory problems. Caregivers reported increased burden and heightened feelings of responsibility for their loved one. Increased isolation imposed by the pandemic has a detrimental impact on PwD. Further work is needed to develop interventions to support PwD and other cognitive impairments and caregivers during the pandemic and when in-person socialization is not possible.","Rising, Salcedo, Amadio, Casten, Chang, Gentsch, O'Hayer, Sarpoulaki, Worster, Gerolamo","https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648211036399","20210804","COVID-19 pandemic; caregiver burden; persons with dementia and other cognitive impairments; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16826,""
"The relationship of perceived social support to feelings of hopelessness under COVID-19 pandemic: The effects of epidemic risk and meaning in life","Lockdown orders were issued on January 23, 2020 in Wuhan, China, for the purpose of preventing and controlling COVID-19, which led to severe psychological problems for residents. The present study aimed to investigate the recovery model of hopelessness through interpersonal pathways during the COVID-19 epidemic. An online survey was conducted in 34 provinces (those in autonomous regions and municipalities) of China. This survey investigated residents' hopelessness and the impact of three factors on it, including their perceived social support, meaning in life, and epidemic risk levels. Results showed that both perceived social support and meaning in life negatively predicted hopelessness, while meaning in life played a partial mediating role between perceived social support and hopelessness. Further, epidemic risk level played a moderating role between perceived social support and meaning in life, indicating a â€œmarginal zone effect.â€ Specifically, when comparing other province, perceived social support showed a stronger positive relationship with meaning in life among residents living in other regions of Hubei province. In sum, this study extends the recovery model of hopelessness through interpersonal pathways, and has important implications for public health emergency management.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111110","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16827,""
"Can urban prosperity aid in recovery?: The relationship between healthcare workers' mental health status and the city level during the COVID-19 epidemic","The mental health of healthcare workers during epidemics is a complex topic. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that occurred in late 2019 has become a global public health threat and provides an opportunity to investigate this topic. Based on a large-scale investigation of Chinese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 epidemic, the article tests the assumption that the socioeconomic level of a city affects the mental health status of healthcare workers. The result is interesting and important: the mental health status of this population differs based on the city level. Hospital level, hospital type and departments risk level were investigated separately. With regard to the degree of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there were obvious differences based on the city level: the negative mental health impacts increase with increasing city level, such that healthcare workers in first-tier cities have the least negative mental health impacts, while those in third-tier cities have the most. City level reflects the degree of urban development, resource richness, resident satisfaction, and positive social atmosphere. Urban prosperity may affect mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103361","20211101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16828,""
"A tale of two countries: Increased uptake of digital mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand","Background Digital mental health services (DMHS) provide highly accessible psychological supports and interventions that can supplement existing mental health services. Concerns about the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been widespread and provide a unique impetus to examine the utility and responsivity of DMHS. This study examined the service utilisation and user characteristics of two DMHS (THIS WAY UP and Just a Thought) in Australia and New Zealand before and during the early pandemic period in these countries (March to June 2020). Methods Service use indices (website visits, course registrations and prescriptions, clinician registrations) were compared across different time periods before (12, 6 and 3 months) and during the pandemic in Australia and New Zealand. The demographic and clinical characteristics of course registrants (anxiety and depression symptom severity and psychological distress) were also compared across the pre- and during-COVID periods. Results Comparing pre-COVID to during-COVID time periods, we observed substantial increases across all service use indices in both DMHS (increases of >100% on the majority of service use indices). For example, in the 3 months prior to the pandemic, 2806 people registered for a THIS WAY UP course and 1907 people registered for a Just a Thought course, whereas 21,872 and 5442 registered for a THIS WAY UP and Just a Thought course, respectively, during the first 3 months of the COVID pandemic. Slight differences in the demographic and clinical profiles of course registrants were found between pre- and during-COVID time periods, with limited evidence of elevated anxiety and depression symptom severity in the COVID period. Conclusions Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Australia and New Zealand, the volume of users accessing DMHS increased yet the demographic and clinical characteristics of course registrants remained stable. Results underscore how nimble and scalable DMHS can be during periods of high demand.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100439","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16829,""
"Investigating the potential mechanisms of depression induced-by COVID-19 infection in patients","The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged now in the world as a pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes variant common symptoms, such as dry cough, tiredness, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, chills, headache, chest pain, and conjunctivitis. Different organs may be affected by COVID-19, such as the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and CNS. However, the information about the COVID-19 infection in the CNS is insufficient. We do know that the virus can enter the central nervous system (CNS) via different routes, causing symptoms such as dizziness, headache, seizures, loss of consciousness, and depression. Depression is the most common disorder among all neurological symptoms following COVID-19 infection, although the mechanism of COVID-19-induced depression is not yet clear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the probable mechanisms of COVID-19-induced depression. The reasons for depression in infected patients may be due to social and pathological factors including social quarantine, economic problems, stress, changes in the HPA axis, inflammation due to the entry of proinflammatory cytokines into the CNS, production of inflammatory cytokines by microglia, mitochondrial disorders, damage to the hippocampus, and malnutrition. By evaluating different factors involved in COVID-19-induced depression, we have concluded that depression can be minimized by controlling stress, preventing the cytokine storm with appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs, and proper nutrition.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2021.07.023","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","",16830,""
"Global prevalence and determinants of mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 5 million and lost the lives of more than 300 thousand people globally. It is the first-ever deadly pandemic with a significant degree of fear, worry and concern in the population at large. Therefore, this Meta-Analysis aims to assess the global prevalence and determinants of mental health disorders. Methods A three-stage search strategy was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Science direct LILACS and PsycINFO databases. The Heterogeneity among the included studies was checked with forest plot, <U+03C7>2 test, I2 test, and the p-values. Publication bias was checked with a funnel plot and the objective diagnostic test was conducted with Egger's correlation, Begg's regression tests, and Trim and fill method. Results The Meta-Analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression 33.59% (95% confidence interval (CI): 27.21 to 39.97, 30 studies, 88,543 participants) and 29.98% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25.32 to 34.64, 25 studies, 78,191 participants) respectively. Conclusion The review revealed that more than thirty percent of patients developed anxiety and depression during COVID-19 Pandemic.
