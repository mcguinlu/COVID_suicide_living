"Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic","Objective Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide  Design A thirty-one question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors  Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis  Quantitative data was evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses  Participants 84 residency programs (33 6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes Results Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment  100% of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95 2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce;on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half  With telehealth clinics(90 5%) and remote inpatient consults(26 2%), both clinical care and resident didactics(86 9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics  Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare(51 2% vs 6 7%), housing(41 9% vs 13 3%), and virtual mental health services(83 7% vs 53 3%)  Conclusions Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic  While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives  Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action","White, Erin M.; Shaughnessy, Matthew P.; Esposito, Andrew C.; Slade, Martin D.; Korah, Maria; Yoo, Peter S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Surgical Education;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Surgical Education;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3431,""

"Immuno-psychiatrie et pandÃ©mie de SARS-CoV-2: liens et possibles consÃ©quences","RÃ©sumÃ© Objectif: La pandÃ©mie de SARS-CoV-2 (ou COVID-19) se propage depuis dÃ©cembre 2019, et Ã  Ã©tÃ©, comme attendu, accompagnÃ©e dâ€™une augmentation drastique de la prÃ©valence des troubles anxieux et dÃ©pressifs dans la population gÃ©nÃ©rale  Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sÃ»r, expliquer une partie de ces troubles  Cependant, dans la mesure oÃ¹ les troubles psychiatriques sont Ã©galement associÃ©s Ã  une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le systÃ¨me immunitaire de lâ€™hÃ´te, avec une rÃ©ponse inflammatoire marquÃ©e, mais Ã©galement lâ€™inflammation secondaire Ã  ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraÃ®ner lâ€™apparition ou lâ€™aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques  Cet article vise donc Ã  identifier les possibles consÃ©quences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandÃ©mie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient Ãªtre utiles en termes de dÃ©pistage et/ou de prise en charge  MÃ©thode: Nous nous sommes appuyÃ©s sur les donnÃ©es issues des prÃ©cÃ©dentes pandÃ©mies et les donnÃ©es existantes Ã  ce jour sur les consÃ©quences psychopathologiques de la pandÃ©mie de SARS-CoV-2, pour rÃ©aliser une revue de la littÃ©rature narrative sur les possibles consÃ©quences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandÃ©mie de SARS-CoV-2  Nous avons ciblÃ© lâ€™environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-dÃ©veloppementaux pour le fÅ“tus, dâ€™une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectÃ©s avec les risques de dÃ©velopper des troubles psychiatriques, dâ€™autre part  RÃ©sultats: Comme durant les prÃ©cÃ©dentes pandÃ©mies, lâ€™activation du systÃ¨me immunitaire due au stress et/ou Ã  lâ€™infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire Ã  un risque accru de troubles du neuro-dÃ©veloppement chez le fÅ“tus (schizophrÃ©nie et troubles du spectre de lâ€™autisme)  De plus, chez les individus exposÃ©s Ã  des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectÃ©s par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de lâ€™humeur, est probable  Conclusion: Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dÃ©pistage et de prise en charge dÃ©diÃ©es sont indispensables  Il est de fait important de proposer aux individus ayant Ã©tÃ© infectÃ©s par le virus, un suivi rapprochÃ© afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus prÃ©coce possible  De mÃªme chez les femmes enceintes, le dÃ©pistage de troubles de lâ€™humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit Ãªtre facilitÃ©  Le suivi des bÃ©bÃ©s nÃ©s pendant la pÃ©riode pandÃ©mique doit Ãªtre renforcÃ© afin de dÃ©pister et de prendre en charge dâ€™Ã©ventuels troubles du neuro-dÃ©veloppement  Objective: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, along a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population  Psychological trauma can partly explain these troubles  However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the hostâ€™s immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric pathologies  So, this article aims to identify the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to think about possible actions of screening and care that could ensue  Method : Drawing on data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the authors performed a narrative review on the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on the one hand, on the children and adults directly infected, and the subsequent risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand  Results: As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or the infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia nd autism spectrum disorders)  Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased  Conclusion: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary  Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible  Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated  The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders","Daaboul, Jacques;

Results indicated high levels of exposure, concern, and compliance with medical guidelines; however stress was generally low and we found evidence for positive impact. Direct exposure correlated with higher religiosity. Positive religious coping, intrinsic religiosity and trust in God strongly correlated with less stress and more positive impact, while negative religious coping and mistrust in God correlated with the inverse.

The beginning of 2020 has been marked by COVID-19 pandemic, with a strong impact on several national health systems worldwide.Objective. To describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of Italian psoriatic patients treated with biologics.Methods. A telephone survey was conducted in May 4-10, 2020 about the Italian lockdown period (March 09th - May 03rd 2020) in a cohort of psoriatic patients treated with biologics, asking about any exposure to COVID-19, disease status, continuation of therapy, work activity and psychological status through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).Results. 226 patients were interviewed, with no COVID-19 positive cases. Sixty-three of 226 (27.9%) described worsening of the disease with a correlation to drug withdrawal [43/226 (19%)]. Correlation was also found between the worsening of psoriasis and HADS anxiety, HADS depression, BRS and PSS abnormal scores considered both as categorical and continuous variables. No correlation was found between worsening of psoriasis and work activity.Conclusion. Uncertainty about whether biologics could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to drug withdrawal with subsequent worsening of psoriasis.

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of CT on the age of onset (AoO) and clinical features of the disease by considering factors such as family history, head trauma, birth trauma, alcohol and substance abuse that may affect AoO of the disease. METHODS: The sample comprising 200 patients admitted to the outpatient and inpatient care at the Izmir Katip Ã‡elebi University, AtatÃ¼rk Education and Research Hospital psychiatry clinic, were included in the study. Socio-demographic information form, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) and subscale of Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were applied. RESULTS: All types of trauma, except physical abuse, were found related to the disease onset age earlier. It was also detected that the factors of head trauma, birth complication, presence of an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia in the family and migration history were not related to AoO of the disease. On the other hand, it was found that physical, emotional and sexual abuses lead to more positive psychotic symptoms, and all types of CT increase the severity of disease and the risk of suicide. CONCLUSION: This study draws attention to the etiological importance of CT in schizophrenia as an environmental factor by showing that it affects AoO of the disease along with symptomatology. Future studies should focus on the pathogenesis of CT in schizophrenia and the interaction between CT and biological and genetic predisposition.","IngeÃ§, Cem; Evren KiliÃ§aslan, Esin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020943629","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020943629, 2020 Jul 23.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020943629, 2020 Jul 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3466,""
"Frailty Combined with Loneliness or Social Isolation: An Elevated Risk for Mortality in Later Life","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Frailty, loneliness, and social isolation are all associated with adverse outcomes in older adults, but little is known about their combined impact on mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults aged 65 and older (n = 1,427). MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was measured with the frailty phenotype (Fried criteria). Loneliness was assessed with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Social isolation was operationalized using information on partner status, social support, and network size. Two categorical variables were created, for each possible combination regarding frailty and loneliness (FL) and frailty and social isolation (FS), respectively. Mortality was monitored over a period of 22 years (1995-2017). Survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the effects of the FL and FS combinations on mortality. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, depression, chronic diseases, and smoking. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 13%, and 5.9% of the sample were frail and lonely, and 6.2% frail and socially isolated. In fully adjusted models, older adults who were only frail had a higher risk of mortality compared with people without any of the conditions (hazard ratio [HR] range = 1.40-1.48; P < .01). However, the highest risk of mortality was observed in people with a combined presence of frailty and loneliness or social isolation (HRFL = 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-2.37; HRFS = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.36-2.30). Sensitivity analyses using a frailty index based on the deficit accumulation approach instead of the frailty phenotype showed similar results, confirming the robustness of our findings. CONCLUSION: Frail older adults are at increased risk of mortality, but this risk is even higher for those who are also lonely or socially isolated. To optimize well-being and health outcomes in physically frail older adults, targeted interventions focusing on both subjective and objective social vulnerability are needed.","Hoogendijk, Emiel O; Smit, Annelot P; van Dam, Carmen; Schuster, Noah A; de Breij, Sascha; Holwerda, Tjalling J; Huisman, Martijn; Dent, Elsa; Andrew, Melissa K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16716","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Geriatr Soc;2020 Jul 23.; Publication details: J Am Geriatr Soc;2020 Jul 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3467,""
"Potential Influences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Drug Use and HIV Care Among People Living with HIV and Substance Use Disorders: Experience from a Pilot mHealth Intervention","People living with HIV (PLWH) and substance use disorder (SUD) are particularly vulnerable to harmful health consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The health and social consequences of the pandemic may exacerbate substance misuse and poor management of HIV among this population. This study compares substance use and HIV care before and during the pandemic using data collected weekly through an opioid relapse prevention and HIV management mobile-health intervention. We found that during the pandemic, PLWH and SUD have increased illicit substance use and contact with other substance-using individuals and decreased their confidence to stay sober and attend recovery meetings. The proportion of people missing their HIV medications also increased, and confidence to attend HIV follow-up appointments decreased. Optimal support for PLWH and SUD is critical during pandemics like COVID-19, as drug-related and HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence risks such as overdose, unsafe sexual behaviors, and transmission of infectious diseases may unfold.","Hochstatter, Karli R; Akhtar, Wajiha Z; Dietz, Sarah; Pe-Romashko, Klaren; Gustafson, David H; Shah, Dhavan V; Krechel, Sarah; Liebert, Cameron; Miller, Rebecca; El-Bassel, Nabila; Westergaard, Ryan P","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-02976-1","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: AIDS Behav;2020 Jul 23.; Publication details: AIDS Behav;2020 Jul 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3468,""

"Impacto del SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) en la salud mental de los profesionales sanitarios: una revisiÃ³n sistemÃ¡tica; [Impact of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) on the mental health of healthcare professionals: a systematic review]","BACKGROUND: In times of this global pandemic situation, population's mental health is compromised, especially in those groups that are at the forefront of defence against the virus such as healthcare professionals. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on healthcare professionals' mental health. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA format in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect electronic databases between January and May 2020. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for non-randomized studies. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Professionals' mental health and mental functions were compromised, being especially affected those professionals on the front line of battle against the virus. However, these stats were below the general population data. Although there is wide variability of results, medium-high levels of anxiety (26,5%-44,6%), depression (8,1%-25%), concern and insomnia are detected (23,6%-38%). Paradoxically, stress levels were below expectations (3,8%-68,3%).

"Google searches for suicide and suicide risk factors in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December of 2019 and has since spread globally. The dramatic lifestyle changes and stressors associated with this pandemic pose a threat to mental health and have the potential to exacerbate risk factors for suicide. We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess Google Trends data representing searches in the United States for 18 terms related to suicide and known suicide risk factors following the emergence of COVID-19. Although the relative proportion of Google searches for suicide-related queries was lower than predicted during the early pandemic period, searches for the following queries representative of financial difficulty were dramatically elevated: &quot;I lost my job&quot; (226%; 95%CI, 120%-333%), &quot;laid off&quot; (1164%; 95%CI, 395%-1932%), &quot;unemployment&quot; (1238%; 95%CI, 560%-1915%), and &quot;furlough&quot; (5717%; 95%CI, 2769%-8665%). Searches for the Disaster Distress Helpline, which was promoted as a source of help for those impacted by COVID-19, were also remarkably elevated (3021%; 95%CI, 873%-5169%). Google searches for other queries representative of help-seeking and general mental health concerns were moderately elevated. It appears that some indices of suicidality have fallen in the United States in this early stage of the pandemic, but that COVID-19 may have caused an increase in suicide risk factors that could yield long-term increases in suicidality and suicide rates.","Halford, Lake, Gould","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236777","20200727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3473,""
"Knowledge, Concerns, and Behaviors of Individuals During the First Week of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Italy","At the beginning of a public health crisis, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to collect information about people's knowledge, worries, and behaviors to examine their influence on quality of life and to understand individual characteristics associated with these reactions. Such information could help to guide health authorities in providing informed interventions and clear communications. To document the initial knowledge about COVID-19 and recommended health behaviors; to assess worries (ie, one's perception of the influence of the worries of others on oneself), social appraisal, and preventive behaviors, comparing respondents from areas under different movement restrictions during the first week after the outbreak; and to understand how worries, perceived risk, and preventive behaviors were associated with quality of life and individual characteristics among Italian adults. This convenience sample, nonprobablistic survey study recruited adult participants with a snowballing sampling method in any Italian region during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy from February 26, 2020, to March 4, 2020. Data were analyzed from March 5 to 12, 2020. Information was collected from citizens living in the quarantine zone (ie, red zone), area with restricted movements (ie, yellow zone), and COVID-19-free regions (ie, green zone). Levels of knowledge on the virus, contagion-related worries, social appraisal, and preventive behaviors were assessed with ratings of quality of life (measured using the Short Form Health Survey). Additionally, some individual characteristics that may be associated with worries and behaviors were assessed, including demographic characteristics, personality traits (measured using Big Five Inventory-10), perceived health control (measured using the internal control measure in the Health Locus of Control scale), optimism (measured using the Revised Life Orientation Test), and the need for cognitive closure (measured using the Need for Closure Scale). A total of 3109 individuals accessed the online questionnaire, and 2886 individuals responded to the questionnaire at least partially (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [13.2] years; 2203 [76.3%] women). Most participants were well informed about the virus characteristics and suggested behaviors, with a mean (SD) score of 77.4% (17.3%) correct answers. Quality of life was similar across the 3 zones (effect sizeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), but mental health was negatively associated with contagion-related worries (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.066), social appraisal (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.221), and preventive behaviors (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.066) in the yellow zone (R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.108). Social appraisal was also associated with reduced psychological well-being in the green zone (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.205; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.121). In the yellow zone, higher worries were negatively correlated with emotional stability (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.165; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.047). Emotional stability was also negatively associated with perceived susceptibility in the yellow (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.108; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.040) and green (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.170; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.087) zones. Preventative behaviors and social appraisal were also associated with the need for cognitive closure in both yellow (preventive behavior: ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.110; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023; social appraisal ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.115; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.104) and green (preventive behavior: ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.174; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022; social appraisal: 0.261; R2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.137) zones. These findings suggest that during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, people were well informed and had a relatively stable level of worries. Quality of life did not vary across the areas, although mental well-being was challenged by the social appraisal and worries related to the contagion. Increased scores for worries and concerns were associated with more cognitive rigidity and emotional instability.","Pagnini, Bonanomi, Tagliabue, Balconi, Bertolotti, Confalonieri, Di Dio, Gilli, Graffigna, Regalia, Saita, Villani","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15821","20200727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3474,""
"A University-Wide Preparedness Effort in the Alert Phase of COVID-19 Incorporating Community Mental Health and Task-Shifting Strategies: Experience from a Bornean Institute of Higher Learning","The COVID-19 pandemic caught the world by surprise, causing millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Hence, the Malaysian government announced a Movement Control Order at the start of the containment phase to flatten the epidemiological curve. Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), a public university in Borneo, was accelerated into alert phase because of high risk of case importation from more than 400 China incoming undergraduates. Measures to mitigate the potential COVID-19 outbreaks in its population were taken by using conventional public health measures with special attention to task-shifting and widespread community mental health interventions. A Preparedness and Response Centre was established to overseer the mitigating measures happening inside the university. Measures taken included empowerment of frontline staff, strengthening of restrictions, strengthening university health center, vigorous contact tracing, widespread health education, maintaining cultural sensitivity, and establishment of early standard operating procedures and university continuity plans. Hence, UMS was able to ensure no importation of cases into its campus during both acute and containment phases at the nationwide level.","Mukhsam, Jeffree, Pang, Syed Abdul Rahim, Omar, Abdullah, Lukman, Giloi, Salvaraji, Abd Karim, Saupin, Boon Tat, Mohd Hayati, Ibrahim, Muhamad, Zainudin","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0458","20200724","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3475,""
"Social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19","<b>Introduction</b>: Vaccines and drugs for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 require robust evidence generated from clinical trials before they can be used. Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will primarily use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participants will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups. <b>Discussion</b>: At the time of the inception of the study, United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand have initiated strict public health measures and varying degrees of &quot;lockdowns&quot; to curb the pandemic. These public health measures will change in the coming weeks and months depending on the number of cases of COVID-19 in the respective countries. The data generated from our study could inform these strategies in real time.","Pan-Ngum, Poomchaichote, Cuman, Cheah, Waithira, Mukaka, Naemiratch, Kulpijit, Chanviriyavuth, Asarath, Ruangkajorn, Silan, Stoppa, Zuanna, Ongkili, Cheah, Osterrieder, Schneiders, Mackworth-Young, Cheah","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15813.2","20200727","COVID-19; Italy; Malaysia; Thailand; United Kingdom; ethics; qualitative; social","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3476,""

This rapid review takes into account the impact of quarantine on mental health of children and adolescents, and proposes measures to improve psychological outcomes of isolation. Three electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science were searched. Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening followed by full-text screening. This review article included 10 studies. The seven studies before onset of COVID 19 about psychological impact of quarantine in children have reported isolation, social exclusion stigma and fear among the children. The most common diagnoses were acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Three studies during the COVID-19 pandemic reported restlessness, irritability, anxiety, clinginess and inattention with increased screen time in children during quarantine. These adverse consequences can be tackled through carefully formulated multilevel interventions.","Imran, Aamer, Sharif, Bodla, Naveed","https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.36.5.3088","20200725","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Mental health; Quarantine; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-27","",3477,""
