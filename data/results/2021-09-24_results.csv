"Teachers' mental health during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland","Teaching work is stressful, moreover during the pandemic teachers' stress might have been intensified by distance education as well as by limited access to social support, which functions as a buffer in experiencing stress. The aim of the research was to investigate the relation between distance education and teachers' well-being, and their close relations and other social relations during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was conducted in two stages on 285 Polish primary and secondary school teachers who were recruited by means of the chain referral method. The following measures were used: The Depression Anxiety &amp; Stress Scales-21, Berlin Social Support Scales, The Relationship Satisfaction Scale and The Injustice Experience Questionnaire. The teachers experienced at least mild levels of stress, anxiety and depression, both during the first as well as the second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. It has been confirmed that there is a negative relation between relationship quality change and social relations quality change, and stress, anxiety and depression. The variables taken into consideration in the research have provided the explanation for the variation of stress-from 6% in the first stage of the research to 47% in the second stage; for the variation of anxiety-from 21% to 31%; and for the variation of depression-from 12% to 46%, respectively. The research results show that due to distance work the distinction between professional work and family life might have been blurred, and as a consequence teachers' well-being could have been worsened. The isolation put on to stop the spreading of the virus might have contributed to changes in social relations, in close relations in particular, and at the same time negatively influenced teachers' abilities to effectively cope with the crisis situations.","Jakubowski, Sitko-Dominik","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257252","20210923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18215,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in a preexisting longitudinal study of patients with recently diagnosed bipolar disorder: Indications for increases in manic symptoms","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic interfered in the daily lives of people and is assumed to adversely affect mental health. However, the effects on mood (in)stability of bipolar disorder (BD) patients and the comparison to pre-COVID-19 symptom severity levels are unknown. Between April and September, 2020, symptoms and well-being were assessed in the Bipolar Netherlands Cohort (BINCO) study of recently diagnosed patients with BD I and II. The questionnaire contained questions regarding manic and depressive symptoms (YMRS and ASRM, QIDS), worry (PSWQ), stress (PSS), loneliness, sleep, fear for COVID-19, positive coping, and substance use. As manic, depressive and stress symptoms levels were assessed pre-COVID-19, their trajectories during the lockdown restrictions were estimated using mixed models. Of the 70 invited BD patients, 36 (51%) responded at least once (mean age of 36.7 years, 54% female, and 31% BD type 1) to the COVID-19 assessments. There was a significant increase (X<sup>2</sup> =Ã‚Â 17.06; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004) in (hypo)manic symptoms from baseline during the first COVID-19 wave, with a decrease thereafter. Fear of COVID-19 (X<sup>2</sup> =Ã‚Â 18.01; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .003) and positive coping (X<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 12.44; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03) were the highest at the start of the pandemic and decreased thereafter. Other scales including depression and stress symptoms did not vary significantly over time. We found a meaningful increase in manic symptomatology from pre-COVID-19 into the initial phases of the pandemic in BD patients. These symptoms decreased along with fear of COVID-19 and positive coping during the following months when lockdown measures were eased.","Koenders, Mesbah, Spijker, Boere, de Leeuw, van Hemert, Giltay","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2326","20210923","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; depression; loneliness; mania; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18216,""
"Depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 in patients with multiple sclerosis in pandemic era: a cross-sectional study","Depression and anxiety are the two important factors determining quality of life of patients with multiple sclerosis (PWMS). In COVID-19 pandemic era, several factors can provoke mental issues of people and patients. In this cross-sectional study, we aim to estimate the new prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms and their relating factors in PWMS. In this cross-sectional study, we include PWMS who are recruited in the MS clinic of Sina Hospital, Tehran, and are joined in our channel of Telegram media. A self-designed online questionnaire consisted of 4 parts handed out between patients: demographic and clinical data, Beck depression inventory, Beck anxiety inventory, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to find the relating factors of expression of depressive and anxious symptoms in PWMS. Of a total of 282 participants with the mean age of 35.66 (30.75-40) years, had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for 7.36 (3-10) years, 81.7% were women and 69.1% classified as relapsing-remitting MS. Mean score of BDI was 17.13Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.51 which is classified as minimal-moderate depressive symptoms. 48.6% of patients did not express depressive symptoms (BDI-IIÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°14) and the others reported some degrees of depression. In the univariate analysis employment (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015), marital status (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022), level of education (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), number of hospitalization due to MS attacks (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048), and fear of COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) associated significantly with presence of depressive symptoms. After entering these factors in a binary logistic regression model, level of education (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.019), marital status (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.044), number of hospital admissions due to MS relapses (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.10, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.07, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0001) remained significant as relating factors. Mean score of the anxiety calculated 14.54Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.75 and just 3.2% of patients had severe anxiety. Employment (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.045), EDSS score (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), and fear of COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) reported relating to anxious symptoms significantly in the univariate analysis. After entering in the logistic regression analysis, EDSS (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.30, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.13, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) remained as significant relating factors of anxious symptoms. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in PWMS in our MS clinic is 51.4% which is obviously higher than other world's centers which could be due to fear of COVID-19. In addition to fear of COVID-19, presence of depressive symptoms in PWMS is related significantly with level of education, number of hospital admissions due to MS relapses, and marital status. Other side, the patients classified as suffering from anxious symptoms had more severe problems on fear of COVID-19. But it is recommended for future studies to compare patients score in the COVID-19 era with their score before this pandemic.","Alirezaei, Eskandarieh, Sahraian, Naser Moghadasi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05612-5","20210923","Anxiety; Depression; Fear of COVID-19; Multiple sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18217,""
"[Vaccination willingness against COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Germany : Results from aÃ‚Â University Medicine Network survey between November 2020 and January 2021]","The COVID-19 pandemic is aÃ‚Â continuing burden on society and the health system. The vaccination willingness among healthcare workers is of particular interest, as these groups play aÃ‚Â key role in the pandemic response. The present study investigated how the willingness of healthcare workers in Germany to get vaccinated depends on sociodemographic, occupational, and COVID-19-specific characteristics, as well as mental health. Between November 2020 and January 2021, 6217 employees in the German healthcare system were questioned about their vaccination willingness, sociodemographic, occupational, COVID-19-specific, and psychosocial characteristics using the online VOICE survey within the framework of the University Medicine Network (NUM). The vaccination willingness of the sample group was 65.3%. AÃ‚Â higher vaccination willingness was associated with male gender; age &gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯40Ã‚Â years; having no children or no migration background; not working in direct patient care; belonging to aÃ‚Â COVID-19 risk group or professional group of physicians and psychologists in comparison with nursing staff; feeling sufficiently informed about COVID-19 and protected by the measures of the national or local authorities and the employer; fear of infection; and lack of signs of depression. Physicians showed the highest willingness to get vaccinated. During the study period, an overall moderate vaccination willingness against COVID-19 in the health sector was described. Information about the disease and vaccination, especially for younger people, females, and non-physicians, adequate protective measures and prevention of depressive symptoms could increase the vaccination willingness. HINTERGRUND: Die COVID-19-Pandemie stellt eine anhaltende Belastung fÃƒÂ¼r die Gesellschaft und das Gesundheitssystem dar. Die Bereitschaft des Gesundheitspersonals zur COVID-19-Impfung ist aufgrund seiner SchlÃƒÂ¼sselrolle in der PandemiebewÃƒÂ¤ltigung besonders relevant. Die Studie untersuchte die Impfbereitschaft des Gesundheitspersonals in Deutschland in AbhÃƒÂ¤ngigkeit von soziodemografischen, berufsbezogenen und COVID-19-spezifischen Merkmalen sowie psychischer Gesundheit. Zwischen November 2020 und Januar 2021 wurden 6217 BeschÃƒÂ¤ftigte im deutschen Gesundheitswesen mithilfe der Onlinebefragung VOICE im Rahmen des Netzwerks UniversitÃƒÂ¤tsmedizin (NUM) zu ihrer Impfbereitschaft, ihren soziodemografischen, berufsbezogenen, COVID-19-spezifischen und psychosozialen Daten befragt.

"PERSPECTIVE: The Digital Health App Policy Landscape: Regulatory Gaps and Choices Through the Lens of Mental Health","Interest in and use of mental health apps have grown over the past decade, and now further with the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health offers potential to increase access to care, but tangible risks around safety and poor efficacy remain common. We conduct a select analysis of U.S. and international published evidence, government websites, grey literature, and media outlets. We present the marked discordance around digital mental health policy, as these frameworks grapple with the challenges of regulating in this sphere. Across the world, there is no consensus around evaluation with countries piloting or proposing different models. Common barriers include the defining the scope and risk of health apps, creating processes able to update evaluation with software updates, lacking better data to inform evaluation, and educating users to the risks and benefits. We propose four next steps for guiding any future policy: (i) clear clarification of the categorical status of mental health apps; (ii) objective methodology for assessing apps on a premarket basis which does not solely rely on self-reporting; (iii) well-designed, detailed procedures for iterative post-market app review; (iv) clinician and patient education which empowers users to make smart mental health app choices.","Kahane, FranÃƒÂ§ois, Torous","https://www.google.com/search?q=PERSPECTIVE:+The+Digital+Health+App+Policy+Landscape:+Regulatory+Gaps+and+Choices+Through+the+Lens+of+Mental+Health.","20210923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18220,""

"High prevalence of long-term olfactory, gustatory, and chemesthesis dysfunction in post-COVID-19 patients: a matched case-control study with one-year follow-up using a comprehensive psychophysical evaluation","Using an age and gender matched-pair case-control study, we aimed to estimate the long-term prevalence of psychophysical olfactory, gustatory , and chemesthesis impairment at least one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection considering the background of chemosensory dysfunction in non-COVID-19 population. This case-controlled study included 100 patients who were home-isolated for mildly symptomatic COVID-19 between March and April 2020. One control regularly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and always tested negative was matched to each case according to gender and age. Chemosensory function was investigated by a comprehensive psychophysical evaluation including ortho- and retronasal olfaction and an extensive assessment of gustatory function. Differences in chemosensory parameters were evaluated through either Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test. The psychophysical assessment of chemosensory function took place after a median of 401 days from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive swab. The evaluation of orthonasal smell identified 46% and 10% of cases and controls, respectively, having olfactory dysfunction, with 7% of COVID-19 cases being functionally anosmic. Testing of gustatory function revealed a 27% of cases versus 10% of controls showing a gustatory impairment. Nasal trigeminal sensitivity was significantly lower in cases compared to controls. Persistent chemosensory impairment was associated with emotional distress and depression. More than one year after the onset of COVID-19, cases exhibited an excess of olfactory, gustatory , and chemesthesis disturbances compared to matched-pair controls with these symptoms being associated to emotional distress and depression.","Boscolo-Rizzo, Hummel, Hopkins, Dibattista, Menini, Spinato, Fabbris, Emanuelli, D'Alessandro, Marzolino, Zanelli, Cancellieri, Cargnelutti, Fadda, Borsetto, Vaira, Gardenal, Polesel, Tirelli","https://doi.org/10.4193/Rhin21.249","20210923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18222,""
"Adaptation of fuel selection to acute decrease in voluntary energy expenditure is governed by dietary macronutrient composition in mice","In humans, exercise-induced thermogenesis is a markedly variable component of total energy expenditure, which had been acutely affected worldwide by COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition may affect metabolic adaptation/fuel selection in response to an acute decrease in voluntary activity. Using mice fed short-term high-fat diet (HFD) compared to low-fat diet (LFD)-fed mice, we evaluated whole-body fuel utilization by metabolic cages before and 3Ã‚Â days after omitting a voluntary running wheel in the cage. Short-term (24-48Ã‚Â h) HFD was sufficient to increase energy intake, fat oxidation, and decrease carbohydrate oxidation. Running wheel omission did not change energy intake, but resulted in a significant 50% decrease in total activity and a ~20% in energy expenditure in the active phase (night-time), compared to the period with wheel, irrespective of the dietary composition, resulting in significant weight gain. Yet, while in LFD wheel omission significantly decreased active phase fat oxidation, thereby trending to increase respiratory exchange ratio (RER), in HFD it diminished active phase carbohydrate oxidation. In conclusion, acute decrease in voluntary activity resulted in positive energy balance in mice on both diets, and decreased oxidation of the minor energy (macronutrient) fuel source, demonstrating that dietary macronutrient composition determines fuel utilization choices under conditions of acute changes in energetic demand.","Bhandarkar, Lahav, Maixner, Haim, Wong, Rudich, Yoel","https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.15044","20210923","COVID-19; energy expenditure; high-fat diet; metabolic cages; running wheel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18223,""

"Changes in Motivation, Socialization, Wellness and Mental Health in Youth Long-Distance Runners During COVID-19 Social Distancing Restrictions","<b>Purpose:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the sporting and exercise activities of millions of youth. Running is an activity that could be maintained while social distancing restrictions were implemented during the pandemic. However, a recent study has indicated that youth runners reported lower running distance, frequency, and intensity during COVID-19. The reason for this reduction and the impact on overall well-being is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the social distancing restrictions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic influenced running motives, socialization, wellness and mental health in youth long-distance runners. <b>Methods:</b> A customized, open online questionnaire was provided to runners 9-19 years of age who participated in long-distance running activities including team/club cross-country, track and field (distances Ã¢â€°Â¥800 m), road races, or recreational running. Participants responded to questions about demographics, motive for running, and wellness (sleep quality, anxiety, running enjoyment, food consumption quality) 6-months before as well as during social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19. Wilcoxon signed rank tests compared differences for ratio data and Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions before and during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05. <b>Results:</b> A total of 287 youth long-distance runners (male = 124, female = 162, unspecified = 1; age = 15.3 Ã‚Â± 1.7 years; running experience = 5.0 Ã‚Â± 2.3 years) participated. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth long-distance runners reported lower overall motivation to run (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and changes to most motive rankings (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 to <i>p</i> = 0.71). The proportion of youth running alone increased during COVID-19 (65.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 (13.8%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Youth long-distance runners also reported less running enjoyment (<i>p</i> = 0.001), longer sleep duration (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), lower sleep quality (<i>p</i> = 0.05), more anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.043), and lower food quality consumed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) during COVID-19 social distance restrictions. <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 social distancing restrictions resulted in significant decreases in motivation and enjoyment of running. The removal of competition and team-based interactions likely had a role in these decreases for this population. Continuing team-based activities (e.g., virtual) during social distancing may help with maintaining motivation of youth long-distance runners. Reduced running occurred concurrently with reduced overall well-being of youth long-distance runners during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bazett-Jones, Garcia, Taylor-Haas, Long, Rauh, Paterno, Ford","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.696264","20210923","adolescent; anxiety; cross-country; enjoyment; nutrition; sleep; track and field","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18225,""
"Mental Health Issues in the COVID-19 Pandemic and Responses in Bangladesh: View Point of Media Reporting","<b>Background:</b> The negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health has been reported by media throughout the world, although this role is not well-understood in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). We examined the reporting of mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh and initiatives undertaken to support mental health reported from the viewpoint of media. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed articles published in 10 local newspapers, including seven Bangla and three English newspapers, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. News topics were identified through discussions among the team members, with searches across online newspapers and portals. Data extrapolated from newspapers were documented in an Excel spreadsheet. A mixed-method approach was used following a framework analysis for analyzing data. Recurring issues and commonly emerging topics were generated from the data. Descriptive statistics were applied for analyzing quantitative data. <b>Results:</b> Between March 2020 and March 2021, we have identified 201 reports on mental health issues including 45 reports (22.4%) focused on stress due to the associated financial crisis, unemployment and loneliness, 50 reports (24.9%) of 80 apparent suicides linked to family issues, disharmony in conjugal relationships, harassment, sexual violence, emotional breakdown, financial crisis, and stigma due to COVID-19.There were 77 reports (38.3%) concerning domestic violence during the pandemic. Twenty-nine reports (14.4%) referenced actions taken by different organizations to address mental health issues in response to the pandemic in Bangladesh. <b>Conclusion:</b> News coverage has the scope to highlight important issues that can emerge as a consequence of the COVID-pandemic, such as mental health, in a low resource setting. Capacity building of the media on the way to report mental health issues during emergency situations could be a useful strategy for more credible reporting on mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic for raising awareness of the public and policymakers about the negative consequences on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Adopting policies to support essential mental health care and promoting the local organizations to take timely public health measures will be imperative for averting the negative consequences of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.","Nabila Ashraf, Jennings, Chakma, Farzana, Islam, Maruf, Uddin, Uddin Ahmed, McDaid, Naheed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.704726","20210923","COVID-19; domestic violence; media review; mental health stress; newspapers; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18226,""
"Being the Father of a Preterm-Born Child: Contemporary Research and Recommendations for NICU Staff","<b>Background:</b> Most studies on parental reactions to a preterm birth and to hospitalization of the newborn in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) have involved mothers. However, emotional responses and behaviors of fathers are equally important. Usually, the father is the first to meet the preterm newborn, to find out information about baby's condition and to communicate to the mother and other family members. In this context he is often left alone and can show psychological difficulties including affective disorders such as depression or anxiety. This paper describes the role of fathers in the NICU, the best practices to support fathers, and to explain the role of a psychologist in the NICU staff. Considerations and suggestions are provided on the difficulties encountered to support parents, with a focus on the role of fathers during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods and Discussion:</b> Considering contemporary research data and following an attachment perspective, we analyze the role of the father of a preterm-born child in the relation with the partner and in newborn caring. Research has shown that involving fathers in newborn care in NICU and at home is essential not only because it promotes the father/son attachment relationship and has positive effects on the psychological and somatic development of the newborn, but also for the health of the mother and whole family. <b>Conclusion:</b> Recommendations are provided to enhance the functions of fathers in the NICU, promote their involvement in the care of their infant, and interventions to prevent the manifestation of psychological suffering and/or perinatal affective disorders. The commitments of a psychologist in a NICU team are presented and require not only clinical skills, but also the ability to manage the emotional and relational difficulties of fathers, family and NICU staff. Considerations and suggestions are provided on the difficulties encountered by parents in the NICU during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Baldoni, Ancora, Latour","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.724992","20210923","COVID-19; family-centered care; father; neonatal intensive care unit; perinatal affective disorders; preterm infants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18227,""
"Patients' Satisfaction With Telepsychiatry Services at a University Hospital in Riyadh During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background and objective Telepsychiatry uses electronic communication and various technologies to provide psychiatric care by a psychiatrist in one location to a patient in another location. It was originally created to meet the mental health needs of patients in rural, remote, and inaccessible areas. This study aimed to assess the satisfaction level with telepsychiatry from patients' perspectives and to study whether the satisfaction levels influence the patients' decision to use the service in the future. Methodology This was a cross-sectional survey study conducted at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study included psychiatric patients with complete medical records who were followed up through the telepsychiatry program over the phone due to the restriction and regulation implemented by the government in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The data were collected via a questionnaire designed on a Google Form. Initially, the sample sizeÃ‚Â was set at 337 psychiatric patients, but only 141 patients agreed to be included. The SPSS Statistics program (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to analyze the data. Results Patients were generally satisfied with the telepsychiatry services; 80.1%, 95.7%, and 96.5%Ã‚Â of the participants were satisfied with the structure, process, and outcome, respectively, and 94.3% of the patients reported a sense of overall satisfaction. The study did not find any relationship between satisfaction and demographic characteristics. Patients highly valued some aspects during the service use, such as comfort, privacy, easy access, carefulness, and skillfulness of the clinicians. Of the respondents, 24.1%Ã‚Â agreed and 24.8%Ã‚Â strongly agreed when asked if they would use the service in the future. Conclusion Patients had generally positive satisfaction levels toward telepsychiatry service, and many reported that they would like to continue using it in the future. However, further studies are needed to assess whether patient perception will change over time after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Almalky, Alhaidar","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17307","20210923","mental health; pandemic; patients' perspectives; satisfaction; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18228,""

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Societal Infection Control Measures on Children and Adolescents' Mental Health: A Scoping Review","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is primarily a crisis that affects people's physical health. However, it is well-known from previous epidemics and pandemics that there are other indirect negative impacts on mental health, among others. The purpose of this scoping review was to explore and summarise primary empirical research evidence on how the COVID-19 pandemic and societal infection control measures have impacted children and adolescents' mental health. <b>Methods:</b> A literature search was conducted in five scientific databases: PubMed, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINHAL, and Social Science Premium Collection. The search string was designed using the Population (0-18 years), Exposure (COVID-19), Outcomes (mental health) framework. Mental health was defined broadly, covering mental well-being to mental disorders and psychiatric conditions. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-nine studies were included in the scoping review. Of these, 44 were cross-sectional and 15 were longitudinal studies. Most studies reported negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health outcomes, yet the evidence was mixed. This was also the case for studies investigating societal control measures. Strong resilience, positive emotion regulation, physical activity, parental self-efficacy, family functioning and emotional regulation, and social support were reported as protective factors. On the contrary, emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance, exposure to excessive information, COVID-19 school concerns, presence of COVID-19 cases in the community, parental mental health problems, and high internet, social media and video game use were all identified as potentially harmful factors. <b>Conclusions:</b> Due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies and geographical variation, it is challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. However, the existing body of research gives some insight to how parents, clinicians and policy makers can take action to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and control measures. Interventions to promote physical activity and reduce screen time among children and adolescents are recommended, as well as parenting support programs.","Marchi, Johansson, Sarkadi, Warner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.711791","20210923","COVID-19; adolescents; children; mental health; pandemic; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18230,""
"Mental health of new undergraduate students before and after COVID-19 in China","The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in severity of anxiety and depression symptoms, stress and sleeping quality after three months of mass quarantine for COVID-19 among undergraduate fresh students compared to their pre-COVID-19 measures. We used participants from the Chinese Undergraduate Cohort (CUC), a national prospective longitudinal study to examine the changes in anxiety and depression symptoms severity, stress and sleep quality after being under mass quarantine for three months. Wilcoxon matched pair signed-rank test was used to compare the lifestyle indicators. Severity of anxiety, depression symptoms, stress and sleep quality were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) to further quantify the change in mental health indicators and sleep quality after the COVID-19 mass quarantine compared to baseline. This study found that there was no deterioration in mental health status among Chinese new undergraduate students in 2020 after COVID-19 mass quarantine compared with the baseline measures in 2019. There was an improvement in sleep quality and anxiety symptoms. After adjusting for age, sex, exercise habit, time spent on mobile gadgets, and time spent outdoors, year 2020 was significantly associated with severity of depression symptoms in males (OR:1.52. 95%CI:1.05-2.20, p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027). Year 2020 was significantly associated with the improvement of sleeping quality in total (OR:0.45, 95%CI:0.38-0.52, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and in all the subgroups. This longitudinal study found no deterioration in mental health status among Chinese new undergraduate students after three months of mass quarantine for COVID-19.","Lu, Yang, Wang, Xia, Xiang, Chen, Jiang, Ye, Pang, Sun, Yan, Su, Heyworth, Huxley, Fisher, Li, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98140-3","20210923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18231,""
"Adjunctive inspiratory muscle training for patients with COVID-19 (COVIDIMT): protocol for randomised controlled double-blind trial","A significant number of patients with COVID-19 may experience dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue and physical impairment symptoms, raising the need for a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach, especially for those with advanced age, obesity, comorbidities and organ failure. Traditional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), including exercise training, psychosocial counselling and education, has been employed to improve pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COVID-19. However, the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in PR programmes remain unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the addition of a supervised IMT in a PR is more effective than PR itself in improving dyspnoea, health-related quality of life and exercise capacity in symptomatic patients with post-COVID-19. This parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, powered for superiority, aimed to assess exercise capacity as the primary outcome. A total of 138 are being recruited at two PR centres in Brazil. Following baseline testing, participants will be randomised using concealed allocation, to receive either (1) standard PR with sham IMT or (2) standard PR added to IMT. Treatment effects or differences between the outcomes (at baseline, after 8 and 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, and after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months) of the study groups will be analysed using an ordinary two-way analysis of variance. This trial was approved by the Brazilian National Ethics Committee and obtained approval on 7 October 2020 (document number 4324069). The findings will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

"Detrimental changes to the health and well-being of healthcare workers in an Australian COVID-19 hospital","Most studies examining the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCWs) have assessed well-being during the initial stages or the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. We aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 and potential changes over time in its impact, on the health and well-being of HCWs in an Australian COVID-19 hospital. An online questionnaire assessed current and retrospective physical and mental health; psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale); lifestyle behaviours; and demographics, providing measures of health and wellbeing at three phases of the pandemic. Targeted staff were invited to participate via email and in-person. Additional promotional activities were directed to all staff. Changes in general health, mental health and psychological distress were examined using McNemar's Chi-square. Associations between other categorical variables were tested using Chi-Square or non-parametric equivalents as appropriate. Logistic regression explored risk factors for current distress. Four hundred thirty-three eligible HCWs answered all (74Ã¢â‚¬â€°%) or part of the questionnaire. Current self-rated health and mental health were significantly better than during the height of theÃ‚Â pandemic, but had not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Psychological distress was significantly more common during the height of the pandemic (34.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°%) than currently (22.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°%), and during the height of the pandemic distress was significantly more common among younger than older HCWs. Females were significantly more likely to be distressed that males currently, but not during the height of the pandemic. High distress during the height of the pandemic was more likely to be maintained by HCWs who were less physically active than usual during the height of the pandemic (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.5); had low self-rated mental health before the pandemic (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.8); and who had 10 or more years of professional experience (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.9). The adverse effects of the pandemic on HCWs have lessened with the easing of pandemic demands, but health and well-being have not reverted to pre-pandemic levels. This indicates continued exposure to elevated levels of stress and/or a sustained effect of earlier exposure. Initiatives that provide ongoing support beyond the pandemic are needed to ensure that HCWs remain physically and mentally healthy and are able to continue their invaluable work.","Stubbs, Achat, Schindeler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07013-y","20210923","Hospital staff; Lifestyle; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Repeated measures; Retrospective recall","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18233,""
"Navigating the COVID-19 infodemic in those living with kidney disease: access and trust in health information sources and the association with anxiety and depression","During COVID-19, access to trustworthy news and information is vital to help people understand the crisis. The consumption of COVID-19-related information is likely an important factor associated with the increased anxiety and psychological distress that has been observed. We aimed to understand how people living with a kidney condition access information about COVID-19 and how this impacts their anxiety, stress, and depression. Participants living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were recruited from 12 sites across England, UK. Respondents were asked to review how often they accessed and trusted 11 sources of potential COVID-19 information. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items was used to measure depression, anxiety, and stress. The 14-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory measured health anxiety. 236 participants were included (age 62.8 (11.3) years, male (56%), transplant recipients (51%), non-dialysis (49%)). The most frequently accessed source of health information was television/radio news, followed by official government press releases, and medical institution press releases. The most trusted source was <i>via</i> consultation with healthcare staff. Higher anxiety, stress, and depression was associated with less access and trust in official government press releases. Education status had a large influence on information trust and access. Traditional forms of media remain a popular source of health information in those living with kidney conditions. Interactions with healthcare professionals were the most trusted source of health information. Our results provide evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related information exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations.","Wilkinson, Lightfoot, Palmer, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1984221","20210923","COVID-19; Chronic kidney disease; anxiety; depression; health information; infodemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","",18234,""
"Altering Dynamics of Autonomic Processing Therapy (ADAPT) trial: a novel, targeted treatment for reducing anxiety in joint hypermobility","Hypermobility is a poorly recognised and understood musculoskeletal disorder thought to affect around 20% of the population. Hypermobility is associated with reduced physiological and psychological functioning and quality of life and is a known risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder. To date, no evidence-based, targeted treatment for anxiety in the context of hypermobility exists. The present intervention (ADAPT-Altering Dynamics of Autonomic Processing Therapy) is a novel therapy combining bio-behavioural training with cognitive approaches from clinical health psychology targeting the catastrophisation of internal sensations, with aim to improve autonomic trait prediction error. Eighty individuals with diagnosed hypermobility will be recruited and the efficacy of ADAPT to treat anxiety will be compared to an Emotion-Focused Supportive Therapy (EFST) comparator therapy in a randomised controlled trial. The primary treatment target will be post therapy score on the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and secondary outcomes will also be considered in relation to interoception, depression, alexithymia, social and work adjustment, panic symptoms and dissociation. Due to COVID restrictions, the intervention will be moved to online delivery and qualitative assessment of treatment tolerance to online therapy will also be assessed. Online delivery of an intervention targeting anxiety would improve the quality of life for those experiencing anxiety disorder and help to reduce the Ã‚Â£11.7 billion that anxiety disorders cost the UK economy annually.
