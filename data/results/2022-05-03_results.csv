"Greek teachers' resilience levels during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and its association with attitudes towards emergency remote teaching and perceived stress","The mandatory closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic affected the mental health, and, by extension, the personal and professional life of teachers. This study explored their level of resilience during the pandemic and its association with attitudes towards emergency remote teaching and perceived stress. Data were collected through the administration of three self-report instruments: (a) the ?Teachers' Professional Attitudes and Behaviors Scale?, (b) the ?Teachers' Resilience Scale?, and (c) the ?Perceived Stress Scale?. The sample consisted of 1415 general teachers from central Greece. Teachers were found to possess neutral attitudes towards emergency remote teaching, moderate levels of resilience, and experienced slightly increased levels of stress. The examined constructs were largely influenced by some of the teachers' demographic and professional characteristics. Teachers' perceptions of resilience predicted their attitudes to emergency remote teaching and stress levels during the pandemic. The study has reaffirmed the importance of holding sufficient levels of resilience to cope with adverse circumstances and has offered clear directions about which groups of teachers are in most need for counselling and professional support so that their resilience is strengthened.","Papazis, Filippos, Avramidis, Elias, Bacopoulou, Flora","https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22709","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology in the Schools; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30814,""
"Psychological state and its correlates of local college students in Wuhan during COVID-19 pandemic","In 2020, the lockdown of Wuhan due to the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted various aspects of local college students' life and may further negatively affect their psychological state. This study was conducted among 652 Wuhan local college students during the quarantine of this city. We assessed their psychological state using Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale 21 and evaluated their living condition including diet, schedule, recreational activities, social contact, academic life, and attention paid to pandemic news. Results showed that 16.87% of the students reported stress, 28.68% with anxiety, and 35.12% had depression. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, having a medical background was associated with higher stress levels;students who had an irregular diet and schedule were more likely to develop stress, anxiety, and depression;students with their academic life affected had a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression. By studying local students in the hardest-hit area during the pandemic, our findings can provide references for the improvement of college students' mental health in the long term.","Liu, Fenghuixue, Dai, Luojia, Cai, Yuyang, Chen, Xin, Li, Jiaqing, Shi, Lili","https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22699","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology in the Schools; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30815,""
"â€œHer Voice is Proudâ€: Exploring the Intersections of Writing, Gender, and Mental Health","In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, challenges with adolescent mental health are on the rise, making the need for spaces where teens share their emotions and experiences all the more vital. This single-case study explores the impact of writing on one young woman's (Celia) mental health during Girl Power, a gender empowerment poetry writing workshop for adolescent girls. Celia's poems, interviews, and discussions illustrate the complexity of the intersections of mental health with friendship, body image, and identity as a girl, revealing the benefits of a supportive community for writing for self and catharsis. This article concludes with practical implications for the healing power of writing both in and out of the classroom.

"Children's anxiety sensitivity as a moderator of behavioral avoidance in child and parent interventions for anxiety","Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in children and adolescents, accounting for increased incidence rates in late childhood through early adolescence. Although evidence-based treatments exist for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, the researchers of most recent literature call for the integration of dismantling studies to further understand the conditions in which these treatments are effective. Anxiety sensitivity has historically been conceptualized as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders. However, scant research has addressed the ways in which anxiety sensitivity plays a role in the overall effectiveness of evidence-based treatment as well as reduced functional impairment in anxious children. The current study contributes to the emerging dismantling studies by understanding for whom evidence-based child and parent-based treatments are effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The current sample included children age 6-14 who were enrolled in either individual cognitive behavioral therapy or Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions (SPACE). A paired samples t-test and moderation analyses were run to assess the relationship of treatment condition on behavioral avoidance as a function of anxiety sensitivity. Results indicated that both CBT and SPACE treatment conditions significantly reduced behavioral avoidance. However, Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI) Total and subscale scores did not statistically significantly moderate this relationship. Implications of this study during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future directions are discussed.

"The association between the perceived adequacy of workplace infection control procedures and personal protective equipment with mental health symptoms: A cross-sectional survey of Canadian health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: To examine the relationship between perceived adequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) and workplace-based infection control procedures (ICP) and mental health symptoms among a sample of health-care workers in Canada within the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A convenience-based internet survey of health-care workers in Canada was facilitated through various labor organizations between April 7 and May 13, 2020. A total of 7,298 respondents started the survey, of which 5,988 reported information on the main exposures and outcomes. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screener, and depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) screener. We assessed the perceived need and adequacy of 8 types of PPE and 10 different ICP. Regression analyses examined the proportion of GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across levels of PPE and ICP, adjusted for a range of demographic, occupation, workplace, and COVID-19-specific measures. Results: A total of 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.5% to 56.1%) of the sample had GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 42.3% (95% CI, 41.0% to 43.6%) of the sample had PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher. Absolute differences of 18% (95% CI, 12% to 23%) and 17% (95% CI, 12% to 22%) were observed in the prevalence of GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher between workers whose perceived PPE needs and ICP needs were met compared to those who needs were not met. Differences of between 11% (95% CI, 6% to 17%) and 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%) were observed in PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across these same PPE and ICP categories.

"Pregnancy and the Risk of In-Hospital Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mortality","In a large cohort of reproductive-aged patients hospitalized with pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pregnancy was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether pregnancy is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients of reproductive age hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (April 2020â€“May 2021) of 23,574 female inpatients aged 15â€“45 years with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code for COVID-19 discharged from 749 U.S. hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. We used a viral pneumonia diagnosis to select for patients with symptomatic COVID-19. The associations between pregnancy and in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation were analyzed using propensity scoreâ€“matched conditional logistic regression. Models were matched for age, marital status, race and ethnicity, Elixhauser comorbidity score, payer, hospital number of beds, season of discharge, hospital region, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, deficiency anemias, depression, hypothyroidism, and liver disease. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality occurred in 1.1% of pregnant patients and 3.5% of nonpregnant patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia (propensity scoreâ€“matched odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.25â€“0.63). The frequency of ICU admission for pregnant and nonpregnant patients was 22.0% and 17.7%, respectively (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15â€“1.55). Mechanical ventilation was used in 8.7% of both pregnant and nonpregnant patients (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86â€“1.29). Among patients who were admitted to an ICU, mortality was lower for pregnant compared with nonpregnant patients (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20â€“0.57), though mechanical ventilation rates were similar (35.7% vs 38.3%, OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70â€“1.16). Among patients with mechanical ventilation, pregnant patients had a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality compared with nonpregnant patients (0.26, 95% CI 0.15â€“0.46). CONCLUSION: Despite a higher frequency of ICU admission, in-hospital mortality was lower among pregnant patients compared with nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and these findings persisted after propensity score matching.","Pineles, Beth L.; Goodman, Katherine E.; Pineles, Lisa, O'Hara, Lyndsay M.; Nadimpalli, Gita, Magder, Laurence S.; Baghdadi, Jonathan D.; Parchem, Jacqueline G.; Harris, Anthony D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pregnancy+and+the+Risk+of+In-Hospital+Coronavirus+Disease+2019+(COVID-19)+Mortality","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Obstetrics and gynecology; 139(5):846-854, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30824,""

"Association between news media consulting frequency and psychological distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: Examine the association between news media use frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale of psychological distress in pregnant women, considering this distress known harmful effects on the fetus development. Method: Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none;one time a day;several times a day;constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. Results: An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p &lt; 0.001, eta2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons a posteriori, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81). Conclusions: The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress. Results provide one of the first empirical supports to recommendations of World Health Organization, Canada government and psychiatric associations that encourage population to limit their news media consulting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults: Results of descriptive research","The results of previous research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related epidemiological measures on older adults' quality of life and well-being are inconsistent, with some not confirming the assumed adverse effects, while others point to significant negative effects on older adults' mental health and quality of life. The aim of this qualitative research was to examine the perceived impact of the pandemic and related epidemiological measures on Croatian older adults and their daily lives. Ninety-three community-dwelling older adults from different regions of Croatia, 65 to 90 years old, were interviewed. Three main themes were identified by the thematic analysis of the answers to the open-ended question on the impact of the pandemic and related epidemiological measures. These are the non-significant impact or good adaptation of the elderly to the pandemic and imposed measures, significant adverse and significant beneficial impact. The answers showed that the majority of interviewed older people (51%) adapted well to pandemic conditions and did not report significant changes in quality of life. However, a significant percentage (45%) highlighted the adverse impact of the pandemic, in three domains: compromised physical and mental health and general well-being, activity restrictions, and social distancing. Only four people reported positive impact of pandemic such as more frequent walks in nature, finishing some previous matters, turning to oneself, etc. The results suggest heterogeneity of the population of older people regarding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures and interventions aimed at preserving the quality of life and health in a pandemic should be targeted at all older people, but especially at-risk groups such as socially isolated and lonely older people.

Cilj je ovoga kvalitativnog istrazivanja bio ispitati percipirani utjecaj pandemije i propisanih mjera na starije osobe u Hrvatskoj i njihov svakodnevni zivot. Intervjuirane su 93 starije osobe iz prigodnog uzorka, u dobi od 65 do 90 godina, iz razlicitih krajeva Hrvatske. Tematskom analizom odgovora na pitanje otvorenog tipa o utjecaju pandemije i propisanih mjera identificirane su tri glavne teme: izostanak veceg utjecaja ili dobra prilagodba starijih osoba na pandemiju i propisane mjere, znacajan nepovoljan i znacajan povoljan utjecaj. Pokazalo se da se vecina intervjuiranih osoba (51%) dobro prilagodila pandemijskim uvjetima i da ne navodi znacajne promjene kvalitete zivota. Medutim, znacajan postotak (oko 45%) istaknuo je i nepovoljne efekte pandemije, i to u tri domene: ugrozeno tjelesno ili mentalno zdravlje i opca dobrobit, ogranicenja kretanja i uobicajenih aktivnosti te socijalno distanciranje. Samo cetiri osobe navele su pozitivne utjecaje pandemije poput cescih setnji u prirodi, obavljanja zaostalih poslova, veceg okretanja sebi itd. Rezultati upucuju na heterogenost populacije starijih osoba glede utjecaja pandemije COVID-a-19 na njihove zivote. Mjere i intervencije usmjerene na ocuvanje kvalitete zivota i zdravlja u uvjetima pandemije trebaju biti usmjerene na sve starije osobe, ali posebno na rizicne skupine kao sto su socijalno izolirane i usamljene starije osobe.

"Moving between experiences and new psychoanalytic frontiers","This article aims to dialogue with psychoanalysis in a frontier zone to show how a fundamental concept, such as the unconscious, has been transformed and expanded throughout the history of the psychoanalytic movement. Also, in the border area, we highlight Freud's thinking when he analyzes the civilization and its discontents, indicating that, considering the Covid-19 pandemic, we believe that we are living under the same aegis of the three sources of suffering mentioned in that work. Issues such as our own helplessness and our patients' helplessness, the impossibility of maintaining the traditional asymmetry, as well as the necessary adaptations to non-face-to-face sessions, are some of the topics addressed. We present theoretical perspectives that examine the mental state produced by the ""overlapping worlds phenomenon"", when the material brought to the session touches elements common to the lives of both patient and analyst. Clinical vignettes are introduced to illustrate this phenomenon Another frontier is also presented, which its heuristic value concerns the support of the articulator of uncertainty, understood as what presents itself as the new, the unpredictable, and its status and contribution to the psychoanalytic theory. The article ends by presenting a vivid picture of the reactions of patients and analysts, the framework and the analytical fields, from the beginning of the pandemic to the present moment.

"Adaptation of a remote therapy programme via online video during the COVID-19 lockdown","Adaptation of a remote therapy programme via online video during the COVID-19 lockdown Since December 2019, many countries have enforced lockdowns against the evolving COVID-19 outbreak, which led to a new and unprecedented situation for the world and the Swiss population. The impact of restriction of movement on mental and physical health was quickly observed and documented. In an ambulatory mental health centre in Geneva, we quickly created therapeutic groups to reduce these consequences and to support vulnerable patients under psychiatric care. Therapeutic groups of adapted physical activities, emotional management and nutrition were offered to the patients for nine weeks via online video conference. In 92.5% of cases, patients expressed a sense of well-being after a group session supervised by a professional. Limitations regarding the use of computer tools were highlighted, but prevention and health promotion provided by this means are undeniable. We honestly think that support measures must be anticipated in order to be able to react quickly on behalf of all vulnerable persons in the event of a COVID-19 rebound.

"The contribution of self-esteem, self-compassion, and self-acceptance/self-condemnation in predicting psychopathology and well-being","Many self-concepts have developed over time. This study investigated the relationship between self-esteem, unconditional self-acceptance (USA)/irrational self-condemnation, and self-compassion. Each of these aspects of the self is thought to lead to disturbance, yet the relationship of these concepts to each other and which has the unique influence on psychopathology and well-being, is unclear. The current study sampled 303 adults from the United States of America who completed scales measuring each of the self-constructs and anxiety, depression, anger, and flourishing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated mostly medium to large, correlational relationships amongst the self-constructs, as well as the self and positive and negative emotions. Evidence supported the self as four separate constructs. Total self-compassion accounted for the most unique variance in predicting anxiety and anger, while self-compassion and USA accounted for the greatest variance in predicting depression and flourishing. Self-compassion was also deconstructed by subscale to examine its relation to each criterion variable. However, total self-compassion was deemed the strongest predictor of positive and negative emotions. The interplay of subscales leads to a strong sense of self, evidenced by decreased psychopathology and increased well-being. These findings should inform future therapeutic treatment plans and interventions.

"Resilience in the time of pandemic","Comments on an editorial Mental health of communities during the COVID-19 pandemic by D. Vigo et al. (2020). Vigo et al. summarize a timely analysis of the psychological impact the current pandemic might have on the general population and vulnerable groups. The authors start by outlining the continuum of foreseeable health-related anxieties with deleterious consequences on both ends of that spectrum. They astutely predict the range of traumatic experiences and trauma related disorders, the negative complications of social isolation, and the specific risks that communities can face: stigma, discrimination, substance use disorders, violence, mass poverty, and medical complications. While the authors present well-informed opinions and sensible solutions, they only touch in passing on the role of resilience in the face of adversity. This oversight is important since most people facing hardship and loss adapt fast and well. Adversity does not only create illness but also breeds strength. In the face of major loss, humans often find the power to reconnect with loved ones and each other, reevaluate their survival skills, and consolidate their capacity for health and wellbeing.

"Parenting in a Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration of Parentsâ€™ Experiences of Supporting their Children During the Covid-19 Pandemic (preprint)","This qualitative study examined parentsâ€™ experiences of supporting their children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventeen parents of children aged 2-16 years from diverse backgrounds, living in the UK, were interviewed one-to-one about their experiences. Ten professionals working with children and families were also interviewed to gain a broader perspective of parentsâ€™ experiences. Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, we identified four central themes: a) worries and uncertainties;b) mental exhaustion;c) resources available to cope with the challenges;and d) finding the positives. Findings revealed the worries and uncertainties that parents faced regarding how best to support their child and the long-term consequences of the pandemic, as well as feelings of mental exhaustion from juggling multiple responsibilities. The impact of Covid-19 on parentsâ€™ wellbeing was varied and parents identified several factors that determined their ability to support their children, such as space in the home environment, support networks and their personal mental health. Despite the challenges, some parents reported positive experiences, such as strengthened family bonds during the pandemic. Our study emphasizes the importance of flexible work arrangements and family-friendly employment policies, as well as support for parents to enable them to support their children and look after their own wellbeing.","Waite, Polly, Shum, Adrienne, Burgess, Lowrie Caitlin Hulley, Pearcey, Samantha, Lawrence, Peter, Klampe, Marie-Louise, Cattel, Claire","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tnasg","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30839,""
"Early Impacts of College, Interrupted: Considering First-Year Studentsâ€™ Narratives about COVID and Reports of Adjustment during College Shutdowns (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened lives and livelihoods, imperiled families and communities, and disrupted developmental milestones globally. Among the critical developmental disruptions experienced is the transition to college, which is common and foundational for personal and social exploration. During college shutdowns (Spring 2020), we recruited 633 first year, US students (M age = 18.83 years;71.3% cisgender women) to provide narratives about the impacts of the pandemic. We tested the ways narrative features were associated with concurrent and longitudinal COVID stressors, psychosocial adjustment, and identity development. Narrative growth expressed in Spring 2020 was positively associated with psychosocial adjustment and global identity development and was negatively associated with mental health concerns. Associations were supported concurrently and at one-year follow-up. Growth partly explained associations between COVID stressors and studentsâ€™ adjustment. Our findings reinforce the importance of growth for resilience and underscore the importance of connective reasoning as people navigate a chronic stress.","Booker, Jordan Ashton, Ell, Mikayla, Fivush, Robyn, Greenhoot, Andrea, McLean, Kate, Wainryb, Cecilia, Pasupathi, Monisha","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hkzwx","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30840,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Florida medical studentsâ€™ wellbeing and academic experience during â€œlockdownâ€ (preprint)","Introduction:  The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to demonstrate considerable impacts on all aspects of life, as well as mental health across populations. Medical students may be considered a particularly vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the compounding mental stress of a demanding medical education. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was designed for medical students in the state of Florida, USA, to collect their perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their personal daily habits, perceived social connectedness, academic outlook, and anxiety levels using a General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. Results: From the ten medical schools in Florida, 96 students responded. 94% of student respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their academic experience, but only 55% of students felt their medical school adequately mitigated the negative effect of the pandemic on their education, psychological well-being, and personal health. GAD-7 analysis revealed 36 students with mild, 15 with moderate, and 6 with severe anxiety symptoms. Students rated interruption of daily habits and feeling others were not following health guidelines as the most influential factors for their increased anxiety. Factors related to decreased anxiety were communication with family, practicing relaxation techniques, and avoiding public exposure. Discussion: Increased levels of anxiety were common amongst students during the pandemic. Students should be encouraged to seek appropriate resources and outlets to mitigate the effects of anxiety on their psychological well-being and academic success.","Baajour, Shadi, Wahood, Waseem, Carnevale, Kate","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1562079/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30841,""
"The Evolution of the COVID-19 Pandemic Through the Lens of Google Searches (preprint)","Real-time data is essential for policymakers to adapt to a rapidly evolving situation like the COVID-19 pandemic. Relying on Google search interest data across 207 countries and territories, we demonstrate the capacity of publicly-available, real-time data to anticipate COVID-19 cases;evaluate the economic, mental health, and social impacts of containment policies;and identify demand for (mis)information about COVID-19 vaccines. We show that: (1) search interest in COVID-specific symptoms can anticipate rising COVID-19 cases across both high- and low-income settings;(2) countries with more restrictive containment policies experienced larger socio-economic externalities;in addition, lower-income countries experienced less searches for unemployment, but more pronounced mental health externalities;and (3) high vaccination rates are associated with strong demand for information about vaccine appointments and side effects;in some settings, high interest in misinformation search terms is associated with low vaccination rates. Overall, the results demonstrate that real-time search interest data can be a valuable tool for both high- and low-income countries to inform policies across multiple stages of the pandemic.","Marty, Robert, Maqueda, Manuel Ramos, Khan, Nausheen, Reichert, Arndt","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1551521/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30842,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related quarantine on female sexual behavior:A cross-sectional study in Chinese (preprint)","Aim:  To investigate the impact and factors of home quarantine life on women's sexual life and behavior in different areas of China, and analyze the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: We selected adult women (over 18 years old) who have regular sexual life (including regular masturbation) and had been isolated at home for at least one month during the COVID-19 outbreak. We use online questionnaires to survey respondents, the content of this questionnaire includes three parts: general demographic information, the impact of the epidemic on sexual life, and the Female Sexual Dysfunction Scale. Results: After screening, a total of 678 complete questionnaires were recovered in this study. The results showed that during the epidemic, the overall score of female sexual dysfunction (FSFI) was 21.98Â±6.38, the incidence of FSD was 61.9%, the incidence of FSD in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Ningxia were 60.6%, 75.2%, and 52.2%, respectively. The differences in the incidence of FSFI score and other specific items (Desire, Arousal, Lubrication, Orgasm, Satisfaction, and Pain) are in the three regions were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). In a separate analysis of women who used masturbation for sex, we found that the incidence of FSD was 34.4%, which was lower than paired sexual intercourse 60.1%.(p&lt;0.05). Further analysis we found that the occurrence of FSD during the epidemic was related to different age stages, menopause, mode of delivery, degree of anxiety and depression, and different sexual lifestyles. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a great impact on people's spiritual life and sexual life. This impact has a negative impact on mental health, but for sex life it has both negative and positive effects, which is mainly caused by it is determined by the characteristics of this life mode of home isolation. In addition, we comparatively analyzed the sexual health status and influencing factors of sexual intercourse and masturbation groups during the epidemic, which helps us to care about the sexual health of masturbation population. Finally, we also found that sex knowledge and education are lacking in many women, which may be the root cause of sex unhealthy. And we should pay attention to the importance of sexual health in epidemic, and having a harmonious and stable sex life will help us get through the boring life of isolation.","Li, Guangyong, Yu, Puguang, Zhang, Fen, Xu, Yanlong, Zhou, Gaiyan, Zhan, Xuekang, Gao, Yu, Liu, Hetao, Du, Xaoli, He, Rui","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1549167/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30843,""

This study aimed to investigate the level of anxiety, anger, and depression among health professionals in COVID-related special circumstances. A mass COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a general hospital in Korea. In total, 149 frontline and non-frontline health professionals involved in this were surveyed. Their anger, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, General Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Korean Screening Tool for Depressive disorders. By occupation, health professionals showed relatively higher anxiety and depression than non-health professionals. By type of work, frontline staff showed a higher level of depression than non-frontline staff.

"Symptoms, physical measures and cognitive tests after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large population-based case-control study (preprint)","Persistent symptoms are common after SARS-CoV-2 infection but the correlation with objective measures is unclear. We utilized the deCODE Health Study to compare multiple symptoms and physical measures between 1,721 Icelanders with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (cases) and 546 contemporary and 13,842 historical controls. Cases participated in the study five to 17 months after the acute infection. One percent reported still suffering severe symptoms more than a year after the infection. 46 of the 88 symptoms explored associated with prior infection, most significantly disturbed smell and taste, memory disturbance, and dyspnea. On the contrary, only a handful of objective measures associated with prior infection. Cases were more likely to have measured impairment in smell and taste, lower grip strength, and poorer immediate and delayed memory recall than controls. No other objective measure associated with prior infection including heart rate, blood pressure, postural orthostatic tachycardia, oxygen saturation, exercise tolerance, hearing, and traditional inflammatory, cardiac, liver and kidney blood biomarkers. There was no evidence of more anxiety or depression among cases. We estimated the prevalence of long Covid to be 7â€“8%. Thus, in our large case-control study of mostly non-hospitalized Icelanders, diverse symptoms were common after SARS-CoV-2 infection while objective differences between cases and controls were few and, except for smell and taste, small. Discrepancies between symptoms and objective measures suggest a more complicated biological or biopsychosocial contribution to symptoms related to prior infection than is captured by conventional tests. Traditional clinical assessment would thus not be expected to be particularly informative in relating symptoms to a past SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Holm, Hilma, Ivarsdottir, Erna, Olafsdottir, Thorhildur, Thorolfsdottir, Rosa, Eythorsson, Elias, Norland, Kristjan, Gisladottir, Rosa, Jonsdottir, Gudrun, Unnsteinsdottir, Unnur, Sveinsdottir, Kristin, Jonsson, Benedikt, Andresdottir, Margret, Arnar, David, Arnthorsson, Asgeir, Birgisdottir, Kolbrun, Bjarnadottir, Kristborg, Bjarnadottir, Solveig, Bjornsdottir, Gyda, Einarsson, Gudmundur, Eiriksdottir, Berglind, Gardarsdottir, Elisabet, Gislason, Thorarinn, Gottfredsson, Magnus, Gudmunsdottir, Steinunn, Gudmundsson, Julius, Gunnarsdottir, Kristbjorg, HelgadÃ³ttir, Anna, Helgason, Dadi, Hinriksdottir, Ingibjorg, Ingvarsson, Ragnar, Jonasdottir, Sigga, Jonsdottir, Ingileif, Karlsdottir, Tekla, Kristinsdottir, Anna, Kristinsson, Sigurdur, Kristjansdottir, Steinunn, Love, Thorvardur, Ludviksdottir, Dora, Masson, Gisli, Nordahl, Gudmundur, Olafsdottir, Thorunn, Olafsson, Isleifur, Rafnar, Thorunn, Runolfsdottir, Hrafnhildur, Saemundsdottir, Jona, Sigurbjornsson, Svanur, Sigurdardottir, Kristin, Sigurdsson, Engilbert, Steinthorsdottir, Valgerdur, Sveinbjornsson, Gardar, Thorarensen, Emil, Thorbjornsson, Bjarni, Thorsteinsdottir, Brynja, Tragante, Vinicius, Ulfarsson, Magnus, Sigurdsson, Martin, Sigurdsson, Emil, Stefansson, Hreinn, Gislason, Thorsteinn, Palsson, Runolfur, Kristjansson, Mar, Sulem, Patrick, Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur, Thorgeirsson, Gudmundur, Gudbjartsson, Daniel, Stefansson, Kari","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1539784/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30845,""
"Breathing against suicidal ideation: factors of suicidal attempts in nursing home residents under COVID-19 (preprint)","Background:  Suicide ideation is sweeping through the older population. As COVID-19 forced nursing homes to implement the severest restrictions, nursing home residents are particularly at risk of suicide ideation due to several interrelated factors. Methods: : This qualitative study investigated the protective and risk factors for suicide among nursing home residents as well as their strategies for suicide prevention under the lockdown of COVID-19. A total of ten semi-structured interviews were carried out. Thereafter, we analyzed the interview content following a thematic approach. Results: : The experiences of ten nursing home residents with suicidal ideation were classified into three categories, nine sub-themes and twenty seven theme clusters. The three categories included: (a) protective factors for suicide prevention, (b) risk factors for suicide attempts, and (c) strategies for suicide prevention. These factors and strategies were found to be correlated with their suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Conclusion:  Factors and strategies influencing suicide ideation and attempts among nursing home residents displayed some new issues and problems under COVID-19. These factors will help both nursing home staff and other health-care providers to understand their life of nursing home residents who have suicide ideation and suicide attempts and improve intervention strategies.","Tian, Yinong, Zhang, Dan, Su, Yonggang, Zhang, Shuai","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1486055/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30846,""
"Risk Factors and Resilience Associated to Depressive Symptoms in Mexican Healthcare Workers During the Early Stages of the Covid-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Introduction:  The world has been marked by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has had an impact in everyoneâ€™s lives, but particularly in healthcare workers (HCW), whom have been exposed to higher workload, COVID exposure and stigma, all of which are known risk factors for mental health problems. Objective:  The aim of this study is to report the prevalence of depression, risk factors and resilience related to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic among Mexican HCW. Method:  This is an observational cross-sectional study part of a larger international, prospective multicentric study â€œ The COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrkErs Study â€ (HEROES). A convenience sample with a total of 2,127 HCW from two states of Mexico (Chiapas and Jalisco) were recruited. Depression was the main outcome, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). A COVID-19 risk scale was developed with a total of 19 items. Resilience was studied with the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Model-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated. Results:  We found moderate to severe depression in 16.6% of the study sample. HCW from Jalisco, medical staff, working in hospitals, and those with chronic illness and with a mental health history were more depressed. Regarding the COVID-19 related risk factors, we found more than double the prevalence of depression (2.14, 95%CI=1.64-2.8) for those exposed to =8 of the risk variables here studied. Depression was prevalent in 30% of HCW with low resilience, 13.3% with medium resilience and only 4.4% of those with high resilience. Discussion:  and conclusion COVID-19 related risk factors increase the prevalence of depression in HCW, whereas resilience proved to be a protective factor (higher resilience, less prevalence of depression). This evidence proves the need to develop strategies to reduce the risk (developing measures to enhance trust in the workplace and anti-sigma campaigns) and enhance resilience (fostering wellness and building relationships) in HCW.

"Medical student flourishing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at one US institution (preprint)","Introduction:  Medical education research often focuses on measuring negative mental states like burnout, rather than focusing on positive states like well-being. Flourishing â€“ a state that includes domains of happiness and mental health - is a way of thinking about well-being that may be relevant to education and research. The purpose of this prospective, observational study was to compare the relationship among flourishing, other well-being measures, and burnout in medical students via a survey administered at two time points. Â Â  Methods: : We surveyed medical students at one U.S. institution about their flourishing, satisfaction with work-life balance, quality of life, empathic concern, and burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Flourishing was measured using two scores, the Flourish Index (FI) and Secure Flourish Index (SFI), with higher scores indicating greater flourishing. Pre- and post-scores for both measures were compared. Results: : 107/585 (18%) medical students responded to the survey and 78/107 (73%) participated in the post survey. SFI scores were higher at the second time point (M=7.1, SD=1.2) than the first (M=6.7, SD=1.3, p=.026). FI, satisfaction with work-life balance, quality of life, empathic concern, and burnout were unchanged at the second time point. Discussion:  COVID-19 has disrupted medical students and their education in multiple ways â€“ some of them positive â€“ which may explain the increase in SFI score and the lack of change in FI and other measures, at the post-survey.","Kelly-Hedrick, Margot, Iuliano, Kayla, Tackett, Sean, Chisolm, Margaret","https://doi.org/10.12688/mep.19094.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30848,""
"Impact of Long COVID on health and quality of life (preprint)","Background:  The aim of this study was to measure the impact of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) on quality of life, mental health, ability to work and return to baseline health in an Irish cohort. Methods:  Â We invited individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 lasting more than 14 days to participate in an anonymous online questionnaire. Basic demographic data and self-reported symptoms were recorded. Internationally validated instruments including the patient health questionnaire somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom scales (PHQ-SADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and Chadler fatigue scale (CFQ) were used. Results:  We analysed responses from 988 participants with self-reported confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive;81%) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested;9%) COVID-19.Â The majority of respondents were female (88%), white (98%), with a median age of 43.0 (range 15 â€“ 88 years old) and a median BMI of 26.0 (range 16 â€“ 60). At the time of completing this survey, 89% of respondents reported that they have not returned to their pre-COVID-19 level of health.Â The median number of symptoms reported was 8 (range 0 to 33 symptoms), with a median duration of 12 months (range 1 to 20 months) since time of acute infection. A high proportion of PASC patients reported that they have a moderate or severe limitation in their ability to carry out their usual activities, 38% report their ability to work is severely limited and 33% report a moderate, or higher, level of anxiety or depression. Conclusion:  The results of this survey of an Irish cohort with PASC are in line with reports from other settings, and we confirm that patients with PASC reported prolonged, multi-system symptoms which can significantly impact quality of life, affect ability to work and cause significant disability.

"Assessment of fear, anxiety, obsession and functional impairment due to COVID-19 amongst health-care workers and trainees: A cross-sectional study in Nepal (preprint)","Background:  The emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic threw the world into turmoil. The medical community bore the brunt of the pandemic's toll. Long work hours, and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and social support all had an influence on mental health. Methods: : This cross-sectional study was conducted among Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital students and employees in Palpa, Nepal. Data entailing their demographic details, pre-existing comorbidities, or death in the family due to COVID-19 was collected using a self-administered survey.Â In addition, the level of fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment due to COVID-19 was recorded using previously validated respective scales. Results: : In total, 403 health-care workers and trainees participated in our study. The mean age of the study participants was 23Â±4 years, and more than half of them (n=262, 65%) were females. A significant association was found between fear score with age (p-value=0.04), gender (p-value &lt;0.01) and occupation (p-value&lt;0.001). The participants suffering from chronic diseases (p-value=0.36), were not found to be significantly obsessed with COVID-19. Age (p-value=0.34), was not found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels. Nursing students suffered from a significantly greater functional impairment than other health-care professionals (mean rank score=269.15, p-value &lt; 0.001). A moderately positive correlation was observed between fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment scales. Conclusion:  This study revealed various socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for psychological stress in the people related to the health-care profession of Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Rasch Validation of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) in Community-Dwelling Adults and in Adults with Stroke in the US (preprint)","Background With the recent ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and political divide in the United States (US), there is an urgent need to address the soaring mental well-being problems and to promote positive well-being. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) measures the positive aspects of mental health. Previous studies confirmed its construct validity, reliability, and unidimensionality with confirmatory factor analysis. Four studies have performed a Rasch analysis on the WEMWBS, but none of them tested adults in the US. The goals of our study are to use Rasch analysis to validate the WEMWBS in the general US population and in adults with stroke. Methods We recruited community-dwelling adults and adults with chronic stroke with upper limb hemiplegia or hemiparesis. We used the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model (RUMM) 2030 software to evaluate item and person fit, targeting, person separation reliability (PSR), and differential item functioning (DIF) for sample sizes of at least 200 persons in each subgroup. Results After deleting two items, the WEMBS analyzed in our 553 community-dwelling adults (average age 51.22Â±17.18 years;358 women) showed an excellent PSR=0.91 as well as person and item fit, but the items are too easy for this population (person mean location=2.17Â±2.00). There was no DIF for sex, mental health, or practicing breathing exercises. In the 37 adults with chronic stroke (average age 58Â±13;11 women) the WEMWBS had a good item and person fit, and PSR=0.92, but the items were too easy for this group as well (person mean location=3.13Â±2.00). Conclusions The WEMWBS had good item and person fit but the targeting is off when used in community-dwelling adults and adults with stroke in the US. Adding more difficult items might improve the targeting and capture a broader range of positive mental wellbeing in both populations. Our pilot data in adults with stroke needs to be confirmed in a larger sample size.","Deng, Wei, Carpentier, Sydney, Blackwood, Jena, Van de Winckel, Ann","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.18.22274001","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30851,""
"Methadone overdoses increased 48% during the COVID-19 epidemic (preprint)","Background The United States (US) is in the middle of an opioid overdose epidemic that has spanned over two decades and continues to escalate. Methadone is long-acting full opioid agonist which has been approved to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). Methadone can cause respiratory depression that may result in mortality. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic. Methods The Center for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database, which draws data from death certificates, was used to find the unintentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999-2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10 th revision codes: X40-44 with only data which was coded for methadone (T40.3). Data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, narcotic treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states, including the District of Columbia, for 2020 and corrected for population. Results There have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in overdoses involving methadone. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 ( t (50) = 3.05, p &lt; .005). The correlations between overall methadone use ( r (49) = +0.75, p &lt; 0.001), and narcotic treatment program use ( r (49) = +0.77, p &lt; 0.001) were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with overdoses ( r (49) = -.08, p = .57). Conclusions Overdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. This mortality increase is much larger than the 5.3% elevation in calls involving methadone reported to poison control centers in the year following the March 16, 2020 loosening of methadone take-home regulations. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone may warrant reconsideration.","Kaufman, Daniel, Kennalley, Amy, McCall, Kenneth, Piper, Brian","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.14.22273870","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30852,""

Increased job losses, jump in divorce rate, and the generic nature of staying home has also led to various mental health issues. Methods We analyzed two publicly available datasets to better understand vaccine hesitancy. The first dataset was extracted from ICPSR Covid-19 database ( https://doi.org/10.3886/E130422V1 ).[1].This cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in the US, India, and China. The second dataset was obtained from the United States Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey (HPS) Phase 3.2. For the ICPSR dataset, proportions and summary statistics are reported to give an overview of the global picture of vaccine hesitancy. The HPS dataset was analyzed using multinomial and binary logistic regression. Chi-square test of independence and exploratory data analysis supplemented provided insight into the casual factors involved in vaccine hesitancy. Results ICPSR Global Data For India, 1761 participants completed the survey as of November, 2020 of which 90.2% indicated acceptance of a Covid-19 vaccine. 66.4% are parents of 18 years old or younger, and 79.0% respondent has a parent 50 years or older. Vaccine acceptance rate was 99.8% among 928 out of 1761 participants who had a child. 1392 participants either had a parent or child of which 83.4% will encourage their parents and 90.5% will encourage their children to get the covid-19 vaccine. In this Indian survey, 16.2% identified as belonging to the rural population of which 51.2% showed vaccine hesitancy. A binary logistic regression model with vaccine hesitancy as a dichotomous variable showed that rural population had an odds ratio (OR) of 3.45 (p-value&lt;0.05). Income seems to influence vaccine hesitancy, with income level of (7501-15,000 Indian Rupees (INR)/month) having an OR of 1.41 as compared to other income groups. In the US, 1768 individuals participated in the survey from August-November 2020. 67.3% respondents indicated the will to accept the vaccine. 1129 of them either had a parent or a child, of which 67.6% will take the vaccine;66% will encourage their parents and 83% will encourage their children for taking the vaccination. 40.3% responded as vaccine hesitant, 31% identified as staying in rural areas, of which 52.5% are vaccine hesitant. In the binary logistic regression analysis, race, past flu shot history, rural living, income turned out to be significant. White race had OR &gt;1 as compared to other races, low-income group (US dollar $2000-4999/month) had an OR of 1.03. In China, there were 1727 participants, of which 1551(90.0%) indicated that they will accept a vaccine. 90.1% of them who had either a parent or child will accept vaccine, 80.4% will influence parents, and 83.4% will encourage children to get vaccination needle in the arm. 30% had vaccine hesitancy. 262 belonged to the rural population, of which 34.8% are vaccine hesitant. Income and Northern region (OR = 3.17) were significant in saying â€œyesâ€ to a vaccine. High income groups were least resistant (OR=0.96) as compared to other groups. HPS USA data Data used in this study was collected from United States Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey (HPS) Phase 3.2 Weeks 34-39, which covers data collected from July 21, 2021, to October 11, 2021. The HPS data helped to understand the effect of several demographic and psychological, and health-related factors upon which responses were provided, thus helping to understand the social and economic effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Among the three countries, it appears based on this survey that US has the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy. may contribu e towards this result gender, education, religious beliefs, disbelief in science, government which remains unexplored due to data limitation.","Bhattacharyya, Arinjita, Singh, Shikshita, Sakshi, Swarna, Seth, Anand, Rai, Shesh","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.13.22273843","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30853,""
"Steeling for the Next Pandemic Through Fiscal Responsibility: The Bank of Namibia as Fiscal Council (preprint)","In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics, this chapter mounts a fiscal responsibility framework to enable developing countries, Namibia in particular, to strike the delicate balance between easing short-term liquidity crises and preserving their countryâ€™s long-term development. The COVID-19 pandemic has created manifold pandemonium, affecting the economy, the healthcare system, and state finances. Inexorably, most governments will have to borrow money if they genuinely wish to pull through COVID-19, the worldâ€™s worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Disasters such as the latest coronavirus cause government spending to shoot up as the authorities need to spend huge sums to engage in relief activities, recover losses suffered or repair damage caused, and shore up the economy. Crucially, however, these disasters tend to push up public debt to unsustainable levels. While economists and economically-oriented lawyers spoke about this thorny dilemma, the legal literature has remained silent as to how developing countries could use or tweak their budget system laws to tackle this singular and multi-faceted crisis. The time is therefore opportune to ponder on budget system laws in developing countries and reflect on how governments can adapt to suit the unique and uncertain circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing Great Lockdown. This holds especially true given the evidence that this pandemic may be one only of several pandemics to come. By relying on international best practices in budget system laws, the chapter outlines and assesses the framework for a fiscal responsibility law (FRL) that a developing country such as Namibia could pass to safeguard debt sustainability. I advance the thesis that Namibiaâ€™s legal system can most effectively balance the liquidity-strategy dilemma by enabling the Bank of Namibia (BON), the central bank, to act as a fiscal council. BON stands in a better position than other national bodies to function like a fiscal council because BON enjoys a legally-protected independence, in a country with a sterling reputation for its strict adherence to the law;and because it has greater expertise and more resources in matters pertaining to the macroeconomy and system-wide risks. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) appears to have carved out a fiscal council role for central banks in the region. In 2009 SADC adopted a model law that Namibia utilised to enact a new law in 2020 which makes it possible for the central bank to act as a fiscal council. In that capacity, the Bank of Namibia can guide the government in fixing the appropriate level of public debt that Namibia can take on. This level strikes a balance between the two poles of the dilemma mentioned above â€“ a dilemma that pits short-term emergency against long-term strategy.","Zongwe, Dunia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Steeling+for+the+Next+Pandemic+Through+Fiscal+Responsibility:+The+Bank+of+Namibia+as+Fiscal+Council+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30854,""
"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical Activity among Sri Lankan Population: A Cross-Sectional Study (preprint)","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the general population is massive, and one of the effective strategies to reduce the spread is to maintain social distancing. Further, it was facilitated by imposing a nationwide curfew during May 2020. The routine lifestyle of the Sri Lankan population has been affected due to a nationwide curfew. Therefore, the study was conducted to assess the changes in physical activity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Sri Lankan population. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was carried out among the Sri Lankan population during the nationwide curfew in May 2020. Even though the calculated sample size was 384 (Cochraneâ€˜s formula), 562 data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic data (10 questions) and questions addressing the frequency of physical activities carried out before and during the curfew period (16 questions) during the three weeks, that the questionnaire was open to the public. The sample was achieved through snowball sampling technique with ethical approval of KIU (KIU/ERC/20/47). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS version 25. The mean age of the sample was 24.83 Â± 5.74 years, and the majority (49.8%) were graduates, while 17.3% of the sample represented the Colombo district. In assessing the physical activity, it was categorized as moderate and vigorous. The majority of the sample (89%) had followed moderate physical activity before the curfew;however, this has been reduced to 1.8% during the curfew. At the same time, 29.7% of the sample followed moderate physical activity between 30-60 minutes per day before the curfew, where only 34.5% of them followed physical activity for more than 60 minutes during the curfew. Under the vigorous-intense physical activities, 49.6% followed no activity before the curfew;however, this has increased to 55% during the curfew (p=0.001). In conclusion, even though the majority had followed a moderate level of physical activity during curfew, it shows a significant increase (p=0.001) of following vigorous-intense physical activities compared to before the curfew. Since regular physical activities act as a protective factor for many non-communicable diseases and mental health, there is a necessity to raise awareness of the recommended thresholds of physical activity to improve quality of life.","Wijkeumar, P.

"Basel I & Basel II Have Aggravated the Man-Made Dollar Virus (preprint)","Metaphorically speaking, prior to the man-created dollar virus leaked from the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference (i.e. the virology lab), financial crises were termed as a panic and the Panic of 1907 was the last financial crisis termed this way. The roaring 1920s (equity and housing bubbles in the U.S.), the Fedâ€™s unwarranted tight-money policy error to curtail speculative activities on Wall Street and to avoid a potential stock market crash (1929), and a severe economic recession with massive bank failures at the onset of the 1930s resulted in catchy economic jargons to be coined such as the Great Crash of 1929 and Great Depression of the 1930s. At the backdrop of no large-scale conflicts, the Cold War era (i.e. bipolarity and two superpowers) gave the dollar virus a rare opportunity to gain strength during the halcyon periods of economic growth (1950s and 1960s), but the Nixon shock (President Nixonâ€™s decision to cut dollarâ€™s link or convertibility to gold) caused the dollar virus to mutate into a more dangerous variant, the upshot of which was an epidemic (i.e. Latin American debt crisis) as the dollar virus began to infect major economies in Latin America through commercial banksâ€™ short-term lending of the dollar glut from rich oil-producing countries to Latin American states. Risk insensitive rules of Basel I banking standard (released to banks in July 1988) aggravated the dollar virus and forced it to mutate into a more severe variant in the late 1990s which caused another epidemic in the East Asia and Pacific (Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), but this time was different than the antecedent, the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 in systemic nature (President Clinton called it a â€œglitchâ€) made investors lose $700 billion ($30 billion by Americans). The criticism and mounting pressure prompted the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the standard setter) to overhaul Basel I;contrary to the hyped optimism and promises, Basel II (Revised Framework) has made developing and emerging economies more crisis-prone. Thanks to the selfish â€œAmerica Firstâ€ policy, weaponization of the dollar, and abuse of the sanction power, now the dollar virus has reached a pandemic status with the objective of enslaving the humankind and bringing on the Armageddon. Although COVID-19 pandemic (Great Health Crisis â€“ GHC) has killed over 6 million people worldwide, if not contained by designing of a new monetary order (no hegemony of one nation and one currency), the dollar virus as a weapon of vast economic destruction will take more lives, maybe by billions.","Taskinsoy, John","https://www.google.com/search?q=Basel+I+&+Basel+II+Have+Aggravated+the+Man-Made+Dollar+Virus+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30856,""

"Rethinking Business Model for Drug Discovery, Post-COVID (preprint)","The COVID pandemic underscores the need for fair access to health. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer business model for drug discovery, which democratizes the drug discovery process and reduce drug prices by cutting the intermediaries that stand between biomedical researchers and future patients. Employing a signalling game-theoretic mechanism, our analysis not only elucidates how the stakeholders strategically interact in this market using deception, adverse selection, and moral hazards, but also how to tame their interactions to improve the overall performance. In particular, we suggest and rigorously evaluate an embodiment built on a scalable implementation of non-fungible token (NFT).

"Union Pacific Corporation (preprint)","The Union Pacific Corporation (UPC) was the largest public railroad transportation company in the United States. Established in 1962 with the help of Abraham Lincoln, it expanded to connect the North American continent from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Seattle, Washington, and from Long Beach, California, to Duluth, Minnesota. UPC's growth opportunities had become limited over the previous 50 years, and management had focused on efficiency, cost cutting, and generating cash flows that the company channeled back to shareholders though dividends and share repurchases.But the freight recession of 2019 followed by the decline in shipping volumes caused by 2020's COVID-19 pandemic had not been gentle to the freight industry overall, and UPC was no exception.

"Putting health workers at the centre of health system investments in COVID-19 and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the implications of chronic underinvestment in health workforce development, particularly in resource-constrained health systems. Inadequate health workforce diversity, insufficient training and remuneration, and limited support and protection reduce health system capacity to equitably maintain health service delivery while meeting urgent health emergency demands. Applying the Health Worker Life Cycle Approach provides a useful conceptual framework that adapts a health labour market approach to outline key areas and recommendations for health workforce investment-building, managing and optimising-to systematically meet the needs of health workers and the systems they support. It also emphasises the importance of protecting the workforce as a cross-cutting investment, which is especially important in a health crisis like COVID-19. While the global pandemic has spurred intermittent health workforce investments required to immediately respond to COVID-19, applying this 'lifecycle approach' to guide policy implementation and financing interventions is critical to centering health workers as stewards of health systems, thus strengthening resilience to public health threats, sustainably responding to community needs and providing more equitable, patient-centred care.","Deussom, Lal, Frymus, Cole, Politico, SaldaÃƒÂ±a, Vasireddy, Khangamwa, Jaskiewicz","https://doi.org/10.1136/fmch-2021-001449","20220502","COVID-19; health planning; health policy; health workforce; patient-centered care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30860,""
"Alcohol Use, Sleep, and Depression Among Family Caregivers in the Time of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially altered daily life around the world, resulting in significant impacts on health behaviors. The additional burdens imposed by family caregiving (i.e., providing unpaid care for children and/or adults) may further exacerbate negative effects of the pandemic on health and health behaviors, including increased alcohol consumption, poor sleep, and increased depressive symptoms. The current study examined this possibility. Participants (N = 320, mean age = 35.11 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing alcohol use, sleep, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (June-August 2020) and retrospectively assessed the same health behaviors in the months prior to the pandemic. Insomnia severity increased, sleep quality decreased, and depressive symptoms increased for both caregivers and non-caregivers during the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). By contrast, alcohol consumption increased among caregivers only (p &lt; 0.05). Further, increased alcohol use was associated with decreased sleep quality and increased insomnia symptoms among caregivers, but not non-caregivers. While additional longitudinal research is warranted in this population, our findings offer important insight on self-reported changes in alcohol consumption, sleep patterns, and mood among family caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Strzelecki, Moloney, Brooks, Weafer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2022.04.002","20220502","COVID-19; alcohol use; depression; family caregiving; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30861,""
"Association between family financial decline due to COVID-19 and generalized anxiety disorder among Korean adolescents","COVID-19 has had a worldwide economic impact. A decline in family financial level can adversely affect adolescents' mental health. This study examined the association between perceived family financial decline due to COVID-19 and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) among South Korean adolescents. Data from 54,948 middle and high school students from the 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey were collected in this cross-sectional study. The effect of the perceived family financial decline due to COVID-19 related to GAD was analyzed using binary and multinomial logistic regression. The relationship between perceived family financial decline due to COVID-19 and GAD was linear with increasing odds ratios and confidence intervals (the possibility of GAD, no financial decline: OR 1.00, mild: OR 1.11, CI 1.05-1.17, moderate: OR 1.30, CI 1.22-1.39, severe: OR 1.48, CI 1.34-1.63). Girls, low-income class, and living with family were vulnerable to GAD. GAD levels of mild, moderate, and severe were most likely to occur in each case of mild, moderate, and severe financial decline, respectively. As this is a cross-sectional study, causality is unknown. Because this study data was self-reported by adolescents, they may have been overestimated or underestimated. GAD in adolescents is closely related to perceived decreased family finances due to COVID-19. The dose-response of GAD according to financial decline became gradually severe. Anxious adolescents were afraid of uncertain and adverse outcomes affecting them or their families. Therefore, there is a vital need to care for financially affected adolescents.","Jung, Jang, Park, Park","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.154","20220502","Adolescent; Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Financial challenges; Income; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30862,""

We examine changes from just before to during the pandemic in indicators of health and well-being and comprehensive profiles of health and well-being, along with links between covariates and profiles during the pandemic. 1,004 students participated in a longitudinal study that began in November 2019. Latent class analysis identified health and well-being profiles at both waves; covariates were included in relation to class membership. Mental health problems increased, whereas substance use, sexual behavior, physical inactivity, and food insecurity decreased. Six well-being classes were identified at each wave. Baseline class membership, sociodemographic characteristics, living situation, ethnicity, coping strategies, and belongingness were associated with profile membership at follow-up.

"Implementation and Evaluation of COVIDCare@Home, a Family Medicine Led Remote Monitoring Program for COVID-19 Patients: a multi-method cross-sectional study","COVIDCare@Home (CC@H) is a multi-faceted, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program led by family medicine for diagnosed COVID-19 patients, based at Women's College Hospital, an ambulatory academic centre in Toronto, Canada. CC@H offers virtual visits (phone and video) to address the clinical needs and broader social determinants of health of patients during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, including finding a primary care provider and support for food insecurity. The objective of this evaluation is to understand the implementation and quality outcomes of CC@H within the Quadruple Aim framework of patient experience, provider experience, cost, and population health. This multi-method cross-sectional evaluation follows the Quadruple Aim to focus on implementation and service quality outcomes including feasibility, adoption, safety, effectiveness, equity, and patient-centeredness. These measures were explored using clinical and service utilization data, patient-experience data (an online survey and a post-discharge questionnaire), provider-experience data (surveys, interviews and focus groups) and stakeholder interviews. Descriptive analysis was conducted for surveys and utilization data. Deductive analysis was conducted for interviews and focus groups, mapping to implementation and quality domains. The Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg) measured the proportion of underserved patients accessing CC@H. 3412 visits were conducted in the first 8 months (Apr 8-Dec 8, 2020) for 616 discrete patients, including 2114 visits with family physician staff/residents, and 149 visits with social worker/mental health professionals. There was a median of 5 (IQR=4) visits per patient, with a median follow-up of 7 days (IQR=27). The Net Promoter Score was 77. 23.3% of patients were in the most marginalized populations based on residential postal code (as per the ON-Marg index). Interviews with providers and stakeholder indicated that the program continues to adapt to meet the needs of patients and the healthcare system. Future remote monitoring should integrate support for addressing the social determinants of health and ensure patient-centred care through comprehensive care teams.","Laur, Agarwal, Thai, Kishimoto, Kelly, Liang, Bhatia, Bhattacharyya, Martin, Mukerji","https://doi.org/10.2196/35091","20220502","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30864,""
"Therapeutic Alliance in Online and Face-to-face Psychological Treatment: Comparative Study","Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of online mental health treatments have grown exponentially. Additionally, it seems inevitable that this technical resource is here to stay at health centers. However, there is still very little scholarly literature published on this topic, and therefore, the impact of the changes that have had to be dealt with in this regard has not been studied. This study aims to evaluate the differences in the establishment of the therapeutic alliance (TA) based on the intervention modality (online or face-to-face), the type of attachment, and diagnosis. A total of 291 subjects participated in the study, 149 (51.2%) of whom were men and 142 were (48.8%) women between the ages of 18 and 30 years. The instruments used were sociodemographic data, SOFTA-o (System for Observing Family Therapeutic Alliances-observational), and Relationship Questionnaire. The results show that the treatments conducted face-to-face obtain significantly better scores in the creation of the TA than those conducted online (t=-42.045, df=289, P&lt;.001). The same holds true with attachment, in that users with secure attachment show a better TA than those with insecure attachment (t=6.068, P&lt;.001,), although there were no significant differences with the diagnosis (F=4.566, P=.44), age (r=0.02, P=.70), and sex (t=0.217, P=.33). We believe that professionals are not yet prepared to conduct remote treatment with a degree of efficacy similar to that of face-to-face. It is essential for professionals to receive training in this new technical resource and to understand and incorporate the variants it entails into their daily practice.","Mercadal Rotger, CabrÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.2196/36775","20220502","digital health; health interventions; health professional; intervention modality; mental health; mental health education; mental health treatment; online health; online psychological intervention; therapeutic alliance; web-based health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30865,""
"Emotional consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents: challenges to public health","To describe adolescents' everyday activities and emotional consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative study grounded in Alfred SchÃƒÂ¼tz's social phenomenology, involving 22 students at two public schools in a municipality in the state of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil. Interviews were conducted, had their audio recorded, and were analyzed according to a thematic categorization. Five categories emerged from the accounts: i) adolescents' reaction before the COVID-19 pandemic; ii) emotional consequences; iii) concern about the family; iv) adolescents' adaptation; and v) fragmentation of social support networks. Feelings such as uncertainty, fear, anguish, anxiety, and lack of motivation, depressive symptoms, and extreme suicidal ideation were reported. Paying attention to adolescents' psychosocial needs is essential, especially in face of the possibility of post-traumatic stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"A qualitative study of patient experiences with telemedicine opioid use disorder treatment during COVID-19","<i>Background:</i> The drug-related overdose crisis worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent drug policy changes to increase access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during COVID-19 shifted some outpatient MOUD treatment into virtual settings to reduce the demand for in-person care. The objective of this study was to qualitatively explore what is gained and lost in virtual patient encounters for patients with opioid use disorder at a low-threshold, addiction treatment clinic that offers buprenorphine and harm reduction services. <i>Methods:</i> Patients were included in this study if they received care at the Harm Reduction and BRidges to Care (HRBR) clinic and utilized virtual visits between November 2019 and March 2021. The study was conceptualized using a health care access framework and prior studies of telemedicine acceptability. Semi-structured interviews were completed between March and April 2021. Interviews were dual-coded and analyzed using directed content analysis. <i>Results:</i> Nineteen interviews were conducted. The sample was predominantly White (84%) and stably housed (79%) with comparable gender (male, 53%) and employment status (employed, 42%). The majority (63%) of patients preferred virtual visits compared to in-person visits (16%) or a combination of access to both (21%). Two overarching tandem domains emerged: availability-accommodation and acceptability-appropriateness. Availability-accommodation reflected participants' desires for immediate services and reduced transportation and work or caregiving scheduling barriers, which was facilitated by virtual visits. The acceptable-appropriate domain articulated how participants felt connected to their providers, whether through in-person interactions or the mutual trust experienced during virtual visits. <i>Conclusions:</i> Virtual visits were perceived by participants as a valuable and critical option for accessing treatment for OUD. While many participants preferred virtual visits, some favored face-to-face visits due to relational and physical interactions with providers. Participants desired flexibility and the ability to have a choice of treatment modality depending on their needs.","Lockard, Priest, Gregg, Buchheit","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2022.2060447","20220502","COVID-19; Telemedicine; buprenorphine; opioid use disorder; qualitative research; substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30867,""
"Tele-Balint under the microscope: What really happens in Tele-Balint groups?","Balint groups provide a safe space for clinicians to discuss difficult cases, with the aim of deepening the clinician-patient relationship and providing space for self-introspection and personal development. During this COVID-19 period, mental health clinicians need a platform to undergo professional supervision and peer learning sessions, which can be provided for by Tele-Balint sessions. This study aims to understand the workings of Balint groups in a multi-disciplinary team, through exploring the experience and perceptions of mental health clinicians in a tertiary obstetrics- and paediatrics-focused hospital in Singapore towards Tele-Balint groups, and examining if these groups can address their professional needs. A mixed-methods study was conducted. 26 mental health clinicians who had participated in Tele-Balint groups since March 2020 completed a semi-structured questionnaire, and 12 of them were interviewed. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts was performed. Qualitative analysis revealed 5 themes. The first 4: professional and personal growth of clinicians, providing emotional support to clinicians, burnout in clinicians: what contributes and what helps, and psychological safety, address whether Tele-Balint groups meet clinicians' needs. The last theme, evolution of nature of Balint groups, addresses whether Tele-Balint groups meet clinicians' needs during the time of a pandemic. Tele-Balint group participation was found to be beneficial in facilitating personal and professional growth, providing emotional support and preventing burnout, despite some limitations. Members should maintain flexibility towards the Balint process, in order to accommodate others who have differing needs, especially in a multi-disciplinary group.","Pan, Yong, Chua, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174221092505","20220502","Balint group; clinician-patient relationship; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30868,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Women","The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, type of delivery, and neonatal feeding of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestation. The study was conducted online, and anonymous survey was distributed to mothers that delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was completed by 286 women, and 64 women (22.4%) had COVID-19 during pregnancy. Women that had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy or at time of delivery had a significantly higher probability of being separated from the newborn (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and a significantly lower probability of breastfeeding (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale, to assess if mothers had symptoms of postnatal depression, showed that items suggestive of postnatal depression were relatively frequent in the whole cohort. However, women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy reported higher probability of responses suggestive of postnatal depression in eight out of 10 items, with statistically significant differences in three items. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the type of delivery and breastfeeding of pregnant women, particularly when they had SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, had an impact on the psychological status of the interviewed mothers, aspects that could benefit of special support.","Buonsenso, Malorni, Turriziani Colonna, Morini, Sbarbati, Solipaca, Di Mauro, Carducci, Lanzone, Moscato, Costa, Vento, Valentini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.790518","20220502","COVID-19; breastfeeding; newborns; pregnant women; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30869,""
"Mental Health in German Paralympic Athletes During the 1st Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic Compared to a General Population Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has huge influences on daily life and is not only associated with physical but also with major psychological impacts. Mental health problems and disorders are frequently present in elite paralympic athletes. Due to the pandemic situation, new stressors (e.g., loss of routine, financial insecurity) might act upon the athletes. Therefore, the assessment of mental health in athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic is important to identify prevalence of psychological problems and propose countermeasures. The mental health of German paralympic athletes was longitudinally monitored (starting in May 2019). The athletes completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4) on a weekly basis and reported a stress level, training hours, and training load. During the pandemic, 8 measurement time points (March 2020 to April 2021) were used to reflect the psychological health course of the athletes. In parallel, a convenience sample of the general population was questioned about their psychological distress, including the PHQ-4. To be included in the analysis, participants of both groups had to complete at least 4 measurement time points. Matching of the para-athletes and the general population sample was prioritized upon completion of the same measurement time points, gender, and age. Seventy-eight paralympic athletes (40 women, 38 men, age: 29.8 Ã‚Â± 11.4 years) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-eight matched pairs of the general population (40 women; 38 men; age: 30.5 Ã‚Â± 10.9 years) were identified. The para-athletes had a significantly (<i>p</i> &lt;0.0001; 0.39 &lt; <i>r</i> &lt;0.48) lower PHQ-4 value at each measurement time point compared to the matched control group. No significant age or sex differences were evident regarding the symptom burden. In para-athletes, no significant and a weak positive correlation was found between decreased training load and PHQ-4 values and a stress level, respectively. Reduced physical activity was significantly (<i>p</i> &lt;0.0001) associated with higher PHQ-4 values in the general population sample. Lower PHQ-4 values were reported by the para-athletes compared to the general population sample. However, small sample sizes must be considered while interpreting the data. Nevertheless, adequate support for individuals suffering from severe psychopathological symptoms should be provided for para-athletes as well as for the general population.","Busch, Kubosch, Bendau, Leonhart, Meidl, Bretthauer, Petzold, Dallmann, Wrobel, Plag, StrÃƒÂ¶hle, HirschmÃƒÂ¼ller","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.870692","20220502","PHQ-4; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; elite athlete; paralympic sport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30870,""
"Social Engagement and Mental Health Symptoms Across Asian American Ethnic Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine social engagement and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic across Asian American (AA) ethnic groups. Data from three waves of the nationally representative COVID-19 Household Impact Survey (4/20/2020-6/8/2020) were used to describe social engagement and mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Associations between mental health and social engagement were assessed via multinomial logistic regression. In this sample of 312 AAs (36.9% Chinese American, 30.9% South Asian American, 20.1% Filipino/Vietnamese American, and 12.0% Japanese/Korean American), daily communication with neighbors declined for Chinese, South Asian and Filipino/Vietnamese Americans but increased for Japanese/Korean Americans (P=.012) whereas communication with friends/family increased only for Filipino/Vietnamese, Japanese/Korean and South Asian Americans (P&lt;0.001). Differences in self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and hopelessness were observed across AA ethnic groups. In adjusted models, lower social engagement was associated with frequent (3-4 days/week) depressive symptoms during the preceding week (cOR:3.26, 95%CI:1.01-10.5). This association was heightened for Asian men (cOR:14.22, 95%CI:3.62-55.8). Heterogeneity of social engagement and mental health symptoms across AA ethnicities was observed. Understanding associations between social engagement and mental health within different communities is necessary to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health treatment and care.","Islam, Awan, Kapadia","https://doi.org/10.18865/ed.32.2.131","20220502","Anxiety; Asian Americans; COVID-19; Depression; Disaggregated; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30871,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Psychiatric Symptoms Among Older People in England During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Latent Class Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health and social connections. Older people may be disproportionately affected, placing them at increased risk for complex mental ill-health outcomes and quality of life undermined by anxiety and depression. Understanding gender differences in the determinants of anxiety and depression symptoms is crucial to policy and practice. This study aims to examine gender-specific symptom subtypes (and subthreshold symptoms) in an older English population sampled during the COVID period, in relation to their socio-demographic, social, and health circumstances. The sample comprises all individuals aged 50Ã‚Â years or older and included in the <i>English Longitudinal Study of Ageing</i> COVID-19 sub-study conducted during June-July 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) defined indicative sample subgroups of clinically relevant anxiety and depression. Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between socio-demographic characteristics, health and social care indicators, loneliness, and pre-pandemic mental ill-health. LCA derived three classes of self-reported depression and anxiety: for females (1) comorbid depression and anxiety (19.9% of the sample), (2) depression and subthreshold anxiety (31.6%), and (3) no or low symptoms of depression and anxiety (48.5%), and for males (1) comorbid depression and anxiety (12.8%), (2) subthreshold anxiety and depression (29.6%), and (3) no or low depression and anxiety (57.6%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses indicate that compared to those with low/no mental health symptoms, severity of pandemic-era mental ill-health was positively associated with pre-pandemic mental health levels, worry over finances, having access to essentials, loneliness, and access to health and social care services. Findings support the persistence of comorbidity of both depression and anxiety in the pandemic period. Results may inform government health strategy on interventions to prevent social isolation and mitigate the effects of the pandemic on deteriorating mental health in older people who may be more susceptible.","Curran, Rosato, Ferry, Leavey","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00820-2","20220502","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30872,""
"A Cross-sectional Study of the Mental Health Symptoms of Latin American, US Hispanic, and Spanish College Students Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Young adults and racial/ethnic minorities report the worst mental health outcomes during the COVID19 pandemic, according to the Center for Disease Control (2020). The objectives of this study were (1) to identify common mental health symptoms among Latin American, US Hispanic, and Spanish college students, and (2) to identify clinical features predictive of higher post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among this population. The study sample included 1,113 college students from the USA, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, and Spain who completed an online survey containing demographic questions and mental health screeners. Findings revealed higher scores of depression, suicidality, and PTSS compared to pre-pandemic levels and current scores by non-Spanish speaking college students; however, less than 5% of participants endorsed clinical levels of anxiety. After controlling for demographic profiles and sociocultural values, clinical symptoms of depression, loneliness, perceived stress, anxiety, and coping strategies explained 62% of the PTSS variance. Age, history of mental illness, perceived social support, and familism were not significant predictors. This sample of college students revealed higher mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The high prevalence of PTSS highlights the need to develop pragmatic, cost-effective, and culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate these symptoms.

"An analysis of changes in wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","We investigated the trajectory of wellbeing over the course of the first wave and sought to determine whether the change in wellbeing is distributed equally across the population. Specifically we investigated pre-existing medical conditions, social isolation, financial stress and deprivation as a predictor for wellbeing and whether there were community level characteristics which protect against poorer wellbeing. Using online survey responses from the COVID-19 modules of Understanding society, we linked 8379 English cases across five waves of data collection to location based deprivation statistics. We used ordinary least squares regression to estimate the association between deprivation, pre-existing conditions and socio-demographic factors and the change in well-being scores over time, as measured by the GHQ-12 questionnaire. A decline in wellbeing was observed at the beginning of the first lock down period at the beginning of March 2020. This was matched with a corresponding recovery between April and July as restrictions were gradually lifted. There was no association between the decline and deprivation, nor between deprivation and recovery. The strongest predictor of wellbeing during the lock down, was the baseline score, with the counterintuitive finding that for those will pre-existing poor wellbeing, the impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health were minimal, but for those who had previously felt well, the restrictions and the impact of the pandemic on well-being were much greater. These data show no evidence of a social gradient in well-being related to the pandemic. In fact, well-being was shown to be highly elastic in this period indicating a national level of resilience which cut across the usually observed health inequalities.","Murphy, Elliot","https://doi.org/10.1007/s44155-022-00009-x","20220502","COVID-19; Resilience; Social gradient; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30874,""

"Phubbing among Lebanese young adults: Scale validation and association with mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress)","Mobile phones use has not been without several social and psychological problems, specifically during the fast spread of the COVID-19 infection, which imposed strict restrictions and isolation. This research principal aims were to (1) confirm the validity of the Generic Scale of Phubbing in Arabic (GSP), and (2) evaluate the association between phubbing and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). A first cross-sectional study enrolled 203 participants to confirm the factor structure of the phubbing scale among Lebanese young adults. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out on the whole sample using SPSS AMOS v.24 to confirm the four-factor structure of the GSP. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. RMSEA values Ã¢â€°Â¤0.08 andÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.10 indicate a good and acceptable fit respectively. CFI and TLI values Ã¢â€°Â¥0.90 indicate good model fit. A second cross-sectional study enrolled 461 respondents (18-29Ã‚Â years old) to conduct the multivariable analysis. The fit indices values were as follows: Ãâ€¡2/dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°181.74/84Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.16, TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.92, CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.94 and RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.076 [95% CI .061-.091] respectively, indicating an excellent fit of the model.

"The role of emotion regulation and intolerance to uncertainty on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and distress","The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing negative consequences on mental health around the globe. To date, research on what psychological factors could influence individuals' distress is still scarce. The current study aims to test a multiple mediation model to examine the role of Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) and emotional regulation (i.e., expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal) as joint factors, which can increase understanding of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 outbreak. An online survey measuring fear of COVID-19, IU, emotional regulation, and psychologicalÃ‚Â distress was administered to 3863 Italian adults (females 73.3%; <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36.44; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.74) during lockdown. Results showed that IU partially mediated the effect of fear of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress. Moreover, individuals with difficulties in managing the uncertainties due to their fear of COVID-19 may be at risk for heightened use of expressive suppression and depression. However, individuals with both higher IU and expressive suppression showed lower level of stress. High cognitive reappraisal has a mediational effect on the relationship between fear of COVID-19, IU, and lowerÃ‚Â psychological distress. Findings suggest that IU and emotional regulation should be targeted for informing the development of tailored treatments to reduce the negative consequences of the outbreak.

"Mental Health Problems Among Front-Line Healthcare Workers Caring for COVID-19 Patients in Vietnam: A Mixed Methods Study","Healthcare workers have directly provided care for COVID-19 patients, and have faced many additional sources leading to poor mental health. The study aimed to investigate the mental health problems and related factors among healthcare staff in Vietnam. A descriptive cross-sectional mixed methods study, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods, was performed among 400 healthcare workers working at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Ninh Binh General Hospital from the first day of treatment for COVID-19 patients to May 01, 2020. The results showed that 8.0% of participants had stress, 17.5% of participants had anxiety, and 14.8% of participants had depression. Approximately 50% of participants reported that they had at least one of these symptoms. The findings illustrated that stress, anxiety, and depression were associated with the position in a hospital, health status during the COVID-19 pandemic, family members/relatives infected with COVID-19, physical and mental support from friends, family, and community, department, years of working, and the average work hours per day of healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers who worked in the hospital providing treatment and care for COVID-19 patients dealt with mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, and depression.

"Worker Stress, Burnout, and Wellbeing Before and During the COVID-19 Restrictions in the United Kingdom","COVID-19 created a transformational shift in the working environment for much of the labour force, yet its impact on workers is unclear. This study uses longitudinal data to examine the wellbeing of 621 full-time workers assessed before (November 2019-February 2020) and during (May-June 2020) the first lockdown in the United Kingdom. We employ fixed effects analyses to investigate the impact of the restrictions and mandatory homeworking on cognitive, emotional, and psychological wellbeing. Within the sample, the rate of full-time homeworking increased from 2 to 74% between waves. We identify significant changes in 9 of the 15 measures assessed, with a general pattern of improvements in wellbeing during lockdown. Overall levels of stress, self-rated mental health, positive emotions and life and job satisfaction are not adversely affected by the restrictions. There is a reduction in the burnout symptoms of disengagement (-0.13 sd) and exhaustion (-0.20 sd) and in the frequency with which negative emotions are experienced at work (-0.15 sd). Workers feel more autonomous (+0.09 sd), closer to their co-workers (+0.10 sd), and more attached to their organisations (+0.19 sd). However, homelife satisfaction declines (-0.11 sd). These findings highlight the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic and large-scale transition to homeworking was associated with unchanged or improved worker wellbeing. This study has important implications for governments and employers regarding a global shift to homeworking.","Pelly, Daly, Delaney, Doyle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.823080","20220502","COVID-19 restrictions; burnout; homeworking; lockdown; mental health; stress; subjective wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30882,""
"Influencing Factors of International Students' Anxiety Under Online Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study of 1,090 Chinese International Students","We conducted the following cross-sectional study to comprehensively assess the anxiety among Chinese international students who studied online during the COVID-19 pandemic and its influencing factors. Questionnaires were distributed through ""Sojump,"" and a total of 1,090 valid questionnaires were collected. The questionnaire was divided into two parts: general situation and anxiety assessment of students. The former used a self-made questionnaire, and the international general GAD-7 scale was used to measure anxiety. Chi-square test was used to analyze the differences between groups, and logistic regression analysis was performed for the factors with differences. Anxiety was found in 707 (64.9%) of 1,090 international students. Chi-square test and multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence of anxiety was higher in the group under 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age than in the group over 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age (68% vs. 61%, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.186, 95% CI 1.045-1.347, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.008); International students living in big cities had a higher incidence of anxiety than those living in rural areas (67% vs. 60%, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.419, 95%CI 1.038-1.859, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011); international students who socialized 3 times or less monthly had a higher incidence of anxiety than those who socialized more than 3 times per month (68% vs. 58%, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.52, 95%CI 1.160-1.992, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002); international students who expected purely online teaching had a higher incidence of anxiety than those who expected purely offline teaching or dual-track teaching (72% vs. 64%, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.037; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.525, 95%CI 1.069-2.177, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02); international students with a subjective score of online learning experience of 6 or less had a higher incidence of anxiety than those with subjective scores of more than 6 (70% vs. 60%, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.25, 95%CI 1.099-1.422, <i>p</i> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). However, gender, emotional status, BMI, major of study, vaccination status, and degree type had no significant difference in the incidence of anxiety among international students who studied online during the COVID-19 pandemic. During COVID-19, international students who were younger, came from big cities, had low social frequency, expected purely online teaching, and had poor experience of online classes were risk factors for anxiety during online classes.","Tan, Wu, Qu, Liu, Peng, Ge, Li, Du, Tang, Wang, Peng, Liao, Song, Kang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.860289","20220502","COVID-19; anxiety; cross-sectional study; international students; mental health; online learning; online survey; public health emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30883,""

"The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 8-Items Expresses Robust Psychometric Properties as an Ideal Shorter Version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 Among Healthy Respondents From Three Continents","To examine the cultural limitations and implications in the applicability of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 8-items (DASS-8)-a shortened version of the DASS-21 recently introduced in an Arab sample-this study evaluated its psychometric properties, including measurement invariance, among healthy subjects from the United States, Australia, and Ghana. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed good fit of the DASS-8 relative to a 12-item version (DASS-12). Both the DASS-8 and the DASS-12 were invariant at all levels across genders, employment status, and students vs. non-students. The DASS-8/DASS-12 also expressed invariance at the configural and metric levels across all countries, albeit scalar invariance was not maintained due to misspecification of the factor loadings in the Ghanian sample. Mann-Whitney U test revealed significantly lower levels of mental symptomatology on the DASS measures among Ghanian students than in English-speaking respondents (both students and non-students). The DASS-8 expressed excellent internal consistency (coefficient alphaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.89), good convergent validity-noted by high values of item-total correlations (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.87 to 0.88), good predictive validity-indicated by significantly strong correlation with the DASS-21 and its subscales (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.95 to 0.80), and adequate discriminant validity-indicated by heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations &lt;0.85. The DASS-8 correlated with the Internet Gaming Disorder-9, the Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Self-Report Scale, and the Individualism and Collectivism Scale/Culture Orientation Scale at the same level as the DASS-21 and the DASS-12, denoting its adequate criterion validity. The DASS-8 can be used as a brief alternative to the DASS-21 to screen for mental symptomatology in English-speaking and African cultures. However, the same scores on the DASS-8 and the DASS-12 may not always indicate the same level of symptom severity in subjects from different countries. Further inter-cultural evaluations of the DASS-8 are needed.","Ali, Hori, Kim, Kunugi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.799769","20220502","coronavirus disease 2019/COVID-19; countr*/Australia/United States/Ghana; cultur*/collectiv*/individual*; factorial structure/psychometric properties/predictive validity/convergent validity/validation/measurement invariance; healthy individuals; psychological distress/stress/anxiety/depression; short form of the depression anxiety stress scale 21 (DASS-21)/depression anxiety stress scale 8-items; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30885,""
"Virus-Induced Maternal Immune Activation as an Environmental Factor in the Etiology of Autism and Schizophrenia","Maternal immune activation (MIA) is mediated by activation of inflammatory pathways resulting in increased levels of cytokines and chemokines that cross the placental and blood-brain barriers altering fetal neural development. Maternal viral infection is one of the most well-known causes for immune activation in pregnant women. MIA and immune abnormalities are key players in the etiology of developmental conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, and depression. Experimental evidence implicating MIA in with different effects in the offspring is complex. For decades, scientists have relied on either MIA models or human epidemiological data or a combination of both. MIA models are generated using infection/pathogenic agents to induce an immunological reaction in rodents and monitor the effects. Human epidemiological studies investigate a link between maternal infection and/or high levels of cytokines in pregnant mothers and the likelihood of developing conditions. In this review, we discuss the importance of understanding the relationship between virus-mediated MIA and neurodevelopmental conditions, focusing on autism and schizophrenia. We further discuss the different methods of studying MIA and their limitations and focus on the different factors contributing to MIA heterogeneity.","Massarali, Adhya, Srivastava, Baron-Cohen, Kotter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.834058","20220502","LPS; Poly(I:C); SARS-CoV-2; autism; autism spectrum conditions; maternal immune activation (MIA); schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30886,""

Study participants completed a brief online demographic questionnaire followed by a 45- to 60-min semi-structured one-on-one interview conducted <i>via</i> Zoom. Participants were asked about two main areas: (1) reasons for high rates of COVID-19 cases among the PI community and its impacts on their community and (2) the impacts of COVID-19 on them as individuals. A total of 14 PI adults, a majority of whom were females (76%) with an average age of 39.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years took part in the study. Participants cited underlying medical conditions, overrepresentation in the essential workforce, multigeneration households, and the collectivistic culture of PIs as possible reasons for high rates of COVID-19 cases in their communities. Impacts of the pandemic included loss of jobs, loss of family and friends, and poor mental health which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. This study documents the perspectives of PIs on why rates of COVID-19 are high in their community, their experiences with COVID-19 testing, and the impacts that the pandemic has had on themselves and their community.

"Predictive Model of the Psychological Well-Being of Nursing Students During the COVID-19 Lockdown","Lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed nursing education. Along with social isolation, the transition to distance education affected the well-being of students in several countries, particularly Portugal and Spain. To identify which variables are predictors of psychological well-being for Portuguese and Spanish nursing students during mandatory lockdowns. A multicenter, cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study involving a sample of 1075 students (944 women, mean age 22.46Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/-4.95 years). Data were collected from an online questionnaire which applied the following scales: Perceived Stress Scale (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.820); Brief COPE-14 Subscales (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.430Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.930); Well-being Manifestations Measure Scale (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.940); Herth Hope Index (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.850). A multiple regression model was created to predict the psychological well-being of nursing students. The following predictor variables were identified in the model of the psychological well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic: perceived stress (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.405; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); hope (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.404; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); and the mechanisms of active coping (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.405; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), planning (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.097; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and positive reinterpretation (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.053; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°.12).

"Metaphors of War in Effective and Ineffective Coping of Medical Directors of COVID-19 Wards in Public Hospitals","The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged medical professionals worldwide with an unprecedented need to provide care under conditions of complexity, uncertainty, and danger. These conditions, coupled with the unrelenting stress of overwhelming workloads, exhaustion, and decision-making fatigue, have forced clinicians to generate coping mechanisms. This qualitative study explored the use of metaphors as a coping mechanism by clinical directors of COVID-19 wards in Israeli public general hospitals while they were exposed to death and trauma throughout the pandemic's first wave in Israel (March to June 2020). The study employs discourse methodology and metaphor mapping analysis to capture the personal, organizational, and social dimensions of effective and ineffective processes of coping with an extreme health crisis. Analysis revealed that the metaphors that clinical directors used reflect a dual process of mediating and generating the social construction of meaning and facilitating effective and ineffective coping. Effective coping was facilitated by war metaphors that created a sense of mission and meaningfulness at both the organizational and the individual levels. War metaphors that generated a sense of isolation and sacrifice intensified helplessness and fear, which undermined coping. We propose actionable recommendations to enhance effective coping for individuals and organizations in this ongoing pandemic.","Naamati-Schneider, Gabay","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.830266","20220502","COVID-19; clinicians; coping; discourse analysis; hospitals; mapping; social constructivism; war metaphors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30889,""
"The Validation Study of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Scale Among Patients With Cancer in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 (SAVE-6) scale among patients with cancer who are in serious situations in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The survey included questions on the participants' demographic information, clinical history of cancer (including cancer type, stage, current treatment or diagnosis of complete remission), and scores on rating scales, including the SAVE-6 scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results determined that the model fits the single factor structure of the SAVE-6 scale among patients with cancer. The multi-group CFA showed that SAVE-6 can measure the anxiety response in a similar way across multiple variables, such as sex, presence of clinical depression, being in a state of complete remission, or currently undergoing cancer treatment. The SAVE-6 scale showed good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.819) and convergent validity with the rating scales, such as CAS [r = 0.348 (95% CI, 0.273-0.419), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001] and PHQ-9 items score [r = 0.251 (95% CI, 0.172-0.328), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001].

"Ability to Care for an Ill Loved One During the First COVID-19 Lockdown: Mediators of Informal Caregivers' Stress in Europe","Informal caregivers are overlooked, healthcare actors. They are at particular risk of distress and suffer from poor mental health. This study aimed to investigate the perceived stress and modulating factors during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Europe, regardless of the illness that care recipients suffer from. Sociodemographic data, coping resources, and perceived stress level using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) questionnaire were assessed using a web-based survey in Switzerland, France, and Belgium with 232 informal caregivers. Mediation analyses were used to identify the factors that modulate stress. Higher perceived stress among informal caregivers was associated with a younger age for the care recipient, family relationship with the care recipient, cohabitation, and female sex of the informal caregiver. These associations were partially mediated by the fear of getting ill (age, cohabitation), the conviction that lockdowns had a negative impact on health (age, kinship), and the perceived deterioration of the care recipient's health (gender). The fear of losing the ability to cope with caregiving tasks due to an illness (COVID-19 and/or other) and the negative impact of the lockdown on care recipients' health, particularly on the mental health of young care recipients, increased the stress of informal caregivers. Our results emphasize the importance of informal caregiving support to prevent heightened stress in lockdown conditions, regardless of care recipient illness or kinship.","Monteiro, Fournier, Favrod, Drainville, Plessis, Freudiger, Skuza, Tripalo, Franck, Lebas, Deloyer, Wilquin, Golay, Rexhaj","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.852712","20220502","COVID-19; informal caregiver; lockdown; mental health; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30891,""
"Research Gaps and Recommendations to Guide Research on Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Moral Injury Among Healthcare Workers","Healthcare workers face numerous occupational stressors, including some that may challenge personal and shared morals and values. This is particularly true during disasters and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which require critical decisions to be made with little time and information often under personal distress and situational constraints. Consequently, healthcare workers are at risk for moral injuries characterized by stress-related and functional impacts. Although research on the evaluation and treatment of moral injury among military veterans burgeoned in the recent decade, addressing moral injury in healthcare workers and other civilians remains an important gap. In this perspective piece, we identify research gaps and make recommendations to advance future work on assessment, prevention, and treatment of moral injury in healthcare workers.

"Psychological Symptom Progression in School-Aged Children After COVID-19 Home Confinement: A Longitudinal Study","The long-term mental health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children are rarely reported. We aimed to investigate the progression of depressive and anxiety symptoms among a cohort of children in the initial epicenter of COVID-19 in China. Two waves of surveys were conducted in the same two primary schools in Wuhan and Huangshi, Hubei province: Wave 1 from 28 February to 5 March, 2020 (children had been confined to home for 30-40 days) and Wave 2 from 27 November to 9 December, 2020 (schools had reopened for nearly 3 months). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were estimated using the Children's Depression Inventory - Short Form (CDI-S) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), respectively. ÃŽâ€CDI-S and ÃŽâ€SCARED scores between Wave 2 and Wave 1 were calculated and further categorized into tertiles. Multivariable linear regression and multinomial logistic regression models were then applied. A total of 1,224 children completed both surveys. The prevalence of mental health outcomes at Wave 2 increased significantly compared to Wave 1, specifically depressive symptoms (age-standardized prevalence rates: 37.5 vs. 21.8%) and anxiety symptoms (age-standardized prevalence rates: 24.0 vs. 19.6%). Higher ÃŽâ€SCARED scores were observed in females and children in Wuhan, and children with experience of neglect had higher ÃŽâ€CDI-S (ÃŽÂ² = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.67-1.58) and ÃŽâ€SCARED (ÃŽÂ² = 6.46; 95% CI = 4.73-8.19) scores compared with those without experience of neglect. When the ÃŽâ€ scores were further categorized into tertiles, similar results were found.

"Prevalence and Factors Associated With Depression and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among University Students in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted psychosocial well-being and mental health of students across the world. Although students are vulnerable to depression and suicidal ideation, few studies have been conducted in Uganda. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation, and associated factors among undergraduate university students in Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduates [<i>N</i> = 540; 363 males; mean age = 23.3 (Ã‚Â± 2.64) years] recruited from four universities using an online questionnaire that explored sociodemographic factors, depression, and other associated factors. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression, and Item 9 was used to assess suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation. The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 20% (<i>n</i> = 108) (cut-off: 10/27 based on the PHQ-9), and the prevalence of past-2-week suicidal ideation was 13.89% (<i>n</i> = 75) (cut-off: 1/3 based on the PHQ-9 Item 9). About half of the individuals who screened positive for depression had suicidal ideation. Factors associated with depression were: having relationship issues [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-2.81, <i>p</i> = 0.012], and having a history of sexual abuse (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.10-3.84, <i>p</i> = 0.023). Factors associated with reducing the risk of depression were: satisfaction with current academic performance (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.32-0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and being in the fifth year of academic study (aOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03-0.73, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Factors associated with suicidal ideation were: smoking cigarettes and/or marijuana (aOR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.10-21.12, <i>p</i> = 0.037), and having financial tuition constraints (aOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.08-3.16, <i>p</i> = 0.024), However, satisfaction with current academic performance reduced the likelihood of suicidal ideation (aOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.23-0.70, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Approximately one-fifth of undergraduate university students were moderately to severely depressed, especially those who had relationship issues and those with a history of sexual abuse. Suicidal ideation was common among smokers and those having financial tuition constraints. Therefore, it is recommended that the university authorities implement measures to provide psychological support for the students with problems concerning financial tuition constraints, relationships, and sexual abuse. Also, all students with depression should be screened for suicidality.","Kaggwa, Arinaitwe, Nduhuura, Muwanguzi, Kajjimu, Kule, Ajuna, Machacha, Nkola, Najjuka, Wamala, Bongomin, Griffiths, Rukundo, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.842466","20220502","COVID-19; academic satisfaction; depression; sexual abuse; suicidal ideation; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30894,""
"Mental Health and Loneliness in University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: A Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic and its preventive measures had adverse consequences for mental health. However, knowledge of mental health trajectories across the pandemic is limited. This study investigated the mental health levels and changes among university students during the pandemic and lockdown in Germany, as well as their associated factors. We surveyed students' mental health (<i>N</i> = 363, 68% female) with the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) during the first easing phase (July 2020; time 1) and the second lockdown (November 2020; time 2). Cut-off scores from the GAD-7 and PHQ-8 were used to determine clinically relevant symptoms and to define trajectory groups. Sociodemographic and pandemic-related data were assessed (e.g., coping with academic life, social contacts) as well as loneliness, stress, repetitive negative thinking, quality of life, and perceived social support. Paired <i>t</i>-test, multiple regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA were applied. Means and prevalence rates for symptoms of depression (38.8%) and anxiety (25.6%) did not differ between time 1 and time 2, and most students were asymptomatic on the PHQ-8 (44.4%) and the GAD-7 (56.3%) across the pandemic. Feelings of loneliness significantly increased from time 1 to time 2, <i>d</i> = -0.30, [-0.47, -0.13], with higher symptom levels in symptomatic groups at time 2 and greater increases in the asymptomatic groups. Levels of stress, repetitive negative thinking, quality of life, and social support did not differ during the pandemic. At time 1, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were prevalent among students, and increased levels of loneliness during the pandemic were associated with elevated symptoms and differing trajectories. Further research using representative and larger samples should determine the long-term impact of the pandemic on mental health and loneliness to identify vulnerable students and offer adequate support.","Weber, Schulze, BolzenkÃƒÂ¶tter, Niemeyer, Renneberg","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.848645","20220502","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; loneliness; pandemic; students; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30895,""
"Multimodal Benefits of Exercise in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis and COVID-19","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease characterized by plaque formation and neuroinflammation. The plaques can present in various locations, causing a variety of clinical symptoms in patients with MS. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is also associated with systemic inflammation and a cytokine storm which can cause plaque formation in several areas of the brain. These concurring events could exacerbate the disease burden of MS. We review the neuro-invasive properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the possible pathways for the entry of the virus into the central nervous system (CNS). Complications due to this viral infection are similar to those occurring in patients with MS. Conditions related to MS which make patients more susceptible to viral infection include inflammatory status, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, function of CNS cells, and plaque formation. There are also psychoneurological and mood disorders associated with both MS and COVID-19 infections. Finally, we discuss the effects of exercise on peripheral and central inflammation, BBB integrity, glia and neural cells, and remyelination. We conclude that moderate exercise training prior or after infection with SARS-CoV-2 can produce health benefits in patients with MS patients, including reduced mortality and improved physical and mental health of patients with MS.","Razi, Tartibian, Laher, Govindasamy, Zamani, Rocha-Rodrigues, Suzuki, Zouhal","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.783251","20220502","COVID-19; blood-brain barrier; glia; multiple sclerosis; myelin; physical exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30896,""
"Folie Ãƒ Deux in the Setting of COVID-19 Quarantine","We relay the case of a middle-aged male and his mother, an elderly female, who presented with <i>folie Ãƒ deux</i> in the context of shared delusions of persecution and somatization during the COVID-19 quarantine period. The delusions were described as electric microwave shocks being transmitted to their internal organs by neighbors, followed by somatic symptoms of palpitations, headaches, and a shock-like perception. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any reports that describe the development of <i>folie Ãƒ deux</i> in the setting of the COVID-19 quarantine. <i>Folie Ãƒ deux</i> may be defined as delusions affecting two or more individuals, usually first-degree relatives. Delusions classically transmit from one person, coined <i>the inducer</i>, to one or several individuals, <i>the induced</i>, who share and may expand on the communicated delusions. The preconditions that must exist for <i>folie Ãƒ deux</i> to develop are an intimate emotional association between the inducer and the induced and a genetic predisposition to psychosis, such as blood relations with primary relatives. Isolation from society has also been considered a potential risk factor for shared psychosis in the recent literature. Given that to the best of our knowledge, there have not been any reports describing the development of <i>folie Ãƒ deux</i> in the setting of the COVID-19 quarantine, the authors aim to dissect how extended periods of shared isolation from society during such a significant time in history may have served as a significant precipitating factor in the onset of shared psychotic disorder, while simultaneously illustrating a parallel relation to how such conditions may predispose certain subgroups to similarly dynamic-based mental health disorders. In addition, an evaluation of the origins and multifactorial etiology of <i>folie Ãƒ deux</i>, along with that of existing treatment modalities, and the emphasis on advancement toward more effective treatment approaches will be provided.","Baez NuÃƒÂ±ez, Rodriguez, DeLuca, Chirimunj, Dhingra","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2046436","20220502","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30897,""
"Dysregulated light/dark cycle impairs sleep and delays the recovery of patients in intensive care units: A call for action for COVID-19 treatment","Exposure to an adequate light-dark cycle is important for the speedy recovery of hospitalized and institutionalized patients. Light exposure, including natural light, offers several health benefits to both patients and nursing staff. This includes physical (e.g., decreased confusion and disorientation) and mental health benefits (e.g., prevention of depression) and a reduction in the hospital stay. Improved alertness and performance can also be noted among hospital staff. In this commentary, we discuss disrupting factors that include light during the nighttime along with noise and physical procedures on the patient and others. We then address some of the important steps that can be undertaken to restore a more normal environment for patients in the intensive care unit, which can be particularly important for COVID-19 patients.","Golombek, Pandi-Perumal, Rosenstein, Lundmark, Spence, Cardinali, Reiter, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2022.2056477","20220502","COVID-19; Light exposure; intensive care unit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30898,""
"Gratitude, relatedness needs satisfaction, and negative psychological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A short-term longitudinal study","Although gratitude relates to coronavirus disease 2019Ã‚Â (COVID-19) well-being outcomes in the United States, more evidence is needed to understand how this psychological strength reciprocally relates to mental health during this pandemic. This study examines the association of gratitude with stress, anxiety, and depression among undergraduate students in the United States via a longitudinal design. An online survey was administered to 643 undergraduate students in a public university located in the southeastern region of the United States. There was a 1-month interval between the firstÃ‚Â and secondÃ‚Â waves of data collection. Cross-lagged panel structural equation modeling showed that whereas gratitude positively predicted subsequent relatedness needs satisfaction, it negatively predicted later stress, anxiety, and depression. Relatedness needs satisfaction was reciprocally linked to subsequent gratitude. Results suggest that gratitude might serve as a protective psychological resource against the detrimental mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Datu, Fincham","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23364","20220502","COVID-19; gratitude; mental health; relatedness; undergraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30899,""
"Hormonal trends in patients suffering from long COVID symptoms","Symptoms of long COVID are complex and long-lasting, and endocrine dysfunction might be involved in the underlying mechanisms. In this study, to clarify the hormonal characteristics of long COVID patients, laboratory data for patients who visited the outpatient clinic for long COVID were evaluated. A retrospective analysis was performed for patients who visited Okayama University Hospital during the period from Feb 2021 to Dec 2021 with focus on the interrelationships between major symptoms and endocrine data. Information and laboratory data were obtained from medical records for 186 patients. The patients had various symptoms, and the most frequent symptoms were general malaise, dysosmia/dysgeusia, hair loss, headache, dyspnea, and sleeplessness. Patients who were suffering from fatigue and dysosmia/dysgeusia were younger, while hair loss was more frequent in older and female patients. As for the characteristics of patients suffering from general fatigue, the scores of depression and fatigue were positively correlated with serum levels of cortisol and free thyroxin (FT4), respectively. Also, patients suffering from general fatigue had lower levels of serum growth hormone and higher levels of serum FT4, while patients with dysosmia/dysgeusia had a significantly lower level of serum cortisol. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels were higher and the ratios of FT4/TSH were lower in the initially severe cases, suggesting occult hypothyroidism. In addition, the ratios of plasma adrenocorticotropin to serum cortisol were decreased in patients with relatively high titers of serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Thus, hormonal changes seem to be, at least in part, involved in the persistent symptoms of long COVID.","Sunada, Honda, Nakano, Yamamoto, Tokumasu, Sakurada, Matsuda, Hasegawa, Otsuka, Obika, Hanayama, Hagiya, Ueda, Kataoka, Otsuka","https://doi.org/10.1507/endocrj.EJ22-0093","20220501","Fatigue; Growth hormone; Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; Long COVID; Thyroid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30900,""
"One-year into COVID-19 pandemic: Decision-making and mental-health outcomes and their risk factors","The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented worldwide crisis with serious socioeconomic, physical and mental health consequences. However, its long-lasting effects on both mental health and decision-making difficulties remain unexplored. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of psychological disorders in Italy's populace one-year after the outbreak; further, we investigated potential risks impacting mental health and decision-making. In March 2021, 586 individuals (18-73Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years) completed an online-survey plus a computerized delay discounting task for hypothetical money rewards. Psychological symptoms prevalence exceeded the Italy's lockdown rates, with about one-third reporting moderate-to-extremely severe depression, another third anxiety, and the rest stress; mirrored by an increase of symptoms at clinically significant severity levels. One year into the pandemic, half of our sample presented at least one psychological problem, and one-third was at risk of developing a more clinically severe psychological outcome. Fear of job loss, loneliness and intolerance of uncertainty were among the major risk factors to mental health. Plus, social-relationships and financial uncertainty were key determinants of depression, while fear of COVID-19 infection predicted anxiety symptoms. For decision-making tendencies, elevated delay discounting rates, implying less future-oriented behaviors, were mostly predicted by increased job loss fear and older age (&gt;35Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years). This study provides cross-sectional evidence. Depression, anxiety and stress levels were still alarming one-year into COVID-19. Individuals experiencing financial insecurity, loneliness and intolerance of uncertainty perhaps benefit most from early interventions. Governments need to implement timely recovery plans to reduce financial insecurity, given its significant mental health impact and decision-making outcomes.","Fiorenzato, Cona","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.144","20220501","Anxiety; COVID-19; Decision-making; Delay discounting task; Depression; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30901,""
"Coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and mental health during pregnancy","Increased stress has likely contributed to the observed high prevalence of depression and anxiety in pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and associations of these coping strategies with depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. 8320 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between June 22, 2020 and May 10, 2021 completed an online survey including questions about coping strategies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and current depression and anxiety symptoms. We used weighted regression to estimate prevalence ratios for moderate/severe depression and anxiety symptom severity associated with coping strategies. The most common coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress were talking with friends and family (77%), outdoor physical activity (54%), and increasing screen time activities (52%). Exercising using online programs or videos, outdoor physical activity, talking with friends and family, and engaging in more family activities were associated with 29% to 38% lower prevalence of moderate/severe depression symptom severity and 16% to 34% lower prevalence of moderate/severe anxiety symptom severity. We are unable to rule out reverse temporality as an explanation for the observed results because of the cross-sectional design; depression or anxiety symptom severity may influence use of specific coping strategies. Our results suggest that physical activity and connecting with others are coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress that may be associated with better mental health in pregnant individuals.","Badon, Croen, Ferrara, Ames, Hedderson, Young-Wolff, Zhu, Avalos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.146","20220501","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping strategies; Depression; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","",30902,""
