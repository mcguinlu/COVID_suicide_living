"One-year multidisciplinary follow-up of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation","Objective Patients with COVID-19 frequently develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Data on long-term survival of these patients are lacking. We investigated 1-year survival, quality of life and functional recovery of COVID-19 ARDS patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation Design Prospective observational study Setting Tertiary-care university hospital Participants All COVID-19 ARDS patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and discharged alive from hospital Interventions Patients were contacted by phone after 1-year. Functional, cognitive, and psychological outcomes were explored through a questionnaire and assessed using validated scales. Patients were offered the possibility to undergo a follow-up chest CT scan. Measurements and Main Results The study included all adult (age = 18 years) patients with COVID-19-related ARDS admitted to an ICU of our institution between February 25th, 2020 - April 27th, 2020), who received at least one day of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Of 116 patients who received IMV, 61 (52.6%) survived to hospital discharge. These survivors were assessed one year after discharge and 56 completed a battery of tests of cognition, activities of daily living and interaction with family members. They had overall good functional recovery, with &gt;80% reporting good recovery and no difficulties in usual activities. A total of 52 (93%) of patients had no dyspnea at rest. Severe anxiety/depression was reported by five (8.9%) of patients. Comparing 2-months and 1-year data, we observed the most significant improvements in the areas of working status and exertional dyspnea. One-year Chest CT scans were available for 36 patients: fibrotic-like changes were present in four patients. Conclusions All patients who survived the acute phase of the COVID-19 disease and were discharged from the hospital were alive at the 1-year follow up and the vast majority of them had good overall recovery and quality of life.

"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on otolaryngological practice, effect of presbylarynx and presbycusis in the elderly, and suicidal ideation in patients with tinnitus","In a study by Rodrigues Dias et al. in this month's issue, the authors used a multidimensional assessment, including objective and subjective measures, to examine the potential influences of presbylarynx and presbycusis on the 30-item Voice Handicap Index and on emotional status (as assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale) in 174 participants.5 The authors conclude that the presence and severity of presbylarynx have strong associations with Voice Handicap Index scores, the voice and quality of life. The authors conclude that clinicians should therefore be assessing suicidality as standard in tinnitus sufferers, and, if suicidal ideation is present, formal suicide risk assessment and appropriate referral to mental health services are important.

"The effect of school and peer connectedness on adolescent mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal panel survey","Background The COVID-19 pandemic, school closures, and social distancing measures have disrupted young people's daily routines, learning, and social relationships. We examine the changes in adolescent mental health over time and explore the relationship between how connected students felt to their school and peers before the pandemic and how this affected their mental health during school closures and on return to school. Methods This is a longitudinal three-wave panel survey with students aged 13â€“15 years in 17 secondary schools across the South West of England. Students completed a self-report survey before the pandemic (October, 2019), during the first UK lockdown (May, 2020), and shortly after returning to school (October, 2020). Matched data across all three waves were available for 603 students. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS). School connectedness was measured using six items adapted from the Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM) scale. Peer connectedness was measured using a seven-item subscale as published by Jose, Ryan, and Pryor (2012). The study was approved by the University of Bristol Medical School ethics committee (reference 84883). Findings There was an overall decrease in anxiety score from before the pandemic (median 7, IQR 4â€“11) to during the first UK lockdown (median 6, IQR 3â€“10). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated that this difference was statistically significant (z=â€“7Â·061, p&lt;0Â·0001). Anxiety levels then increased on return to school (median 8, IQR 4â€“11), which was also statistically significant (z=6Â·983, p&lt;0Â·0001). No changes were observed for levels of depression over the three timepoints. Low school connectedness at baseline predicted a significant increase in anxiety when students returned to school (ÃŸ 1Â·33, 95% CI 0Â·55â€“2Â·11;p=0Â·001). No significant association was found between low peer connectedness before the pandemic and anxiety levels on return to school (ÃŸ 0Â·53, 95% CI â€“0Â·24 to 1Â·30;p=0Â·175). Interpretation Our findings suggest that most students adapted well to school closures, and in fact experienced less anxiety than before the pandemic. Students who reported feeling poorly connected to school before the pandemic are likely to experience higher levels of anxiety on return to school. This study highlights the need for routine mental health and wellbeing monitoring in schools to identify key areas of support and to inform school-based public health interventions.

"Variations in the incidence of common mental disorder symptoms in the general population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and nationally mandated restrictions to control the virus were anticipated to increase the incidence of mental health issues. So far, little evidence has been found of increases in the use of mental health services. Heterogeneous mental health has been found in general population cohorts during the first 6 months of the pandemic. This study aimed to explore changes in the likelihood of clinically significant mental health issues during 14 months of the pandemic, and to identify individual risk factors for poor mental health. Methods A cohort was formed of 33 703 adults in England who provided data between March, 2020, and April, 2021 (11 023 [32Â·7%] aged 60 years or older;25 567 [75Â·9%] women;and 1628 [4Â·8%] from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic groups). Trajectories of meeting criteria for clinically significant depression or anxiety each month were estimated with growth mixture modelling through validated screening measure cutoffs (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores =10 or Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 scores =8). Sociodemographic and personality-related (Big Five Inventory) risk factors associated with trajectory class membership were identified in multivariable regression models. The study was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (reference 12467/005). Findings We identified five trajectories for depression and five for anxiety. Participants (general population weighted) in the largest trajectory class (depression: n=20 818 [62%];anxiety: n=21 167 [63%]) had a less than 5% probability of reporting clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety throughout the study period. However, other trajectories represented participants with clinically significant mental health issues: high likelihood of distress throughout the study period (depression: n=4444 [13%];anxiety: n=4214 [13%]);distress early in the pandemic that decreased within the first four months (depression: n=3 052 (9%);anxiety: n=3 050 [9%]);distress that emerged around five months after the pandemic began (depression: n=2157 [6%];anxiety: n=2 111 [6%]);and a moderate likelihood of such problems throughout the pandemic study period (March, 2020, to April, 2021) (depression: n=3230 [10%];anxiety: n=3 159 [9%]). Being in younger age groups (compared with being older than 60 years), female, a carer, having an existing mental health diagnosis, socialising daily pre-pandemic, and higher neuroticism scores were all independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Participants from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic groups or those living alone were more likely to follow trajectories that changed little in relation to the course of the pandemic. Interpretation Almost four in ten people followed trajectories with a greater than 50% chance of reporting clinically significant levels of depression or anxiety symptoms during the study period. Sociodemographic, health, and personality factors were associated with differential mental health trajectories. These findings might support targeted public health interventions for those in the highlighted at-risk groups, given the likelihood of developing mental health issues during the course of the pandemic.

"Attitudes towards COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented at St Mark's Bowel Cancer Screening Centre: a cross-sectional analysis of survey data from an ethnically diverse region in London","Background Negative attitudes towards, and experiences with, health services can negatively affect attendance at diagnostic investigation. Since services resumed in June, 2020 (ie, following the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic), several new procedures to reduce COVID-19 transmission have been implemented, but the extent to which these measures are acceptable to patients has not yet been examined. We aimed to assess patient attitudes towards the measures implemented within St Mark's Bowel Cancer Screening Centre, St Mark's Hospital, Harrow, UK. Methods We surveyed patients who underwent colonoscopy after their procedure and asked a series of questions using the five-point Likert scales. Factor analysis was used to group questions into mutually exclusive groups, with three factors were subsequently identified: attitudes towards measures to reduce hospital-based COVID-19 transmission (factor 1;five items), attitudes towards precolonoscopy COVID-19 swabbing (factor 2;two items), and attitudes towards protective clothing (factor 3;two items). Scales ranged from five to 25 for factor 1 and two to ten for factors 2 and 3 (with higher scores representing more positive attitudes). Descriptive statistics were used to calculate means, whereas linear regression was used to test associations between participant demographics, COVID-19 anxiety, and bowel cancer anxiety with attitudinal factors. Participation in the study was voluntary and consent was obtained from all participants. Findings Of the 408 patients invited, 288 patients (71%) who underwent colonoscopy between July 1, 2020, and May 1, 2021, were surveyed. Participants were predominantly men (n=182;63%) and of White (n=167;58%) or South Asian ethnicity (n=59;20%;the mean age of all participants was 66Â·52 years [SD 5Â·29]). The mean score was 23Â·12 for factor 1, 7Â·60 for factor 2, and 8Â·15 for factor 3. South Asian adults were less positive towards measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission (factor 1;23Â·04) than White adults (23Â·18;ÃŸ coefficient 0Â·31;p=0Â·035). COVID-19 anxiety was the only predictor of attitudes towards protective clothing (factor 3), with higher COVID-19 anxiety being associated with more positive attitudes towards protective clothing (0Â·25;p=0Â·037). Interpretation Attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention measures were highly positive. Future service evaluation should focus on reassuring South Asian patients of measures to reduce hospital-related infection (eg, through information provision). South Asian patients are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage, so reducing barriers to diagnosis to prevent COVID-19 from widening inequalities in cancer even further is imperative.

"Population birth outcomes and experiences of expectant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales: a mixed methods study","Background Pregnancy can be a stressful time and the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to have heightened maternal stress. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on population birth outcomes, uptake of primary immunisations, and expectant mothers' experiences of pregnancy in Wales. Methods In this mixed methods study we analysed stillbirths, prematurity, birthweight and caesarean section births before (2016â€“19) and during (2020) the pandemic using national routine anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. Uptake of the first three scheduled primary immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. Immunisations were extracted from the routinely collected data in the National Community Child Health Database. We compared percentages between years the ran <U+03C7>2 with Yates correction for the three percentages given. Expectant mothers (aged =16 years) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. Inclusion criteria was being aged 16 years or older and living in Wales. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. Ethical approval was granted by Swansea University Ethics Committee and each participant provided written consent before answering any survey questions. Findings There was no significant difference between annual outcomes including gestation and birthweight, stillbirths, and caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared with 2016â€“19. Difference in gestation (moderate to late preterm difference â€“0Â·26%, 95% CI â€“0Â·52% to â€“0Â·01%). Difference in low birthweight 0Â·13% (0Â·00% to 0Â·26%). Difference in stillbirths â€“0Â·01% (â€“0Â·02% to 0Â·00%). Difference in caesarean sections â€“0Â·42% (â€“1Â·13% to 0Â·29%). There was an increase in late-term births (=42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (odds ratio [OR] 1Â·28, p=0Â·019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32â€“36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR 0Â·74, p=0Â·001). Fewer babies were born in 2020 (n=29 031) compared with 2016â€“19 (n=32 582;mean [SD 1561]). All babies received their immunisations in 2020, but there were minor delays in the timings of vaccines. Those vaccinations due at 8-weeks were 8% less likely to be on time (within 28 days) and, at 16-weeks, they were 19% less likely to be on time. The pandemic had a negative effect on the mental health of 151 (72%) of 211 survey respondents, who reported feeling anxious, nervous, or depressed;this finding was associated with attending scans without their partner, giving birth alone, and minimal contact with midwives. Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on mothers' experiences of pregnancy;however, population data suggests that this did not translate to adverse birth outcomes for babies born during the pandemic.

"Exploring sentinel conditions and the accrual sequence of multiple long-term condition multimorbidity using birth cohort and primary care data: an exploratory retrospective cohort study","Background Evidence suggests that the sequence of accrual of conditions varies considerably and affects outcomes. We aimed to explore whether sentinel conditions (the first long-term condition occurring in the life course) and accrual sequences of long-term conditions in the development of early onset multimorbidity can be characterised using birth cohort and primary care data. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study (BCS70) and pseudonymised data from the Care and Health Information Analytics database (CHIA). Age 26 years is the first BCS70 adulthood sweep (round of data collection) age 46 years the most recent (age 50 sweep delayed by COVID-19) and we investigated an exemplar multiple long-term condition multimorbidity (MLTC-M) group with adequate numbers (ie, mental ill-health, backpain, and high blood pressure). In CHIA we defined MLTC-M as two or more (of 21) conditions occurring by age 50. Sequencing identified the timepoint at which sentinel conditions were reported. Findings The BCS70 age 46 years sample comprised of 8581 participants (4427 [52%] women and 4154 [48%] men). For participants who reported the exemplar MLTC-M outcome (n=163), mental ill-health was the sentinel condition for 25% (n=41), with 12% (n=20) reporting mental ill-health at age 26 years. Pain was the second commonest sentinel condition (21%;n=35) with 16% (n=26) reporting pain at age 26 years. 45% (n=74) reported their sentinel condition by age 26. For the exemplar MLTC-M group the most common accrual sequence was mental ill-health and back pain followed by high blood pressure (n=35;21%). The CHIA sample included 702 265 participants (373 553 [53%] women and 328 712 [47%] men). Out of a total 335 963 people under 50, 65 757 (20%) had MLTC-M. Common sentinel conditions were asthma (44%;n=29 228) and anxiety or depression (37%;n=24 634). Hypertension was a sentinel condition for 4% (n=2580). Interpretation We identified possible sentinel conditions of burdensome MLTC-M in birth cohort and primary care datasets. Continued development of this methodology, drawing together learning from complementary datasets, might help inform the timing and nature of interventions endeavouring to alter health trajectories and preventing the development of MLTC-M.

"Young people's perspectives on inequalities in health in England: a qualitative study","Background Across England, inequalities in health are worsening. They have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and are particularly acute for some ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and some regions. Exploration of the public's understanding of health inequalities has increased, but few studies have looked at the views of young people. Our study seeks to redress this gap by exploring young people's perspectives of inequalities in health. Methods We did a qualitative study consisting of three interlinked focus groups (online and face-to-face) with young people from six youth organisations. Focus groups took place from Feb 10 to June 28, 2021. They were co-delivered with partnering youth organisations and involved participatory concept mapping activities and the discussion of health-related news articles. Working with youth organisations, we recruited young people (aged 13â€“21 years) from six youth groups in areas of high and mixed deprivation across three geographical locations in England (the North East, South Yorkshire, and London). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The data management software NVivo 12 was used to facilitate coding. All participants provided written informed consent, following acquisition of verbal informed consent from parents or guardians. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of Sheffield, Durham University, and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ethics committees. Findings We ran 15 focus groups online and three face-to-face with 42 young people (19 male, 18 female, two non-binary, and three trans-male). Numbers ranged from two to ten participants in each group. Young people described a variety of different factors that shaped their health, including individual behaviours, personal or household resources, relationships and community, local services, the physical environment (particularly reputation and safety), psychosocial factors (including sense of belonging), and the socioeconomic context of the area (eg, quality and quantity of local jobs). However, throughout their discussions they foregrounded the importance of interrelationships between factors. Young people's understanding of inequalities in health were often rooted in their own experience and focused on an awareness of advantage and disadvantage. Young people articulated several different pathways through which they perceived health inequalities to be created, and consistently emphasised the importance of poverty as a root cause of inequality. Priorities for change included improving mental health support, access to safe and healthy local spaces, affordability of activities, healthy food availability, and youth group funding. Interpretation Our study highlights that young people have nuanced, experiential understandings of factors influencing their and other people's health within their local areas. Exploring young people's perspectives of inequalities is crucial in designing policies that are relevant to, and informed by, the people and places they affect.

"COVID-19 recovery from the community perspective in Middlesbrough: a coproduction cross-sectional study","Background People younger than 65 years living in deprivation are nearly four times more likely to die of COVID-19 and, in Middlesbrough, life expectancy is 12Â·6 years lower than those in the least deprived areas of England. We aimed to examine COVID-19 recovery from the perspective of members of the local communities in Middlesbrough. Methods In this coproduction cross-sectional study, we used purposive, semi-structured interviews, with recruitment via social media and community groups. Interviews were conducted via telephone or Microsoft Teams. Participants needed to be a resident of Middlesbrough and aged 18 years or older. Particular engagement was sought amongst those aged 18â€“30 years (n=15), older than 50 years (n=20), and individuals identifying as Black, Asian, or minority ethnic (n=22), or those residing in a TS1 or TS3 postcode area (n=23), with both areas being associated with high rates of deprivation, and Middlesbrough ranking fifth highest according to the 2019 English Indices of Deprivation (ONS, 2019). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic analysis, coded blind to eliminate bias. Ethical clearance was granted by the Teesside University Ethics Sub-Committee at which time recruitment commenced. Written and verbal consent was obtained by the research team before any interviews started. Findings Between Oct 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021, we recruited and interviewed 52 people (26 women, 25 men, and one non-binary person), generating over 50 h of interview transcripts. From analysis of these transcripts, eight primary themes emerged: authority, autonomy, community, economy, fairness, framing, future, and wellbeing. Participants spoke of feeling abandoned by authorities, mistrusting of official information, and worries around the ability of their communities to survive financially through lockdowns. Interpretation Development of social capital is crucial to the development of a COVID-19 recovery strategy. Providing people with choices tailored to their local setting is fundamentally important. Mental health is a priority as we emerge from lockdown, particularly young people. Communication from authorities must be carefully framed, avoiding imperatives where possible. Better understanding is needed for the reasons behind mistrust of official information.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-care usage and mental health of clinically extremely vulnerable individuals in Wales: a population-scale data linkage study","Background The public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK included advising those identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to self-isolate within their homes. We compared the health-care usage and mental health of the CEV population with that of the general population during the pandemic. Methods In this retrospective population-scale data linkage study in Wales, we used person-level linked, routinely collected, data sources available within the Secure Anonymous Information Linkage Databank. Age-standardised rates of monthly planned and emergency care attendances between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2020, were examined. We used a Cox model to explore risk factors for depression or anxiety (identified from primary care diagnosis, symptoms, and prescription Read codes). Findings The CEV cohort included 127 787 patients and was older than the general population (52Â·4% (66 963) CEV were aged =65 years, vs 21Â·0% (662 376) of the general population, p&lt;0Â·0001). Average monthly trends showed that the decline in planned care was greater among the CEV than the general population from Marchâ€“August, 2020 (elective admissions: â€“7Â·2% for CEV vs â€“0Â·6 for general population;outpatient attendances: â€“3Â·8% vs â€“1Â·3%), with a slower recovery into December, 2020 for CEV (elective: CEV â€“1.4% vs general population 3Â·9%;outpatient: 1Â·7% vs 4Â·1%). There were increases in both ED attendances and emergency admissions from Marchâ€“August, 2020, which were greater among the general population (7Â·0% vs 3Â·1%, respectively) compared with the CEV (4Â·3% vs 0Â·5%). Being CEV (hazard ratio 1Â·2 [95% CI 1Â·2â€“1Â·3]) and historical poor mental health (3Â·7 [3Â·5â€“3Â·9]) were associated with an increased risk of anxiety or depression. Interpretation Declines in planned care were not unexpected given the impact of COVID-19 on the National Health Service, and suggest considerable unmet need. Declines in secondary care activity amongst the CEV could reflect reluctance to attend hospital, not reduced clinical need. Reliance on an algorithm to identify CEV might have led to overestimation of the heterogeneous CEV population.

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of shielded children and children living in shielded households in Wales: a data linkage study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on children's mental health. Shielded children or those living with a shielded person might be particularly susceptible to mental health difficulties arising as a result of strict public health restrictions. However, studies examining mental health outcomes in these children are scarce. We aimed to address this evidence gap. Methods We linked the COVID-19 Shielded Patient List to demographic and health-care datasets within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. We constructed three cohorts of children aged 2â€“17 years who were living in Wales and registered with a general practitioner that provides data to SAIL when shielding was introduced on March 23, 2020: shielded children, children living with a shielded person, a general population group of registered children who were neither shielding or living with a shielded person. We used published Read codes to identify children with primary care diagnoses or prescriptions relating to anxiety or depression, before and during the pandemic. We compared the difference in proportions of new diagnoses or prescriptions during COVID-19 between groups. Findings Before the COVID-19 pandemic (March 23, 2019, to March 23, 2020), 155 (4Â·2%) of 3721 shielded children received diagnoses or prescriptions for anxiety or depression, compared with 128 (3Â·4%) of 3721 children during the pandemic (March 23, 2020, to Jan 31, 2021);71 (2Â·0%) of 3566 had new diagnoses or prescriptions during the pandemic. For children in shielded households, these values were 489 (2Â·5%) of 19 954 children before COVID-19 and 301 (1Â·5%) of 19 954 children during COVID-19, with 218 (1Â·1%) of 19 456 having new diagnoses or prescriptions during the pandemic. For the general population, these values were 8001 (2Â·0%) of 411 680 children before COVID-19 and 5420 (1Â·3%) of 411 680 children during COVID-19, with 4070 (1Â·0%) of 403 679 having new diagnoses or prescriptions during the pandemic. The difference in the proportion of new diagnoses or prescriptions between shielded children and the general population was significant (<U+03C7>2 35Â·40 [95% CI 0Â·59â€“1Â·51], p&lt;0Â·0001). Interpretation Our findings show a decrease in diagnoses or prescriptions for anxiety or depression during COVID-19, which could be partly attributed to a reluctance to seek health care during this time. The prevalence of anxiety or depression was highest in shielded children, and the rate of new diagnoses or prescriptions during COVID-19 was significantly higher among shielded children. Future work could involve longitudinal follow-up of these children to assess future trends in health-care use for mental health-related conditions and longer-term health and education outcomes among these groups.

"Reduced ability to engage in social and physical activity and mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: longitudinal analysis from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging","Background Restrictions implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 have affected the ability of many older adults to engage in social and physical activities. We examined the mental health outcomes for older adults whose ability to be socially and physically active was reduced during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of Canadian residents aged 45â€“85 years, at CLSA baseline (2012â€“15), follow-up 1 (2018), COVID-19 baseline (Aprilâ€“May, 2020), and COVID-19 exit surveys (Septemberâ€“December, 2020) were used. Participants were asked the degree to which their ability to participate in social and physical activity had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between the risk of a positive screen for depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score &gt;10) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 score &gt;10) and reduced participants' ability to participate in social and physical activity. Models were adjusted for age group, dwelling type, geographic area, household composition, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and smoking status at COVID-19 baseline;alcohol consumption at COVID-19 exit;and multimorbidity, physical activity, income, social participation, and diagnosis of anxiety or mood disorders before the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Of the 24 108 participants who completed the COVID-19 exit survey, 5219 (22Â·0%) screened positive for depression and 1132 (5Â·0%) screened positive for anxiety. Depression and anxiety were associated with a decreased ability to participate in social activity (odds ratio [OR] 1Â·85 [95% CI 1Â·67â€“2Â·04] for depression;1Â·66 [1Â·37â€“2Â·02] for anxiety) and physical activity (2Â·46 [2Â·25â€“2Â·69] for depression;1Â·96 [1Â·68â€“2Â·30] for anxiety). Interpretation Older adults whose ability to participate in social and physical activities was reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic had poorer mental health outcomes than those whose ability remained the same or improved. Individuals who had low pre-COVID-19 levels of social and physical activity had a higher frequency of positive depression and anxiety screens. These findings highlight the importance of fostering social and physical activity resources in advance of, and during, future lockdown measures.

"Understanding risk and protective factors to UK railway workers' mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","Background Frontline railway workers have provided an essential service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Although railway workers are known to be at risk of developing traumatic stress-related conditions, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of railway workers in the UK. We tested two hypotheses: (1) increased scores in COVID-19-related risk factors will predict decreased mental wellbeing and (2) protective factors will mediate the relationship between COVID-19-related risk factors and mental wellbeing. Methods The study consisted of a cross-sectional online survey exploring the effects of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of railway workers (n=906) in the UK, using data collected during third lockdown (between Dec 1, 2020, and March 24, 2021). The survey, advertised on social media and internal platforms of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, included measures of COVID-19-related risk factors (COVID-19 Perceived Risk Scale, COVID-19 Stress Measure, COVID-19 Burnout Scale, and PTSD Checklistâ€“Civilian Version) and protective factors (brief resilience coping, team resilience, general help-seeking questionnaire) associated with mental wellbeing (Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scaleâ€“Short Form). We analysed responses via multiple regression and parallel mediation analyses. Open-ended questions, exploring railway workers' views of risks and protective factors for their mental wellbeing, were analysed using content analysis. The institutional ethics committee granted ethical approval and participants gave informed consent. Findings COVID-19 related risk factors negatively predicted wellbeing (r2=0Â·50, F=273Â·556 [3 variables, n=813], p&lt;0Â·0001). Protective factors significantly mediated the relationship between wellbeing and burnout (indirect effect [IE] â€“0Â·0252, 95% CI â€“0Â·0364 to â€“0Â·0152), stress (IE â€“0Â·0252, â€“0Â·0364 to â€“0Â·0152), post-traumatic stress disorder (IE â€“0Â·0311, â€“0Â·0493 to â€“0Â·0145), and risk perception (IE â€“0Â·0244, â€“0Â·0411 to â€“0Â·0089). Content analysis found self-reported mental health decline throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived loss of workplace supports, need for psychological support, and concerns for the future. Interpretation These findings emphasise the importance of adaptive coping and team-based resilience in alleviating the negative impact that COVID-19 has on railway workers' mental wellbeing and in preventing burnout. Work-based supports and access to psychological input for railway workers who need it is highlighted. Building a resilient railway workforce moving forward requires attention to staff mental wellbeing and to ensuring that support systems are robust and accessible.

"Challenges of self-isolation among contacts of cases of COVID-19: a national telephone survey in Wales","Background Self-isolation is known to be challenging and adherence is dependent on a range of psychological, social, and economic factors. We aimed to identify the specific challenges experienced by contacts of COVID-19 cases to better target support and minimise the harms of self-isolation. Methods The Contact Adherence Behavioural Insights Study (CABINS) was a 15 min telephone survey of contacts of COVID-19 cases, identified through NHS Wales Test Trace Protect (TTP). Quota sampling by age, gender (interlocked), and Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) was used to ensure a representative sample of those in the TTP database. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, living alone, time period, WIMD, and income precarity (financial insecurity) established which subgroups were more likely to experience challenges. Ethical approval was gained from the NHS Research Ethics Committee and the Public Health Wales Research and Development Office. Informed consent was gained from participants at the beginning of the telephone call. Findings We identified 47 072 eligible contacts (24 825 female, 23 090 male, and 10 542 did not say) who were informed to self-isolate over two periods (period 1 [regional lockdowns in place;no financial support available]: Sept 13, 2020, to Oct 23, 2020 [n=18 568];period 2 [during a national lockdown;self-isolation support payments available]: Dec 13, 2020, to Jan 16, 2021 [n=28 504]). 10 801 were invited to participate (5092 from period 1, 5709 from period 2);2027 (18Â·8%) completed the survey. People with high income precarity were almost eight times more likely to report financial challenges (adjusted odds ratio 7Â·73;95% CI 5Â·10â€“11Â·74) and three times more likely to report mental health concerns (3Â·08;2Â·22â€“4Â·28) than their more financially secure counterparts. Younger people (18â€“29 years) were twice as likely to report loneliness (1Â·96;1Â·37â€“2Â·81) and three times more likely to report mental health concerns (3Â·16;2Â·05â€“4Â·86) than individuals aged 60 years and older. Women were nearly twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties as men (1Â·51;1Â·20â€“1Â·92). No effects of WIMD were found. Findings were similar between the two periods. Interpretation Financial challenges of self-isolation were particularly acute among those individuals with high income precarity, and younger people and women had considerable mental health challenges. During the pandemic, Welsh Government and local TTP teams used this insight to target financial and mental health support to those with greatest need. Despite easing of self-isolation requirements for contacts of COVID-19 cases, identifying these groups remains important for future pandemics and the provision of financial and social support.

"Understanding the potential and pitfalls of digital phenotypes to measure population mental health and wellbeing","Background Digital phenotypes such as social media data are increasingly being used to infer supposed trends in population mental health and wellbeing. These methods are attractive for their potential scale and timeliness. However, many methodological aspects need investigation to establish if these approaches could be applied successfully. We aim to explore these challenges by linking digital phenotypes to high-quality epidemiological data in a birth cohort study. Methods We retrospectively linked social media data from Twitter for 661 consenting participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a multigenerational population cohort study. Participants volunteered their Twitter usernames, after a series of focus groups with 14 cohort participants about the acceptability of social media data linkage. Twitter data were used to test the effectiveness of inferring mental health and wellbeing from a range of sentiment analysis algorithms in combination with behavioural and temporal features. These methods were evaluated with participant-level survey data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 9, 2020, to July 3, 2020), including with the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Ethics and Law Committee, and informed consent was obtained from participants. Findings Twitter provides a specific Application Programming Interface for academic research, granting free access to the full history archive and thus enabling the collection of data from cohorts. The focus groups determined that data linkage with Twitter and subsequent sharing is acceptable when data are anonymised. However, publicly available data such as Twitter data can be easily identifiable, and we are therefore exploring methods that would preserve privacy more effectively for data sharing. Our initial results show that temporal features have a key influence on the sensitivity and specificity of a model for the inference of wellbeing, anxiety, and depression when used in combination with textual and behavioural features. This influence varies depending on the specific outcome measure. Ongoing analyses will establish whether extrapolating successful models to alternative population samples is possible. Interpretation Early results suggest that different mental health and wellbeing outcomes require individual models with uniquely tuned features. Cohort studies are a rich source of training data, but attention must be given to adequate anonymisation practices.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychotropic medication uptake in Northern Ireland: a population-wide trend analysis","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns were predicted to have a major impact on mental health;however, studies on this issue present contradictory findings. Mental ill-health indicators have exhibited strong upward trends over the past decade, but recent studies exploring psychotropic medication uptake have relied on simple counts in the year before and after lockdown, which can give a false impression of the scale of the pandemic's effect. This study uses 9 years of linked, individual-level, administrative data to identify changes in psychotropic medication uptake before and after the pandemic. Methods Psychotropic and antiepileptic (counterfactual comparator) medication data were extracted from the population-wide Enhanced Prescribing Database (EPD), which captures all medications dispensed in community pharmacies across Northern Ireland. Prescriptions remain free in Northern Ireland;therefore, EPD captures more than 99% of medications dispensed, but monthly scan rates can be lower. Individual-level demographic and socioeconomic indicators were obtained from general practitioner registration data for everyone aged older than 10 years (approximately 1Â·5 million). Denominators varied monthly, including all individuals alive and resident that month. Monthly prescription counts were split (prelockdown Jan 1, 2012 to Feb 29, 2020;post lockdown March 1 to Oct 31, 2020). Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average models were trained in R, version 4.1.0, taking into consideration trends and seasonal effects. The forecast (expected) monthly values were compared to actual monthly values, stratified by demographic factors. Findings Over the study period, approximately 31Â·4% (n=566 594) of the study population had received antidepressant, 13Â·6% (n=244 515) hypnotic, 3Â·6% (n=65 565) antipsychotic, 17Â·4% (n=312 849) anxiolytic, and 9Â·3% (n=167 518) antiepileptic medications at some point, with strong upward trends for all medications 2012â€“20. In March, 2020, when restrictions began, all medication uptake increased beyond the CIs of the expected value, followed by a decrease Aprilâ€“May, 2020, mostly returning to the expected trend thereafter. Uptake of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiepileptics remained as expected when stratified by gender, age, single-person household, deprivation, and urbanicity. Significant increases were observed in uptake of hypnotics in people younger than 18 years and older than 65 years, and in anxiolytics for people older than 65 years. Interpretation Our results suggest stockpiling of medications in March, 2020, with lockdown associated with increased hypnotics in children, and hypnotics and anxiolytics in older people. There remains no evidence of restrictions impacting antidepressant or antipsychotic uptake.

Les donnÃ©es socio-dÃ©mographiques Ã©taient recueillies, et le retentissement des confinements Ã©tait Ã©valuÃ© par des questionnaires validÃ©s visant Ã  Ã©valuer le stress perÃ§u (Perceived Stress scale 10), lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ© et la dÃ©pression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) et la survenue dâ€™un Ã©tat de stress post-traumatique (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, PCL-5). Les participants ont consenti Ã  lâ€™utilisation de leurs donnÃ©es et la mÃ©thodologie de lâ€™enquÃªte a Ã©tÃ© validÃ©e par un comitÃ© dâ€™Ã©thique indÃ©pendant (CE-2020-151). RÃ©sultats Cinq cent trente-six questionnaires ont Ã©tÃ© recueillis auprÃ¨s de patients lupiques entre novembre 2020Â et avril 2021. Lâ€™Ã¢ge mÃ©dian Ã©tait de 50Â ans [IQRÂ : 39-60] et 91,9Â % Ã©taient des femmes. Leur maladie Ã©voluait depuis une mÃ©diane de 17 [9-25] ans, 77Â % Ã©taient traitÃ©s par HCQ, 50Â % par corticoÃ¯des et 33Â % par immunosuppresseurs. Durant la pandÃ©mie, 85Â patients ont cessÃ© leur activitÃ© professionnelle (chÃ´mage technique n=55, licenciement n=30). Des difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res Ã©taient rapportÃ©es par 76Â patients (15,9Â %), avec une prÃ©dominance significative chez ceux ayant interrompu leur activitÃ© professionnelle (36,9Â % vs. 9,3Â %, p&lt;0,0001). Parmi les patients traitÃ©s par HCQ, 23,9Â % (92/385) ont eu des difficultÃ©s dâ€™accÃ¨s Ã  lâ€™HCQ responsable de son interruption chez 58Â patients (durÃ©e mÃ©diane de 7 [3-17] jours). Le stress perÃ§u Ã©tait important (PSS-10 =27/40) pour 11,8Â % des patients. Un syndrome anxieux ou dÃ©pressif Ã©tait dÃ©pistÃ© chez 47,6Â % et 41,5Â % des patients, respectivement. Des scores compatibles avec un Ã©tat de stress post-traumatique Ã©taient retrouvÃ©s chez 39Â % des patients. Le sexe fÃ©minin (OR=4,50Â [IC95Â %Â :1,28-15,8]), la prÃ©sence de difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res (OR=2,71 [1,30-5,6]) et dâ€™accÃ¨s Ã  lâ€™HCQ (OR=2,07 [1,16-3,69]) durant la pandÃ©mie Ã©taient significativement associÃ©es Ã  la prÃ©sence dâ€™un Ã©tat de stress post-traumatique. Conclusion La pandÃ©mie COVID-19Â a entraÃ®nÃ© de nombreuses difficultÃ©s aux patients atteints de LS, avec une forte prÃ©valence de troubles psychiques. Il sâ€™agissait en particulier de syndromes anxieux ou dÃ©pressif et des Ã©tats de stress post-traumatique associÃ©s Ã  des difficultÃ©s dâ€™accÃ¨s aux traitements ou des modifications de lâ€™activitÃ© professionnelle.","Scherlinger, M.; Zein, N.; Kleinmann, J.

"I'm alone but not lonely U-shaped pattern of self-perceived loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and Greece","Objectives In the past months, many countries have adopted varying degrees of lockdown restrictions to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. According to the existing literature, some consequences of lockdown restrictions on people's lives are beginning to emerge yet the evolution of such consequences in relation to the time spent in lockdown is understudied. To inform policies involving lockdown restrictions, this study adopted a data-driven Machine Learning approach to uncover the short-term time-related effects of lockdown on people's physical and mental health. Study design An online questionnaire was launched on 17 April 2020, distributed through convenience sampling and was self-completed by 2,276 people from 66 different countries. Methods Focusing on the UK sample (NÂ =Â 325), 12 aggregated variables representing the participant's living environment, physical and mental health were used to train a RandomForest model to estimate the week of survey completion. Results Using an index of importance, Self-Perceived Loneliness was identified as the most influential variable for estimating the time spent in lockdown. A significant U-shaped curve emerged for loneliness levels, with lower scores reported by participants who took part in the study during the 6th lockdown week (pÂ =Â 0.009). The same pattern was replicated in the Greek sample (NÂ =Â 137) for week 4 (pÂ =Â 0.012) and 6 (pÂ =Â 0.009) of lockdown. Conclusions From the trained Machine Learning model and the subsequent statistical analysis, Self-Perceived Loneliness varied across time in lockdown in the UK and Greek populations, with lower symptoms reported during the 4th and 6th lockdown weeks. This supports the dissociation between social support and loneliness, and suggests that social support strategies could be effective even in times of social isolation.","Carollo, Alessandro, Bizzego, Andrea, Gabrieli, Giulio, Wong, Keri Ka-Yee, Raine, Adrian, Esposito, Gianluca","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100219","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Public Health in Practice;: 100219, 2021.; Publication details: Public Health in Practice;: 100219, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23041,""
"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OF TWO ITALIAN HOSPITALS IN MILAN","During the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion in Italy, mental health care services continuity has been granted to the general population. Emergent and urgent conditions, however, are managed in collaboration with Emergency Departments (EDs). However, this collaboration may have suffered from the overload of the EDs due to the high number of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. In this perspective, we analysed the possible impact of COVID-19 on the EDs accesses of psychiatric patients in two of the main hospitals of Milan, the â€œLuigi Saccoâ€ Hospital and the â€œFatebenefratelliâ€ Hospital, comparing their admissions between the periods of March, April and May 2019 and 2020. We found a significant reduction in the number of evaluated patients in 2020 in both EDs. Emergency Medical Services (EMSs) brought a significant lower number of patients to the ED of Sacco Hospital during 2020, while this number increased for the ED of Fatebenefratelli Hospital, confirming the hypothesis that the overload of the Sacco Hospital ED significantly influenced the possibility to receive a psychiatric evaluation there. Moreover, we found a significant difference between diagnosis at discharge of the different samples.","Cafaro, Rita, Piccoli, Eleonora, Ferrara, Luca, Russo, Stefania, Dragogna, Filippo, ViganÃ², Caterina, Mencacci, Claudio, Dell'Osso, Bernardo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114303","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114303, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114303, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23042,""
"Mind the gap: Inequalities in mental health care and lack of social support in Parkinson disease","Inequalities in mental healthcare and lack of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic have lowered quality of life and increased overall burden of disease in people with Parkinson's (PWP). Although the pandemic has brought attention to these inequalities, they are long standing and will persist unless addressed. Lack of awareness of mental health issues is a major barrier and even when recognized disparities based on race, gender, and socioeconomic factors limit access to already scarce resources. Stigma regarding mental illness is highly prevalent and is a major barrier even when adequate care exists. Limited access to mental healthcare during the pandemic and in general increases the burden on caregivers and families. Historically, initiatives to improve mental healthcare for PWP focused on interventions designed for specialty and academic centers generally located in large metropolitan areas, which has created unintended geographic disparities in access. In order to address these issues this point of view suggests a community-based wellness model to extend the reach of mental healthcare resources for PWP.","Subramanian, Indu, Hinkle, Jared T.; Chaudhuri, K.

"A paradoxical psychological impact of COVID-19 among a sample of Italian adults with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder","Background Since February 2020, many governments of the world ordered strict social distancing rules to try to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, with a reported consequent increase in levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population. Aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the aforementioned psychiatric symptoms across a sample of individuals with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (HF-ASDs) with respect to a group of neurotypical adults (NA), during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Method 45 adults with HF-ASDs and 45 NA completed a structured online questionnaire, including;the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale â€“ 21 items (DASS-21);the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R);the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). We also explored some specific aspects of participantsâ€™ psychological well-being through an ad-hoc questionnaire. Results Subjects with HF-ASDs scored significantly higher than NA at the DASS-21, the IES-R Total Score and the PSS;NA reported a higher perceived change of their lifestyle during the lockdown than individuals with HF-ASDs, and subjects with HF-ASDs reported to feel more comfortable and less tired during the lockdown period, in relation to the social distancing measures adopted by Italian authorities. Conclusions Adults with HF-ASDs presented higher rates of depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD-related symptoms than NA during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic. However, they also reported to feel subjectively more comfortable and less tired during the lockdown than before, in relation to the social distancing measures.","NisticÃ², Veronica, Gambini, Orsola, Pizzi, Ludovica, Faggioli, Raffaella, Priori, Alberto, Demartini, Benedetta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2021.11.026","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Neuroscience;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Neuroscience;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23044,""
"Trends in Pharmacy-Based Dispensing of Buprenorphine, Extended-Release Naltrexone, and Naloxone During the COVID-19 Pandemic by Age and Sex â€“ United States, March 2019 â€“ December 2020","Background COVID-19 stay-at-home orders may reduce access to substance use treatment and naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug. The objective of this analysis was to compare monthly trends in pharmacy-based dispensing rates of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (buprenorphine and extended-release [ER] naltrexone) and naloxone in the United States during March 2019â€“December 2020 by age and sex. Methods We calculated monthly prescription dispensing rates per 100,000 persons using IQVIA New to Brand. We used Joinpoint regression to calculate monthly percent change in dispensing rates and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to examine differences in median monthly rates overall, and by age and sex between March 2019â€“December 2019 and March 2020â€“December 2020. Results Buprenorphine dispensing increased among those aged 40â€“64 years and =65 years from March 2019 to December 2020. Median rates of total ER naltrexone dispensing were lower in March 2020â€“December 2020 compared to March 2019â€“December 2019 for the total population, and for females and males. From March 2019 to December 2020, ER naltrexone dispensing decreased and naloxone dispensing increased for those aged 20â€“39 years. Conclusions Dispensing ER naltrexone declined during the study period. Given the increase in substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining equivalent access to MOUD may not be adequate to accommodate rising numbers of new patients with opioid use disorder. Access to all MOUD and naloxone could be further expanded to meet potential needs during and after the public health emergency, given their importance in preventing opioid overdose-related harms.","Cremer, Laura J.; Board, Amy, Guy, Gery, Schieber, Lyna, Asher, Alice, Parker, Erin M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109192","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109192, 2021.; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109192, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23045,""

"Work-Life Balance and Mental Health Needs of Health Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey","Health professionals constitute a group that is at a high risk of COVID-19. They have been found to experience difficulties in many issues, one of which is that they face the risk of infecting themselves and others due to interaction with high-risk patients. The present study investigates how demographical and individual factors and work addiction affected work-life balance and mental health needs of health professionals. The data of the present study were collected in the first wave of pandemic. The hypothesized structural equation model was rejected based on the fit indices. The second analysis of modified model was significant and indicated that whether health professionals live alone or with others such as family members had direct effects on work addiction, indirect effects on work-life balance, and needs for mental health. In addition, gender and working hours had direct effects on work-life balance. The highest effect on work-life balance was caused by work addiction. Moreover, work addiction had a moderate effect on mental health needs. As a result, the current study showed that work-life balance, work addiction, and the need for mental health were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Dispositional Gratitude Affects College Student Stress and Depression from COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediation through Coping","Although generally less at risk from adverse health effects of the COVID-19 virus compared to older adults, younger adults have been found to struggle with stress and mental health symptoms associated with the pandemic. Research has begun to shed light on resiliency factors that may point the way to effective prevention and intervention methods for responding to the ongoing mental health impact of the pandemic. Dispositional gratitude has been found to be associated with more adaptive and prosocial responses to the pandemic. There is also evidence that gratitude appraisals of the pandemic mediate the relationship between self-compassion and well-being. However, research has not investigated the relationship between dispositional gratitude and adverse mental health effects of the pandemic, along with mediators such as gratitude-based coping. This study assessed dispositional gratitude, pandemic stress exposure, use of general adaptive coping and gratitudebased coping (use of gratitude appraisals) during the pandemic, and levels of perceived stress and depressive symptoms in college students. Findings support a direct relationship between dispositional gratitude and lower perceived stress and depressive symptoms, as well as mediation through the use of adaptive coping and gratitude-based coping methods.

"Medical education versus exposure to SARS CoV-2: How is the achievement of doctor resident competence in the field of urogynecology?","The spread of SARS CoV-2 impacts medical education. Patients with urogynecological cases are mostly elderly patients who are at risk of exposure to the virus. This paper aims to review resident education in the urogynecology field during the pandemic and how residents can achieve appropriate competence. This study examines the views of several previous research articles and then compiled them into a narrative review. New recommendations such as services at health facilities, as well as scheduled visits or virtual services, have made an impact on reducing the number of cases, limited contact with patients, and virus exposure from practice locations, online learning, and the involvement of resident doctors in handling SARS CoV-2 case for other units. Resident doctors need to achieve competence to become professionals in their fields. What needs to be realized is that direct practice with patients, conducting examinations, making diagnoses, and providing therapy with real cases cannot be replaced with online learning. Medical education for residents must ensure safety in obtaining education and practice in the hospital to fulfill the task of caring for patients, access to mental health in a pandemic, and simulation-based training. All of these interventions are designed to ensure that the competence of graduates achieved before or during COVID-19 is the same: doctors who are professional and competent in their fields.

"Intervention to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress in mexican university students during the pandemic","Introduction: University students suffer psychological alterations during confinement due to COVID-19, that need to be addressed to in a timely manner to avoid further complications. Objective: Determine the effect of a brief online intervention to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Quasi-experimental-longitudinal design (pretest-posttest and one follow-up) of experimental and control group, 44 male and female university students between 18 and 24 years old were selected through a non-probabilistic intentional sampling, who answered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale in three times of evaluation. A brief online intervention based on psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral techniques was carried out to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress. Group data was analyzed with Friedman's non-parametric test and the clinical-objective-change was calculated individually. Results: There were no significant differences in the two groups at the three time of evaluation (x2r, gl = 2, p &gt; 0.05), but when analyzing the clinical-objective-change in the experimental group, it was determined that between the pretest-posttest and pretest-follow up, 40,7% y 37,0% of the participants, presented a positive clinical-objective-change in anxiety. For depression, was also positive in 25,9% y 18,5%, and in stress was of 11,1% y 33,3%, we can appreciate in this last variable an increase in the studentÂ´s percentage with a positive change through time.

"Disordered eating and self-harm as risk factors for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A UK-based birth cohort study","BACKGROUND: Young adults and especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions, such as disordered eating and self-harm, appear to be at greater risk of developing metal health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether this increased risk is affected by any changes in lockdown restrictions, and whether any lifestyle changes could moderate this increased risk. METHODS: In a longitudinal UK-based birth cohort (The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC) we assessed the relationship between pre-pandemic measures of disordered eating and self-harm and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2,657 young adults. Regression models examined the relationship between self-reported disordered eating, self-harm, and both disordered eating and self-harm at age 25 years and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and mental wellbeing during a period of eased restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020) when participants were aged 27-29 years. Analyses were adjusted for sex, questionnaire completion date, pre-pandemic socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-pandemic mental health and wellbeing. We also examined whether lifestyle changes (sleep, exercise, alcohol, visiting green space, eating, talking with family/friends, hobbies, relaxation) in the initial UK lockdown (April-May 2020) moderated these associations. RESULTS: Pre-existing disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were all associated with the reporting of a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and poorer mental wellbeing during the pandemic compared to individuals without disordered eating and self-harm. Associations remained when adjusting for pre-pandemic mental health measures. There was little evidence that interactions between disordered eating and self-harm exposures and lifestyle change moderators affected pandemic mental health and wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with pre-pandemic disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were at increased risk for developing symptoms of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when accounting for pre-pandemic mental health. Lifestyle changes during the pandemic do not appear to alter this risk. A greater focus on rapid and responsive service provision is essential to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of these already vulnerable individuals.","Warne, N.; Heron, J.; Mars, B.; Kwong, A.

"Relating psychiatric symptoms and self-regulation during the COVID-19 crisis","Disruptions of self-regulation are a hallmark of numerous psychiatric disorders. Here, we examine the relationship between transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology and changes in self-regulation in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data-driven approach on a large number of cognitive tasks and self-reported surveys in training datasets. Then we derived measures of self-regulation and psychiatric functioning in an independent population sample (N = 102) tested both before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the restrictions in place represented a threat to mental health and forced people to flexibly adjust to modifications of daily routines. We found independent relationships between transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology and longitudinal alterations in specific domains of self-regulation defined using the drift diffusion model. Compared to the period preceding the onset of the pandemic, a symptom dimension related to anxiety and depression was characterized by a more cautious behavior, indexed by the need to accumulate more evidence before making a decision. Instead, social-withdrawal related to faster non-decision processes. Self-reported measures of self-regulation predicted variance in psychiatric symptoms both concurrently and prospectively, revealing the psychological dimensions relevant for separate transdiagnostic dimensions of psychiatry, but tasks did not. Taken together, our study shows that self-regulation can be affected depending on the interaction between external events and trait-like vulnerabilities and suggests that the study of cognition needs to take into account the dynamic nature of real-world events as well as within-subject variability over time.","Vaghi, Matilde, Hagen, McKenzie Paige, Jones, Henry Morrow, Mumford, Jeanette, Bissett, Patrick, Poldrack, Russell","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/af892","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23057,""
"A genome-wide association study of COVID-19 related hospitalization in Spain reveals genetic disparities among sexes (preprint)","We describe the results of the Spanish Coalition to Unlock Research on Host Genetics on COVID-19 (SCOURGE). In sex-disaggregated genome-wide studies of COVID-19 hospitalization, we found two known loci associated among males (SLC6A20-LZTFL1 and IFNAR2), and a novel one among females (TLE1). Meta-analyses with independent studies revealed two novel associations (AQP3 and ARHGAP33) and replicated ELF5. A genetic risk score predicted COVID-19 severity, especially among younger males. We found less SNP-heritability and larger heritability differences by age (&lt;60/=60 years) among males than females.

"Healthcare workersâ€™ heterogeneous mental-health responses to prolonging Covid-19 pandemic: A full year of monthly follow up in Finland (preprint)","Purpose: To investigate changes in healthcare workersâ€™ mental-health under prolonging Covid-19 pandemic conditions. Methods: A monthly survey over a full year was conducted for employees of the HUS Helsinki University Hospital (n = 4804) between 4th June 2020 to 28th May 2021. Pandemic-related potentially traumatic events (PTEs), work characteristics (e.g., contact to Covid-19 patients), and other covariates were used to predict Mental Health Index-5 (MHI-5) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in generalized multilevel and latent-class mixed model regressions. Results: Local Covid-19 log-incidence (odds ratio, OR = 1.21, with 95% CI = 1.10â€“1.60), directly caring for Covid-19 patients (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.10â€“1.60) and PTEs (OR = 4.57, CI = 3.85â€“5.43) were all independently associated with low mental health, when (additionally) adjusting for age, sex, profession, and calendar time (a 5th degree polynomial expansion). Independence from time suggests effects of incidence change in time. Effects of local Covid-19 incidence on sleep were fully dependent on time. Latent mental-health trajectories were characterized by a large class of â€œstable mental healthâ€ and minority classes for â€œearly shock, improvingâ€ and â€œearly resilience, deterioratingâ€ mental health. The minority classes, especially â€œearly shock, improvingâ€, were more likely to live alone and be exposed to PTEs than others. Conclusion: Healthcare workers face increasingly heterogeneous mental-health challenges as the Covid-19 pandemic prolongs. Adversity and mental ill-being may accumulate in some employees. More research is needed on the factors affecting employeesâ€™ resilience to the prolonging pandemic. Living arrangements may play a role.","RosenstrÃ¶m, Tom, Tuisku, Katinka, Suvisaari, Jaana, Pukkala, Eero, Junttila, Kristiina, Haravuori, Henna, Elovainio, Marko, Haapa, Toni, JylhÃ¤, Pekka, Laukkala, Tanja","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/59h2j","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23059,""
"Exploring negative affect dynamics in high resolution: within-person relationship of inertia and instability with depression is mediated by affect intensity","Background: Temporal patterns of affective functioning such as emotional inertia and instability may indicate changes in emotion regulation that predict depression. However, affect dynamicsâ€™ incremental validity over affect intensity and exposure to stressors in predicting depression has been questioned. Methods: We collected longitudinal data regarding momentary affective states (measured multiple times a day), perceived stressors and depressive symptoms (measured every three days) from a general population sample during the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s first wave in Hungary. The final dataset included 7165 affective states surveys from 125 participants, which were aggregated in 464 three-day measurement windows. Using multilevel models, we explored the unique effects of within-person changes in mean level, inertia, and instability of negative affective states (NA), and stressor-exposure on two domains of depression (anhedonia and negative mood and thoughts) within the three-day windows. Results: Within-person increases in NA inertia and NA instability showed significant positive associations with negative mood and thoughts. These effects did not remain significant after adjusting for mean levels of NA. Multilevel mediation analysis revealed that within individuals, NA inertia and instability indirectly predicted negative mood and thoughts through elevated NA mean.Limitations: The application of self-report questionnaires might bias the results, and the overrepresentation of female participants could limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Specific patterns of temporal affective functioning are indirect predictors of depressive symptoms at the within-individual level. Our findings may facilitate automated depression risk assessment on the basis of simple affective time series.","RÃ³nai, Levente, Polner, Bertalan","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/he53c","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23060,""
"The Failures of an Ideal COVID-19 Vaccine: A Simulation Study (preprint)","This paper simulates an ideal COVID-19 vaccine that confers immediate sterilizing immunity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants. The purpose was to explore how well this ideal vaccine could protect a population against common conditions (such as vaccine hesitancy) that might impair vaccine effectiveness. Simulations were done with an SEIRS spreadsheet model that ran two parallel subpopulations: one that accepted vaccination, and another that refused it. The two subpopulations could transmit infections to one another. Success was judged by the rate of new cases in the period from 1-5 years after the introduction of the vaccine. Under good conditions, including a small subpopulation that refused vaccination, rapid distribution of the vaccine, duration of vaccinal immunity longer than 12 months, good retention of interest in getting vaccinated after the first year, strict maintenance of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as masking, and new variants with R0s less than 4.0, the vaccine was able to end the epidemic. With violation of these conditions, the post-vaccine era futures ranged from endemic COVID at a low or medium level to rates of COVID cases worse than anything seen in the US up to late 2021. The most important conditions for keeping case rates low were a fast speed of vaccine distribution, a low percentage of the population that refuses vaccination, a long duration of vaccinal immunity, and continuing maintenance of NPIs after vaccination began. On the other hand, a short duration of vaccinal immunity, abandonment of NPIs, and new variants with a high R0 were powerful barriers to disease control. New variants with high R0s were particularly damaging, producing high case rates except when vaccination speed was unrealistically rapid. A recurring finding was that most disease afflicting the vaccinated population in these simulations originated in the unvaccinated population, and cutting off interaction with the unvaccinated population caused a sharp drop in the case rate of the vaccinated population. In conclusion, multiple common conditions can compromise the effectiveness of even an ideal vaccine.","Kosinski, Robert Joseph","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.22.21266669","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23061,""
"Patient experience with healthcare: Feedback for a Post COVID-19 clinic at a tertiary care center in rural area (preprint)","Purpose:  Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection(PASC) is a complex condition with multi-system involvement. We assessed patients perspectives and experience with a PASC clinic established at University of Iowa in June 2020. Methods: We conducted a mixed-method survey in June 2021 to ask PASC clinic patients about 1) PASC symptoms and their impact on physical and mental health, and cognition using the PROMIS Global Health and Cognitive Function abilities items, and 2) satisfaction with clinic services and referrals, barriers to care, and recommended support resources. Findings: Ninety-seven patients (97/277, 35% response rate) completed the survey. Most were women(67%, n=65/97), Caucasian(93%, n=90/97) and received outpatient care during acute COVID-19 illness (79%). Fifty percent reported wait time of 1-3 months and 40% traveled &gt;1 hour for the appointment at PASC clinic. The most common symptoms &gt;3 months from initial infection were fatigue (77%), brain fog (73%), exercise intolerance (73%), anxiety (63%), sleep difficulties (56%) and depression (44%). A minority of patients reported significantly reduced functioning (=1.5 SD below mean) of their physical health (22.5%), mental health (15.9%) and cognitive abilities (17.6%). Qualitative analysis of open-ended answers added valuable context to quantitative results. Satisfaction with clinical services was high though participants identified barriers to care including scheduling delays and financial concerns. Respondents suggested potential strategies for optimizing recovery including continuity of care, a co-located multispecialty clinic and being provided with timely information from emerging research. Conclusion: Our study reports high PASC symptom burden, its impact on health and patient experience with healthcare. It is important that primary healthcare professionals listen to patients with empathy and support them during recovery. Healthcare systems and policymakers should focus on accessible, comprehensive, and patient-centered integrated care.","Garg, Alpana, Subramain, Maran, Barlow, Patrick, Garvin, Lauren, Hoth, Karin, Dukes, Kimberly, Hoffman, Richard, Comellas, Alejandro","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.20.21266640","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23062,""
"Experiences of staff providing specialist palliative care during COVID-19: A multiple qualitative case study (preprint)","Objectives:  To explore the experiences of, and impact on, staff working in palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative multiple case study using semi-structured interviews between November 2020 and April 2021 as part of the CovPall study. Data were analysed using thematic framework analysis. Setting: Organisations providing specialist palliative services in any setting. Participants: Staff working in specialist palliative care, purposefully sampled by the criteria of role, care setting and COVID-19 experience. Main outcome measures: Experiences of working in palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Five cases and 24 participants were recruited (n=12 nurses, 4 clinical managers, 4 doctors, 2 senior managers, 1 healthcare assistant, 1 allied healthcare professional). Central themes demonstrate how infection control constraints prohibited and diluted participants ability to provide care that reflected their core values, resulting in experiences of moral distress. Despite organisational, team, and individual support strategies, continually managing these constraints led to a crescendo effect in which the impacts of moral distress accumulated over time, sometimes leading to burnout. Solidarity with colleagues and making a valued contribution provided moral comfort for some. Conclusions: This study provides a unique insight into why and how healthcare staff have experienced moral distress during the pandemic, and how organisations have responded. Despite their experience of dealing with death and dying, the mental health and well-being of palliative care staff was affected by the pandemic.

"An exploratory study of social media users' engagement with COVID-19 vaccine-related content","Background: Facebook, as the world's most popular social media platform, has been playing various important roles throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing users to produce and share health-related information that both eases and complicates public health communication. However, the characteristics of vaccine-related Facebook content and users' reaction to the vaccine issue has been an unexplored area to date. Methods: To fill the previous knowledge-gap, this exploratory study wants to understand the communication climate of Facebook on the COVID-19 vaccine issue, including the nature of dominant content and users' engagement patterns with them. Therefore, the study analyzes the 10,000 most popular Facebook posts with the highest interactions on the vaccine issue. Results: The results show that Facebook users prioritize more vaccine-related news links (71.22%) over other content. The declining interactions on the issue suggests that interaction growth mainly depends on positive news on the vaccine. Finally, users' reaction to the vaccine issue is dominantly positive, though they may show a highly negative attitude toward vaccine misinformation. Conclusions: A few limitations and strengths of this study are discussed along with values and implications. This study for the first time analyzes Bangla language-based Facebook content related to the COVID-19 vaccine issue, which is largely overlooked in global academic research.","Al-Zaman, M.

"Clinical Utility of COVID-19 Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing of Ocular Tissues of Non-COVID-19 Cornea Donors Deemed Suitable for Corneal Retrieval and Transplantation","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human postmortem ocular tissues of asymptomatic donors and its implications on our eye banking protocols. The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in corneal rims and conjunctival tissues from 100 donors who were found suitable for transplantation as per the donor screening guidelines of the Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations. The donor's clinical history and cause of death were assessed for secondary analysis. Of 200 ocular tissues (100 corneal and 100 conjunctival) from the same 1 eye of 100 surgical-intended donors, between September 2020 and April 2021, the overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was ~1% (2/200). Both the ocular samples that tested positive were conjunctival biopsies (2/100, 2%), whereas corneal samples were negative (0/100, 0%) in both donors. The causes of donor death were trauma in 51 donors, suicide in 33, cardiac arrest in 7, electric shock in 5, metabolic cause in 2, malignancy in 1, and snake bite in 1. None of the donors had a medical history suggestive of COVID infection or possible contact. None of the recipients from the donors were reported to have any systemic adverse event after keratoplasty until the follow-up of 6 weeks. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 1% (2% for conjunctival and 0% for corneal samples, P value = 0.5) in the donors who were found suitable for cornea recovery and transplantation. The findings of exceptionally low positive rates in our samples validate the criticality of history-based donor screening and do not support the necessity of postmortem PCR testing as a criterion for procurement and subsequent use for corneal transplantation.","Chaurasia, Rudraprasad, Senagari, Reddy, Kandhibanda, Mohamed, Basu, Garg, Joseph","https://doi.org/10.1097/ICO.0000000000002874","20211201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23065,""
"Managing the Digital Disruption Associated with COVID-19-Driven Rapid Digital Transformation in Brisbane, Australia","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The COVID-19 pandemic has forced rapid digital transformation of many health systems. These innovations are now entering the literature, but there is little focus on the resulting disruption. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’We describe the implementation of digital innovations during the COVID-19 response of Australia's largest health service, Metro North (in Brisbane, Queensland), the challenges of the subsequent digital disruption, how these were managed, and lessons learned. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian state of Queensland created the Queensland Digital Clinical Charter, which provides guidance for the development of digital health programs. The guidelines utilize three horizons: digitizing workflows, leveraging digital data to transform clinical care, and reimagining new and innovative models of care. The technical response to COVID-19 in Metro North is described across these horizons. The rapid digital response caused significant disruption to health care delivery; management of the disruption and the outcomes are detailed. This is a participatory action research project, with members of the research team assisting with leading the implementation project informing the case report content. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Several digital innovations were introduced across Metro North during the COVID-19 response. This resulted in significant disruption creating digital hypervigilance, digital deceleration, data discordance, and postdigital ""depression."" Successful management of the digital disruption minimized the negative effects of rapid digital transformation, and contributed to the effective management of the pandemic in Queensland. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The rapid digital transformation in Metro North during COVID-19 was successful in several aspects; however, ongoing challenges remain. These include the need to improve data sharing and increase interoperability. Importantly, the innovations need to be evaluated to ensure that Metro North can capitalize on these changes and incorporate them into long-term routine practice. Moving forward, it will be essential to manage not only the pandemic, but increasingly, the resultant digital disruption.","Dyda, Fahim, Fraser, Kirrane, Wong, McNeil, Ruge, Lau, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1740190","20211201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23066,""
"Web-based exercise interventions for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials","The number of people suffering from depression and/or anxiety has increased steadily due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this context, web-based exercise interventions have emerged as a potential treatment strategy. The objective of this study was to synthetize evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effects of web-based exercise interventions on patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Six databases were searched (Cochrane Library, EBSCO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science), and eligible articles were identified according to a PICOS inclusion-exclusion approach (participants with depressive or anxiety disorders; web-based exercise interventions; active or passive control group; assessment of changes in depressive or anxiety disorders; randomized design). Primary outcomes were depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. The quality of evidence was assessed with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Of 7,846 search results, three studies met the inclusion criteria (172 participants between 18 and 65 years of age, 95.9% women). The web-based exercise interventions lasted 8-12 weeks and involved endurance training, yoga, or combined endurance and strength training. The comparators involved non-exercise controls or active controls. Compliance rates were low. Web-based exercise interventions were not superior to controls regarding anxiety symptoms, and only one study found benefits for depressive symptoms (p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05). The quality of the cumulative evidence was low. The available data regarding the effects of web-based exercise interventions on depression and/or anxiety symptoms is scarce, the risk of bias is high, and the quality of the cumulative results is low.

"The Polish COVID Stress Scales: Considerations of psychometric functioning, measurement invariance, and validity","The COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were developed to measure stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To further investigate the psychometric properties of the CSS, we used data collected in Poland across two waves of assessment (N = 556 at T1 and N = 264 at T2) to evaluate the factor structure, reliability (at the item and scale level), measurement invariance (across the Polish and Dutch translations of the CSS, and time), over time stability, and external associations of the Polish-language version of the CSS (CSS-PL). Overall, results suggest that the CSS-PL is psychometrically robust, largely invariant across the countries and time-lags considered. The CSS-PL was also positively related to other measures of COVID-19 fear, health anxiety, obsessive compulsive symptoms, anxiety, depression, and intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This study thus provides considerable information about the CSS's items and scales, and lays the foundation for future investigations into COVID stress across time and different populations.","Adamczyk, Clark, Pradelok","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260459","20211201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23068,""
"Preoperative and Postoperative Opioid Prescription Rates in the Total Hip Replacement Surgical Patient","The United States is facing an opioid epidemic that has only worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little evidence regarding patterns of opioid use among patients with total hip replacement (THR). Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put forward guidelines for prescribing opioids, it does not include guidance specifically for THR patients suffering from presurgical and postsurgical pain. The purpose of this study was to (1) compare presurgical and postsurgical opioid rates, (2) compare presurgical and postsurgical morphine milligram equivalents (MME), and (3) determine whether having a presurgical opioid prescription predicts the receipt of postsurgical opioid prescriptions among patients undergoing THR surgery. Retrospective cohort analysis of 4,405 patients undergoing THR at a major academic medical center in the United States from April 30, 2015, to April 30, 2018, was done. Patient characteristics, opioid rates, and average MME/day/person were described. Logistic regression was used to determine whether presurgical opioid prescription and opioid risk level predicted postsurgical opioid prescribing. Median age was 64 years (range = 18-85 years); patients were primarily Caucasian/White (78.8%) and female (54.7%). Opioid prescription rates in this sample for the 12-month presurgical and postsurgical periods were 66.1% and 95.6%, respectively. Oxycodone was the most common opioid prescribed in both periods. Among those prescribed an opioid, moderate/high risk for overdose and/or death was 6.3% presurgery and 19.8% postsurgery. Patients with a comorbidity were two times more likely to receive an opioid prescription in the postsurgical period. The median average MME/day/person was 26.5 (range = 0.3-180.0) for patients with an opioid prescribed during the presurgery period and 40.4 (range = 1.5-270.0) during the postsurgery period. Opioid use, regardless of strength, in the presurgical period as well as having one or more comorbidities predicted opioid use in the postsurgical period.","Schmidt, Shrian-Chang, Silva, Goode, Horn, Cary","https://doi.org/10.1097/NOR.0000000000000808","20211201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23069,""

"Additively manufactured nano-mechanical energy harvesting systems: advancements, potential applications, challenges and future perspectives","Additively manufactured nano-MEH systems are widely used to harvest energy from renewable and sustainable energy sources such as wind, ocean, sunlight, raindrops, and ambient vibrations. A comprehensive study focusing on in-depth technology evolution, applications, problems, and future trends of specifically 3D printed nano-MEH systems with an energy point of view is rarely conducted. Therefore, this paper looks into the state-of-the-art technologies, energy harvesting sources/methods, performance, implementations, emerging applications, potential challenges, and future perspectives of additively manufactured nano-mechanical energy harvesting (3DP-NMEH) systems. The prevailing challenges concerning renewable energy harvesting capacities, optimal energy scavenging, power management, material functionalization, sustainable prototyping strategies, new materials, commercialization, and hybridization are discussed. A novel solution is proposed for renewable energy generation and medicinal purposes based on the sustainable utilization of recyclable municipal and medical waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, recommendations for future research are presented concerning the cutting-edge issues hurdling the optimal exploitation of renewable energy resources through NMEHs. China and the USA are the most significant leading forces in enhancing 3DP-NMEH technology, with more than 75% contributions collectively. The reported output energy capacities of additively manufactured nano-MEH systems were 0.5-32 mW, 0.0002-45.6 mW, and 0.3-4.67 mW for electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and triboelectric nanogenerators, respectively. The optimal strategies and techniques to enhance these energy capacities are compiled in this paper.","Ahmed, Azam, Wang, Zhang, Li, Jia, Mushtaq, Rehman, Gueye, Shahid, Wajid","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40580-021-00289-0","20211201","3D printing; Challenges; Energy harvesting; Nano-energy; Renewable energy; Sustainability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23071,""
"Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Children with Cardiac Rhythm Management Devices","Decreased physical activity is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic and mental health disease. While decreases in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic have been described in the general population, there is a paucity of data regarding children with underlying cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized there would be a decrease in physical activity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study of children agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°19Ã‚Â years with cardiac rhythm management devices. Patients were included if they had device-measured physical activity data fromÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°80% of dates from February 3, 2020 through June 30, 2020. Patients with significant neurologic/neuromuscular disease were excluded. We identified 144 patients with a median age of 15.4Ã‚Â years. 47% were female. 34% had congenital heart disease, 20% had cardiomyopathy, 19% had an inherited arrhythmia syndrome and 5% had atrioventricular block without congenital heart disease. 47% of patients had an implantable loop recorder, 29% had a permanent pacemaker and 24% had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. We observed a significant decrease in device-measured physical activity from baseline (February 3-March 9), with up to a 21% decrease in physical activity during mid-March through early May. Activity levels returned to pre-pandemic levels in June. Physical activity sharply declined in children with cardiac rhythm management devices at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These data highlight the importance of finding strategies to maintain physical activity during the current pandemic and future public health crises.","Przybylski, Craig, Lippmann, Mah, Shafer, Gauthier, de Ferranti, Triedman, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-021-02787-8","20211201","Congenital heart disease; Obesity; Pediatrics; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23072,""
"A longitudinal investigation of COVID-19 pandemic experiences and mental health among university students","Previous studies have established a link between the COVID-19 pandemic and poor mental health. They further suggest that young adults may be especially vulnerable to worsened mental health during the pandemic, but few studies have investigated which specific aspects of the COVID-19 experience affect psychological well-being over time. To better understand concrete predictors of poor mental health outcomes in this population, we identified several pandemic-related experiences and evaluated their effects on mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol, and substance use) in a sample of U.S. college students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°176). Both mental health symptoms and pandemic-related experiences were evaluated at the start of quarantine (March/April 2020, Time 1) and the end of the Spring 2020 semester (May 2020, Time 2). Given the limited literature on specific predictors of mental health during a pandemic, we used elastic net regression, a novel analytic method that helps with variable selection when theoretical background is limited, to narrow our field of possible predictors. While mental health symptoms were elevated at both timepoints, there were no clinically significant changes from Time 1 to Time 2 and few differences between sociodemographic groups. Both disruption due to the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.25, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.021) and limited confidence in the federal government's response (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.14, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.038) were significant predictors of depression symptoms at the end of the semester, even when controlling for baseline depression. Further, predictions that the pandemic would continue to impact daily life further into the future were linked with pandemic stress response symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.15, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.032) at Time 2, beyond the effects of baseline symptoms. Alcohol (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.22, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.024) and substance use (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.26, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) were associated with reduced adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. Our findings indicate that specific aspects of the pandemic experience may be influencing internalizing symptoms and alcohol/substance use in college students, pointing to potential avenues for targeted support and intervention. A range of factors may influence university student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who expect the pandemic will continue to impact daily life further into the future maybe more likely to report stress symptoms. Disruption due to the pandemic and limited confidence in the federal government's response may be associated with depression symptoms. Alcohol and substance use are associated with lower COVID-19 guideline adherence in university students.","Stamatis, Broos, Hudiburgh, Dale, Timpano","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12351","20211201","COVID-19; alcohol use; anxiety; depression; elastic net regression; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23073,""
"Loneliness, sadness, and feelings of social disconnection in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Public health measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic have led to feelings of loneliness among older adults, which, prior to COVID, has been associated with subsequent morbidity and mortality. We sought to identify differences in feelings of loneliness, sadness, and social disconnection early in the pandemic across racial groups, and possible mitigating factors. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using the weighted nationally-representative Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey COVID-19 supplement, collected summer 2020. We included all Medicare beneficiaries over 65 who did not respond by proxy. We examined changes in loneliness, sadness, or feelings of social disconnection. Multivariable logistic regression models accounted for sociodemographic variables, access to primary care and the internet, and history of depression or dementia. Among 8125 beneficiaries, representative of 43.7 million Medicare beneficiaries, 22.6% reported loneliness or sadness, and 37.1% feeling socially disconnected. In fully-adjusted models, Hispanic/Latinx beneficiaries were most likely to report loneliness or sadness (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.3, CI: 1.02-1.65; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02) and Black beneficiaries were least likely to report feeling socially disconnected (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.55; CI: 0.42-0.73; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Internet access was associated with increased odds of both (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.29, 95 CI: 1.07-1.56; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009; and ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.42, 95 CI: 1.24-1.63; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, respectively). Access to primary care was associated with lower odds of both (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.77, 95 CI: 0.61-0.96; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02; and ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.72, 95 CI: 0.61-0.87; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Loneliness, sadness, and feelings of social disconnection were common among older Medicare beneficiaries early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences by race/ethnicity may be driven by different living structures and social networks, and warrant further study. Policy makers and clinicians should consider facilitating connection by phone or in person, as internet access did not diminish feelings of loneliness, particularly for those living alone. Access to primary care, and tools for clinicians to address loneliness should be prioritized. This article is protected by copyright.

"Bearing a Disproportionate Burden: Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Experiences of US-Based Social Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","While social workers have served as frontline workers responding to the needs of vulnerable populations during COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about how social work professionals themselves have been impacted. This article explored the impact of COVID-19 on social work professionals' mental health, physical health, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE). This was a cross-sectional web-based survey of social workers practicing in the United States (N = 3,118); data on demographic and workplace characteristics, physical and mental health, and safety concerns were collected between June and August of 2020. Univariate statistics were used to characterize the sample. Ordinal logistic and multinomial regression were used to achieve the research aims. The majority of participants reported either moderate or severe concerns related to mental (55 percent) and physical (55 percent) health; 36 percent of respondents indicated concerns about PPE access. Respondents' concerns differed by demographic (e.g., race, age) and workplace characteristics (e.g., setting, role, region). Social workers of color are experiencing COVID-19-related concerns of significantly greater severity relative to their White counterparts. Findings highlight an immediate need to deepen understanding of the factors that contribute to these trends and identify mechanisms to support the frontline social work workforce most impacted.","Ross, Cederbaum, de Saxe Zerden, Zelnick, Ruth, Guan","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swab050","20211201","COVID-19; quantitative methods; social work practice; social worker stress; workplace safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23076,""
"Acute and persistent symptoms in children with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to test-negative children in England: active, prospective, national surveillance","Most children recover quickly after COVID-19, but some may have on-going symptoms. Follow-up studies have been limited by small sample sizes and lack of appropriate controls. We used national testing data to identify children aged 2-16 years with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test during 01-07 January 2021 and randomly selected1,500 PCR-positive cases and 1,500 matched PCR-negative controls. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire about the acute illness and pre-specified neurological, dermatological, sensory, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, mental health (including emotional and behavioural well-being) and other symptoms experienced at least five times at one month after the PCR test. Overall, 35.0% (859/2456) completed the questionnaire, including 38.0% (472/1242) cases and 32% (387/1214) controls. of whom 68% (320/472) and 40% (154/387) were symptomatic, respectively. The most prevalent acute symptoms were cough (249 /859, 29.0%), fever (236/859, 27.5%), headache (236/859, 27.4%) and fatigue (231/859, 26.9%). One month later, 21/320 (6.7%) of symptomatic cases and 6/154 (4.2%) of symptomatic controls (p=0.24) experienced on-going symptoms. Of the 65 on-going symptoms solicited, three clusters were significantly (p&lt;0.05) more common, albeit at low prevalence, among symptomatic cases (3-7%) than symptomatic controls (0-3: neurological, sensory and emotional and behavioural wellbeing. Mental health symptoms were reported by all groups but more frequently among symptomatic cases than symptomatic controls or asymptomatic children. Children with symptomatic COVID-19 had a slightly higher prevalence of on-going symptoms than symptomatic controls, and not as high as previously reported.

"Hippocampal-Prefrontal Connectivity Prior to COVID-19 Pandemic Predicts Stress Reactivity","By adolescence, foundational cognitive and affective neurobehavioral processes specialize based on environmental demands, such as stress, to determine the basis of adult trajectories. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress for everyone, particularly adolescents who face unique stressors such as restrictions in socialization and education. However, variability in brain processes supporting stress reactivity is not well understood. Here, we leverage pre-pandemic brain development studies to identify how maturity of prefrontal connectivity with the amygdala and hippocampus (HPC) is associated with response to COVID-19. We hypothesized that age-related changes in connectivity of affective and cognitive brain systems may underlie the emotional response of adolescents during the pandemic. In this study, 10- to 31-year-old participants (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â = 111) completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans prior to the pandemic and then completed a questionnaire 9 months into the pandemic measuring worry, COVID-related stress, sadness, perceived stress, and positive affect. Associations between pairwise functional connectivity of HPC/amygdala subregions with prefrontal cortex subdivisions and affective reactivity during the pandemic were examined. Regression analyses indicated that both worry and COVID-19-related stress increased with age (false discovery rate-corrected <i>p</i> &lt; .05). Furthermore, greater connectivity between the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior HPC was associated with greater worry and COVID-19-related stress (<i>p</i> &lt; .05 corrected), which was primarily driven by individuals younger than 18 years. Taken together, our results indicate that increases in stress reactivity to the COVID-19 pandemic across the transition to adulthood are driven by maturation of posterior HPC-ventromedial prefrontal cortex coupling, which integrates stress response and emotional memory processing.","Perica, Ravindranath, Calabro, Foran, Luna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.06.010","20211201","Adolescence; COVID-19; Connectivity; Development; Stress; fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23078,""
"Mental well-being among patients with congenital heart disease and heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic","Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) show increasing survival. We evaluated the influence of COVID-19 confinement on the mental well-being of patients with CHD. Descriptive, cross-sectional, observational epidemiological study in a cohort of 242 patients with CHD over 14 years old recruited consecutively from a single adolescent and adult CHD outpatient unit. Patients were sent an online questionnaire to determine clinical, demographic and the 12-element general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) data during the COVID-19 quarantine. 242 out of 407 (59%) patients with CHD, to whom the questionnaire was sent, responded to the survey. 98 (42%) patients were between 14 and 24 years old and 133 (58%) were over 25 years old. Of the total, 119 (51%) were male. 123 (51%), 88 (36%) and 31 (13%) patients with CHD had mild, moderate, and severe anatomical complexity respectively. 11 (4.5%) out of 242 patients with CC presented heart failure (HF) symptoms, requiring 18% of them admission to the hospital emergency department during the pandemic (P=0.002). In relation to the GHQ-12 questionnaire, patients with CHD and HF enjoyed less their daily activities (81% vs. 51%, P=0.043) and had less self-confidence (46% vs. 18%, P=0.041) than those without HF symptoms.

"Nature in virtual reality improves mood and reduces stress: evidence from young adults and senior citizens","Large populations worldwide have been deprived from nature experiences due to mass quarantines and lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, and face a looming mental health crisis. Virtual reality offers a safe and practical solution to increase nature exposure. This research examined the effects of virtual nature using a within-subject design with young adults (Study 1) and senior citizens (Study 2).

"Inflation Targeting Model in Macroeconomics","Empirical targeting by lowering inflation to the marginal level that causes monetary deflation and transition to depression is shown to increase the growth of the real GDP, while increasing inflation from the marginal level reduces the growth of the real GDP. The inflation is determined according to the theory of reproduction of the national economy by the mathematical function of the amount of money in circulation, foreign currency cash, interest rate, the cost of the utilized in production capital, the production input-output coefficient, and the unemployment rate. A model for regulating the economy by inflation targeting is developed, which allows the Central Bank of Ukraine to determine the target indicators for the period under consideration based on the statistical indicators of the previous period and through the nomogram of the inflation function of its arguments. The growth of the Ukrainian economy was modeled with an inflation target of four percent in 2021-2023 after the recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic.","Iefymenko, Dunaev, Lyubich","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10559-021-00422-1","20211201","capital; crisis; depression; equilibrium; exchange rate; inflation; interest rate; labor; macroeconomics; market; money; regulation; targeting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23081,""

Coronavirus stress and COVID-19 burnout were positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress and negatively related to resilience. The coronavirus stress and COVID-19 burnout were correlated with elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress over and beyond resilience, age, and gender. Findings suggest that the Polish versions of the CSM and the COVID-19-BS are valid scales to measure stress and burnout related to COVID-19.

"Socioeconomic inequality in mental well-being associated with COVID-19 containment measures in a low-incidence Asian globalized city","The COVID-19 pandemic exposes and amplifies pre-existing inequalities even in places with relatively well-controlled outbreaks such as Hong Kong. This study aimed to explore whether the socioeconomically disadvantaged fare worse via various types of worry in terms of their mental health and well-being. Between September and October 2020, 1067 adults in Hong Kong were recruited via a cross-sectional population-wide telephone survey. The inter-relationship between deprivation, types of worry, mental health disorders, and subjective well-being was assessed using structural equation modelling. Results showed significant total effects of deprivation on worries about being infected (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), economic activities and livelihood (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and personal savings (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), as well as mental health disorders (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and subjective well-being (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Specifically, worry about economic activities and livelihood partly mediated the total effect of deprivation on mental health disorders (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), whereas worry about personal savings and worry about economic activities and livelihood partially mediated the total effect of deprivation on subjective well-being (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007 and 0.002, respectively). Socioeconomic inequality, particularly in mental health and well-being, could be exacerbated via people's economic concerns during the pandemic, which was largely induced by the COVID-19 containment measures rather than the pandemic per se given the relatively low COVID-19 incidence in Hong Kong.","Chung, Chung, Chan, Chan, Wong, Yeoh, Allen, Woo, Marmot","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02342-8","20211201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23084,""

Anonymous online survey adapted from a similar study conducted during the SARS epidemic, disseminated from July 2020 to August 2020. Nine healthcare institutions across Singapore ranging from primary care, community care, tertiary care and specialised referral centres. Employees working in the participating healthcare institutions. Of 3828 survey returns, 3616 had at least one completed item on the questionnaire. Majority were female (74.7%), nurses (51.7%), foreign-born (53.2%) and not working in the tertiary care setting (52.1%). The median score on the Impact of Events Scale (IES) was 15 (IQR 23) and 28.2% of the sample scored in the moderate/severe range. 22.7% of the participants were also HCWs during SARS and more than half of them felt safer and better equipped in the current pandemic. 25.2% of SARS HCWs and 25.9% of non-SARS HCWs had moderate/severe IES scores (p=0.904). After adjusting for age, marital status, parity and length of work experience, racial minority groups and living apart from family were independent predictors of high IES regardless of prior SARS epidemic experience. Daily exposure to confirmed or suspect COVID-19 cases increased the odds of high IES for non-SARS HCWs only. Overall, while 28% of HCWs in our study suffered from significant trauma-related psychological symptoms regardless of prior experience with the SARS epidemic, those with prior experience reported feeling safer and better equipped, finding the workload easier to manage, as well as having more confidence in their healthcare leaders. We recommend for more trauma-informed support strategies for our HCWs especially those from racial minority groups, who are foreign-born and isolated from their families.","Chan, Tan, Sim, Tan, Goh, Su, Tan, Lee, Tan, Lim, Aw, Goh, Sadarangani, Chow","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051895","20211201","COVID-19; epidemiology; mental health; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23085,""
"Recovery From COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis: A Prospective and Longitudinal Cohort Study of the United Kingdom Multiple Sclerosis Register","To understand the course of recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to determine its predictors, including patients' pre-COVID-19 physical and mental health status. This prospective and longitudinal cohort study recruited patients with MS who reported COVID-19 from March 17, 2020, to March 19, 2021, as part of the United Kingdom MS Register (UKMSR) COVID-19 study. Participants used online questionnaires to regularly update their COVID-19 symptoms, recovery status, and duration of symptoms for those who fully recovered. Questionnaires were date stamped for estimation of COVID-19 symptom duration for those who had not recovered at their last follow-up. The UKMSR holds demographic and up-to-date clinical data on participants as well as their web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale (web-EDSS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. The association between these factors and recovery from COVID-19 was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Of the 7,977 patients with MS who participated in the UKMSR COVID-19 study, 599 reported COVID-19 and prospectively updated their recovery status. Twenty-eight hospitalized participants were excluded. At least 165 participants (29.7%) had long-standing COVID-19 symptoms for Ã¢â€°Â¥4 weeks and 69 (12.4%) for Ã¢â€°Â¥12 weeks. Participants with pre-COVID-19 web-EDSS scores Ã¢â€°Â¥7, participants with probable anxiety and/or depression (HADS scores Ã¢â€°Â¥11) before COVID-19 onset, and women were less likely to report recovery from COVID-19. Patients with MS are affected by postacute sequelae of COVID-19. Preexisting severe neurologic impairment or mental health problems appear to increase this risk. These findings can have implications in tailoring their post-COVID-19 rehabilitation.","Garjani, Middleton, Nicholas, Evangelou","https://doi.org/10.1212/NXI.0000000000001118","20211201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23086,""
"The dynamic changes of cellular immunity among frontline medical workers who supported Wuhan for fighting against the COVID-19","The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great stress to frontline medical workers. Our previous study indicated that immune cells in the peripheral blood of frontline medical workers changed significantly. However, the dynamic changes of immune cells of frontline medical workers remain unclear. Here, we reported the dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of 51 frontline medical worker. The frontline medical workers struggling with COVID-19 from February 8 to March 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, including routine blood test data were extracted from the electronic health examination record and retrospectively analyzed. The lymphocyte (LYM) count and LYM ratio increased while the monocyte (MONO) ratio, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and neutrophil (NEUT) ratio in the peripheral blood of frontline medical workers decreased 10Ã‚Â days after struggling with COVID-19. Interestingly, the differences of LYM count, LYM ratio, MONO ratio, NLR, NEUT ratio were more significantly in nurse than doctor. The differences of LYM ratio, NLR and NEUT ratio were more significantly in female than male. However, the changes of LYM count, LYM ratio, MONO ratio, NLR, MLR, NEUT ratio returned to the baseline 10Ã‚Â months after struggling with COVID-19. Together, these data indicated that immune cells in the peripheral blood changed significantly 10Ã‚Â days after struggling with COVID-19, but returned to normal after 10Ã‚Â months. Those maybe caused by psychological stress and we recommend to pay more attention to mental health and immune response of frontline medical workers.","Yang, Wang, Zhang, Li, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108392","20211201","COVID-19; Cellular immunity; Lymphocyte; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23087,""
"The mass release of migrants from UK immigration detention during the COVID-19 pandemic: what can be learned?","Convincing international evidence demonstrates that immigration detention adversely affects mental health. During the COVID-19 outbreak, additional concerns were raised about the safety and appropriateness of immigration detention. Consequently, several hundred migrants were released en masse from UK immigration detention centres, and few new detentions took place. Over 70% fewer migrants were held in detention centres in June 2020 compared with December 2019. This large 'natural experiment' has demonstrated that detaining fewer migrants is possible and it provides an opportunity to review the necessity for large-scale detention for the purpose of immigration control, as well as its impact on health inequalities. Additionally, given that detainee release arrangements had already been considered unsafe prior to the pandemic, clinicians and service providers should take into consideration that many of those released may not be receiving adequate post-release continuity of care.","Waterman, Pillay, Katona","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2021.110","20211201","Asylum seeker; detention; forensic mental health services; immigration removal centre; refugee","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23088,""
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study among Palestinian students (10-18Ã‚Â years)","The COVID-19 pandemic considers a threat to students' well-being and mental health. The current descriptive cross-sectional study aims to identify psychological distress among school students during the lockdown period. This study was carried out in a sample of 420 primary and secondary school students from June 10 to July 13, 2020, in the Gaza Strip in Palestine. Data was collected using an online questionnaire that included informed consent, socio-demographic questions, and a psychometric scale (DASS-21). The results revealed that most students experienced moderate to severe levels of anxiety (89.1%) and depression (72.1%), whereas less than half of them (35.7%) experienced moderate to severe stress. Stress, anxiety and depression scores were significantly different across gender, age groups, family size, and family's economic status. The results showed that gender (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.174, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), age (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.155, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and economic level of family (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.147, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) were negative predictors correlated with stress. Family size (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.156, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) played a positive role in stress. It was found that gender (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.105, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031), age (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.135, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) and economic level of family (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.136, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005) were negative predictors correlated with anxiety, whereas family size (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.139, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004) played a positive role in anxiety. For depression, gender (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.162, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), age (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.160, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and economic level of family (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.131, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007) were negative predictors correlated with depression, whereas family size (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.133, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) was found to be a positive predictor. Concerns about the influence of COVID-19 on economic, education, and daily life were positively correlated to the levels of depression, anxiety and stress, whereas the availability of social support was negatively correlated. The development of a health protocol for influenced students is urgently needed to maintain them remain resilient during dangerous times.","Radwan, Radwan, Radwan, Pandey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00688-2","20211201","Anxiety; COVID-19; DASS-21 scale; Depression; Gaza Strip; Palestine; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23089,""
"Biased perceptions against female scientists affect intentions to get vaccinated for COVID-19","Based on role congruity theory, we investigated how gender bias may influence public attitudes toward the vaccine in Turkey. Using a between-subjects design, we tested whether an emphasis on the female versus the male scientist as the vaccine's inventor in a news story influenced attitudes about the BioNTech vaccine and vaccination intentions. Partly confirming role congruity theory, three-way interaction results from 665 participants demonstrated that among male participants with a stronger belief in traditional gender roles (compared to males with lower belief), the presence of the female inventor, either by herself or together with the male inventor, decreased the perceived efficacy and safety of the vaccine and reduced intentions to be vaccinated by the BioNTech vaccine. We did not observe such differences for women. These findings highlight how gender bias may influence individuals' information processing and decision making in a way that may have negative consequences for public health.","DoÃ„Å¸an, Baruh, Cemalcilar, Kuru, YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, Ãƒâ€¡arkoÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625211060472","20211201","covid vaccination; gender and science; gender bias; media representations; role congruity theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23090,""
"Mental health symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Norway: A cross-sectional survey study","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major social and economic changes that could impact public mental health. The main aim of the current study was to investigate mental health in Norway during the COVID-19 outbreak (since the first confirmed case on 26 February 2020). The results are from the first wave of the data collection (1 April-2 June 2020), which took place during the outbreak along with its initial restrictions. A total of 19,372 (11,883 students) people participated in a cross-sectional web-based survey. A total of 21.8% scored above the cut-off for depression and 23.7% for anxiety. Severity of symptoms was associated with the accumulation of risk factors, such as possible/confirmed infection for oneself or one's family, female/other sex, students, having mental health problems, increased use of tobacco, increased use of alcohol, less exercise, losing one's job, suffering economic impact and lower education. <b>COVID-19 could have a negative association with public mental health, especially for certain risk groups.

"Psychological Distress in Primary Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece","The present study aims to evaluate the symptoms of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Greek primary healthcare workers, correlating them with their individual characteristics. The research is based on a self-report questionnaire distributed to primary HCWs of Thessaloniki's public health care units. A sample of 143 respondents was gathered. The questionnaire consists of 21 items: 6 demographic questions, 9 on personal distress, 5 on work-related distress and 1 on one dominant feeling of the participants. These items were based on existing validated measures, such as the ""Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21"", the ""Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10"", ""General Health Questionnaire- 28"" and ""Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale"". The associations between participants' gender, education, specialty and parenthood were determined with Pearson's chi-squared (Ãâ€¡2) test. Overall, 70.4% of HCWs were generally affected by the pandemic. The personal distress factors revealed that the majority (67%) experienced distress due to routine changes. The effects on health behavior (sleep, eating behavior and substance use) were not high. Psychological/psychiatric needs were relatively low, while negative emotions and need of social support were high. 31.4% displayed intense emotional instability. All work-related distress factors were rated high. Worry about contracting COVID-19 in the workplace scored the highest (82.6%). Almost half of the participants felt exposed to COVID-19 infection (47.0%). Anxiety (47.2%) and burn-out (78.4%) symptoms were also revealed. Female participants appeared to be more anxious (P&lt;0.01) and upset (P=0.013). The exposure to a constant risk could potentially lead to an increase in HCWs' psychological distress. Designing the right tools and organizing the right plans are of paramount importance to prevent the deterioration of their wellness and quality of life.","Cheristanidis, Kavvadas, Moustaklis, Kyriakidou, Batzou, Sidiropoulos, Papazisis, Papamitsou","https://doi.org/10.5644/ama2006-124.341","20211201","COVID-19; Healthcare Workers; Personal Psychological Distress; SARS-CoV-2; Work-Related Psychological Distress.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-02","",23092,""
