"Perceived neighborhood cohesion buffers COVID-19 impacts on mental health in a United States sample","This study examined whether perceived neighborhood cohesion (the extent to which neighbors trust and count on one another) buffers against the mental health effects of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The XXX University National COVID-19 and Mental Health Study surveyed US adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3965; M ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 39 years), measuring depressive symptoms, staying home more during than before the 2020 pandemic, and perceived neighborhood cohesion. A series of linear regressions indicated that perceiving one's neighborhood as more cohesive was not only associated with fewer depressive symptoms, but also attenuated the relationship between spending more time at home during the pandemic and depressive symptoms. These relationships persisted even after taking into account several individual-level sociodemographic characteristics as well as multiple contextual features, i.e., median household income, population density, and racial/ethnic diversity of the zip codes in which participants resided. Neighborhood cohesion may be leveraged to mitigate pandemic impacts on depressive symptoms.","Robinette, Bostean, Glynn, Douglas, Jenkins, Gruenewald, Frederick","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114269","20210814","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Perceived neighborhood cohesion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17126,""
"Identifying Patterns in Administrative Tasks through Structural Topic Modeling: A Study of Task Definitions, Prevalence, and Shifts in a Mental Health Practice's Operations during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This case study illustrates the use of natural language processing for identifying administrative task categories, prevalence and shifts necessitated by a major event (the COVID-19 pandemic) from user-generated data stored as free text in a task management system for a multi-site mental health practice with 40 clinicians and 13 administrative staff members. Structural topic modeling was applied on 7,079 task sequences from 13 administrative users of a HIPAA-compliant task management platform. Context was obtained through interviews with an expert panel. 10 task definitions spanning three major categories were identified, and their prevalence estimated. Significant shifts in task prevalence due to the pandemic were detected for tasks like billing inquiries to insurers, appointment cancellations, patient balances and new patient follow-up. Structural topic modeling effectively detects task categories, prevalence, and shifts, providing opportunities for healthcare providers to reconsider staff roles and to optimize workflows and resource allocation.","Pachamanova, Glover, Li, Docktor, Gujral","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab185","20210814","COVID19; mental health; natural language processing; task management; topic modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17127,""
"Psychosocial status of older adults aged 65 years and over during lockdown in Turkey and their perspectives on the outbreak","Older adults over the age of 65 were announced as a high-risk group in the COVID-19 outbreak and had to be placed on lockdown for a long time. The research was conducted to identify the psychosocial status, attitudes, and experiences of individuals aged 65 and over who were in-home lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. In the study, 51 older adults were reached using the snowball sampling method. The research data were collected through qualitative interviews from older adults who were in house restrictions during the pandemic period, and thematic analysis was performed. As a result of the interviews, four main themes revealed as (a) Growing old is like a crime: The public perception of the older adults regarding the stigma associated with aging, (b) The inevitable course: Potential possibilities arising as a result of the pandemic period, (c) The cost of lockdown at home: Risk factors arising due to staying at home for a long time, (d) The desire for equality: The developing resistance against lockdown and demands for equality. The lockdown applied exclusively to older adults forced them to create new routines and made them aware of some values; however, they asserted that they were stigmatized and lonely, that their concerns about death/catching COVID-19 increased, and they were treated unfairly. Measures should be taken to prevent mental problems in older adults. In addition, public health nurses are advised to provide preventive care services and counselling for early intervention.","YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13542","20210814","COVID-19; awareness; discrimination; equality; loneliness; mental health; older adults; pandemic; psychosocial health; stigma; yearn","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17128,""
"Depression symptoms as longitudinal predictors of the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in hypertensive patients","COVID-19 has brought considerable changes and caused critical psychological responses, especially among frail populations. So far, researchers have explored the predictive effect of diverse factors on pandemic-related psychological distress, but none have focused on the impact of prior depression and anxiety symptomatology adopting an extended (10-year) longitudinal design. 105 patients aged over 60, affected by hypertension who participated in a previous longitudinal study were assessed through a follow-up telephone structured interview. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used for assessing depression and anxiety symptoms and the psychological impact of COVID-19, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. At the assessment, participants did not report clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and psychological pandemic-related distress symptoms. However, significant mean differences between baseline and current follow-up evaluations for both depression and anxiety were found, reflecting a decrease in symptomatology over time (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Baseline depression symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.483, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) significantly predicted the psychological impact of COVID-19 after 10 years. Conversely, their decrease (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.640, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and living with others (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-7.274, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.041) significantly contributed to lower psychological distress scores. Our findings provide insight into the predisposing influence of depressive symptoms on pandemic-related psychological distress ten years later. Preventive interventions and strategies considering these factors are needed to better pre-empt the severe mental consequences of the pandemic.","D'Addario, Zanatta, Adorni, Greco, Fattirolli, Franzelli, Giannattasio, Steca","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96165-2","20210814","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17129,""
"Prospective association between receipt of the economic impact payment and mental health outcomes","The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 provided 'economic impact payments' (EIPs) of $1200 to US adults with annual personal income of $75 000 or less. This study examined the prospective association between EIP receipt and mental health outcomes. A nationally representative sample of 3169 middle-income and low-income US adults completed a baseline assessment of their health and well-being in May-June 2020 and a 3-month follow-up assessment during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic when EIPs were distributed. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, EIP recipients had higher odds of reporting a positive COVID-19 test, endorsing a history of post-traumatic stress disorder and reporting any illicit drug use in the past month than participants who did not receive EIP. Participants who did not receive EIP were more likely to report a history of anxiety disorder or alcohol use disorder and recent suicidal ideation than EIP recipients. There was no association between EIP receipt and financial distress, although over one-third to over half of EIP recipients were not employed at baseline. Between baseline and 3-month follow-up, receipt of EIP was significantly associated with reduced medical conditions and alcohol use problems, but increased depression, suicidal ideation and COVID-19 era-related stress. The EIP provided a brief income stimulus to many adults in need but was not associated with improvements in financial distress or mental health among middle-income and low-income recipients. Long-term income security and employment may be more important to improving and sustaining positive mental health outcomes.","Tsai, Huang, Rajan, Elbogen","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216661","20210814","COVID-19; economics; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17130,""
"Association between contact with a general practitioner and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: a large community-based study in Hangzhou, China","To determine the association of general practitioner (GP) contact with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in China. In April 2020, a follow-up survey was conducted on the basis of a baseline survey conducted between October 2018 and May 2019. The survey was embedded in the Stanford Wellness Living Laboratory-China (WELL China) study, an ongoing prospective community-based cohort study during 2018-2019. The survey was conducted by telephone interview among 4144 adult urban residents participating in the WELL China study at baseline. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms and GP contact during the lockdown period (February to March 2020). Depressive symptoms were measured using the WHO-Five Well-being Index, comprising five questionnaire items that briefly indicate psychological well-being. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the association between GP contact and depressive symptoms. In total, 3356 participants responded to the survey; 203 were excluded owing to missing data on depressive symptoms, leaving 3153 participants in the present study. During lockdown, 449 participants had GP contact. GP contact was significantly negatively associated with prevalent depressive symptoms (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89; p&lt;0.01) and incident depressive symptoms (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93; p&lt;0.05). Stratified analysis showed a significant negative association between depressive symptoms and GP contact in individuals who were 45-64 years old (p&lt;0.01), had a middle or high education (p&lt;0.01) and had self-reported non-communicable diseases (p&lt;0.05). Contact with GPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns may have a negative association with depressive symptoms in community-dwelling populations. Given the possibility of further surges in COVID-19 infections, GPs' contact in the community should be enhanced.","Yang, Lin, Frost, Min, Xu, Wang, Li, Leng, Zhao, He, Hsing, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052383","20210814","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17131,""
"COVID-19-related stigma and its influencing factors: a nationwide cross-sectional study during the early stage of the pandemic in China","To describe the situation of COVID-19-related stigma towards patients with COVID-19 and people from the city of Wuhan in China and to assess the associations between COVID-19-related stigma, health literacy and sociodemographic characteristics during March 2020, the early stage of the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey. The study surveyed 31 provinces in China. This study surveyed 5039 respondents in China. Public stigma towards both patients with COVID-19 and Wuhan residents was measured. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with public COVID-19-related stigma. Among the participants, 122 (2.4%) reported themselves and 254 (5.0%) reported the communities they lived in as holding a stigmatising attitude towards patients with COVID-19, respectively. Additionally, 114 (2.5%) and 475 (10.3%) reported that themselves and the communities they lived in, respectively, held a stigma against people from Wuhan, which was the most severely affected area in China. People aged over 40, lived in areas with severe epidemics (adjusted OR (aOR)=2.03, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI (1.05 to 3.92)) and who felt it difficult to find and understand information about COVID-19 (aOR=1.91, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI (1.08 to 3.37); aOR=1.88, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI (1.08 to 3.29)) were more likely to stigmatise patients with COVID-19. People who were male, aged 41-50 and had difficulty understanding information (aOR=2.08, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI (1.17 to 3.69)) were more likely to stigmatise people from Wuhan. Patients with COVID-19 and Wuhan residents suffered stigma at both the individual and the community levels. Those who had low health literacy, who lived in areas with a large number of COVID-19 cases and who were of ethnic minorities were more likely to stigmatise others. Tailored interventions are encouraged to improve health literacy and consequently to reduce public COVID-19-related stigma.","Jiang, Zhou, Lin, Pan, Zhong, Wang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048983","20210814","COVID-19; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-15","",17132,""
