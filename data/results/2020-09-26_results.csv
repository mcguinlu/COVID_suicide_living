"Longitudinal Mediators of Early Pandemic Distress","We leverage powerful time-series data from a national longitudinal sample measured before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the world's eighth most stringent COVID-19 lockdown (New Zealand, March-April 2020, N = 940) and apply Bayesian multilevel mediation models to rigorously test five theories of pandemic distress. Findings: (1) during lockdown, rest diminished distress; without rest psychological distress would have been about 1.74 times greater; (2) an elevated sense of community reduced distress, a little, but elevated government satisfaction was inert. Thus, the psychological benefits of lockdown extended to political discontents; (3) most lockdown distress arose from dissatisfaction from personal relationships. Social captivity, more than isolation, proved challenging; (4-5) Health and business satisfaction were stable; were they challenged substantially more distress would have ensued. Thus, lockdown benefited psychological health by affording safety, yet only because income remained secure. These national longitudinal findings clarify the mental health effects of stringent infectious disease containment.","Pooja Sengupta; Bhaswati Ganguli; Aditya Chatterjee; Sugata SenRoy; Moumita Chatterjee; Simone Arienti; Pranvera Sadiku; Patricia Coelho; Ananda S Mirchandani; David Hope; Sarah K Clark; Jo Singleton; Shonna Johnston; Robert Grecian; Azin Poon","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194829""","20200918","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5193,""

"Increased Internet Searches for Insomnia as an Indicator of Global Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multinational Longitudinal Study","BACKGROUND: Real-time global mental health surveillance is urgently needed for tracking the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use Google Trends data to investigate the impact of the pandemic on global mental health by analyzing three keywords indicative of mental distress: ""insomnia,"" ""depression,"" and ""suicide."" METHODS: We examined increases in search queries for 19 countries. Significant increases were defined as the actual daily search value (from March 20 to April 19, 2020) being higher than the 95% CIs of the forecast from the 3-month baseline via ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) modeling. We examined the correlation between increases in COVID-19-related deaths and the number of days with significant increases in search volumes for insomnia, depression, and suicide across multiple nations. RESULTS: The countries with the greatest increases in searches for insomnia were Iran, Spain, the United States, and Italy; these countries exhibited a significant increase in insomnia searches on more than 10 of the 31 days observed. The number of COVID-19-related deaths was positively correlated to the number of days with an increase in searches for insomnia in the 19 countries (&#961;=0.64, P=.003). By contrast, there was no significant correlation between the number of deaths and increases in searches for depression (&#961;=-0.12, P=.63) or suicide (&#961;=-0.07, P=.79). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that insomnia could be a part of routine mental health screening during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin, Yu-Hsuan; Chiang, Ting-Wei; Lin, Yu-Lun","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22181","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e22181, 2020 Sep 21.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e22181, 2020 Sep 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5195,""
"Human plague: An old scourge that needs new answers","Yersinia pestis, the bacterial causative agent of plague, remains an important threat to human health. Plague is a rodent-borne disease that has historically shown an outstanding ability to colonize and persist across different species, habitats, and environments while provoking sporadic cases, outbreaks, and deadly global epidemics among humans. Between September and November 2017, an outbreak of urban pneumonic plague was declared in Madagascar, which refocused the attention of the scientific community on this ancient human scourge. Given recent trends and plague's resilience to control in the wild, its high fatality rate in humans without early treatment, and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems, human plague should be considered as a neglected threat. A workshop was held in Paris in July 2018 to review current knowledge about plague and to identify the scientific research priorities to eradicate plague as a human threat. It was concluded that an urgent commitment is needed to develop and fund a strong research agenda aiming to fill the current knowledge gaps structured around 4 main axes: (i) an improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the reservoir, vector, pathogen, and environment; (ii) human and societal responses; (iii) improved diagnostic tools and case management; and (iv) vaccine development. These axes should be cross-cutting, translational, and focused on delivering context-specific strategies. Results of this research should feed a global control and prevention strategy within a ""One Health"" approach.","VallÃ¨s, Xavier; Stenseth, Nils Chr; Demeure, Christian; Horby, Peter; Mead, Paul S; Cabanillas, Oswaldo; Ratsitorahina, Mahery; Rajerison, Minoarisoa; Andrianaivoarimanana, Voahangy; Ramasindrazana, Beza; Pizarro-Cerda, Javier; Scholz, Holger C; Girod, Romain; Hinnebusch, B Joseph; Vigan-Womas, Ines; Fontanet, Arnaud; Wagner, David M; Telfer, Sandra; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Tortosa, Pablo; Carrara, Guia; Deuve, Jane; Belmain, Steven R; D'Ortenzio, Eric; Baril, Laurence","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008251","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS Negl Trop Dis;14(8): e0008251, 2020 08.; Publication details: PLoS Negl Trop Dis;14(8): e0008251, 2020 08.; Neglected Diseases/prevention & control; Plague/prevention & control; Yersinia pestis; Animals; Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control; Disease Reservoirs/microbiology; Humans; Insect Vectors; Madagascar/epidemiology; Neglected Diseases/epidemiology; Plague/epidemiology; Plague/transmission; Rodentia; Siphonaptera; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5196,""

METHODS: A convenience-based internet survey of health-care workers in Canada was facilitated through various labor organizations between April 7 and May 13, 2020. A total of 7,298 respondents started the survey, of which 5,988 reported information on the main exposures and outcomes. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screener, and depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) screener. We assessed the perceived need and adequacy of 8 types of PPE and 10 different ICP. Regression analyses examined the proportion of GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across levels of PPE and ICP, adjusted for a range of demographic, occupation, workplace, and COVID-19-specific measures. RESULTS: A total of 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.5% to 56.1%) of the sample had GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 42.3% (95% CI, 41.0% to 43.6%) of the sample had PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher. Absolute differences of 18% (95% CI, 12% to 23%) and 17% (95% CI, 12% to 22%) were observed in the prevalence of GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher between workers whose perceived PPE needs and ICP needs were met compared to those who needs were not met. Differences of between 11% (95% CI, 6% to 17%) and 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%) were observed in PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across these same PPE and ICP categories.

"PSYCOVID-19, dispositif de soutien psychologique dans les champs de la santÃ© mentale, du somatique et du mÃ©dico-social; [PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social]","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country ""at war"" against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence RÃ©gionale de SantÃ© Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

"The conundrum of human immune system ""senescence""","There is a great deal of debate on the question of whether or not we know what ageing is (Ref. Cohen et al). Here, we consider what we believe to be the especially confused and confusing case of the ageing of the human immune system, commonly referred to as ""immunosenescence"". But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications. Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity. Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy. Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed; (2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age; (3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging; and (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate agig. This remains an immense challenge. These questions acquire an added urgency in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, given the clearly greater susceptibility of older adults to COVID-19.","Pawelec, Graham; Bronikowski, Anne; Cunnane, Stephen C; Ferrucci, Luigi; Franceschi, Claudio; FÃ¼lÃ¶p, Tamas; Gaudreau, Pierrette; Gladyshev, Vadim N; Gonos, Efstathios S; Gorbunova, Vera; Kennedy, Brian K; Larbi, Anis; LemaÃ®tre, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Liu, Guang-Hui; Maier, Andrea B; Morais, JosÃ© A; NÃ³brega, OtÃ¡vio T; Moskalev, Alexey; Rikkert, Marcel Olde; Seluanov, Andrei; Senior, Alistair M; Ukraintseva, Svetlana; Van Haelen, Quentin; Witkowski, Jacek; Cohen, Alan A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111357","","Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Mech Ageing Dev;: 111357, 2020 Sep 16.; Publication details: Mech Ageing Dev;: 111357, 2020 Sep 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5200,""
"Pandemics and Mental Health: an Unfortunate Alliance","Mental health issues not only affect the person but society as a whole. This is especially apparent during times of pandemics or other social unrest situations as currently seen during the COVID-19 crisis. It can manifest itself as violence (towards or from the mentally ill person), increased substance use, increased overcrowding of our prisons, tackling with comorbid medical conditions which have worsened due to lack of initial attention (a particularly big problem among the mentally ill), increased strain on tax payers, and overall affecting the quality of everyone's life. Furthermore, mental health maladies can cause increase work absenteeism and poor work performance and decreased economic productivity. The stigma associated with mental health also leads to poor funding form policy makers, as there is a lack of forceful advocacy in dealing with these issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the loss of productivity due to mental health disability accounts to close to 5% of the gross national product of the European Union (WHO 2019). One of the most crucial causes of lack of mental screening, recognition, and treatment is the limited availability of mental health trained providers. The physician assistant profession is in a unique role to fill this niche as they have been trained as generalists who specialize only when getting trained in their specific field during their employment. Additionally, the fact that PAs do have lateral mobility does lend this profession to meet the needs of society, especially in the psychiatric fields, in a prompt and competent manner. The need for physician assistants (PAs) in psychiatry and addiction medicine is a nationwide trend resulting in existing and emerging shortages of psychiatric and addiction medicine providers. They can provide relatively inexpensive, easily accessible, and good quality care to their clients.","Kuriakose, Shinu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00501-y","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: SN Compr Clin Med;: 1-5, 2020 Sep 11.; Publication details: SN Compr Clin Med;: 1-5, 2020 Sep 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5201,""
"Older People's Non-Physical Contacts and Depression During the COVID-19 Lockdown","With the goal of slowing down the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, restrictions to physical contacts have been taken in many countries. We examine to what extent intergenerational and other types of non-physical contacts have reduced the risk of increased perceived depressive feelings during the lockdown for people aged 50+. We implemented an on-line panel survey based on quota sampling in France, Italy, and Spain in April 2020, about one month after the start of the lockdown. Our analyses are based on logistic regression models and use post-stratification weights. About 50% of individuals aged 50+ felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown in the three considered countries. Older people who increased or maintained unchanged non-physical contacts with non-coresident individuals during the lockdown were at a lower risk of increased perceived depressive feelings compared to those who experienced a reduction in non-physical contacts. The beneficial effect of non-physical contacts was stronger for intergenerational relationships. The effects were similar by gender and stronger among individuals aged 70+, living in Spain and not living alone before the start of the lockdown. In the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, or during future similar pandemic, policy makers may implement measures that balance the need to reduce the spread of the virus with the necessity of allowing for limited physical contacts. Social contacts at a distance may be encouraged as a means to keep social closeness, while being physically distant.","Arpino, Pasqualini, Bordone, SolÃƒÂ©-AurÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa144","20200925","Coronavirus; Intergenerational relationships; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2; Social contacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5202,""
"Association Between Frequent Urination and Prolonged Staying at Home","Due to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many activities have stopped and individuals have been forced to stay at home for prolonged periods, which can have a negative impact on overall health and trigger stress and psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety. The objective of this study was to highlight 25 cases of unusual frequent urination associated with abnormal sleep and their relation to staying at home for a prolonged period due to the COVID-19 crisis. This retrospective cross-sectional study included 25 patients who complained of frequent urination (&gt; 3 times/hour) and abnormal sleep during the last 4 months (January-April 2020). These patients were evaluated for all possible differential diagnoses. All of the patients had frequent urination &gt; 10 times/day and abnormal sleep but had normal kidney function tests and other investigations. None of the patients had been doing any physical activity at home. All of the patients said that both sleep and urination frequency improved after leaving home for a while (eg, to visit friends, walk, or play sports). This improvement occurred within 2 nights of leaving the home; however, the majority of patients improved after the first night. &quot;Home staying syndrome&quot; is an undefined syndrome of unusual symptoms of abnormal sleep (altering sleep time and duration) and frequent urination &gt; 3 times/hour. This syndrome is associated with staying at home for a long period of time and is easily resolved by doing any activity such as sports or visiting friends. While this syndrome is rare, it may be more prevalent now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forces people to stay home for infection prevention.","Hashim","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.20m02694","20200925","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5203,""
"Expression of ACE2 in airways: implication for COVID-19 risk and disease management in patients with chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a rising international cause of morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as a key cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested to be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial infection stage. Recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 expression is highly enriched in nasal epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of respiratory tract as the primary target site of SARS-CoV-2. The expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells is tightly regulated by inflammatory milieu and environmental and internal stimuli. Very recently, ACE2 has been reported to have different expression levels in airways under distinct chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergic asthma, which may associate with the COVID-19 risk and affect the management of primary airway diseases. In this review, we focus on the cutting-edge progress in distribution, expression, and regulation of ACE2 in respiratory system in physiological and pathological conditions, and their implication for the development of COVID-19. We also discuss the management of airway diseases, including asthma, COPD, allergic rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis in the era of COVID-19.","Yao, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.13746","20200925","airway disease; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; coronavirus disease 2019; management; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5204,""
"Mobile Insight in Risk, Resilience, and Online Referral (MIRROR): Psychometric Evaluation of an Online Self-Help Test","Most people who experience a potentially traumatic event (PTE) recover on their own. A small group of individuals develops psychological complaints, but this is often not detected in time or guidance to care is suboptimal. To identify these individuals and encourage them to seek help, a web-based self-help test called Mobile Insight in Risk, Resilience, and Online Referral (MIRROR) was developed. MIRROR takes an innovative approach since it integrates both negative and positive outcomes of PTEs and time since the event and provides direct feedback to the user. The goal of this study was to assess MIRROR's use, examine its psychometric properties (factor structure, internal consistency, and convergent and divergent validity), and evaluate how well it classifies respondents into different outcome categories compared with reference measures. MIRROR was embedded in the website of Victim Support Netherlands so visitors could use it. We compared MIRROR's outcomes to reference measures of PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), depression, anxiety, stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21), psychological resilience (Resilience Evaluation Scale), and positive mental health (Mental Health Continuum Short Form). In 6 months, 1112 respondents completed MIRROR, of whom 663 also completed the reference measures. Results showed good internal consistency (interitem correlations range .24 to .55, corrected item-total correlations range .30 to .54, and Cronbach alpha coefficient range .62 to .68), and convergent and divergent validity (Pearson correlations range -.259 to .665). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA+CFA) yielded a 2-factor model with good model fit (CFA model fit indices: Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>19</sub>=107.8, P&lt;.001, CFI=.965, TLI=.948, RMSEA=.065), conceptual meaning, and parsimony. MIRROR correctly classified respondents into different outcome categories compared with the reference measures. MIRROR is a valid and reliable self-help test to identify negative (PTSD complaints) and positive outcomes (psychosocial functioning and resilience) of PTEs. MIRROR is an easily accessible online tool that can help people who have experienced a PTE to timely identify psychological complaints and find appropriate support, a tool that might be highly needed in times like the coronavirus pandemic.","van Herpen, Boeschoten, Te Brake, van der Aa, Olff","https://doi.org/10.2196/19716","20200925","mobile mental health; online; posttraumatic stress disorder; potentially traumatic events; resilience; self-help","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5205,""
"Evaluation of Regeneration Processes for Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Terms of the Bacteria Inactivation Efficiency and Influences on Filtration Performance","The regeneration of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) is of critical importance because of the severe shortage of FFRs during large-scale outbreaks of respiratory epidemics, such as COVID-19. Comprehensive experiments regarding FFR regeneration were performed in this study with model bacteria to illustrate the decontamination performance of the regeneration processes. The results showed that it is dangerous to use a contaminated FFR without any microbe inactivation treatment because the bacteria can live for more than 8 hours. The filtration efficiency and surface electrostatic potential of 75% ethanol-treated FFRs were significantly reduced, and a most penetrating particle size of 200 nm was observed. Steam and microwave irradiation showed promising decontamination performances, achieving 100% inactivation in 90 min and 30 min, respectively. The filtration efficiencies of steam-treated FFRs for 50 and 100 nm particles decreased from 98.86% and 99.51% to 97.58% and 98.79%, respectively. Ultraviolet irradiation (UVI) effectively inactivated the surface bacteria with a short treatment of 5 min and did not affect the filtration performance. However, the UV dose reaching different layers of the FFP2 mask sample gradually decreased from the outermost layer to the innermost layer, while the model bacteria on the second and third layers could not be killed completely. UVI+MWI and steam were recommended to effectively decontaminate the used respirators and still maintain the respirators' filtration efficiency. The present work provides a comprehensive evaluation for FFR regeneration in terms of the filtration efficiencies for 50-500 nm particles, the electrostatic properties, mechanical properties and decontamination effects.","He, Guo, Gao, Liu, Yue, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c04782","20200925","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5206,""
"Changes in dermatological complaints among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey","This questionnaire study evaluates dermatological complaints that may arise due to hygiene measures and anxiety among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 526 volunteers, consisting of doctors and nurses, participated. Demographic features, personal hygiene behavior, personal protective equipment (PPE) use, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A) parameters, and symptoms of various dermatological diseases (xerosis, eczema, acne, hair loss, palmar hyperhidrosis, xeromycteria, urticaria, aphthous stomatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis) were investigated. Although the frequency and severity of many dermatological complaints increased during the pandemic period, the most frequent increase was observed in the frequency of complaints suggesting xerosis and eczema. We found that complaints suggesting xerosis and eczema were seen on the hands 2.44 and 3.57 times, respectively, as a result of washing hands 10 times/day, and that handwashing times of 10 seconds or more significantly increased the risk of eczema (5.44 times). Another remarkable result was a fivefold increase in acne complaints among those using any mask. The severity of all complaints except hair loss and seborrheic dermatitis correlated significantly with HADS-A. Our study showed that the frequency and severity of some dermatological complaints increased in HCPs.","Metin, Turan, Utlu","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+in+dermatological+complaints+among+healthcare+professionals+during+the+COVID-19+outbreak+in+Turkey.","20200925","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5207,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the perinatal mental health of women","Short Communications The physical health impact of the coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) has received attention worldwide; however, data around the psychological impact of the pandemic is still emerging and little has been reported on psychological effects among vulnerable groups. This study was undertaken with the aim of studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on perinatal mental health among women in Qatar. Objectives and Methods A cross- sectional survey of women accessing maternity services in Qatar was carried out during the months of June and July 2020 at the local peak of the pandemic. Background data including relevant demographic details, pregnancy and mental health history, concerns, as well as helpful stress-reducing factors reported by women was collected. Depression and anxiety symptomatology was studied using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results The survey results revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and Depressive symptomatology (34.4 and 39.2% respectively), based on PHQ-ADS scoring. These rates appeared much higher than the reported pre-pandemic prevalence and were not affected by occupation, previous mental health problems or pregnancy complications. Women's most commonly reported concerns as well as coping factors are discussed. Conclusions Results indicate a marked increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, among pregnant and puerperal individuals, who constitute a vulnerable group with respect to mental health morbidity. These findings can be used to inform public health interventions, among which, consideration should be given to routine mental health screening of vulnerable groups during major health crises.","Farrell, Reagu, Mohan, Elmidany, Qaddoura, Ahmed, Corbett, Lindow, Abuyaqoub, Alabdulla","https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0415","20200925","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; perinatal; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5208,""
"The effects of COVID-19 stay-at-home order on sleep, health, and working patterns: a survey study of United States health care workers","By March 2020, COVID-19 forced much of the world to stay at home to reduce the spread of the disease. Some health care workers transitioned to working from home while many continued to report to work in person as essential employees. We sought to explore changes in sleep, health, work, and mood in health care workers during the stay-at-home orders. A cross-sectional online survey administered to health care workers. The survey assessed changes in sleep, work, screen time, media exposure, diet, exercise, substance use, and mood. The survey data was collected between March 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020. A total of 834 of 936 individuals completed the entire survey. Respondents were from 41 US states. Mood after the stay-at-home orders worsened and screen time and substance use increased. Total sleep time (TST) shortened in those continuing to work in-person (p&lt;.001), whereas TST was unchanged in those working from home (p=.73). Those working from home went to bed later, woke up later, and worked fewer hours. Reduced TST and increased screen time before bed were associated with worse mood and screen time. Longer sleep time was associated with better mood. Health care workers' mood worsened regardless of whether work was in person or remote, though TST was shorter for those working in person. Those working from home perhaps shifted sleep time to be more in line with endogenous circadian phase. Peer or other support services may be indicated to address sleep, mood, and health behaviors among health care workers during these unprecedented times.","Conroy, Hadler, Cho, Moreira, MacKenzie, Swanson, Burgess, Arnedt, Goldstein","https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8808","20200925","COVID-19; alcohol use; anxiety; circadian timing; depression; mood; screen time; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5209,""
"Body Mass Index, Weight Discrimination, and the Trajectory of Distress and Well-Being across the Coronavirus Pandemic","To examine the trajectory of psychological distress and well-being across the coronavirus pandemic by body mass index (BMI) category and weight discrimination. Participants (N=1,590) were assessed three times: early February 2020 before the coronavirus crisis in the United States and again in mid-March and late April 2020. Participants reported their weight, height, and weight discrimination in February. Depressed affect, loneliness, purpose in life, life satisfaction, and perceived support were assessed in all surveys; anxiety and stress were assessed in the March/April surveys. Prior to the pandemic, reporting weight discrimination or being in the underweight or obesity 2-3 category was associated with more distress and lower well-being. Weight discrimination, not BMI, was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of incident depression from before to during the pandemic. Weight discrimination was associated with declines in purpose in life and life satisfaction across the pandemic. BMI categories were unrelated to changes in distress/well-being across the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, BMI and weight discrimination were a vulnerability for greater distress and lower well-being. Weight discrimination, but not BMI, increased risk for incident depression and declines in well-being during the coronavirus pandemic.","Sutin, Stephan, Luchetti, Aschwanden, Strickhouser, Lee, Sesker, Terracciano","https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23048","20200925","COVID-19; Coronavirus pandemic; Psychological distress; Weight Discrimination; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5210,""

"Reshaping Community Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 Epidemic - Report from the 59G21 Service in Lille, France","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid transformation of the health care system to cope with the risk of contamination and of developing a severe form of the infection. Although it is an international crisis, strategies have been decided nationally. In France, priority was given to hospital reorganization, especially intensive care units. Reorganization of primary health and mental health services took place with late and inadequate national guidelines or coordination. For mental health services, lack of visibility on the crisis impact on mental health, and difficulties in defining their place in the overall health strategy appeared as the main challenges to overcome. These rapid transformations impacted the whole organization of community mental health care. Any strategies developed must ensure that every person enjoys the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Using a systemic approach, it has been necessary to identify both status and risk factors of communities, and to implement appropriate and efficient health promotion and crisis resolution actions.

"Poor appetite and overeating reported by adults in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based study","As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. This study reports analysis of data from population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) asking: &quot;Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?&quot;. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. A total of 13,829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past two weeks was 53.6%, with 11.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.6 - 12.6] of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focussed or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, Tran, Hammarberg, Kirkman, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020003833","20200925","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5213,""

Patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to inadequate medical care. We aimed to investigate the &quot;real-world&quot; impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migraine patients, and to identify risk factors for poor outcome. We administered an online, self-reported survey that included demographic, migraine-related, COVID-19-specific and overall psychosocial variables between July 15 and July 30, 2020. We recruited a sample of patients with migraine from headache clinic registry and via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Outcomes included demographic variables, change in migraine frequency and severity during the lockdown period, communication with treating physician, compliance to migraine treatment, difficulty in getting medications, medication overuse, symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, sleep and eating habits disturbance, screen time exposure, work during pandemic, use of traditional medicine, effect of Botox injection cancellation, and overall worries and concerns during pandemic. A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. Of the respondents, 859 (84.3%) were females; 733 (71.9%) were aged 20 to 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 630 (61.8%) were married, and 466 (45.7%) reported working during the pandemic. In comparison to pre-pandemic period, 607 respondents (59.6%) reported increase in migraine frequency, 163 (16%) reported decrease in frequency, and 105 (10.3%) transformed to chronic migraine. Severity was reported to increase by 653 (64.1%) respondents. The majority of respondents; 626 (61.5%) did not communicate with their neurologists, 477 (46.9%) reported compliance to treatment, and 597 (58.7%) reported overuse of analgesics. Botox injections cancellation had a negative impact on 150 respondents (66.1%) from those receiving it. Forty-one respondents (4%) were infected with COVID-19; 26 (63.4%) reported worsening of their headaches amid infection period. Sleep disturbance was reported by 794 (78.1%) of respondents, and 809 (79.5%) reported having symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. COVID-19 pandemic had an overall negative impact on patients with migraine. Several risk factors for poor outcome were identified.

"Improving mental health in US Veterans using mHealth tools: A pilot study","Rates of PTSD remain elevated among U.S. Veterans, highlighting a need for innovative management tools. Previous studies have shown mobile apps to have positive effects on PTSD symptoms, but few apps have been examined systematically. This pilot study evaluated the perceived effectiveness and usability of Mindset, a novel mobile app that monitors user stress level via heart rate to encourage e-therapy use. The study sample included 30 community-residing Veterans who completed baseline assessments. They used the Mindset app and associated smartwatch until their approximate 1-month follow-up. Self-reported assessments included pre- and post-deployment experiences; experience with Mindset; and standard screeners for PTSD (PCL-M), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and alcohol use problems (AUDIT). Among the 24 participants who completed follow-up interviews, a significant decrease (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) was found in PCL-M, PHQ-9, and modified AUDIT scores. Respondents reported moderate to high acceptance and satisfaction with Mindset features, though considerable frustration with the associated smartwatch. These findings highlight mHealth apps such as Mindset as potentially useful tools for PTSD and depression symptom management. These findings are also encouraging in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which may accelerate further innovation and implementation of mHealth technologies to improve mental health self-care.","Latour, O'Byrne, McCarthy, Chacko, Russell, Price","https://doi.org/10.1177/1460458220954613","20200925","U.S. Veterans; mental health; mobile applications; post-traumatic stress disorder; stress monitor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5215,""

Losing the sense of smell has a strong impact on the quality of life, since it may lead to malnutrition, weight loss, food poisoning, depression, and exposure to dangerous chemicals. Individuals who suffer from anosmia (inability to smell) also cannot sense the flavor of food, which is a combination of taste and smell. Interestingly, infected individuals have reported sudden loss of smell with no congested nose, as is frequently observed in common colds or other upper respiratory tract infections. These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to olfactory loss through a distinct mechanism, which is still unclear.

This survey examined attitudes toward media, government, and community responses to COVID-19 by political ideology and sociodemographic factors. Knowledge, anxieties, and impacts of COVID-19 were also assessed. Conservatives were more likely to report that COVID-19 was receiving too much media coverage and people were generally overreacting; liberals were more likely to report the government had not done enough in response to the pandemic. Females and those with lower income experienced more COVID-19 related economic anxieties. Those working and with children at home reported higher social, home, and work disruption. Social distancing behaviors were more common among liberals and were associated with increases in depressive symptoms. General knowledge about COVID-19 was widely exhibited across the sample, however, Black and Hispanic respondents were less likely to correctly answer questions about the availability of a vaccine and modes of transmission.

"Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 on Psychological Health of University Students in UAE and their Attitudes Towards m-Mental Health Solutions: A Questionnaire Study","The COVID-19 outbreak started in December 31, 2019, and was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization on the January 30, 2020. The outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it, caused many global psychological issues like depression, anxiety, and stress. The objectives of this study are: (i) to assess the psychological effect that the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak had on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and (ii) to investigate their awareness of mobile mental care applications (apps), and their attitudes towards the use of such apps. A self-administered online questionnaire, constructed of two parts, was delivered to students of the United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants' awareness and attitudes towards mental care apps. Students were invited to fill out the online questionnaire via social media and mailing lists. A total of 154 students participated in the survey, with the majority being females. Results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety, as well as social dysfunction. Results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental care apps, and uncertainty to use such apps. Third of the participants (28.6% (44/154)) suggested a list of preferred functionalities and characteristics, which they would like to find in mobile mental care apps, such as: affordable price, simple design, ease of use, online therapy, communication with others experiencing same issues, and tracking mental status. Like many groups of people around the world, university students in the United Arab Emirates were also psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Even though apps could be useful tools for mental care delivery, especially in circumstances like the ones produced by the outbreak, students showed a lack of awareness and mixed attitudes towards them. Improving digital health literacy of university student in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental care apps and their treatment methods and benefits, as well as involving them in the co-creation process of such apps might encourage students to use them for their mental care.","Drissi, Ouhbi, Alhmoudi, Alkhyeli, Alnuaimi, Alsalami","https://doi.org/10.2196/19876","20200924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5227,""

We discuss solutions to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 restrictions in this vulnerable population.","Padala, Parkes, Padala","https://doi.org/10.1177/1533317520960875","20200925","COVID-19; activities of daily living (ADLs); depression; instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs); mild cognitive impairment; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5228,""
"The relationship among fear and anxiety of COVID-19, pregnancy experience, and mental health disorder in pregnant women: A structural equation model","Coronavirus pandemic causes stress and anxiety for pregnant women worldwide. The present study was conducted for the path analysis of the relationship among fear and anxiety caused by coronavirus, pregnancy experience, and the mental health of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 222 pregnant women who were referred to Kamali Hospital in Alborz province in 2020. The eligible individuals entered the study through convenience sampling, and data were collected using five questionnaires including the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Anxiety of COVID-19 Scale, the pregnancy experiences Scales, Depression Anxiety Stress scale, and demographic checklist. The obtained data were then analyzed using SPSS-16 and Amos software. According to results of the path analysis, the anxiety of COVID-19 and concerns during pregnancy were variables that were positively and significantly correlated with mental health only through one path, which was direct, and anxiety of COVID-19 had also the highest positive direct correlation among them (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.32). The next variable was the happiness during pregnancy experiencing, which had a significantly negative and direct correlation with mental health disorder (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.29). Moreover, fear of COVID-19 through the mediating concerns of pregnancy experiences was shown to have a significant positive relationship with mental health through an indirect path (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05). Based on the result of this study, it is necessary to pay more attention to the mental health of pregnant women during a pandemic. In addition, it is recommended to provide a virtual training group to reduce anxiety caused by coronavirus and pregnancy concerns, as well as emphasizing the feeling of enjoying happiness caused by pregnancy experience during a pandemic.","Salehi, Rahimzadeh, Molaei, Zaheri, Esmaelzadeh-Saeieh","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1835","20200924","COVID-19; anxiety; fear; mental health; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5229,""
"Experiences of breastfeeding during COVID-19: Lessons for future practical and emotional support","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and social distancing led to changes to breastfeeding support available to women in the United Kingdom. Face-to-face professional support was reduced, and face-to-face peer support was cancelled. Anecdotal media accounts highlighted practices separating some mothers and babies in hospitals, alongside inaccurate stories of the safety of breastfeeding circulating. Meanwhile, new families were confined to their homes, separated from families and support networks. Given that we know breastfeeding is best supported by practices that keep mother and baby together, high-quality professional and peer-to-peer support, and positive maternal well-being, it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic upon the ability to breastfeed. To explore this, we conducted an online survey with 1219 breastfeeding mothers in the United Kingdom with a baby 0-12Ã‚Â months old to understand the impact of the pandemic upon breastfeeding duration, experiences and support. The results highlighted two very different experiences: 41.8% of mothers felt that breastfeeding was protected due to lockdown, but 27.0% of mothers struggled to get support and had numerous barriers stemming from lockdown with some stopped breastfeeding before they were ready. Mothers with a lower education, with more challenging living circumstances and from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to find the impact of lockdown challenging and stop breastfeeding. The findings are vital in understanding how we now support those women who may be grieving their loss of breastfeeding and are affected by their negative experiences and how we can learn from those with a positive experience to make sure all breastfeeding women are better supported if similar future events arise.","Brown, Shenker","https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13088","20200924","COVID-19; breastfeeding; breastfeeding support; formula feeding; lockdown; maternal mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5230,""
"The magnitude of COVID-19 related stress, anxiety and depression associated with intense mass media coverage in Saudi Arabia","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in catastrophic consequences in many aspects of life; including negative psychological effects. We aimed to assess the mental health status of a group of Saudi population during this pandemic. Also, we aimed to assess the effect of the intensive media coverage of the pandemic news on mental health status. A questionnaire was distributed online to test depression, anxiety, and stress (using the DASS-21 scale) and their relationship to certain variables. A total of 215 respondents were included. Higher mental health prevalence rates were reported in non-Saudi participants compared to Saudi ones (i.e., 50.74% vs. 30.40%; 34.23% vs. 13.51% and 59.70% vs. 27.70%; for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively). About 55.8% of the participants felt the extensive coverage in the media of COVID-19 news, which caused higher mental sufferings. Higher mental health prevalence rates were reported in females compared to males participants (i.e., 56.97% vs. 23.25%; 30.23% vs. 13.17% and 54.65% vs. 26.35%; for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively). Reasonable following of the COVID-19 news; and less exposure to the pandemic information could help in reducing the mental health issues related to the ongoing pandemic. Special care and attention should be paid to females and younger people who seem to be particularly affected during the era of COVID-19.","Zakout, Alreshidi, Elsaid, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2020052","20200925","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; anxiety; depression; media; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-26","",5231,""
