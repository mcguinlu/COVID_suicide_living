"Altered brain regional homogeneity is associated with depressive symptoms in COVID-19","COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has spread worldwide in 2020, causing a severe pandemic. In addition to respiratory symptoms, neuropsychiatric manifestations are commonly observed, including chronic fatigue, depression, and anxiety. The neural correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 are still largely unknown. A total of 79 patients with COVID-19 (COV) and 17 healthy controls (HC) underwent 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯T functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest as well as structural imaging. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was calculated. We also measured anxiety using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and fatigue with the Multidimension Fatigue Inventory, respectively. In comparison with HC, COV showed significantly higher depressive scores. Moreover, COV presented reduced ReHo in the left angular gyrus, the right superior/middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior temporal gyrus, and higher ReHo in the right hippocampus. No differences in gray matter were detected in these areas. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between ReHo in the left angular gyrus and PHQ-9 score and a trend toward a positive correlation between ReHo in the right hippocampus and the PHQ-9 scores. Heterogeneity in the clinical presentation in COV, the different timing from the first positive molecular swab test to the MRI, and the cross-sectional design of the study limit the generalization of our findings. Our results suggest that COVID-19 infection may contribute to depressive symptoms via a modulation of local functional connectivity in cortico-limbic circuits.","Cattarinussi, Miola, Trevisan, Valeggia, Tramarin, Mucignat, Morra, Minerva, Librizzi, Bordin, Causin, Ottaviano, Antonini, Sambataro, Manara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.06.061","20220628","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fatigue; ReHo; Resting-state fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33473,""
"High-density EEG sleep correlates of cognitive and affective impairment at 12-month follow-up after COVID-19","To disentangle the pathophysiology of cognitive/affective impairment in Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), we studied long-term cognitive and affective sequelae and sleep high-density electroencephalography (EEG) at 12-month follow-up in people with a previous hospital admission for acute COVID-19. People discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) and a sub-intensive ward (nonICU) between March and May 2020 were contacted between March and June 2021. Participants underwent cognitive, psychological, and sleep assessment. High-density EEG recording was acquired during a nap. Slow and fast spindles density/amplitude/frequency and source reconstruction in brain gray matter were extracted. The relationship between psychological and cognitive findings was explored with Pearson correlation. We enrolled 33 participants ( 17 nonICU) and 12 controls. We observed a lower Physical Quality of Life index, higher post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) score, and a worse executive function performance in nonICU participants. Higher PTSD and Beck Depression Inventory scores correlated with lower executive performance. The same group showed a reorganization of spindle cortical generators. Our results show executive and psycho-affective deficits and spindle alterations in COVID-19 survivors - especially in nonICU participants - after 12Ã‚Â months from discharge. These findings may be suggestive of a crucial contribution of stress experienced during hospital admission on long-term cognitive functioning.","Rubega, Ciringione, Bertuccelli, Paramento, Sparacino, Vianello, Masiero, Vallesi, Formaggio, Del Felice","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2022.05.017","20220628","Electroencephalography; Nap; Neuropsychological assessment; long COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33474,""

"Psychotic symptoms, violent ideation, and disruptive behavior are more prevalent in a population with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a preliminary study","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus to produce a range of mild to severe physical, neurologic and mental health symptoms. Indirectly, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant emotional distress, triggering emergence of mental health symptoms in persons not previously affected, or exacerbating symptoms in those with existing mental health conditions. Emotional distress and some mental health conditions can lead to violent ideation and disruptive behavior, including aggression, threatening acts, deliberate harm towards other people or animals, and inattention or noncompliance with education or workplace rules. Of the many mental health conditions that can be associated with violent ideation and disruptive behavior, psychosis can evidence greater vulnerability to unpredictable changes and be at greater risk for them. Individuals with psychosis can also be more susceptible to contracting COVID-19. The objective of this study was to investigate if violent ideation and disruptive behavior or symptoms of psychosis were more prevalent in a population with COVID-19, and did not proceed the pandemic. In this preliminary study, we analyzed questionnaire responses from a population sample (N=366), received between end of February 2021 and start of March 2021 (one year into the COVID-19 pandemic) about COVID-19 illness, violent ideation and disruptive behavior, and psychosis symptoms. Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test followed by multiple comparisons correction, we compared the self-reported frequency of these variables for three-time windows, related to the past one month, past one month to one year, and more than a year ago, between distributions of people who answered if they tested positive and/or were diagnosed with COVID-19 by a clinician. We also used multivariable logistic regression (MVLR), with iterative resampling to investigate the relationship between these variables occurring more than one year ago (i.e., before the pandemic) and the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. We observed significantly higher frequency of self-reported violent ideation and disruptive behavior, along with psychosis symptoms for all three-time windows of people who tested positive and/or were diagnosed with COVID-19 by a clinician. Using MVLR with iterative resampling, we observed 72%-94% model accuracy for an increased incidence of COVID-19 in participants who reported violent ideation and disruptive behavior, or psychosis symptoms more than one year ago. This preliminary study found that people who reported a test and/or clinician diagnosis of COVID-19 also reported higher frequencies of violent ideation and disruptive behavior or psychotic symptoms, across multiple time windows, indicating they were not likely the result of COVID-19. In parallel, participants who reported these behaviors more than one year ago (i.e., before the pandemic) were more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19, suggesting violent ideation and disruptive behavior along with psychotic symptoms were associated with COVID-19 with about a 70-90% likelihood.","Bari, Vike, Stetsiv, Woodward, Lalvani, Stefanopoulos, Kim, Maglaveras, Breiter, Katsaggelos","https://doi.org/10.2196/36444","20220628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33477,""
"Anxiety, Post-COVID-Syndrome-related depression, and suicidal thinking and behavior in COVID-19 survivors","While the psychiatric and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the general population have been studied since its onset, studies of the long-term impacts on individuals infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus are relatively new. Depression, anxiety, and neurological symptoms associated with Post-COVID-Syndrome have been observed in the months following COVID-19 recovery. Suicidal thinking and behavior (STB) have been proposed as both sequalae of COVID-19 and as potential risk factors. We asked three questions. First, do participants reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis and/or a close relation having severe COVID-19 symptoms score higher on depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9) and/or state anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Index, STAI) screens than those who do not? Second, do they exhibit increases in specific item PHQ-9 scores, and, for those participants admitting a COVID-19 diagnosis, specifically in Post-COVID-Syndrome-related scores? Lastly, do participants reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis and/or a close relation having severe COVID-19 symptoms report increased STB before, during, and/or after the first year of the pandemic? This preliminary study involved analysis of responses to a COVID-19 and mental health questionnaire, obtained from a U.S. population sample of 379 adults, whose data was collected between February 2021 and March 2021. We used Mann Whitney U testing to detect differences in the medians of the total PHQ-9 scores, PHQ-9 component scores, and several STB scores between participants claiming a past clinician diagnosis of COVID-19, and those denying one; as well between participants claiming severe COVID-19 symptoms in a close relation, and those denying one. Where significant differences were found, we created linear regression models to predict the scores based on COVID-19 response as well as demographics, to identify potential confounding in the Mann-Whitney relationships. Moreover, for STB scores, which corresponded to 5 questions asking about three different time intervals (i.e., (i) Past 1 year or more, (ii) Past 1 month to 1 year, and (iii) Past 1 month), we ran Repeated-Measure ANOVAs to determine whether scores tended to vary over time. We discovered greater total depression (PHQ9) and state anxiety (STAI) scores in those with COVID-19 infection history than those without (PBonf = 0.001, PBonf = 0.004 respectively) despite a similar history of diagnosed depression and anxiety. Greater scores were noted for a subset of depression symptoms (PHQ9 items), which overlapped symptoms of Post-COVID Syndrome (all PBonf &lt; 0.05, see text for breakdown). Moreover, we found greater overall STB scores in those with COVID-19 history, equally in time windows preceding, during, and proceeding infection (all PBonf &lt; 0.05, see text). We confirm previous studies linking depression and anxiety diagnoses to COVID-19 recovery, and posit that depression diagnoses associated with COVID-19 may relate to PCS symptoms, and that STB associated with COVID-19 in some cases precedes infection.","Woodward, Bari, Vike, Lalvani, Stetsiv, Kim, Stefanopoulos, Maglaveras, Breiter, Katsaggelos","https://doi.org/10.2196/36656","20220628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33478,""
"Mental health, financial, and social outcomes among older adults with probable COVID-19 infection: A longitudinal cohort study","We investigated the immediate and longer-term impact (over 4-6 months) of probable COVID-19 infection on mental health, wellbeing, financial hardship, and social interactions among older people living in England. Data were analysed from 5146 older adults participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who provided data before the pandemic (2018-19) and at two COVID-19 assessments in 2020 (June-July and November-December). The associations of probable COVID-19 infection (first COVID-19 assessment) with depression, anxiety, poor quality of life (QoL), loneliness, financial hardship, and social contact with family/friends at the first and second COVID-19 assessments were tested using linear/logistic regression and were adjusted for pre-pandemic outcome measures. Participants with probable infection had higher levels of depression and anxiety, poorer QoL, and greater loneliness scores compared with those without probable infection at both the first (OR<sub>depression</sub> = 1.62, <i>P</i>-value = 0.005; OR<sub>anxiety</sub> = 1.59, <i>P</i>-value = 0.049; b<sub>poorQoL</sub> = 1.34, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; b<sub>loneliness</sub> = 0.49, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and second (OR<sub>depression</sub> = 1.56, <i>P</i>-value = 0.003; OR<sub>anxiety</sub> = 1.55, <i>P</i>-value = 0.041; b<sub>poorQoL</sub> = 1.38, <i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.001; b<sub>loneliness</sub> = 0.31, <i>P</i>-value = 0.024) COVID-19 assessments. Participants with probable infection also experienced greater financial difficulties than those without infection at the first assessment (OR = 1.50, <i>P</i>-value = 0.011). Probable COVID-19 infection is associated with longer-term deterioration of mental health and wellbeing and short-term increases in financial hardship among older adults. It is important to monitor the mental health of older people affected by COVID-19 and provide additional support to those in need.","Iob, Steptoe, Zaninotto","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2200816119","20220628","COVID-19 infection; financial hardship; mental health; older adults; social connections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33479,""
"Repeated information of benefits reduces COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy: Experimental evidence from Germany","Many countries, such as Germany, struggle to vaccinate enough people against COVID-19 despite the availability of safe and efficient vaccines. With new variants emerging and the need for booster vaccinations, overcoming vaccination hesitancy gains importance. The research to date has revealed some promising, albeit contentious, interventions to increase vaccination intention. However, these have yet to be tested for their effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates. We conducted a preregistered survey experiment with N = 1,324 participants in Germany in May/June 2021. This was followed by a series of emails reminding participants to get vaccinated in August and concluded with a follow-up survey in September. We experimentally assess whether debunking vaccination myths, highlighting the benefits of being vaccinated, or sending vaccination reminders decreases hesitancy. In the survey experiment, we find no increase in the intention to vaccinate regardless of the information provided. However, communicating vaccination benefits over several weeks reduced the likelihood of not being vaccinated by 9 percentage points, which translates into a 27% reduction compared to the control group. Debunking vaccination myths and reminders alone also decreased the likelihood, yet not significantly. Our findings suggest that if soft governmental interventions such as information campaigns are employed, highlighting benefits should be given preference over debunking vaccination myths. Furthermore, it seems that repeated messages affect vaccination action while one-time messages might be insufficient, even for increasing vaccination intentions. Our study highlights the importance of testing interventions outside of survey experiments that are limited to measuring vaccination intentions-not actions-and immediate changes in attitudes and intentions-not long-term changes.","Burger, Mayer, Steimanis","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270666","20220628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33480,""
"The early impacts of COVID-19 on people living with dementia: part I of a mixed-methods systematic review","<b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this Part I systematic review was to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of people with dementia living in the community or in residential care. Part II focused on unpaid carers.<b>Methods:</b> This review was registered on PROSPERO [CRD42021248050]. Five data bases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched in July 2021. Studies were included if they reported on the impacts of the pandemic on people living with dementia, either in the community or residential settings, and published in English, German, Polish, or Spanish. Risk of bias was assessed using the Standard Quality Assessment QualSyst.<b>Results:</b> Forty papers from 33 studies reported on the effects of COVID-19 on people with dementia. Included studies were conducted across 15 countries, focusing on single-country evaluations except in one study. Three studies focused on care homes, whilst the remainder reported on the community. Studies were categorised into five impacts: Cognition; Independence and physical functioning; Behavioural symptoms; Well-being; and Access to care. All studies evidenced the negative pandemic impacts, including faster cognitive, physical, and behavioural deterioration, limited access to care, and poorer mental and social health.<b>Conclusions:</b> Future restrictions need to consider the need for people with dementia to stay cognitively, physically, and socially stimulated to live well, and this review provides a call for a future pandemic strategy for dementia. Longitudinal research is required on the long-term impacts of the pandemic on the lives of people with dementia, including time to care home entry.","Giebel, Lion, Lorenz-Dant, SuÃƒÂ¡rez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Talbot, Wharton, Cannon, Tetlow, Thyrian","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2084509","20220628","COVID-19; Dementia; activities of daily living; mental health; social care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33481,""
"[Confinement and social distancing: stress, anxiety, depression in children and adolescents]","Among the strategies to avoid COVID-19 disease that affects the world population it is keeping away from contagion through confinement and social distancing, which can cause in children and adolescents a change in the psychosocial environment with a high prevalence of psychological and psychiatric disorders, such as stress, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, risk of suicide and eating disorders. During confinement, were made school closures, shutdowns of recreational and sports spaces, cancellation of outdoor activities, which can have consequences in social habits, sleep, modifications in the eating pattern that entails alterations in anthropometric variables, neurophysiological alterations with behaviors that affect mental health, in addition to the frustration of not executing plans, fear, boredom and the uncertainty of the duration of the pandemic could lead to further stress. Social distancing favors a reduction in interaction, is related to anxiety, stress and depression, in addition to the concern of infecting the family. These scenarios can generate stress for parents, domestic violence and uncontrolled use of the internet. Children and adolescents are vulnerable populations that adapt to the environment in crisis.

"Understanding Veteran Suicide Risk and Mitigation Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic","U.S. Veterans experience a significantly higher risk for suicide compared to the general population. Understanding the challenges associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) enables providers to mitigate the risk of suicide among Veterans. Evidence supports access and utilization of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health services as they are a protective factor associated with lower suicide rates. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the VA has worked to further decrease deaths by suicide in the Veteran population by rapid expansion of current interventions and implementation of new evidence-based interventions. These interventions include mental health and coaching applications, consistent use of measurement-based care across multiple disciplines, and greater use of telehealth services. Through these efforts, despite increased risk for suicide due to additional stressors from COVID-19, suicide rates among Veterans are decreasing.

"Establishing political priority for global mental health: a qualitative policy analysis","Mental disorders represent the leading cause of disability worldwide, yet they remain a low global health priority. This paper uses a case study methodology and different data sources (35 interviews and documents) to analyse factors that have shaped the generation of political priority for global mental health over the past three decades (1990-2020) and their changes over time. The Shiffman and Smith framework on determinants of political priority for global health issues is used to organize data into themes: actor power, ideas, political context and issue characteristics. Global mental health has gained political attention, especially over the past decade, yet support remains limited. Findings reveal that actor power is undermined by a fragmented policy community, the absence of one guiding institution or coordination mechanism and little civil society mobilization. Public portrayal of the issue is divided, hampered by the absence of a common understanding by the community and by stigma. Some policy windows have been missed and a strong global governance structure is lacking. Credible indicators and evidence on simple cost-effective solutions, especially in low- and middle-income countries, are scarce. However, opportunities are arising, including an increasing number of leaders and grassroots organizations, multiple arguments for action and integrated solutions resonating with broader audiences, widening political support at the national level, an emerging global governance structure and an expanding evidence base on the scale of the problem and available solutions. The results point to three technical and four political challenges that advocates need to address to increase political support over the next decade.","Iemmi","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czac046","20220628","COVID-19; Political priority; global mental health; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33484,""
"[Perception of the staff in training on patient's safety during the COVID-19 pandemic]","The recent pandemic has presented several challenges in relation to patient safety with the increase of cognitive, depressive and anxiety symptoms in health workers due to the fear of being infected from COVID-19.

"Young Adults' Mental Health and Unmet Service Needs in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic Across Canada and France","While young adults experienced mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about how their mental health needs were subsequently met through access to mental health services (MHS). From October to December 2020, we conducted an online survey of young adults (18-29Ã‚Â years) living in Canada and France to investigate factors associated with unmet MHS needs.

In both countries, those who identified as men and those who lost income due to COVID-19, were more likely to report unmet MHS needs. In Canada, participants from Quebec, those living in rural areas, and those who experienced ethno-racial discrimination had higher odds of reporting such unmet needs. Urgent investments are needed to improve access to MHS for young adults during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coulaud, Jesson, Bolduc, Ferlatte, Jenkins, Bertrand, Salway, Jauffret-Roustide, Knight","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-01000-1","20220628","COVID-19; Health care access; Mental health; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33486,""
"Comparing a Peer-presented vs Mental Health Service Provider-presented Mental Health Outreach Program for University Students: A Randomized Controlled Design","University students are reporting concerning levels of mental health distress and challenges. University mental health service provider (MHSP) initiatives have been shown to be effective in supporting students' mental health; but these services are often resource-intensive. Consequently, new approaches to service delivery such as online and peer support initiatives have emerged as cost-effective and efficient approaches to support university students. However, these approaches have not been sufficiently evaluated for effectiveness or acceptability in university student populations. Thus, the overarching goal of the present study was to evaluate a MHSP-presented versus peer-presented online mental health resilience-building video outreach program against a wait-list comparison group. Participants were 217 undergraduate students (Mage = 20.44 years, SD = 1.98, 78.8 % women) who were randomly assigned to one of the intervention groups (MHSP-presented (n = 69) or peer-presented (n = 73)) or the wait-list comparison group (n=75). Participants in the intervention groups were asked to watch three brief skills-building videos addressing strategies for building mental health resilience, while the comparison group was wait-listed. The MHSP-presented and peer-presented video series were identical in content, with presenters using a script to ensure consistency across delivery methods, but videos differed in which they were either presented by MHSPs or university students (peer). All participants were asked to complete online self-report measures of stress, coping self-efficacy, social support, social connectedness, mindfulness, and quality of life at baseline (Time 1), six weeks later (Time 2; post), and at a 1-month follow up (Time 3). Results from a series of two-way ANOVAs found no significant differences in outcomes between any of the three groups. Surprisingly, a main effect of time revealed that all students improved on several well-being outcomes. Additionally, results for program satisfaction revealed that both the MHSP-presented and peer-presented programs were rated very highly and at comparable levels. Thus, findings suggest that an online mental health resilience-building video outreach may be acceptable for university students regardless of if it is MHSP-presented or peer-presented. Furthermore, the overall increases in well-being across groups which coincided with the onset and early weeks of COVID-19 suggest an unexpected pattern of response amongst university students to the early period of the pandemic. Limitations and barriers as well as research implications are discussed.","Bastien, Boke, Mettler, Zito, Di Genova, Romano, Lewis, Whitley, Iyer, Heath","https://doi.org/10.2196/34168","20220628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33487,""
"An Examination of the Impact of Social and Cultural Traditions Contributing to Overweight and Obesity Among Black Women","Black women living in Prince George's (PG) County, Maryland, have high rates of overweight and obesity. Obesity significantly impacts Black women, leading to poor physical and mental health, decreased social well-being, and a financial strain on the healthcare system. Despite living in an affluent area and having middle to high incomes and high education levels, Black women living in PG County have difficulty managing their weight. This study explores how social and cultural factors and social networks impact the weight of Black women living in PG County, Maryland. A qualitative case study design guided by social cognitive theory was employed to conduct semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 15 women. Key social and cultural factors (income, family network, peer network, and living in PG County) influenced participants' attitudes and behaviors toward their weight and strategies to manage their weight. Additionally, participants expressed that Black culture is more accepting of larger and curvier body types, and this reinforces a positive body image and less desire to achieve an ideal BMI. Participants also expressed that COVID-19 impacted their weight management strategies. This study adds to the literature by better explaining some of the underlying factors that influence decision-making around weight management among Black women who live in PG County, Maryland.","Spinner","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319221098519","20220628","Black women; cultural traditions; obesity; overweight; social determinants of health; social network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33488,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patterns of cigarette, hookah and marijuana consumption among undergraduate students of University of Sarajevo Bosnia and Herzegovina: a repeated cross-sectional study","The aim of the study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patterns of cigarette, hookah and marijuana consumption among undergraduate students of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first part of the double cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate students of the University of Sarajevo from 22nd to 26th January 2020, prior to the first COVID-19 case in the country (study period 1), and the second part from March 25th to August 26th 2021, during the third wave of COVID- 19 outbreak (study period 2). The majority of the 1,230 respondents were women (N1 70.9%, N2 70.1%), pursuing medical sciences (N1 60.0%, N2 55.0%), in their 3rd year of study (N1 26.3%, N2 26.7%), and living in urban environment (N1 84.9%, N2 86.4%). Similar proportion of cigarette smokers (N1 38.5%, N2 39.2%), and smaller, similar portions of hookah smokers (N1 19.3%, N2 21.1%) were classified in both study periods, while the smallest portion of marijuana smokers (N2 8.0%) was classified during COVID-19. Similar number of cigarettes per day, types of cigarettes consumed and consumption frequency in the last 30 days, with the similar independent predictors of cigarette consumption (being woman and living in rural environment associated with decreased risk, and age older than 22 associated with increased risk) were identified both before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to before COVID-19 pandemic, increased trends in intentions (73.6% vs. 81.2%) and attempts (51.9% vs. 75.1%) to smoking cessation among cigarette smokers, but decreased determination not to smoke in the coming year among cigarette non-smokers (N1 72.2%, N2 51.6%) and decreased awareness of smoking harmfulness among both cigarette smokers (N1 68.0%, N2 46.5%) and especially cigarette nonsmokers (N1 60.9%, N2 22.9%) were seen during COVID-19 pandemic. Also, risky behavior among hookah smokers was evident during COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic seemed to positively affect intentions and attempts to smoking cessation among cigarette smokers while negatively affecting attitudes towards cigarette smoking among cigarette non-smokers.","Ã…Â ljivo, Ã„â€ etkoviÃ„â€¡, Kulo Ã„â€ esiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2022.2533","20220628","COVID-19; cigarettes; hookah; marijuana; students; survey; tobacco products","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33489,""

"Factors Related to Anxiety and Depression Among Adolescents During COVID-19: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and subsequent disease-containment measures (such as school closures) significantly affected the lives of adolescents. We evaluated the mental-health status and factors associated with anxiety and depression among South Korean adolescents. A nationwide online survey was conducted to evaluate the mental-health status of South Korean adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 570 adolescents aged 13-18 years were surveyed between May 27 and June 11, 2021. The participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to determine anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Stepwise logistic regression models were constructed to determine factors related to anxiety and depression. Among the study participants, 11.2% and 14.2% had anxiety and depression, respectively. The results suggested that several factors, such as the experience of COVID-19 infection and quarantine of oneself, a family member or an acquaintance, physical and mental health problems, and fear of one's local community being discriminated against as a COVID-19 area were related to anxiety and depression. The present study identified COVID-19-related factors associated with anxiety and depression among adolescents, and provides insights regarding potential interventions to improve the mental health of adolescents. To promote the mental health of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention should be paid to individuals with physical or mental-health problems, and efforts should be made to reduce the negative social and emotional impacts of infection-control measures.","Lee, Sung, Lee, Hyun, Kim, Lee, Paik, Kim, Sohn, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e199","20220628","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33491,""

To determine these changes, online searches in Google can be analyzed as an alternative measure. To determine the trends of public interest in mental health before and after the MH act approval and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregated search volumes for mental health using the keyword, ""Mental Health (Topic)"" were gathered from Google Trends. Search volume indices (SVIs), and related queries were analyzed. SVIs from the different periods were compared using means, <i>t</i> test, ANOVA, and ARIMA. Public interest in mental health increased after the MH Act approval and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The top and rising related queries revolved around mental health definitions, translations, factors, services, policy, adverse mental state, and its context during the pandemic. These increased public interests may stem from aspirations for mental health after legislation and higher mental health needs during the pandemic. Related queries may indicate that the public may be using online information to search for mental health services and concepts.

"Fear of childbirth in pregnancy was not increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study","Fear of childbirth is a well-known problem during pregnancy and can have implications for childbirth, including prolonged labor, use of epidural analgesia, obstetric complications, presence of traumatic stress symptoms, or request for an elective cesarean section. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected mental health and therefore could have increased fear of childbirth during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate fear of childbirth during the pandemic in the Netherlands compared with a reference group from before the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate pregnant women during the first and second waves of COVID-19 compared with both each other and with pregnant women from before the pandemic. Participants were recruited through social media platforms, hospitals, and midwifery practices. Pregnant women aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years who had mastered the Dutch language were eligible to participate. Fear of childbirth was measured with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire online using a cut-off score of Ã¢â€°Â¥85 to indicate clinically relevant fear of childbirth. The primary outcome was the prevalence of fear of childbirth. We undertook additional analyses to specifically look at possible effect modification. In total, 1102 pregnant women completed the questionnaire during the first wave of the pandemic, 731 during the second wave, and 364 before the pandemic. Fear of childbirth was present in 10.6%, 11.4%, and 18.4%, respectively. We considered possible effect modification, which indicated that age and parity had a significant influence. In participants during the first wave of COVID-19, nulliparous women had significantly lower odds (odds ratio [OR] 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.73; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) of having a fear of childbirth than did the reference group. Both younger participants in the first wave (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37-0.93; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and older participants in the first wave (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.28-0.71; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and the second wave (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.21-0.62; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) of COVID-19 had lower odds of fear of childbirth than the reference group. Pregnant women during the first and second waves of COVID-19 had lower fear of childbirth scores than pregnant women before the pandemic, indicating less fear of childbirth during the pandemic. This could be explained by an increased level of information, more time to consume information, and better work-life balance with more people working at home during the pandemic.","Zilver, Hendrix, Broekman, de Leeuw, de Groot, van Pampus","https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14409","20220628","COVID-19; Sars-Cov-2; anxiety; coronavirus; fear of childbirth; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33493,""

The sample group consists of 689 people living in different cities of Turkey. To collect the data Demographic Information Form, Covid 19 Pandemic Information Form and Beck Depression Inventory were employed. The rate of the participants who stated that violence, anger and arguments increased in the family is 28%. The rate of those who stated that they were exposed to emotional violence during this process is 11.5%. The mean depression level of all participants included in the study is 14.05. The findings show that the level of depression and domestic violence cases increased during the Covid process.

"Generalized anxiety disorder among mothers attending perinatal services during COVID-19 pandemic: using ordinal logistic regression model","Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events. It is critical to ensure a pregnant mother's mental health in order to reduce pregnancy and birth-related problems. The major goal of current study was to identify the factors associated with generalized anxiety disorder among mothers attending perinatal services in the study area during COVID-19 using ordinal logistic regression. The institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020 to August 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020 at Kembata Tembaro zone, Southern Ethiopia. The current study included 423 mothers. The GAD-7 scale was used to assess the anxiety level among mothers. An Ordered logit model was used to identify the determinants of GAD. Brant test of the parallel line was utilized to check proportionality assumption. The statistical significance was determined using an adjusted proportional odd ratio with a 95%CI, and a p-value &lt;5%. STATA software version 14 was used to analyze statistical data. Of all 423 mothers attending perinatal service during COVID-19; 134(31.7%), 171(40.4%), 85(20.1%), and 33 (7.8%) had non/minimal to severe generalized anxiety disorder respectively. The results of multivariable proportional odds model (POM) showed that the variables town residents [aPOR = 1.827; 95% CI:1.233-2.708], having alcohol habit [aPOR = 3.437, 95% CI = 1.397-8.454], having occupation [aPOR = 0.509, 95% CI: 0.303-0.857], being health care worker [aPOR = 0.117, 95% CI = 0.044-0.311], having chronic illness [aPOR = 7.685, 95% CI = 3.045-19.39], having family history of anxiety/mood disorder [aPOR = 7.839, 95% CI = 2.656-23.12], fear of contracting COVID-19 [aPOR = 1.704, 95% CI = 1.152-2.521], having moderate social support [aPOR = 0.648, 95% CI = 0.425-0.989], having strong social support [aPOR = 0.495, 95% CI = 0.272-0.901] were significantly associated with generalized anxiety disorder at 5% level of significance. Current findings concluded that the prevalence of GAD among mothers attending perinatal service during COVID-19 was high. The covariates like being town resident, lower-income status, occupation status, having a chronic illness, having a positive family history of anxiety or mood disorder, perceived social support, and fear of the COVID-19 were significantly associated with generalized anxiety disorder among mothers. Mothers who visit perinatal services should be given special consideration to improve health care services and ensure their mental health.","Lelisho, Merera, Tareke, Hassen, Jemal, Markos Kontuab, Bambo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09778","20220628","COVID-19; Generalized anxiety disorder; Mental health; Prenatal period","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33495,""

"Examining the Long-Term Sequelae of SARS-CoV2 Infection in Patients Seen in an Outpatient Psychiatric Department","The acute phase of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is well known. However, there is now an increasing number of patients suffering from the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with aÃ‚Â history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms and that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis), including neuropsychiatric symptoms. The purpose of this report is to describe the sociodemographic, diagnostic and treatment characteristics of patients evaluated in an outpatient psychiatric setting for PASC. A retrospective review of 30 individuals with documented COVID-19 illness treated at a university hospital-based Post-COVID-19 Recovery Program were referred to an outpatient psychiatric department for consultation and treatment from December 2020 to July 2021. All individuals complained of neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, depression, fatigue and cognitive problems. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnosis, prominent psychological themes and treatment prescribed were described and, where applicable, analyzed with SPSS software. The study population consisted of patients between 25 and 82 years old, with a predominance of women between 46 and 60 years. Approximately half of the patient population had a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder, often combined with prominent anxiety. Over two-thirds of the patient population reported a combination of depression, fatigue and cognitive complaints, predominantly memory and slowed processing speed. Prominent stressors and psychological themes included social and occupational decline, isolation, lack of empathy and understanding from family, friends and employers, and apprehension about future ability to return to their baseline level of function. Treatments recommended included individual and group psychotherapy, medication and cognitive rehabilitation. Modafinil and antidepressants, often in combination, were the most commonly used medications, intended to target the pervasive fatigue, depressive, and anxiety these individuals were facing. Clinical experience from this patient population underscored the significant medical, emotional, neurocognitive and functional sequelae of PASC. Management of these individuals requires a collaborative approach with the availability of psychotherapeutic interventions, pharmacologic treatment, neurocognitive assessment and remediation to address these symptoms.","Farooqi, Khan, Jacobs, D'Souza, Consiglio, Karmen, Dornbush, Hasnat, Ferrando","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S357262","20220628","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fatigue; long-term sequelae; modafinil","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33497,""
"Social Networking Use Across Gender: Its Association with Social Connectedness and Happiness Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","With the increasing popularity of social networking platforms, it serves a greater purpose that is no longer contained simply as a means of social leisure. Social networking sites (SNSs) form and maintain social interactions. Various phenomena revolve around how this usage is associated with certain behaviors, such as keeping social ties online and affecting well-being. It is vital to understand how SNSs may affect users differently during this time, viewing this in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Moreover, studies have also suggested that gender plays a role in these behaviors. The present study investigated SNS use and showed evidence of its association with social connectedness and happiness across gender during the COVID-19 pandemic. We empirically examined the association of social networking use with the sense of social connectedness and state of happiness among 420 Generation Z Filipinos (31.4% male) aged 18 to 27. We found that social networking use is not associated with either social connectedness or happiness. Multiple-sample path analysis was performed to investigate further the association between social networking site use, social connectedness, and happiness across gender. SNS use for male participants during stress-related periods predicted decreased social connectedness and happiness levels. General motives for use, or reasons people are likely to use SNSs, also predicted reduced happiness levels among males. Overall, the findings suggest that SNS use by itself may not be sufficient to influence substantial change in social connectedness and happiness and that gender alter the ways of SNS use, given its importance as a crucial channel for communication at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reyes, Morales, Javier, Ng, Zsila","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-022-00262-6","20220628","Generation Z; Happiness; Social connectedness; Social networking use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33498,""
"Role of positive mental health in reducing fears related to COVID-19 and general anxiety disorder in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed multiple challenges to healthcare systems. Evidence suggests that mental well-being is badly affected due to compliance with preventative measures in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore the role of positive mental health (subjective sense of wellbeing) to cope with fears related to COVID-19 and general anxiety disorder in the Pashtun community in Pakistan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 501 respondents from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa participating in an online-based study. We performed correlational analysis, hierarchical linear regression and structural equational modeling (SEM) to analyze the role of mental health in reducing fears and general anxiety disorder. The results of the SEM show that positive mental health has direct effects in reducing the fear related to COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.244, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and general anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.210, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Associations between fear of COVID-19, dental anxiety, and psychological distress among Iranian adolescents","The present study evaluated the association of fear of COVID-19 with dental anxiety, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), and psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), as well as exploring the mediating role of dental anxiety in the association of fear of COVID-19 with OHRQoL and psychological distress. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents in high schools of Qazvin city (Iran) from March-June 2021, recruited through a two-stage cluster sampling method. All the adolescents completed a self-administered survey assessing (i) fear of COVID-19, (ii) depression, anxiety and stress, (iii) OHRQoL, and (iv) dental anxiety. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate all the hypothesised associations, and the model fit was estimated. A total of 2429 adolescents participated in the study. The conceptual model fitted the data well. Fear of COVID-19 had a direct effect on dental anxiety (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.316; bias-corrected bootstrapping 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.282, 0.349), depression (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.302; bias-corrected bootstrapping 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.259, 0.347), anxiety (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.289; bias-corrected bootstrapping 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.246, 0.334), stress (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.282; bias-corrected bootstrapping 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.237, 0.328), and OHRQoL (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.354; bias-corrected bootstrapping 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.530, -0.183). Also, dental anxiety mediated the association of fear of COVID-19 with depression, anxiety stress, and OHRQoL. High levels of fear of COVID-19 were associated with high levels of dental anxiety and poorer OHRQoL. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 was positively associated with anxiety, depression and stress. Increased levels of dental anxiety were also associated with increased anxiety, stress, depression, and poorer OHRQoL.","Tofangchiha, Lin, Scheerman, BrostrÃƒÂ¶m, Ahonen, Griffiths, Tadakamadla, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41405-022-00112-w","20220627","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33500,""

"Evaluation of the perception of physical and emotional health of ophthalmologists in Spain and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The main objective was to study the perception of physical and emotional health of Spanish ophthalmologists and their health habits, as well as the possible influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. An observational, cross-sectional, non-randomized and uncontrolled study was carried out among at Spanish ophthalmologists through an online survey of 47 questions on eating habits, tobacco, alcohol, physical exercise, workload, and perception of physical and emotional state. Of a total of 2,179 ophthalmologists, 260 (11.9%) of whom 55% were men responded to the survey, with a mean age of 52.9Ã‚Â±11.4 years. 5.8% were smokers. In total, 51.5% reported good physical health, with a mean Body Mass Index of 24.4kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Overall, 53.5% reported depression, 66.9% tiredness, 34.6% difficulty sleeping, and 57.3% considered their work hard. Up to 28.5% of those surveyed had thought about leaving their job and 60.8% about reorganizing their workload. In total, 91.9% would continue to choose Ophthalmology as a specialty. In total, 36.2% reported an increase in workload, 42.3% worsening of physical state and 63.8% worsening of emotional state as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spanish ophthalmologists have a positive perception of their physical and emotional health, despite having life habits that are not always healthy and feeling mostly down. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative influence on the physical and emotional health of ophthalmologists.","Burgos-Blasco, Caballero-Linares, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-PÃƒÂ©rez, GegÃƒÂºndez-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-FeijÃƒÂ³o, Arriola-Villalobos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfo.2022.03.010","20220627","COVID; Emotional health; Ophtalmologie; Ophthalmology; Physical health; SantÃƒÂ© physique; SantÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©motionnelle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33502,""

"Rapid increase in depression within the first month of the Shanghai Covid lockdown in 2022","In the global efforts to combat Covid-19, researchers have increasingly recognized the profound impacts of society lockdown on population mental health. However, the fine temporal evolution of negative psychological consequences induced by lockdowns remains poorly understood. Here we report a rapid and systematic increase in depression due to the Shanghai Covid lockdown in March 2022. Measured by Beck Depression Inventory-2, 10% of the participants experienced at least mild depression before the official citywide lockdown started, and two and four weeks later this number increased to 21% and 36 %, respectively. Regression analyses show that lockdown duration and physical restriction jointly contribute to worsening depression. Furthermore, the time of sleep and social communication during the lockdown are associated with the severity of depression symptoms. These results highlight the fast development of depression during lockdowns and call for special attention to early psychological interventions once a lockdown is initiated.","RU-YUAN ZHANG et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0067-BCB-D99","20220629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","",33504,""
