"Analysis of mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums: a natural language processing study","Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users. We obtained data from three leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19. (1) Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19 keywords; (2) proportion of forum users making their very first post about COVID-19; (3) proportion of COVID-19-related posts containing content related to physical and mental health comorbidities. Data from 739 434 posts created by 53 134 unique users were analysed. A total of 35 581 posts (4.8%) contained a COVID-19 keyword. Posts discussing COVID-19 and related comorbid disorders spiked in early March to mid-March around the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of users to post on online health forums for the first time. Over a quarter of COVID-19-related thread titles mentioned a physical or mental health comorbidity. We demonstrate that it is feasible to characterise the content of online health forum user posts regarding COVID-19 and measure changes over time. The pandemic and corresponding public response has had a significant impact on posters' queries regarding mental health. Social media data sources such as online health forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental health surveillance.","Patel, Smeraldi, Abdollahyan, Irving, Bessant","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056601","20211106","COVID-19; health informatics; information technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-07","",21308,""
"Emotional Correlates of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Individuals With and Without Diabetes","To compare the mental health experiences associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults with and without diabetes. Between 29 May 2020 and 30 June 2020, 2,176 U.S. adults completed an online survey including demographics, COVID-19 experiences, depression (eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder) symptoms, perceived stress (17-item Diabetes Distress Scale), resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), and diabetes-related distress (in participants with diabetes). Mean age was 49.6 years (SD 16.9); participants were primarily women (80.0%) and White (88.3%), with an annual household income of Ã¢â€°Â¥$60,000 (57.6%). One hundred reported a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (4.6%), 304 type 2 diabetes (13.9%), and 145 prediabetes (6.6%). Nearly one-third (29.7%) indicated decreases in income attributable to the pandemic. Participants with type 1 diabetes had higher levels of diabetes distress than participants with type 2 diabetes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), with moderate severity in both groups. Participants with type 2 diabetes had significantly more comorbidities and COVID-19 risk factors than all other groups (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). After controlling for covariates, participants with type 2 diabetes reported significantly more depressive symptoms than those without diabetes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and lower levels of resilience (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Subgroup analyses by sex and age indicated that women and younger adults, particularly those age 18-34 years, reported significantly more depression and anxiety symptoms, stress, and diabetes-related distress and lower levels of resilience than men and adults age Ã¢â€°Â¥51 years. In this naturalistic observational study, participants with type 2 diabetes reported more depression, lower resilience, and significantly more COVID-19 risk factors and medical comorbidities than participants without diabetes. Overall, our participants demonstrated worse depression and anxiety symptoms during compared with before the pandemic.","Myers, Klingensmith, de Groot","https://doi.org/10.2337/dc21-0769","20211106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-07","",21309,""
"Prevalence Rates of Anxiety, Depressive, and Eating Pathology Symptoms between the Pre- and Peri-COVID-19 Eras: A Meta-Analysis","COVID-19 emerged in 2019 and has since killed more than two and a half million people worldwide. Several studies have investigated the role of COVID-19 on the prevalence of mental health outcomes, with general findings indicating elevated rates of mental health issues as compared to the pre-COVID-19 era. However, the effect of specific demographic features is less clear. As such, we investigated whether anxiety, depressive, and eating pathology symptoms varied by gender, age, status as a medical provider (compared to the general public), race, or region of origin. Forty-three effect sizes from 36 studies indicated that all three symptoms increased from pre- to peri-COVID-19-eras across all regions. No symptom varied by age, status as a medical provider, or race, though females were significantly more likely to experience eating pathology than males. Findings from our study indicate that worldwide, regardless of age, status as a medical provider, race, or region of origin, respondents experienced significantly elevated rates of psychopathology symptoms during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schafer, Lieberman, Sever, Joiner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.115","20211106","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Eating Pathology; SARS-COV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-07","",21310,""
"Psychiatric symptoms and moral injury among US healthcare workers in the COVID-19 era","Emerging cross-sectional data indicate that healthcare workers (HCWs) in the COVID-19 era face particular mental health risks. Moral injury - a betrayal of one's values and beliefs, is a potential concern for HCWs who witness the devastating impact of acute COVID-19 illness while too often feeling helpless to respond. This study longitudinally examined rates of depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and moral injury among United States HCWs in the COVID-19 era. We anticipated finding high levels of clinical symptoms and moral injury that would remain stable over time. We also expected to find positive correlations between clinical symptoms and moral injury. This three-wave study assessed clinical symptoms and moral injury among 350 HCWs at baseline, 30, and 90Ã¢â‚¬â€°days between September and December 2020. Anxiety, depression, PTSD, and moral injury were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD), and Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES). Of the 350 HCWs, 72% reported probable anxiety, depression, and/or PTSD disorders at baseline, 62% at day 30, and 64% at day 90. High level of moral injury was associated with a range of psychopathology including suicidal ideation, especially among healthcare workers self-reporting COVID-19 exposure. Findings demonstrate broad, persisting, and diverse mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among United States HCWs. This study is the first to longitudinally examine the relationships between moral injury and psychopathology among HCWs, emphasizing the need to increase HCWs' access to mental healthcare.","Amsalem, Lazarov, Markowitz, Naiman, Smith, Dixon, Neria","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03565-9","20211106","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare; Moral injury; PTSD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-07","",21311,""
