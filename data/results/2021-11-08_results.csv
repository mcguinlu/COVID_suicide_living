"Digital medical education and students' mental health: effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Purpose Medical education was challenged and re-imagined during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to examine the consequent changes in medical school curricula alongside students' mental and physical health. Design/methodology/approach It is observed that 549 medical students (response rate: 79.7%) from 31 of 37 public medical schools in Germany completed a cross-sectional online survey. Students answered questions regarding teaching, internet use, COVID-19 and well-being. A multivariate logistic regression examined factors associated with depressed mood, insomnia and headache. Findings Academic teaching moved to a virtual environment (91%), whilst practical activities were suspended or cancelled (88%). Virtual teaching modality, quantity and quality were well-perceived, yet 35% of respondents were dissatisfied with their internet connection. Consequently, students worried about the pandemic's adverse effect on their quality as a doctor (60%) and thought about postponing their studies (30%). Students were frequently engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 patients (36%). Daily screen time was significantly associated with depressed mood, insomnia and headache. Negative changes in mental and physical health were frequently observed. Research limitations/implications Students' experience with digital education during the COVID-19 pandemic was mixed. Whilst teaching modality, quantity and quality were well-perceived, students' mental and physical health deteriorated. Further longitudinal studies investigating the impact of digital education on students' well-being are necessary. Practical implications Besides teaching, faculties must quickly digitalize and strengthen social communities and offer targeted support services for students. Originality/value This is the first cross-sectional survey exploring medical students' experience with virtual medical teaching alongside their mental and physical well-being in Germany.","Michaeli, D.; Keough, G.; Strotzer, Q.; Michaeli, T.","https://doi.org/10.1108/jmhtep-03-2021-0035","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Training Education and Practice; ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print):18, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Training Education and Practice; ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print):18, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21313,""
"Motivating or stigmatising? The public health and media messaging surrounding COVID-19 and obesity: a qualitative think aloud study","Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how individuals with overweight and obesity living in the UK respond to the public health and media messaging surrounding COVID-19 and obesity. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative interview study with a think aloud protocol. A total of 10 participants self-reported to have overweight, obesity or as actively trying to lose weight were recruited through social media and were asked to think aloud whilst exposed to four sets of public health and media materials describing the link between COVID-19 and obesity. Interviews were conducted over zoom, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Findings Three primary themes were identified through thematic analysis: ""flawed messaging"", ""COVID-19 as a teachable moment"" and ""barriers to change"". Transcending these themes was the notion of balance. Whilst the messaging around COVID-19 and obesity was deemed problematic;for some, it was a teachable moment to facilitate change when their future self and physical health was prioritised. Yet, when focussing on their mental health in the present participants felt more overwhelmed by the barriers and were less likely to take the opportunity to change. Practical implications Findings hold implications for public health messaging, highlighting the need for balance between being educational and informative but also supportive, so as to achieve maximum efficacy. Originality/value This study offers a novel and useful insight into how the public health and media messaging concerning COVID-19 risk and obesity is perceived by those with overweight and obesity.","Stewart, S.

"Characteristics and Outcomes of Psychiatric Inpatients With Severe Mental Illness and COVID-19: Experience From a COVID-19-Specific Acute Psychiatric Ward in Istanbul","ABSTRACT: Recent studies indicated that psychiatric inpatients with severe mental illness (SMI) are at a greater risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. However, there is still little data about the impact of comorbid COVID-19 infection on the course and outcome of acute exacerbations in this population. We conducted a prospective historically matched case control study. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of acute psychiatric inpatients with SMI and comorbid COVID-19 (n = 21) were compared with those of historically-matched non-COVID-19 controls with SMI (n = 42). The outcomes for acute inpatients with SMI and COVID-19 were also investigated. The new-onset SMI rate was relatively higher (23.8%) in the COVID-19 group, which has characteristics similar to those of the non-COVID-19 group except for working status (p &lt; 0.05). The COVID-19 group had a high rate of relapse (47.6%) within 6 months of discharge. Our study suggests that patients with SMI who contracted SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher rate of new-onset mental disorder. Considering the high rate of relapse during the pandemic, chronically ill patients with SMI and COVID-19 should be closely monitored after discharge.","Yalcin, M.; Sonmez Gungor, E.; Ergelen, M.; Besikci Keles, D.; Yerebakan Tuzer, M.; Ocek Bas, T.; Gunes, M.; Genc, D.; Kirsavoglu, B.; Metin, M.; Bulbul, A.; Kayacan, A.","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001450","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease; 26:26, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease; 26:26, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21315,""
"SMILE: Sustaining medical education in a lockdown environment Student perceptions of a free online access medical education platform as an adjunct to the traditional undergraduate curriculum during lockdown","Introduction: The coronavirus outbreak has had significant impact on medical students worldwide. SMILE is a free online access medical education (FOAMed) platform. SMILE delivered 200 lectures during lockdown with up to 1400 students per session from both UK medical schools and 33 abroad. Here we discuss student perceptions to SMILE during lockdown Method: An electronic survey was used to collect information from students who had utilised the platform during lockdown. This examined access to learning, impact on their mental health during lockdown and the differences between FOAMed and more traditional based campus lecture based learning. Results: 1306 students responded to the anonymous survey with 94% of students stating SMILE had been 'extremely useful' or 'very useful' at supplementing learning during covid. 71% of students stated lockdown had affected their stress levels and 44% reported deterioration in their mental health. &gt;80% felt SMILE improved stress levels by adding structure and providing motivation. Students attended 4.3hours/week of university teaching, vs 7.9hours/ week by SMILE. Positives included: anonymity, making 80% more likely to both ask and answer questions, the informal approach, ease of access and enthusiastic teachers. Negatives included time differences and technical issues such as poor Internet. 98% stated they would be interested in future SMILE projects post lockdown Conclusions: SMILE addressed challenges identified during an unanticipated transition towards the online provision of medical education on an international scale. Students found SMILE lectures effective, accessible and safe, supporting FOAMed as part of the 'new normal' post lockdown.","Pascoe, J.; Foster, P.; Quddus, M.; Kosti, A.; Guest, F.; Stevens, S.; Bamford, R.; Coulston, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsopen/zrab032.110","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: BJS Open; 5(SUPPL 1):i31, 2021.; Publication details: BJS Open; 5(SUPPL 1):i31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21316,""
"Preliminary findings on patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry-a systematic review","Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health services have been presented with the unique challenge of providing effective and safe patient care whilst maintaining safety regulations. Telepsychiatry has emerged as a potential solution to this and is now being used across the UK to diagnose and manage mental health conditions. Evidence has shown that its effectiveness is comparable to face to face consultations, however, is much less clear regarding patient satisfaction. We therefore initiated a systematic review to establish whether patients are satisfied with tele-delivery of psychiatric care, and to identify the predictors of a positive experience with telepsychiatry. Methods: A preliminary search was performed using five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO), with a date restriction between 2010-2020 to reflect advances in technology over the past decade. Results: Preliminary data shows that patient views on telepsychiatric services are largely positive. Factors that arose in literature potentially affecting this include location, cost, privacy, digital literacy and technological issues including audio/video quality. Conclusion: Our study so far shows that patient views on telepsychiatry are generally positive. The review is still in process, however, we anticipate that it will only further support our preliminary findings. These findings will be used to improve patient-centred delivery and provision of telepsychiatric services. We intend to produce a checklist of factors affecting patient satisfaction and test this in a national multicentre study. We are hoping that the study results and the resulting checklist will encourage greater patient involvement in setting up and delivering telepsychiatric services.","Tokell, M.; Lin, C. M.

"Paradigms about the COVID-19 pandemic: Knowledge, attitudes and practices from medical students","Introduction: As new coronavirus has spread globally, economic instability in healthcare systems has been significant. This reality is especially accentuated in Ecuador where, the shortage of healthcare workers combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors have led it to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation of medical students on the front line is indispensable. Appropriate training on COVID-19 is an urgent need that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices in Ecuadorian final year medical students in order to identify the knowledge gaps, perceptions and behavior patterns which could guide the desig3n of better medical education curricula regarding COVID-19. Methods: This descriptive 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 20 sent by email and by Facebook and WhatsApp. Results: 309 students responded to the survey. 88% scored high (= 70% correct) for knowledge of the disease. The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of COVID19 in Ecuador and volunteering during the outbreak (77%, and 58% of the students, respectively). Moreover, 91% of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment or training in their health facilities. Conclusions: Ecuador has a capable upcoming workforce that could benefit from an opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training in preparation for COVID-19. Creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways for all students to be trained, while simultaneously focusing on the students' most pressing concerns.","Lincango-Naranjo, E.; Solis-Pazmino, P.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsopen/zrab032.086","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: BJS Open; 5(SUPPL 1):i24, 2021.; Publication details: BJS Open; 5(SUPPL 1):i24, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21318,""
"Mental health presentations to a UK tertiary children's emergency department during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to 2019","Introduction: Observational study exploring the differences between the number and severity of mental health presentations to a Children's Emergency Department over a 2-month period during the Covid-19 Pandemic (2020) compared to the same months in 2019. Additionally, exploration of the possible impact of the introduction of a hotline giving clinicians access to 24/7 Children's and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) advice. Methods: Identification of mental health presentations in children = 16 years from coded admission data. Data collected included basic demographics, presenting complaint, final diagnosis, mental health Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) outcome and timings of review, referral and discharge. Results: 141 cases were examined (2019-n=79, 2020-n=62). During the Covid-19 pandemic 18.9% (n=10) scored high on the RAM and 64.2% (n=34) scored moderate whilst in 2019, 17.2% (n=11) scored high on the RAM and 69.4% (n=38) scored moderate. 2019 data saw 25.3% (n=20) discharged directly compared to 37.1% (n=23) in 2020. In 2020, 26 (42.6%) of CAMHS reviews were via telephone compared to nine (12.3%) in 2019. Overnight (20:00-08:00), in 2019, there were 37 (46.8%) presentations, 86.5% (n=32) of which required admission and in 2020 there were 36 (58.1%) where 75.0% (n=27) required admission. Conclusion: A higher number of presentations was not seen in the CED despite the potentially adverse psychological effects caused by enforced isolation due to Covid-19. The provision of a 24/7 hotline may have contributed to clinician's decision to discharge, aiding a higher number of out of hours discharges.","Groome, R.; Jain, N.; Henderson, S.; Green, M.; Hand, C.; Cuellar, B.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsopen/zrab032.080","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: BJS Open; 5(SUPPL 1):i23, 2021.; Publication details: BJS Open; 5(SUPPL 1):i23, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21319,""
"Park usersâ€™ perception and preference of public park in Bogor City post Large Scale Social Restriction (LSSR)","On 31st March 2020, Indonesia pulls out a large scale social restriction (LSSR) policy to depress the spread of Covid19. The regulation leads to the lay-off of schools, workplaces, worship places, and public facilities, including public parks. Despite the time, it is only a matter of time until the new normal and reopening of all public facilities. For that, public parks as public facilities should be prepared in a way before it is reopened so as not to worsen the situation or even create a new pandemic wave. It is an excellent opportunity to build better by applying health protocol for a healthier future, and transforming the future sustainable landscape. This research is studying two public parks in Bogor City, a satellite city of the megapolitan Jakarta area, which affected the most by Covid19, i.e.,, Sempur Park and Kencana Park. This research aims to explore usersâ€™ perceptions and preferences of using public parks to plan health protocol for public parks in the new normal era. Data collected through an online questionnaire survey. As much as 192 responses are analyzed. Data and instruments are valid and reliable, with an overall Cronbach alpha value of 0.896. Results showed that the perception of park use pre-LSSR and post-LSSR was significantly different. The trend of park use was similar but at different levels. This indicates that the motivation and willingness to visit and use public parks is decreasing, therefore applying health protocol is a necessity in the future. This study also found that existing parks perceived to be quite appropriate in accordance with health protocols and need to be moderately modified. Another finding was that the considered most required health protocols application were procurement of handwashing facility, park benches placed at least 1 meter apart, and solitary park bench. It is elicited that despite the type of park, the visitorsâ€™ preference was the same.","Fithriyah, A.

"A symptom-based definition of resilience in times of pandemics: Patterns of psychological responses over time and their predictors","Background: It has been suggested that resilience is best conceptualized as healthy and stable functioning in the face of a potentially traumatic event. However, most research on this field has focused on self-reported resilience, and other patterns of response when facing adversity, in cross-sectional designs. Objective: Alternatively, we aimed to study changing patterns of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population, based on patterns of symptoms, and factors contributing to those patterns. Method: A national representative sample of Spain (N = 1,628) responded to an internet-based survey at two assessment points, separated by 1 month (April and May 2020), during the official national confinement stage. Based upon whether participants exhibited absence/presence of distress (i.e., significant trauma-related, depression, or anxiety symptoms) at one or two of the assessment times, patterns of psychological responses were defined by categorizing individuals into one of the four categories: Resilience, Delayed distress, Recovered, and Sustained distress. Results: Analyses of the levels of disturbance associated with the symptoms provided support to that four-fold distinction of patterns of responses. Furthermore, resilience responses were the most common psychological response to the pandemic. Multinomial regression analyses revealed that the main variables increasing the probability of resilience to COVID-19 were being male, older, having no history of mental health difficulties, higher levels of psychological well-being and high identification with all humanity. Also, having low scores in several variables (i.e., anxiety and economic threat due to COVID-19, substance use during the confinement, intolerance to uncertainty, death anxiety, loneliness, and suspiciousness) was a significant predictor of a resilient response to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with previous literature that conceptualizes resilience as a dynamic process. The clinical implications of significant predictors of the resilience and the rest of psychological patterns of response are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Spanish) Antecedentes: Se ha sugerido que la mejor manera de conceptualizar la resiliencia es como un funcionamiento saludable y estable ante un evento potencialmente traumatico. Sin embargo, la mayor parte de las investigaciones sobre la resiliencia y otras pautas de respuesta ante la adversidad se han centrado en el uso de cuestionarios de autoinforme de resiliencia en disenos transversales. Objetivo: Alternativamente, nuestro objetivo fue estudiar los cambios en los patrones de las respuestas psicologicas a la pandemia de COVID-19 en la poblacion general y analizar de manera empirica las caracteristicas que contribuyen a la respuesta resiliente. Metodos: Se utilizo una muestra nacional representativa espanola (N=1.628), que respondio a una encuesta realizada a traves de Internet, en dos momentos de evaluacion, separados por un mes, durante la etapa de confinamiento asociada a la pandemia (Abril y Mayo 2020). Se definieron los patrones de respuesta psicologica en funcion de la ausencia/presencia de malestar (v.g., sintomas significativos de estres post-traumatico, depresion y Ansiedad) en los dos momentos de evaluacion, clasificando a los individuos en: resiliencia, malestar tardio, recuperacion y malestar sostenido. Resultados: Analisis de los niveles de interferencia apoyaron estos cuatro de patrones dinamicos de respuesta psicologica. Ademas, la respuesta de resiliencia fue la mas comun frente a la pandemia. Un analisis de regresion multinomial indico que los predictores de una mayor probabilidad de resiliencia fueron ser hombre, tener mas edad, no tener antecedentes de salud mental, y altos niveles de identificacion con la humanidad y de bienestar psicologico. Ademas, bajos niveles en otras variables (ansiedad y amenaza economica debida a la pandemia, consumo de sustancias durante el confinamiento, intolerancia a la incertidumbre, ansiedad ante la muerte, soledad, y desconfianza) fueron tambien predictores significativos de una respuesta de resiliencia psicologica al COVID-19. Conclusion: Nuestros hallazgos estan en linea con la literatura previa que identifica la resiliencia como un patron de respuesta comun y un proceso dinamico. Se discuten las implicaciones clinicas de los predictores significativos de los cuatro diferentes patrones de respuesta.

"Care challenges of a cervical spinal cord injury patient during the COVID-19 pandemic","Context: 48-year-old uninsured female with a history of depression and anxiety admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic after sustaining a traumatic spinal cord injury (C4 ASIA A). She planned to discharge to her ex-husband's single level home with her mother as the primary caregiver;however, due to restrictions from the pandemic, her family was unable to gain sufficient training on her care. Ultimately, they opted to pursue long term placement as a result. Given her history of respiratory collapse and overall elevated risk for respiratory complications, care facilities expressed worry about severe respiratory complications should she become infected with the novel coronavirus. Unfortunately, she was therefore considered an unattractive candidate from a risk assessment standpoint. Additionally, bed availability was limited at this time from the multitude of outbreaks. To add, care facility representatives were also not able to assess her level of appropriateness in person. Findings: As such, she remains medically stable yet still hospitalized one year later. Conclusion/Clinical Relevance: While tetraplegic patients require a high level of skilled care in general, COVID- 19 created many more challenges in treating these complex rehab patients. From the visitor restrictions limiting family training opportunities to the lack of bed availability at long term facilities to the fear surrounding respiratory compromise, the ability to advocate and care for this patient population can be increasingly difficult at this time.","Tompary, A.; Yeste, K.; Cleveland, C.","https://doi.org/10.1080/10790268.2021.1959194","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine; 44(5):838-839, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine; 44(5):838-839, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21323,""
"Resilience and mental health in individuals with spinal cord injury during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Individuals with SCI face the same difficulties related to COVID-19 as others with disabilities, but also experience challenges related to the nature of SCI. Objective: Understand how concerns about medical rationing, access to personal care attendants (PCAs) and medical supplies, and resilience are related to overall and mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional findings from a longitudinal study. Methods: Data were collected online between May and August 2020 (N = 187). Primary outcomes were mental health, depression (PHQ-8) symptoms, anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), and quality of life (QoL Basic Data Set). Primary predictors were resilience and concerns about medical rationing, financial stability, access to PCAs and medical supplies, and social isolation. Ordinal logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to analyze the data. Results Observed: Perceived mental health was negatively associated with concern about medical rationing, social isolation, and age and positively associated with resilience. Anxiety was positively associated with concern about medical rationing and personal finances and negatively associated with resilience. Depressive symptoms were greater in those with incomplete compared to complete injury, positively associated with concern about medical rationing, social isolation, and personal finances and negatively associated with resilience. QoL was negatively associated with concern about medical rationing, social isolation, and personal finances and positively associated with resilience. Conclusions: Interventions increasing resilience and addressing concerns regarding medical rationing, social isolation, and financial insecurity may have positive mental health benefits for individuals with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Monden, K.

"Neuropsychiatric symptomatology after severe COVID-19 in older survivors","Background:The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, leading to increased concerns about long-term patientsâ€™ neuropsychiatric morbidity. Currently, there is still few data regarding mental health after hospital discharge of severe COVID-19 elderly patients. Considering this, the present study aims to characterize the neuropsychiatric morbidity in old severe COVID-19 patients.Methods:In the context of an ongoing multidisciplinary research project, this study analyzed a subsample of patients aged =60 years, admitted due to COVID-19, during the first wave, in the Intensive Care Medicine Department (ICMD) of a University Hospital in Porto, Portugal. ICMD length of stay (LoS) =24h, terminal illness, major auditory loss or inability to communicate at the time of follow- up were used as exclusion criteria. Participants were evaluated by telephone in average 99 (Â±32) days after being discharged from the hospital, with Six-item Cognitive Impairment Test, PatientHealth Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Sociodemographic and relevant clinicaldata were obtained from hospital electronic records and clinical interview.Results:A sample of 39 survivors with a mean age of 70 (Â±6.3) years old were assessed. The majority were male (62%), married (64%), retired (77%), with low educational level (59%), and 15% lived alone. The average number of comorbidities and the daily medications per patient were 4.7 (Â±1.7) and 5.5 (Â±3.5), respectively.During ICMD stay, 69% had nosocomial infections and 56% delirium. Deep sedation was used in 74% of the patients (mean=30 days) and 74% needed Invasive Mechanical Ventilation. ICMD mean LoS was33 (Â±28.3) days. Based on follow-up assessment, 18% of survivors had cognitive impairment, whereas23% and 15% had depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. A positive and high correlation between depression and anxiety was found (rs=0.792;p&lt;0.001). No significant associations were observed with cognitive impairment.Conclusions:The presence of this symptomatology may hinder a successful recovery once the patient is discharged back home. This is particularly relevant accruing the strong relationship between depressive and anxious symptoms found in this sample. Therefore, early screening and timely multidisciplinary support interventions to minimize these neuropsychiatric symptoms after discharge should be considered in order to achieve positive health outcomes.","Martins, SÃ³nia, Ferreira, Ana Rita, Fernandes, Joana, Vieira, Tatiana, Fontes, Liliana, Coimbra, Isabel, Paiva, JosÃ© Artur, Fernandes, Lia","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002544","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):98-99, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):98-99, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21326,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on elderlyâ€™s mental health","Background:Since the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, countries around the globe adopted measures of social distancing to limit the spread of the virus. Although social distancingmeasures are essential preventive mechanisms, they can promote feelings of loneliness and influence the onset or exacerbation of psychiatric disorders. Current knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health - and in particular on mental health of the geriatric population - is still scarce.Research Objective:The present review aimed to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the elderlyÂ´s mental health and to suggest measures that can mitigate this impact.Method:A non-systematic review of the literature, through bibliographic research in Pubmed and Embase databases - using the keywords â€œCOVID-19"", â€œSARS-CoV-2"", â€œCoronavirusâ€, â€œAgingâ€, â€œOlder adultsâ€, â€œElderlyâ€, â€œQuarantineâ€ and â€œMental healthâ€ -was performed.Preliminary results of the ongoing study:The available literature points towards a likely increase in mental disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomena may be particularly relevant in the elderly population. Several measures â€“ pharmacological and non-pharmacological â€“ can help to maintain the physical and mental health of the elderly.Conclusion:The COVID-19 pandemic had an important impact in elderlyâ€™s mental health. This subject should be addressed by profissionals/caregivers and measures tominimize negative consequences are in order.","Sofia Ramos, Ferreira, Pereira, Daniela, Firmino, HorÃ¡cio","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002519","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):96-97, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):96-97, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21327,""
"Caregiver Burden and Geriatric Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy in the COVID-19 Era","IntroductionCaregivers are essential in providing valuable patient information to medical providers. With limited available research investigating caregiver burden among those caring for patients receiving ECT and the new life challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important now than ever to take a closer look at the caregiversâ€™ experiences.MethodsEmoryâ€™s Wesley Woods Geriatric Hospital is one of the busiest ECT services in the country with around 2000 treatments completed every year. In this chart review, researchers are looking at caregiversâ€™ responses to the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. This assessment includes 22 questions assessing the caregiversâ€™ current emotional state in order to examine the impact of the patientâ€™s condition oncaregiver wellbeing. The score ranges from 0 (no burden) to 88 (severe burden). Other objective assessments completed with ECT patients are BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), BDI Suicide, Sheehan Disability Scale, ECCA (Electrocompulsive Cognitive Assessment), GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), and CGI (Clinical Global Impression). The purpose of this chart review is to investigate whether the higher severity of depression in patients correlates with higher levels of caregiver burden and whether the pandemic contributed to caregiver burden.ResultsThe Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview has been administered on twelve caregivers (n=12;6 male and 6 female), all providing care for patients currently undergoing ECT for depressive symptoms. Out of the twelve caregivers, 66.6% reported little caregiver burden, 16.6% reported mild to moderate burden, and 16.6% reported moderate to severe burden. Additional patients are being interviewed in the ECT suite and further data collected will be presented at the 2021 IPA Virtual International Congress.ConclusionAs the world adjusts to life in the COVID-19 era, caregivers face new challenges in providing care for vulnerable, at-risk populations. Caregivers of patients receiving ECT facilitate frequent COVID testing and limited visitation policies while continuing to provide care and emotional support to patients with advanced age and a mental illness. Administrating the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview can help providers look at the degree of burden in caregivers of patients receiving ECT for depressive symptoms and provide better caregiving strategies during and post pandemic.","Tsygankova, Valeriya, Grullon, Maria A.; Woolwine, Bobbi, Subler, Ashley, Schwab, Parker, Adriana, Patricia","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002453","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):92, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):92, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21328,""
"Cultural Considerations for Older LGBTQ Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case and Review","IntroductionThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been disproportionately impacted by both illness and fatalities. Of the nearly 39 million adults over age 65 in the United States, approximately 2.4 million older adults identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ). LGBTQ older adults face unique challenges due to their intersecting identities and histories, including the effects of heterosexism, ageism, and being more likely to live alone, be single, and not have children. As we implement social distancing as a primary COVID-19 prevention method, older adults have faced increased isolation.MethodsWe presented a case of a lesbian older adult patient who has experienced increased depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. A table will be added featuring culturally competent recommendations for LGBTQ older adults from a literature review.ResultsA 77-year-old female with history of major depression, attention deficit disorder, hypertension, xerostomia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient has been on multiple trials of medications for depression as well as ECT treatments. She was initially engaged to a man and after some years fell in love with a woman. The patient is currently single and has no children. She typically has a strong support system with her lifelong friend and attends church. She transitioned from independent living to an adult living facility, with the hope of increased social activity and connectedness. However, due to COVID-19, she experienced her move as extremely difficult, and was disappointed that all social activities were canceled. For a period of several months, she was unable to visit her chosen family, was limited to attending church via Zoom, and was restricted from multiple areas of the complex. As a result, she reported increased depression, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping with passive suicidal ideation due to isolation and no direct family support.ConclusionOlder LGBTQ populations are at disproportionately higher risk for mental health conditions and with the current social distancing measures in place, social isolation and loneliness has been exacerbated.Connection with accepting family and community are well documented in the literature as key protective factors and sources of resiliency in LGBTQ populations. Culturally competent care is integral to psychiatric treatment of older LGBTQ adults.Note:This abstract was presented at the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry 2021 Annual Meeting.","Grullon, M.

"Moderating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the efficacy of cognitive stimulation A controlled trial","Background:ItÂ´s been proved that cognitive stimulation (CS) has direct effects over the improvement of general cognitive functions in people with cognitive impairment (PCI). The restrictions in daily life associated to COVID-19 pandemic had an impact in the quality of life of PCI and it might have affected the efficacy of the CS programs targeting this population.Research Objective:To analyse if there was a moderating effect of the pandemic on the efficacy of CS programs.Method:Participants were enrolled in a public memory clinic;213 PCI were assigned to two groups: 173 received CS treatment before the pandemic (PRECOVID) and 40 received CS during the pandemic (COVID). Pre and post assessments were carried out with the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), the clock-test and the brief Geriatric Depression Scale. The treatment consisted of 32 sessions of CS held twice a week during 4 months. No significant differences (p&lt;.05) were found between groups at baseline in age (74.46Â±7.80 years), cognitive function (MMSE=23.43Â±3.30), gender (58% women) and the remaining variables.Preliminary results of the ongoing study:After treatment, both samples improved in depression (t = 4.56, p &lt; .05), the COVID group improved in MMSE (t = -3.40, p &lt; .05) and clock-test (t= -3.78, p &lt; .05), the rest of the changes were not significant. Between group effect sizes favoured the COVID group intervention for MMSE (dc = 0.74) and the clock test (dc = 0.48). No between group differences were found for depression (dc = -0.48).Conclusions:Older people participating of CS during the pandemic benefited more from the treatment than those participating before the pandemic. This apparently contradictory result might be explained by the context of lack of social, emotional and cognitive stimulation associated to the restrictions inherent to social confinement. The continuity of CS care to PCI is essential in the context of generalised restrictions in daily life associated to COVID-19 pandemic and might play an important role in preventing cognitive loss and associated disabilities.","Gurbindo-Elizari, MÂª ConcepciÃ³n, MartÃ­nez-MartÃ­nez, Blanca, Garcia-Casal, J.

"Loneliness and social isolation in attendees of a Psychiatry of Old Age Service in the North West of Ireland: preliminary findings of a cross-sectional study during the COVID- 19 pandemic","Aims and HypothesisThe primary aim is to establish the prevalence of loneliness and social isolation in older adults referred to a Psychiatry of Old-Age Service in the North-West of Ireland. Secondary aims include exploring associations between loneliness, social isolation and, well-being, depression, cognition and health- status. The overarching aim was to improve patient outcomes by tailoring mental health and social interventions appropriate to patient need.BackgroundLoneliness is a discrepancy between the social-relations one has and their desired level. It is estimated that one third of older adults will experience loneliness, which along with social isolation has links to poorer health-outcomes, reduced quality of life and cognitive decline. Government advice in Ireland to reduce social activity due to COVID-19 pandemic may compound social disconnection. We present preliminary findings of an ongoing study investigating loneliness, social isolation and related factors in older adults referred to a Mental-Health Service in the North-West of Ireland in 2020 - 2021.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional study design, participants completed University of California, Los-Angeles(UCLA) Loneliness Scale (UCLA maximum score =10);and Berkman-Syme Social Network Index. Quality of life is measured using WHO-Well-being Index(WHO-5) with a number of relevant personal, clinical and social factors also captured.ResultsData from 98 questionnaires (January 2020- May 2021), 52% female, showed average participant age was 74.4 years. Average perceived loneliness score was 3.67 and 85.7%, (n=84) reported some loneliness (UCLA &gt;0) with 2% (n=2) reporting high loneliness levels (UCLA =10). The majority, 77.5% (n=76) were socially isolated;35.7% (n=35) â€˜mostly isolatedâ€™, 41.8% (n=41) â€˜moderately isolatedâ€™. Females were noted to be more isolated.ConclusionsPreliminary results illustrate majority of older adults referred to a mental-health service over a time- period spanning COVID-19 pandemic are lonely and socially isolated. This is likely compounded by changes to daily routines during COVID-19 pandemic. This is concerning given the adverse health implications. We hope final results will guide enhancement of clinical-care through linkage of mental- health services with community agencies, social-care supports and e-health technologies.","Rushe, Clodagh, Bernadette, Kevin, Maye, Ericka, Sweeney, Gavin, McLaughlin, Kevin, Cryan, Marguerite, Gannon, Aislinn, Vincent, Melvin, Cogan, Valerie, Wilkie, Donna, McDonagh, Elaine, McCarthy, Geraldine, Dolan, Catherine","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002301","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):79-80, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):79-80, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21331,""
"Grief in de elderly and its impact","IntroductionWith coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a lot of people have succumbed and older adults were disproportionately affected. (1,2) Also, grief is encountered frequently in clinical practice with the elderly, and can be defined as the natural response to the death of a loved one. Still, when a failure of adaptation occurs then a Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) can be diagnosed, which has been recently included in ICD-11. The principal feature of PGD is a persistent preoccupation or an intense longing for the deceased that lasts longer than 6 months after the death. (3)Objective:Comprehend the grief in the elderly and its implications in their health.Methods:The author conducted a literature review by searching the Pubmed database using the keywords elderly;grief;complicated grief;covid-19Results:PGD is relatively prevalent among the elderly and has been associated with some variables related to the death time of the deceased, being the prevalence inversely correlated with the deceasedâ€™s. (4, 5) Additionally, older adults present a higher risk of developing PGD when they are lesseducated, male, have poorer cognitive performance, and a history of depression. (3) PGD is characterized by sadness, fascination with or excessive avoidance of the memories associated with the deceased, the memory of the loss and mental ruminations about death. According to some investigations, PGD reduces life expectancy, increasing the odds of death, causes severe behavioural symptoms, and is associated with longer-term functional impairment. (4,5)Conclusion:Given these results, it is easy to understand the need for a closer monitoring of these patients during this global crisis. Moreover, it is also important to find new ways to do that while complying with COVID-19 rules and restrictions. A short-term evidence-based intervention for PGD effective in the elderly is based on support focused upon these seven themes: understanding their grief, managing emotional pain, thinkingabout the future, strengthening their relationships, telling the story of the dead, learning to live with reminders of the deceased, and connecting with memories.

"The impact of the Health Crisis on the psychological feeling of patients during the second wave of Covid-19 in Geriatric wards","ObjectivesDuring the Covid Health crisis, Belgium is one of the countries that currently counts a very high rate mortality among the elderly population.With more than 24,000 deaths, including more than 10 000 nursing home patients (for a total population of 11 million);this vulnerable population paid a heavy price during this pandemic. During the 2nd wave, we wanted to focus on the level of stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness among the Geriatric hospitalized population.MethodsThis prospective observational and multicentric study (CHU St Pierre and Hospital of Nivelles-Tubize) evaluated the psychological state of our patients hospitalized in Geriatrics from 16/11/2020 to 16/03/2021 (with a Minimal Mental State &gt; 20/30) according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and to the Perceived Stress Scale(PSS).We also estimated their feeling of loneliness. We analysed their biographical, social and medical data as well as their Global Geriatric Evaluation. We will also observe if there are difference between patient living in Nursing Home (NH) or at home.ResultsThe sample (n=81) has an average age of 85 years and is predominantly female. The majority were widows with an average of 2 children living at homeAmong the 81 geriatric inpatients, 30% scored positive for anxiety, rising to 57% with questionable cases. The depression scale was found to be certain for 17%, rising to 39% if doubtful cases are taken into account.We did not observe a significant difference between the two categories for the patients living at home or in Nursing Home. For the Perceived Stressed Scale, 65% had a high stress score, 15% a moderate score and 20% a low score. It can be noted that nursing home residents also suffer more from loneliness (56%) than people living at home (35%).ConclusionThis study confirms that the pandemic has had a deleterious effect on the mental state of our elderly during the 2nd wave despite some efforts to reduce isolation. The high mortality rate could be explained by government mismanagement, a delay in action in NH, but also by a latent ageism in Belgium which it would be good to analyze after the pandemic.","Higuet, S.; Berte, L.; Kromar, F.; Lelubre, C.; Praet, J.

"An audit of Lithium Prescribing Practices in an Old Age PsychiatryService highlighting renal impairment in this cohort","Aims:To compare Lithium prescribing practices in a Psychiatry of Old Age (POA) Service in the North-West ofIreland among adults aged 65 years and over with best practice guidelines.Methods:Review of the literature informed development of audit standards for Lithium prescribing. These included National Institute for Clinical Excellent (NICE) 2014 guidelines, The British National Formulary(2019) and Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines (2018). Data was collected retrospectively, using an audit-specific data collection tool, from clinical files of POA team caseload, aged 65 years or more and prescribed Lithium over the past year.Results:At the time of audit in February 2020, 18 patients were prescribed lithium, 67% female, average age 74.6 years. Of those prescribed Lithium;50% (n=9) had depression, 44% (n=8) had bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and 6% (n=1) schizoaffective disorder.78% (n= 14) of patients met the NICE standard of 3-monthly lithium level. Lithium levels were checkedon average 4.5 times in past year, average lithium level was 0.61mmol/L across the group and 39% (n=7) had lithium level within recommended therapeutic range (0.6-0.8mmol/L).83% of patients (n=15) met the NICE standards of 3 monthly renal tests. Taking into consideration mostrecent blood test results, 100% (n=18) had abnormal renal function.Half (n=9) were initiated on lithium by POA service and of these, 56% (n=5) had documented renal impairment prior to initiation. Of patients on long term lithium at time of referral (n=9), almost half (n=4) had a documented history of lithium toxicity.Conclusions:The results of this audit highlight room for improvement in lithium monitoring of older adults attending POA service. Furthermore, all patients prescribed lithium had impaired renal function. This is an important finding given the associations between those admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and co- morbid kidney disease and increased risk of inpatient death.Our findings highlight the need for three monthly renal function monitoring in elderly prescribed lithiumgiven the additive adverse effects of increasing age and lithium on the kidney. Close working with specialised renal services to provide timely advice on renal management for those with renal impairment prescribed lithium is important to minimise adverse patient outcomes.","Valentine, L.; Cannon, J.; Marmion, S.; Corcoran, M.; Cryan, M.; Carthy, G.

"Environmental stimuli in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons learned to improve the management of challenging behavior","Challenging behavior is common in nursing home residents, especially in those with dementia. Our previous study suggested that a decrease in environmental stimuli (i.e., events that take place around residents but are not specifically directed at them) in nursing homes due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect residents differently. To improve future care, the experience of practitioners can be used to learn about the effects of environmental stimuli on challenging behavior in specific resident groups during the pandemic.From the perspective of practitioners, this study aimed to learn from successful initiatives and observed effects of decreased environmental stimuli on challenging behavior in residents during anti-pandemic measures.An online survey among 199 Dutch nursing home practitioners was conducted from November 2020 to January 2021. Practitioners were asked about alleged effects of diminished environmental stimuli in residents with different types of challenging behavior (i.e., psychotic, depressed, anxious, agitated, apathetic) and with mild vs. advanced or without dementia. Also, their opinion about strategies to limit environmental stimuli was explored.Residents with advanced dementia and those with psychotic and agitated behavior seemed to benefit from diminished environmental stimuli. In contrast, residents without dementia and those with depressive and apathetic behavior seemed to be negatively affected by decreased environmental stimuli. Practitioners indicated that they would like to preserve various strategies to limit environmental stimuli in the future such as reducing the use of corridors adjacent to residentsâ€™ rooms. Also, they planned to use adjustments and new initiatives regarding organized activities such as an increased use of small-scale and person-oriented activities. Opinions were divided on receiving visitors in the living room and on imposing visiting hours. In open-ended questions, other initiatives were mentioned that can be useful in nursing home care.Various strategies and initiatives in nursing homes during the pandemic seem promising to meet individual needs. While many residents may be negatively affected by restrictions during the pandemic, specific resident groups may benefit from a decrease in environmental stimuli. These findings underline the importance of a good balance between stimuli and rest in the nursing home, tailored to an individual resident.","Knippenberg, Inge, Leontjevas, Ruslan, Nijsten, Johanna, Bakker, Christian, Koopmans, Raymond, Gerritsen, Debby","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001599","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):27-28, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):27-28, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21335,""
"Mental healthcare services and advocacy for older people amidst the COVID crisis: Voices from South Asia","Asia has some of the fastest developing economies and largest conglomerations of populations in the world. One such geographically unique region is South Asia, which accounts for nearly 25% of the global population and one-fifth of the psychiatric morbidity worldwide. This region is also ageing rapidly compared to rest of the world due to modifications in healthcare facilities, hygiene, and lifestyle as well as improved sanitation and infection control. Besides, some of the South Asian countries have also been worst-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic which has led to an exaggerated psychosocial crisis among their older people. Many of these nations face issues with community psychiatric care, trained manpower, socio-economic resources, legislation catering to psychological care and health inequalities. However, recent years have also witnessed paradigm shift in mental health policies, infrastructure and technology among these nations. Climate changes, migration, displacement and ecological characteristics further make South Asia unique in mental health needs and challenges.With this background, leaders in the field of psychogeriatric care from some of the South Asian nations come together to discuss and highlight upcoming strategies for mental health advocacy and service delivery among older people in these regions.

"A cross-country comparison of family carers experiences with residential aged care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background:The number of research projects into residential aged care (RAC) during the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing, however there are limited data on the cross-country comparison of experiences residents living with dementia and their families. Our study aimed to 1) give an overview of the RAC restrictions and changes (visiting policy, governmental & health authoritiesâ€™ advice, service delivery) implemented during the pandemic in Australia, Italy and the UK and 2) and their impact on people with dementia in RAC facilities and their families.Methods:A total of 56 informal family carers of people with dementia residing in RAC took part in semi- structured interviews over the telephone or via Skype in Australia (n=6), Italy (n=25) and the UK (n=26) between July 2020 and March 2021. The interviews were recorded and translated verbatim. Transcripts were analysed by researchers in each country using thematic analysis, then combined across sites.Results:Inductive thematic analysis identified four overarching themes: 1) Adaptations implemented in RAC facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, Italy and the UK;2) means of communication between RAC facility personnel, people with dementia living in RAC and family members;3) impact of the implemented restrictions and changes in care provision due to the COVID-19 pandemic on people with dementia in RAC facilities and 4) impact of the implemented restrictions and changes in care provision due to the COVID-19 pandemic on families of people with dementia in RAC facilities. While differences between countries and facilities were identified, the restrictions and changes within the residential care system impacted familiesâ€™ well-being, increased their worries about care quality and safety of people with dementia. The consequences of a lack or modified services for people with dementia included noticeable physical and mental health changes. Although the majority of the facilities implemented some form of video-communication between families and residents, those solutions were unable to replace face-to-face contact.Conclusions:These findings demonstrate the need for implementing safe solutions which might facilitate more frequent in-person contact between families and residents with dementia preventing consequences in mental and physical health in both groups.","Lion, Katarzyna M.; Giebel, Clarissa, Chirico, Ilaria, Cations, Monica, Chattat, Rabih, Gabbay, Mark, Moyle, Wendy, Ottoboni, Giovanni, Valente, Marco","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001575","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):26, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):26, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21337,""
"The use of technology by people with dementia and informal carers during COVID-19: a cross-country comparison","Background:Social distancing rules and the closure of services associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have strongly impacted the physical and mental health of people with dementia. Digital technologies can represent an effective means to compensate for the distress associated with social distancing rules and the decreased use of in-person services. More specifically, technologies such as smartphones, tablets, and smart home systems can minimize the negative effects of social distancing and isolation, and the pressure on health and care systems. Indeed, they can provide a continuity of care and social connectedness, while decreasing exposure to risk. However, barriers such as digital literacy and lower income households can impede the access and use of digital technologies. The aim of this international study was to compare the use of technology by people with dementia from different care settings, and their informal carers across four countries (Italy, UK, Australia, and Poland).Methods:People with dementia and informal carers were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Verbatim transcripts were analysed by researchers in each country using inductive thematic analysis.Results:A total of 141 people with dementia and carers (47 in Italy;50 in the UK;18 in Australia;26 in Poland) were interviewed. The analysis identified three overarching themes: 1) different uses of technology (three subthemes);2) benefits of technology (three subthemes);3) limitations of technology (three subthemes). Results show that calls, video calls, and group-chats were effectively used across countries to guarantee the continuity of relationships with professionals, families, and small groups of peers. Telemedicine was used with varying levels of satisfaction. Furthermore, the benefits experienced by carers exceeded those for people with dementia. Similar barriers were reported across countries, and were strictly associated with dementia deficits, low level digital literacy, and the need for carerâ€™s supervision.Conclusions:These international findings highlight the importance to maximise the benefits related to the use of technology according to people with dementiaâ€™s impairment and care context. Moreover, it should be complementary to in-person care which should be provided, at least to some extent, even during pandemic times.","Chirico, Ilaria, Giebel, Clarissa, Lion, Katarzyna, Mackowiak, Maria, Cations, Monica, Chattat, Rabih, Gabbay, Mark, Moyle, Wendy, PappadÃ , Alessandro, Rymaszewska, Joanna, Senczyszyn, Adrianna, Szczesniak, Dorota, Tetlow, Hilary, Trypka, Elzbieta, Valente, Marco, Ottoboni, Giovanni","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001563","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):25-26, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):25-26, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21338,""
"Social health of people with dementia during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Background:Limited access to medical and social services during the coronavirus outbreak has contributed to the exclusion of vulnerable populations, such as people with dementia and older adults. These limitations and the resulting social isolation have highlighted the importance of social relationships and their relationship to the mental health of these people. In the context of dementia, â€˜social healthâ€™ (SH) can be defined as the role of social abilities for achieving a dynamic balance between opportunities and limitations. The concept encompasses the capacity and independency of an individual to participate in social activities alongside the influences of the surrounding social network.Methods:Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, we will present social health and its determinants of people with dementia related to social care service closures and self-isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We present an analysis of the survey data from the cross-country population- based study and the semi-structured telephone interviews with people with and without dementia from Poland, UK, Australia and Italy aged 65 and over.Results:Measuring the Social Health Index in relation to experiencing self-isolation and changes in the use of services before and during the pandemic among the people with dementia, allow us to identify the level of SH and its determinants. Also, the qualitative results revealed the indirect consequences of the pandemic-related restrictions in the access to social care service and social isolation. Reduction of social support was significantly related to deficits in social health and well-being.Conclusions:Our results highlight the emerging impact of health the current global epidemiological situation upon social health, with a particular focus on those affected by social disadvantage and isolation.","Lenart, Marta, Mackowiak, Maria, Senczyszyn, Adrianna, Szczesniak, Dorota, Giebel, Clarissa, Chattat, Rabih, Gabbay, Mark, Lion, Katarzyna, Moyle, Wendy, Ottoboni, Giovanni, Rymaszewska, Joanna, Tetlow, Hilary, Trypka, Elzbieta, Valente, Marco, Chirico, Ilaria, Cations, Monica","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001551","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):24-25, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):24-25, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21339,""

"Involvement, Worries and Loneliness of Family Caregivers of People with Dementia during the COVID-19 Visitor-ban in Long-term Care Facilities","BackgroundTo prevent COVID-19 from spreading in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), the Dutch government took national restrictive measures, including a visitor-ban in LTCFs between mid-March and May 2020.Physical visits were replaced by alternatives as telephone or video calls. This study examines the relationship between the involvement of family caregivers (informal caregivers, ICs) of people with dementia (PwD) living in LTCFs and IC mental health during the visitor-ban. Furthermore, we examine whether this relationship is moderated by the frequency of contact with PwD during the visitor-ban and resilience of ICs.MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out, 375 Dutch long-term care organizations were invited by email to participate. LTCFs sent eligible ICs a link to an anonymous online survey. Family involvement was assessed by the visiting frequency and doing social (e.g. drinking coffee), or social and task-related (e.g. laundry) activities during visits before the visitor-ban.Results958 ICs of PwD participated. Contact frequency increased for 17% ICs and decreased for 25% compared to visiting frequency. 43% of ICs did only social activities and 57% social and task-related activities. ICs who visited their relatives at least once a week before the visitor-ban were more worried during the visitor-ban than those with less regular visits (main effect). Contact frequency during the visitor-ban was a moderating factor, ICs who visited the PwD daily before, but had at least weekly contact during the visitor-ban, worried less. No main effects for activity type were found on loneliness , however resilience was a moderating factor. Resilient ICs who did more diverse activities (task and social related) before the visitor-ban, experienced less loneliness during the visitor ban.ConclusionsThe results implicate that to reduce worries amongst ICs, LTCFs should facilitate in continuing contact with PwD during a visitor-ban, specifically in highly involved ICs. Also, non-resilient ICs that generally only do social activities are more prone to loneliness. It is advisable for healthcare and welfare professionals to reach out to this group, to help them with overcoming their loneliness.","Prins, Marleen, Willemse, Bernadette, van der Velden, Claudia, Pot, Anne Margriet, HenriÃ«tte van der, Roest","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001459","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):14, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21341,""
"Holocaust survivors residence in Israel and nursing homes around the world during COVID-19 pandemic","Significant risk factors for Covid-19 infection include old age ,somatic illnesses as well as psychiatric and neurological illnesses such as dementia and schizophrenia .This lecture reviews the specific case of measures and considerations that were used to protect elderly holocaust survivors with severe mental illness or dementia, in Israel. We had to protect our residents from the virus, yet preserve certain autonomy.In addition this lecture reviews global aspects of nursing homes struggle during the pandemic as reflected in various periods (at beginning in march 2020, during various waves and after vaccinations). During the pandemic 100 holocaust survivors were monitored and protected in their long term residence at Lev-Hasharon mental health center, Israel with variety of measures such as recurrent PCR tests to inpatients and staff, isolation during fever and after emergency department visits etc. The features of caregivers visits changed in time. The safety measures that were taken in our nursing home and around the world is reviewed as well as the demand for preserving the autonomy and rights of the tenants.At the beginning families could not visit at all and virtual contacts were maintained in patients that could communicate. After the first wave a ""drive in"" method was carried out, families communicated with their relatives from a car.During the second wave of the virus in Israel (September 2020), an outbreak spread in our residence. 14 patients tested positive for COVID19, all suffering from dementia or schizophrenia. They were immediately placed in quarantine in Corona departments in other geriatric and general hospitals. All patients came back after recovering, small part of them regressed.As the pandemic continued we allowed visits with social distance and masks that were monitored by the staff. After vaccinations we allowed families to be with the elderly patients in the open yard without staff inspection. Four patients were infected during the third wave, although they were immunized.We had to consider every step of the way protection versus some autonomy to our patients and families and weigh creative ways to do this.","Shelef, Assaf","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001393","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):9-10, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):9-10, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21342,""
"Psychological distress and support needs of community residing older adults in urban India â€“ An exploratory study","Background:COVID pandemic in India, lockdowns and an unprepared health system has affected wellbeing of older adults. Low public awareness about mental health issues and stigma also contribute to low help seeking. Exploring impact of COVID on mental health of older adults and understanding support needs is essential.Research Objective:To examine mental wellbeing and coping strategies used by urban community residing older adults during the pandemic in India.Method:As part of an ongoing community engagement initiative with older adults and their families, an online survey was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic in April/May 2020. Sociodemographic details and information on coping strategies were gathered. The five-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to screen for psychological distress and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Respondents were contacted again in May 2021 during the second COVID wave for a telephonic interview to understand current levels of distress and coping strategies. Consent was taken for audio recording and interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis.Preliminary results of the ongoing study:Respondents (N=54) aged between 40-86 years (Mn = 60;SD = 18.9). Majority were male (61%), retired or homemakers (57%) and widowed/unmarried (52%). Of the sample 70% had one or more pre-existing medical conditions. A score of = 2 on GHQ in 66% respondents indicates psychological distress. Stressors included health and well-being of family (62%), difficulty managing household work (42%) and increase in family conflicts (17%). Although 72% discussed their worries with family/friends, only 25% considered speaking with a mental health professional indicating low help seeking. Of respondents contacted again, 40% citied ill health or being busy as reasons for refusal to participate. Of those who agreed, 33% reported psychological distress. In-depth interviews, showed use of online mental wellness sessions and yoga/meditation to be beneficial coping strategies. Need for more online support groups was also highlighted.Conclusion:Psychological distress is present amongst community residing older adults in urban India. A change in attitude towards tele mental health must be leveraged to provide support for adults experiencing psychological distress.","Dasgupta, Jayashree, Chopra, Meenakshi","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001381","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):8-9, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):8-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21343,""
"Care Home Residents as Artists: Digital Connections in the age of Disconnect","Throughout the current global pandemic, many people have had to adapt to new ways of interacting through virtual platforms. For those with access to new technologies this transition has been straightforward, but not easy and for those without it, life has become socially isolating, frightening, and lonely. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of older adults is a serious concern, particularly for those living in care homes who have been forgotten or neglected by exclusionary government policy. Amnesty Internationalâ€™s 2020 report As if Expendable: The UK Governmentâ€™s Failure to Protect Older People in Care Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic provides analysis of the neglect to care and sufficiently support older adults living with dementia in supported living. The results of this inaction to provide care has led to many avoidable deaths, and caused fear and heartache for those who have lost family, friends and colleagues. It is at this moment, during the third UK lockdown that we would like to share a narrative of hope about the actions that we have taken within care home contexts to provide relief, reconnect residents safely with their neighbours, and found creative ways to inclusively provide care, support and celebrations of the identities of people in these contexts who have become statistics in news reports.Between January and March 2021, undergraduate and postgraduate Applied Theatre students from The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in partnership with Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust collaborated with residents from One Housing Association to create and develop bespoke films, poems, songs and virtual reality 360 videos from the safety of their homes to bring to life their stories, hopes and inner artists. In this presentation, we will explore the impact of these projects on the participantsâ€™ wellbeing and examine the importance of providing older adults opportunities to be creative. We will additionally offer insights into the relationships that were made and developed during the projects, including family connections, intergenerational connections and playful relationships that emerged between the residents themselves and their Carers.","Abraham, Nicola Dr, Hudspith, Rachel","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221001356","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):6-7, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):6-7, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21344,""
"A global perspective on dignity-based psychogeriatric care: An urgent call for a Convention on rights for older people","The world is ageing fast with a renewed emphasis on comprehensive healthcare for older people. This has created a paradigm shift towards rights and social justice-based approach to augment the medical model of mental healthcare. Dignity is one such construct embedded into the human-rights approach. It comprises of self-respect and worthiness of an individual as well as social acceptance of his/her identity. Dignity is a multi-faceted concept and consists of privacy, independence, inclusion, autonomy, etc. It includes community participation, functional abilities, rights to sexuality and oral healthcare, outcomes which are often neglected in conventional psychogeriatric care. Ageism and fear of ageing can exacerbate social stereotypes thereby compromising dignity in older people and risk of elder abuse.Geriatric psychiatry is uniquely positioned to equip mental healthcare with a â€˜dignity-basedâ€™ approach promoting social connectedness and health equality. This further needs integration into all levels of public health for better access and holistic psychosocial management.With this background and on the backdrop on the unique psychosocial challenges posed by the COVID- 19 pandemic, this symposium glances at various dimensions of dignity-based psychogeriatric care:â€“ Practical approach towards dignity promotion in healthcare using an attributional modelâ€“ Perspectives, healthcare challenges and research from LMIC like Brazil and India related to dignity among older people and its impact on ageism and human rightsâ€“ Rights-based geriatric mental healthcare in the developed nationsâ€“ Finally, an urgent call for Convention on human rights of older persons for promoting dignity in healthcare and combatting ageism","","https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610221001332","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):3-4, 2021.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics; 33(S1):3-4, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21345,""
"Over the top: psychotropic polypharmacy in long-term care","To date, several studies have estimated the prevalence of psychotropic polypharmacy among long-term care residents with dementia (Iaboni et al., 2016;Norgaard et al., 2017), but substantial geographic variation and heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates have made it challenging to define a benchmark and characterize the scope of the problem. In Moyle et al., combination therapy with an atypical antipsychotic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant accounted for 7% of the severe and 26% of the moderate drugâ€“drug interactions (Moyle et al., 2017). [...]the adverse effects of polypharmacy can be easily missed in frail long-term care residents, with a decline in cognition, mobility, and falls misattributed to geriatric syndromes or progression of the underlying dementia (Hilmer et al., 2012).

"Psychological impact of COVID 19 pandemic in cancer patients: a cross sectional observational study","Purpose or Objective: On 30 January 2020,WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID19).As cancer patients are already considered at increased risk of persistent depressive and anxiety disorders, the aim of this study was to evaluate psycological impact of the COVID19 pandemic in these patients.Psychological counseling services were offered to patients who showed anxiety and stress above selected cut off levels. Materials and Methods: All consecutive adult cancer outpatients between April and May 2020 were prospectively enrolled in this study and therefore received structured and validated ad-hoc questionnaires.Emotional distress was measured by means of visual scale.The structured questionnaire consisted of questions covering several areas such as knowledge and concerns about COVID19,the psychological impact of the COVID19 outbreak and mental health.Validated self-assessment questionnaires for the evaluation of psychological functioning and resilience skills were:1)Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale(CD-RISC-25) investigating five factors of resilience;2)Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II)consisting of 21 items evaluating the severity of depression;3)State and Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI-Â¬TRAIT-Y) investigating the anxiety-trait and anxiety-state. Results: A total of 208 patients completed the survey with a participation rate of 99%. Most of patients(79.3%) were in treatment and 20.7% in follow up.70 patients(42.7%) received palliation treatment and 94(57.3%) curative treatment. Patients who cohabited with others declared themselves to be more resilient;the COVID related physical concern is worse in those with lung cancer than in other cancers and in those on active treatment compared to follow up. COVID-related physical concern correlates significantly with depression, distress, and state and trait anxiety.

"Covid-19 era and radiotherapy: psychological changes in oncological patients","Purpose or Objective: To evaluate the emotional state of oncological patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) during the COVID-19 Lockdown. Materials and Methods: To evaluate patientsâ€™anxiety, depression and distress, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Distress Thermometer (DT) were used. Patients were divided into 3 groups: those who underwent radiotherapy before COVID-19 emergency (Julyâ€“December 2019) (Group 1), in early stage of COVID-19 emergency (Januaryâ€“ February 2020) (Group 2) and one week (wk) before the Lockdown (Group 3). For Group 3 the evaluations of anxiety, depression and distress were conducted at 3 different time points: at the RT beginning(1-wk before Lockdown,T0), during RT (1-wk after the start of Lockdown, T1) and at the RT ending (during Lockdown, T2). Results: From July 2019 to 8th March 2020, on 452 treated patients, 223 (49.3%) accepted to participate in psychooncological support program: 80 (35.9%) were in Group 1, 121 (54.2%) in Group 2 and 22 (9.9%) in Group 3. Anxiety was higher in Groups 1 and 2 and distress was higher in Group 3 (p 0.01;p 0.0001) while no differences were noted for depression (p 0.1). Regarding Group 3, respect to baseline (T0), all considered emotional states increased at T1 and decreased at T2: anxiety and depression increased considerably from T0 to T1 and decreased from T1 to T2 (p 0.00001, p 0.001 respectively);distress also showed the same trend, but the differences was not statistically significative (p 0.1). All patients completed their planned RT without delays. Conclusion: The study revealed optimal compliance to RT despite the increase of anxiety and distress COVID19-related. The appropriate supportive care in term of psychologic support must be prioritized for all oncological patients, even more during pandemic.","Caliandro, M.; Gregucci, F.; Surgo, A.; Carbonara, R.; Ciliberti, M.

"COVID-19 impact on working conditions for researchers in radiation oncology: a qualitative analysis","Purpose or Objective A questionnaire among 543 radiation oncology (RO) professionals involved in research demonstrated that approximately half of them were forced to work full-time from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Dhont et al, ctRO, 2020). At the same time, those still working on location had to adjust to a new working environment. Both groups and especially early-career researchers experienced a substantial impact on mental health and work productivity. The aim of the current qualitative study was to assess in-depth the specific challenges faced by young researchers in RO and what constitutes helpful support in case of continuing or future adverse situations. Materials and Methods This study was conducted jointly by researchers in the field of RO and experts in qualitative research. Data was collected using online Focus Groups (oFGs) facilitated by qualitative research experts. Three oFGs were held with 7-11 young RO professionals (total N=25), in which data saturation was reached. Invitations to participate in the oFGs were sent out 30 days prior through the ESTRO newsletter, social media and personal networks. Inclusion criteria to participate were (1) working in RO, (2) in a European institution, and (3) with less than 10 years of research experience. Efforts were made to ensure a diverse panel. The design of the oFGs (Figure 1) comprised two main steps: (1) Deepening the understanding of experienced impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) formulating solutions that could positively address the identified impacts. The oFGs were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed via the qualitative analysis software Atlas (2019) through inductive coding. The coded segments were then translated into themes. $Fg Results In addition to years of research experience, seven other variables were identified as potentially impacting on the work or personal sphere in a positive and/or negative manner. In total ten main impacts were identified in the personal (2) and work sphere (8), which were either affected directly by the variables or indirectly through other impacts. It was for example found that job title could negatively impact the type of work the researcher had to perform during the pandemic, which in turn negatively impacted his/her mental health. All variables, impacts and how they relate are illustrated in Figure 2. Proposed solutions were mostly technical, illustrating that the most pressing issue was to ensure the possibility to perform one's work. Proposed solutions for social isolation (e.g. virtual social events) were often countered by the presence of â€œzoom fatigueâ€. $Fg Conclusion Different variables, their impacts and a complex interplay between them have been identified to determine how early-career RO professionals experienced working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond technical solutions to enable remote working, the distinct personal situations must be considered when proposing solutions to support mental health in these situations.","Dhont, J.; Pittens, C.

"Inequities in adolescent and young adult deaths","Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, the authors analysed historical trends and contemporary profiles of the absolute, relative, and proportional distributions of deaths among young people aged 10â€“14 years, 15â€“19 years, and 20â€“24 years from 1950 to 2019.2 The findings substantiate global epidemiological transitions, with decrease in all-cause mortality and substantial reductions in communicable and maternal causes of death since 1980. [...]unintentional injuries, interpersonal violence, and self-harm became the leading causes of mortality in most regions. Mortality analyses cannot reveal the inter-related effects of mental health problems, domestic and sexual violence, and patriarchal norms, which, combined with a paucity of access to key services, differentially thwart adolescent girls and boys from flourishing.4â€“7 Beyond the study period, COVID-19 has reversed hard-won development gains and progress in structural determinants, with huge gendered ramifications for the wellbeing of young people.8 Collectively, these effects sow the seeds for lifelong inequities, trauma, and ill health. Threats to the health of adolescents and young adults that are increasingly unequal and context-specific in distribution speak to the urgency of strengthening both health sector and intersectoral action at country levels.9,10 There are pressing needs to attend to the unfinished agenda of communicable diseases, strengthen school health programmes and adolescent friendly health services, invest in structural interventions to address vulnerabilities to commercialisation and climate change, and affirm the sexual and reproductive rights of adolescent girls in particular.1,11 Scaling up intersectoral action is also imperative to tackle systemic deficiencies in safe transport options and to address the epidemic of violence killing boys in some contexts.7,12 Most importantly, there is a critical need for deeper, more nuanced enquiries at country levels and to identify and address societal norms, economic systems, political processes, and threats to social justice that challenge the rights of young people to equitable access to health, education, employment, and meaningful social participation.","Ameratunga, Shanthi, George, Asha","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01603-2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The Lancet; 398(10311):1545-1547, 2021.; Publication details: The Lancet; 398(10311):1545-1547, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21351,""
"Global, regional, and national mortality among young people aged 10â€“24 years, 1950â€“2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","Summary Background Documentation of patterns and long-term trends in mortality in young people, which reflect huge changes in demographic and social determinants of adolescent health, enables identification of global investment priorities for this age group. We aimed to analyse data on the number of deaths, years of life lost, and mortality rates by sex and age group in people aged 10â€“24 years in 204 countries and territories from 1950 to 2019 by use of estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. Methods We report trends in estimated total numbers of deaths and mortality rate per 100 000 population in young people aged 10â€“24 years by age group (10â€“14 years, 15â€“19 years, and 20â€“24 years) and sex in 204 countries and territories between 1950 and 2019 for all causes, and between 1980 and 2019 by cause of death. We analyse variation in outcomes by region, age group, and sex, and compare annual rate of change in mortality in young people aged 10â€“24 years with that in children aged 0â€“9 years from 1990 to 2019. We then analyse the association between mortality in people aged 10â€“24 years and socioeconomic development using the GBD Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure based on average national educational attainment in people older than 15 years, total fertility rate in people younger than 25 years, and income per capita. We assess the association between SDI and all-cause mortality in 2019, and analyse the ratio of observed to expected mortality by SDI using the most recent available data release (2017). Findings In 2019 there were 1Â·49 million deaths (95% uncertainty interval 1Â·39â€“1Â·59) worldwide in people aged 10â€“24 years, of which 61% occurred in males. 32Â·7% of all adolescent deaths were due to transport injuries, unintentional injuries, or interpersonal violence and conflict;32Â·1% were due to communicable, nutritional, or maternal causes;27Â·0% were due to non-communicable diseases;and 8Â·2% were due to self-harm. Since 1950, deaths in this age group decreased by 30Â·0% in females and 15Â·3% in males, and sex-based differences in mortality rate have widened in most regions of the world. Geographical variation has also increased, particularly in people aged 10â€“14 years. Since 1980, communicable and maternal causes of death have decreased sharply as a proportion of total deaths in most GBD super-regions, but remain some of the most common causes in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where more than half of all adolescent deaths occur. Annual percentage decrease in all-cause mortality rate since 1990 in adolescents aged 15â€“19 years was 1Â·3% in males and 1Â·6% in females, almost half that of males aged 1â€“4 years (2Â·4%), and around a third less than in females aged 1â€“4 years (2Â·5%). The proportion of global deaths in people aged 0â€“24 years that occurred in people aged 10â€“24 years more than doubled between 1950 and 2019, from 9Â·5% to 21Â·6%. Interpretation Variation in adolescent mortality between countries and by sex is widening, driven by poor progress in reducing deaths in males and older adolescents. Improving global adolescent mortality will require action to address the specific vulnerabilities of this age group, which are being overlooked. Furthermore, indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to jeopardise efforts to improve health outcomes including mortality in young people aged 10â€“24 years. There is an urgent need to respond to the changing global burden of adolescent mortality, address inequities where they occur, and improve the availability and quality of primary mortality data in this age group.

"Exploring College Studentsâ€™ Biopsychosocial Spiritual Wellbeing and Problems during COVID-19 through a Contextual and Comprehensive Framework","Abstract: College students in Kenya have experienced many mental health issues, and there is little well-grounded research on this topic. Therefore, in this current study, we aimed to explore college studentsâ€™ biopsychosocial spiritual wellbeing and problems from an Ecological Systems Theory (EST) perspective. Due to lack of previous well-grounded mental health research and services, we collaborated with the college students from the beginning of the study and acted with them to shape the research. Based on all these, we called our theoretical framework for this current paper as exploring college studentsâ€™ biopsychosocial spiritual wellbeing and problems from the EST perspective. We examined college studentsâ€™ (N = 518) mental health experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic through six items to measure psychosomatic problems (sadness, anxiety, frustration, stress, loneliness, and withdrawal) and their coping mechanisms (talking to family/friends, physical exercise, social media, reading books, hobbies, spiritual activities, alcohol/drugs, COVID-19 information). Gender and age explained a trivial amount of variance, about 1%, in psychosomatic problems in model one. With the inclusion of the coping strategies and demographic factors (age and gender), the second model explained 24% of the variance in psychosomatic problems. In the second model, the highest effect size originated from talking to family/friends and use of social media. In addition, change in sleeping patterns, sadness, anxiety, and frustration were reported with one in three reporting â€œpoorâ€ or â€œfairâ€ mental health. In light of the larger COVID-19 and college studentsâ€™ mental health literature, we discussed the present findings and provided recommendations.

"Mental Pain, Psychological Distress, and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Emergency: the Moderating Role of Tolerance for Mental Pain","The psychosocial stressors related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have been shown to lead to an exacerbation of suicide risk. The present study aims to examine (a) the contribution of mental pain intensity to psychological distress and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) the protective role of mental pain tolerance in buffering these adverse mental health effects. A total of 652 adults (74.2% female, M = 33.99Â years, SD = 13.74) were assessed through an online survey during the first mandatory lockdown in Italy. Participants completed measures of mental pain intensity and tolerance, psychological distress, and suicidal ideation. Results showed that mental pain intensity significantly predicted increases in psychological distress and suicidal ideation while mental pain tolerance significantly buffered the adverse effects of mental pain intensity on psychological distress and suicidal ideation. The findings highlight that tolerance for mental pain may act as a powerful protective factor during the pandemic. Evidence-based public health interventions fostering tolerance for mental pain during a pandemic are needed in order to effectively reduce suicide in potential risk groups.

"Irritable bowel syndrome: Prevalence and associated factors of the biopsychosocial model during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic cross-sectional study","Introduction: Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has a global prevalence of 11.2%. The current diagnosis is based on Rome IV Criteria, and it is recognized as a gut-brain axis disorder in which biopsychosocial factors, currently affected by the global pandemic of COVID-19, play a major role. Aims & Methods: Objective: To analyze biopsychosocial factors related to IBS during COVID-19. Methods: Observational study using an online survey. The survey combined questions of two validated questionnaires of Rome IV and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score Scale, as well as other items related to psychosocial areas affected by COVID-19. Data was collected and a Binary Logistic Regression Analysis was performed. Results: 2487 participants were divided according to the Rome IV criteria in IBS (N=678) and control (N=1809). IBS had a prevalence of 27% and was more prevalent in females (OR=2.81, IC 95% 2.12-3.7), healthcare workers (OR=2.33, IC 95% 1.92-2.82), and was linked to symptoms of anxiety and depression (OR=3.6, IC 95% 2.95-4.41) (OR=2.09, IC 95% 1.75-2.50), respectively. The factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression were, healthcare worker (OR=2.01, IC 95% 1.71-2.36) (OR=1.44, IC 95% 1.22-1.70), psychological violence (OR=3.72 IC 95% 2.85-4.8) (OR=2.95 IC 95% 2.35-3.72), time &gt;3 hours/day searching for COVID-19 information (OR=2.36 IC 95% 1.81-2.98) (OR=1.91 IC 95% 1.52-2.41), and worrying about the current pandemic (OR=2.79, IC 95% 2.18-3.58) (OR=2.20, IC 95% 1.68-2.86). Conclusion: There are important associations between IBS prevalence, anxiety, depression and other factors in the environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Trujillo Leija, A.

"Utility of telemedicine in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic A rapid review","Telemedicine is the use of technology to achieve remote care. This review looks at the utility of telemedicine during the pandemic, period March 2020 to February 2021. Eleven articles met inclusion criteria. There was moderate use of telemedicine in sub-Sahara Africa during the pandemic, however, there were also some limitations. Benefits of telemedicine include continuing medical service provision, connecting relatives with loved ones in quarantine, education, and awareness of mental health issues, and toxicovigilance and infection control. Challenges to the implementation of telemedicine on the continent were lack of supporting telemedicine framework and policies, digital barriers, and patient and healthcare personnel biases. To address these challenges, this article proposes the development of policy frameworks that fosters telemedicine use by all stakeholders, including medical insurance organizations, the introduction of telemedicine training of medical workers, educational awareness programs for the public, and improvement of digital platforms access and affordability.

"BC's Five Years of Drug Failure, Visualized: The anniversary of the province's overdose emergency declaration is nothing to celebrate","Since the start of the opioid epidemic in 2016, the Downtown Eastside community of Vancouver, Canada, has lost many pioneering leaders, activists and visionaries to the war on drugs. The Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society (WAHRS), and the British Columbia Association People on Opiate Maintenance (BCAPOM) are truly concerned about the increasing overdose deaths that have continued since 2016 and have been exacerbated by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COVID-19) despite many unique and timely harm reduction announcements by the British Columbia (BC) government. Some of these unique interventions in BC, although in many cases only mere announcements with limited scope, are based on the philosophy of safe supply to illegal street drugs. Despite all the efforts during the pandemic, overdose deaths have spiked by over 100% compared to the previous year. Therefore, we urge the Canadian federal government, specifically the Honorable Patty Hajdu, the federal Minister of Health, to decriminalize simple possession immediately by granting exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Canadian federal government has a moral obligation under Sect. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to protect the basic human rights of marginalized Canadians.","Willcocks, Paul","https://www.google.com/search?q=BC's+Five+Years+of+Drug+Failure,+Visualized:+The+anniversary+of+the+province's+overdose+emergency+declaration+is+nothing+to+celebrate","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BC Studies; - (211):13-18, 2021.; Publication details: BC Studies; - (211):13-18, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21358,""

"Fostering social connectedness: The Official Voice of Perioperative Nursing","Key determinants of loneliness included a lack of social support and infrequent meaningful social interactions, negative feelings about personal relationships, poor physical and mental health, and a lack of balance in daily activities (i.e., doing too much or little of any given thing).5 A number of studies corroborate this survey and stipulate negative health risks associated with loneliness and isolation. Social connectedness can provide different types of support, such as emotional (e.g., trust, love), instrumental (e.g., assisting a person in doing something), informational (e.g., providing advice), and appraisal (e.g., providing feedback).11 In stark contrast to loneliness and social isolation, there are many benefits associated with social connectedness, including that it enhances brain health and improves memory;drives quality of life and feelings of belonging;mitigates stress levels during unfavorable events;and provides support when dealing with negative emotions, such as distress and worry, especially in times of adversity and uncertainty.12-14 Tips for fostering social connectedness It has become increasingly challenging to foster meaningful social connectedness, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessity of social distancing practices at work and in the community. The tips for fostering social connectedness below are provided with the hope that they will have a profoundly positive effect on the common challenges perioperative nurses and other health care professionals face in fostering social connectedness, while acknowledging some of the unique considerations associated with their professional environment. Because the social connectedness that individuals desire varies and cannot be prescribed, the tips can be customized so that individuals can find the approaches that best suit their needs. Knowing that managers can either increase or decrease the stress of their team depending on their own actions and words, the team at Johns Hopkins Medicine trains all new managers on their role in the stress of their employees. Because of the great influence managers have on the emotions of employees, the training helps them understand the impact of their behavior, teaches them practices they can embrace to lower stress, and outlines additional resources available to them to help manage stress.","Safeer, Richard M.

"Online Learning of English Language Courses via Blackboard at Saudi Universities During Covid-19: Challenges and Difficulties","The outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic resulted in a temporary interruption of learning activities across the world. In Saudi Arabia, there was a sudden and quick shift from face-to-face learning mode to online learning in efforts to save the educational process from non-continuity in many universities. As a result, the use of various e-learning platforms such as Blackboard applications was key to facilitating the learning of different academic courses including the English language. However, the widespread uptake and implementation of Blackboard learning are still in nascent phases in terms of facilitating English language learning. The objective of this study was to investigate the challenges and difficulties encountered in online learning of English language courses via Blackboard at Saudi universities in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Desktop research was used in this study where secondary resources were collected from various academic databases including Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, and Semantic Scholar. Results showed that the use of Blackboard application in online learning of English courses had some potential advantages including improved interactivity, communication, enhanced language proficiency, discussion forums, improved writing quality, learning flexibility, and enhanced grammar and vocabulary acquisition. However, there were potential challenges including students' negative attitude, lack of tutor training, poor technical support, difficulty accessing curriculum content or tests, concerns about safety or privacy, slow internet connection, students' lack of computers, and reliable internet. In conclusion, despite the positive outcomes of using Blackboard in English learning, adequate measures need to be implemented to address identified challenges.","redcrow@naver.com","https://www.google.com/search?q=Online+Learning+of+English+Language+Courses+via+Blackboard+at+Saudi+Universities+During+Covid-19:+Challenges+and+Difficulties","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Asia TEFL; 18(3):780-799, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Asia TEFL; 18(3):780-799, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21367,""
"Physical and emotional sequelae after hospitalization for COVID-19","Background: Facing a severe life-threatening disease has physical and emotional consequences for patients. Aim: To evaluate the physical and emotional sequelae in patients who survived COVID-19 pneumonia. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data from post-COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to an outpatient follow-up program in a public hospital in Chile. One month after hospital discharge, the evaluation of physical capacity was carried out through the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1STST). In addition, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale were applied Results: We included 70 patients aged 63 +or- 13 years (54% women). Eighty-five percent of the patients were able to execute the 1STST with an average of 20.6 +or- 4.8 repetitions. Forty-eight percent of the patients had a performance below the 2.5th percentile according to the reference values and 28% of patients had exertional desaturation. The CFS classified as mildly vulnerable or with some degree of frailty to 33% of patients. Twenty-five percent of the patients presented symptoms of depression and 33% of anxiety. Conclusions: Patients who survived COVID-19 have a decrease in physical capacity and a significant proportion of depression and anxiety one month after hospital discharge.","Nunez-Cortes, R.; Leyton-Quezada, F.; Pino, M.

"Barriers and facilitators to emotional well-being and healthcare engagement in COVID-19: A qualitative study among patients with kidney disease and their caregivers","Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have disproportionately faced poor health outcomes during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Barriers and facilitators to patients' and caregivers' emotional well-being and healthcare engagement have not been deeply described, leaving a gap in interventions during future crisis settings. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among patients with CKD (stages 4-5), kidney failure, kidney transplantation, and their caregivers. Interviews were guided by Leventhal's Model of Self-Regulation that emphasized individual interpretations and emotional responses to health threats as determining factors of health behaviors. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Results: Twenty-eight patients (median age 63, self-reported race: White 57%, Black 18%, Asian 1%, others 14%) and 14 caregivers were interviewed over six months. Barriers and facilitators related to patients' emotional well-being included 1) negative emotional responses (feelings of increased vulnerability, anxiety, social isolation, and depression);2) coping behaviors (adaptive coping via self-preservation and emotion regulation;maladaptive coping via alcohol and unhealthy eating);3) and the need for caregiver support for daily tasks. Barriers and facilitators to healthcare engagement included: 1) continued trust in the medical community ( I put my faith in [my doctor's] knowledge);and 2) technology (telehealth was a facilitator to access for some but inadequate for multidisciplinary care [my] transplant evaluation was stoppedwe could not go to the cardiologist). Caregivers reported higher burden compared to before the pandemic. Conclusions: Patients and caregivers widely reported negative emotional reactions to enforced pandemic-related social isolation. Coping efforts were partially successful. Telehealth provided adequate access to kidney health services for some but was insufficient for those requiring multidisciplinary care. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that patients with kidney disease may benefit from psychosocial and multi-modal structural support to offset social isolation, reduce caregiver burden, and bolster access to multidisciplinary care during future crisis settings.","Ng, J.

"transferTALK: SUSTAINING SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER PATHWAYS","In 1976, Jack Maguire--then dean of admissions at Boston College (MA), having been recruited to the role from his faculty appointment in physics--first used the term enrollment management in print in his institution's alumni magazine, Bridge. Two features of the article stand out for their relevance to our current challenges. First, he wrote it during a period of pessimism regarding the future of enrollment at four-year private institutions, with fears of retrenchment leading to huge deficits and institutional mergers or closures.

"Perception of COVID-19 risk among in-center hemodialysis patients","Background: Dialysis patients are at high risk for severe complications related to COVID-19. The present study examined perception of risk of COVID-19 and its impact on behavior modification and emotional well-being among in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) patients during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted between May and July 2020 with adult ICHD patients dialyzing at a large dialysis organization (LDO). Responses were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The reliability of categories was examined by an independent coder. Results: A total of 41 LDO patients were interviewed. The median age was 63 years and 54% were female. Satisfactory inter-rater reliability was achieved for all identified themes (kappa = 0.70 -0.99). We found that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a high level of worry among ICHD study subjects;78% of those interviewed felt that they are at high risk of COVID-19. Consequently, subjects reported a high level of compliance with appropriate protective behaviors during the pandemic, such as wearing a mask, sheltering at home, social distancing, and frequent handwashing. The perception of the actual likelihood of contracting the virus during a hemodialysis session was relatively low (M = 3.38 on a 0 to 10 risk scale). The pandemic had no impact on self-reported adherence to dialysis treatment schedules, medications, or diet. However, subjects reported dominating emotions of frustration, fear, stress, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions: The study subjects were aware of the risk of COVID-19 and seemingly increased compliance with protective behaviors as a consequence. It appears that the pandemic had a strong negative impact on the study subjects' emotional well-being and that additional support in this area might be beneficial.","Filus, A.; Gonzalez, C. G.

"Anxiety and depression among doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, an increase in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases with extremely severe symptoms of depression and anxiety was observed among healthcare workers working in the ""red zone"" and on the front lines. In view of many factors, such as stigmatization of an infectious disease, a sharp increase in workload, lack of personal protective equipment, social isolation, etc., special attention should be paid to the psycho-emotional state of health workers. Objectives. The aim of the study is to study the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety among doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Methods. Using an online questionnaire, we collected data from 200 respondents to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The groups of participants were divided into: doctors and persons of other specialties. Results. According to the statistical calculations of Pearson's correlation, no strong positive correlation between profession and the development of anxiety and depression was found [p = 0.396;p = 0.526]. Higher rates of anxiety symptoms were associated with males and age over 60 years [p = .045;p = .004], and the level of depression was increased only in the group of doctors [p = .031]. Conclusions. The results of the study did not prove an association between the medical profession and signs of depression and anxiety.

"An online investigation into school teachers' experiences of stress and coping strategies while teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic: Exploring the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder","One year since over 1.2 billion learners were affected by school closures in response to the COVID-19 epidemic, this study sought predictors of past month perceived stress for K-12 teachers. The sample (N=159) had 89.3% (N=143) born in the United States, 89.9% female (N=143), 69.8% White (N= 111), 9.4% Asian (N=15), 9.4% Black (N= 15), and 8.8% Latino (N= 14)-with mean age of 39.53 years (min=23, max=70, SD=1.138), while 72.3% (N=115) had a current partner. For education level, the mean was category 2.87 (min=2, max= 4, SD=.517) for closest to a master's degree with a mean annual household income of category 5.39 (min=1, max=9, SD=1.034) for $50,000-$99,000. They had a mean of 13.36 years (min=1, max=45, SD=13.36) teaching. Teachers reported high stress related to being a teacher, high fear about the transmission of COVID-19 in the school setting, high anger about COVID-19 decision-making and policies, and moderate coping overall as a teacher during the pandemic.In backward stepwise regression, controlling for social desirability, higher past month Perceived Stress (PSS-4) was significantly predicted by: Yes, lost social support in the last year due to death/change in status;Lower annual household income;Lower rating of mental/emotional health during pandemic;Greater negative changes in physical/mental health during pandemic;Greater symptoms of mental health disorders during pandemic;and Lower level of social support/lower number of people providing it-while the model (R 2=.568, Adj R 2 =.547) accounted for 54.7% of the variance.Qualitative data showed their most stressful experiences during the pandemic: Category I: Coping with Overwhelming and Varied Feelings;Category II: New Challenges Teaching with Exorbitant Hours;Category III: Teachers as Disrespected, Blameworthy, Disposable Multi-Tasking Servants.

"A comparison of office-based buprenorphine treatment outcomes in Bronx community clinics before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction In 2020, the US and New York City experienced unprecedented deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic and drug overdoses. Policy changes reduced burdensome regulations for medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Despite these policy changes, few studies examined buprenorphine treatment outcomes during the pandemic. We compared treatment outcomes among Bronx patients referred to office-based buprenorphine treatment before versus during the pandemic. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we compared patients referred to buprenorphine treatment in a Bronx community clinic before (Marchâ€“August 2019) versus during (Marchâ€“August 2020) the pandemic. We describe changes to buprenorphine treatment during the pandemic, including telehealth and prioritizing harm reduction. Using data from medical records and program logs, main outcomes included steps of the OUD treatment cascade of careâ€”initial visit scheduled and completed, treatment initiated, and retained in treatment at 90Â days. Using chi square and t-tests, we examined differences in patient characteristics and OUD treatment cascade steps before versus during the pandemic. Results Before and during the pandemic, 72 and 35 patients were referred to buprenorphine treatment, respectively. Patients' mean age was 46Â years, most were male (67.3%) or Hispanic (52.3%), and few had private insurance (19.6%). Patients referred during (vs. before) the pandemic were more likely to have private insurance (31.4% vs. 13.9%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) and be referred from acute care settings (37.1% vs. 19.4%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). No significant differences in OUD cascade of care outcomes existed between those referred during versus before the pandemic. However, among patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment, those referred during (vs. before) the pandemic were more likely to be retained in treatment at 90Â days (68.0% vs. 42.9%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Conclusions Despite the COVID-19 pandemic's unprecedented devastation to the Bronx, along with worsening drug overdose deaths, OUD cascade of care outcomes were similar among patients referred to buprenorphine treatment before versus during the pandemic. Among patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment, treatment retention was better during (versus before) the pandemic. During a public health emergency, incorporating telehealth and prioritizing harm reduction are key strategies to maintain optimal OUD treatment outcomes.","Cunningham, Chinazo O.; Khalid, Laila, Deng, Yuting, Torres-Lockhart, Kristine, Masyukova, Mariya, Thomas, Shenell, Zhang, Chenshu, Lu, Tiffany","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+comparison+of+office-based+buprenorphine+treatment+outcomes+in+Bronx+community+clinics+before+versus+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Journal of substance abuse treatment;2021.; Publication details: Journal of substance abuse treatment;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21383,""
"Intradialytic yoga-based breathing and relaxation to improve anxiety, depression, and quality of life: A pilot feasibility study","Background: In-center hemodialysis patients have high rates of depression and anxiety. Pharmacologic interventions to ameliorate psychological burdens have proven to be limited in efficacy. Alternative therapies are increasingly used for those with chronic disease. A small number of studies have looked at the impact of meditation and yoga to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression and to promote a better quality of life. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of implementing a chairside intradialytic yogabased breathing and relaxation technique. A secondary goal was assessing the efficacy of such an intervention. Methods: Eligible subjects were patients with a below average score on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of a previously completed Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) survey. Following consent, each subject was provided with an MP3 player, pre-loaded with a 12-minute recording of a specific yogic breathing and relaxation exercise, the Three-Part Breath. The intervention consisted of listening to the recording at each dialysis treatment over a 12-treatment period. Subjects completed a KDQOL-36 survey both at the start and the end of the study. A Likert scale to measure anxiety was completed at each dialysis treatment both pre-and post-intervention. Results: 11 subjects were enrolled over a 10-month period in 2020;10 completed the study. As measured by the Likert scale, anxiety was significantly reduced after listening to the recording. Notably, there was a larger reduction in anxiety on a per treatment basis in the period after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Over the study period, there was a significant improvement in the scores of the Effects of Kidney Disease on Quality of Life component of the KDQOL-36, and a trend toward significant improvement in the Mental Component Summary scores. Conclusions: A chairside intradialytic breathing and relaxation program can be integrated into a dialysis treatment session. The study demonstrates an improvement in scores related to anxiety, depression, and measures of quality of life. Larger and randomized trials using this intervention are needed to better understand its benefits and adverse effects, as well as the obstacles to large scale implementation.","Conway, F.; Desta, M.

"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with ESKD on peritoneal dialysis","Background: The mortality rate from COVID-19 is remarkably high in elderly patients and those with chronic conditions. Increases in physical and mental stress among patients with chronic conditions, especially end-stage kidney disease, were expected to have occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports that the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. Methods: During the pandemic, we surveyed the mental health of patients with endstage kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis at a single center. Depression using with BDI scoring was evaluated and then compared in peritoneal dialysis patients between before and the pandemic declaration. We also surveyed patient satisfaction with the self-care services associated with peritoneal dialysis under the pandemic period. Results: One-third of the survey respondents (n=176) were moderately to extremely worried about their physical health being impacted by the pandemic, while 20% moderately to extremely worried about their mental and emotional health being impacted. About half of participant reported feeling that they were unable to handle their personal problems and that things were out of their control. However, most felt that they could retain control over the important things and overcome their difficulties. Despite COVID-19 pandemic, no significant changes in depression scores were apparent between before and during the pandemic. Most participants were satisfied with the in-home selfcare services delivered by either telephone or remote monitoring. Conclusions: Many participants reported that they were afraid of COVID-19, but most patients with PD felt that they could overcome the crisis.

The authors have advised that there is an error in the author list on page 929. The author name ""Erick de Souza Neri"" should read ""Erick Souza Neri"". The name appears correctly in this and the original record. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-08614-001). Introduction: In addition to the effects of coronavirus infection, the Covid-19 pandemic has induced widespread psychosocial distress, which has triggered the onset of anxious and depressive states, reactive to the socio-relational and economic situation induced by the pandemic. Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. Methods: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization-cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual's response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer;therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion: The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous clinical studies confirming the usefulness of the treatments to face neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by exposome pressure.

"Disinfectant-induced hormesis: An unknown environmental threat of the application of disinfectants to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic?<U+2606>","Massive additional quantities of disinfectants have been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic as infection preventive and control measures. While the application of disinfectants plays a key role in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of disinfectants applied during the ongoing pandemic on non-target organisms remain unknown. Here we collated evidence from multiple studies showing that chemicals used for major disinfectant products can induce hormesis in various organisms, such as plants, animal cells, and microorganisms, when applied singly or in mixtures, suggesting potential ecological risks at sub-threshold doses that are normally considered safe. Among other effects, sub-threshold doses of disinfectant chemicals can enhance the proliferation and pathogenicity of pathogenic microbes, enhancing the development and spread of drug resistance. We opine that hormesis should be considered when evaluating the effects and risks of such disinfectants, especially since the linear-no-threshold (LNT) and threshold dose-response models cannot identify or predict their effects.

"COVID-19 and its impact on student-athlete depression and anxiety: the return to campus","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the NCAA to abruptly cancel all sporting events, to help slow the spread of the virus. As such, measures such as social-distancing and work from home orders, were implemented nationwide. While effective, both safety measures are socially disruptive with the potential to cause psychological disturbances such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other behavioral disorders. To date, there is no literature that examines the consequences of abrupt mid-season cancellation for student-athletes, and the subsequent return to campus in Fall of 2020 brought on by a global crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. To explore the mental health consequences of such termination and subsequent return to campus, student-athletes were surveyed on their experience with returning to campus amidst a global pandemic.

"""Could we have predicted this?"" The association of a future mental health need in young people with a non-specific complaint and frequent emergency department visits","Objective: Mental health emergencies among young people are increasing. There is growing pressure for emergency departments to screen patients for mental health needs even when it is not their chief complaint. We hypothesized that young people with an initial non-specific condition and emergency department (ED) revisits have increased mental health needs. Methods: Retrospective, observational study of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Emergency Department Discharge Dataset (2010-2014) of young people (11-24 years) with an index visit for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes of ""Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions"" (Non-Specific); ""Diseases of the respiratory system"" (Respiratory) and ""Unintentional injury"" (Trauma) who were discharged from a California ED. Patients were excluded if they had a prior mental health visit, chronic disease, or were pregnant. ED visit frequency was counted over 12 months. Regression models were created to analyze characteristics associated with a mental health visit. Results: Patients in the Non-Specific category compared to the Respiratory category had 1.2 times the odds of a future mental health visit (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.17-1.24). Patients with &#8805;1 ED revisit, regardless of diagnostic category, had 1.3 times the odds of a future mental health visit. Patients with both a Non-Specific index visit and 1, 2, and 3 or more revisits with non-specific diagnoses had increasing odds of a mental health visit (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.29-1.47; OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.46-1.98; OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.70-2.87, respectively.).

"Demonstrator training needs to be active and focused on personalized student learning in bioscience teaching laboratories","Demonstrators spend significant time with students on a weekly basis in instructional laboratories and are well poised to offer students meaningful learning. Most often, effective demonstrator training is neglected due to time and resource restraints and it is clear more attention is needed. We hypothesized that students' learning experience in laboratories would improve if demonstrators were well trained particularly across three overlapping learning domains: subject-specific knowledge (cognitive and psychomotor), problem solving (cognitive) and group management including personalized student learning strategies (affective). We assessed both students and demonstrators on the impact of this extensive demonstrator training in 1st- and 2nd-year bioscience practical courses over two years. The results show that all students rated the demonstrators' performance higher after the extensive training. Students from both years valued the provision of problem-solving skills; however, 1st-year students placed greater value on the demonstrator's ability to address student inclusivity, whereas 2nd-year students preferred the provision of strong subject knowledge. Interestingly, demonstrators' own perception of their teaching ability was different from student feedback on their performance, which may be due to lack of reflective practice. We propose a multimodal training framework that includes inclusivity/approachability and reflection as an integral part of training. This study further suggests that demonstrator training needs to be tailored to the changing needs of students as they progress through the different levels of their degree. Our proposed framework is particularly relevant to the current pandemic which has affected young people's mental health, confidence and openness to new experiences.","Awais, Raheela; Stollar, Elliott","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13299","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: FEBS Open Bio;2021 Sep 12.; Publication details: FEBS Open Bio;2021 Sep 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21394,""
"Facilitating a supportive learning experience: The lecturer's role in addressing mental health issues of university students during COVID-19","During Covid-19, rates of mental health issues, particularly anxiety, rose significantly in university students. In the scramble to adapt to online learning, university professors were overwhelmed with material aimed at facilitating a supportive learning experience and preserving student academic performance in online contexts yet were ill-equipped to cope with the increased volume of mental health issues encountered. Many studies attest to the association between poor mental health and academic performance. It has been shown that students often report their mental health issues to university professors who are called upon to cope with these issues as best they can. This paper outlines strategies undertaken, in the context of a novel undergraduate mental health program, to address emergent mental health issues during Covid-19 student isolation. These practical, cost effective interventions can be used to successfully give voice to ongoing student mental health issues in a post-Covid world and to help professors feel equipped and empowered enough to contribute to stemming the tide of rising rates of mental illness meaningfully, appropriately and professionally. Practitioner Notes 1. In delivery of an undergraduate mental health program, the lecturer's expertise, familiarity with students and familiarity with the student's academic and learning environment, needs to be coupled with the expertise of a mental health professional. 2. It is recommended that the undergraduate mental health program includes some of the following: the giving of talks, question and answer sessions, one-on-one informal reviews with the mental health professional, anonymous invitations to share concerns through Padlets, post-it note surveys, anonymous questionnaires, the creation of podcasts or videos, information sheets, online Blackboard posts, panel discussions or more. 3. Padlet walls, post-it note surveys and questionnaires are ideal vehicles for anonymous and voluntarily self-reporting to alleviate shame and stigma issues. 4. Current Mental Health training for lecturers in universities predominantly do not reflect the realities of the classroom and are often ineffective.Integrating key learnings into lectures from the topics discussed by a mental health expert in the mental health program is a strategic way to not only re-inforce the messages but establish a caring and trusting student-teacher relationship","Heim, C.; Heim, C.","https://doi.org/10.53761/1.18.6.06","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice; 18(6):13, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice; 18(6):13, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21395,""
"A moderated-mediation model of fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being during COVID-19 pandemic","A sudden outbreak of diseases poses a serious threat to mental health. Relying on strengths might mitigate negative mental health outcomes and promote positive mental health. Prior research suggests a potential moderated mediation effect between fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being. Based on the Competence-based Model of mental health, this study examined the relationship between fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being through perceived distress moderated by resilience in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey using questionnaires was employed. Data were collected online from 384 participants (270 female and 114 male, age range= 15 to 29 years). The participants had indirect exposure to COVID-19 through information from the media. Results demonstrated that fear of illness significantly predicts subjective psychological well-being both directly and indirectly. In addition, the moderated mediation effect of resilience was confirmed. Resilience moderated the indirect effect between fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being through perceived distress. The magnitude of the indirect effect was contingent on resilience. Further, the effect of perceived distress on subjective psychological well-being is weakened as the level of resilience increases. This study contributes theoretically to a better understanding of the salutogenic effect of resilience on positive mental health during a pandemic. Based on the findings, implications and future directions are discussed. Â© 2021, Sarawak Research Society.

"Loneliness vs Solitude: Recognizing the Difference for Ourselves and for Our Clients in Light of COVID-19","During COVID-19 the practice of social distancing has affected society in various ways. There is still much to learn about the harmful effects of isolation due to social distancing on societal mental health, however, others have noted potentially positive side effects from social distancing such as the observance of solitude (Levine, 2020;Mercier et al., 2021). Solitude and loneliness are distinct experiences (Melvin, 2021). This point of view article contends that Christian social workers should consider the ramifications of both loneliness and solitude in light of COVID-19. This article utilizes Christian scriptures and current literature to define and discuss the differences between loneliness and solitude. There is also a discussion throughout the article about how Christian social workers can recognize and utilize these concepts in their practice with clients and in their own self-care.","Landers, Jillian Carol","https://doi.org/10.34043/swc.v48i4.249","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Social Work and Christianity; 48(4):368-378, 2021.; Publication details: Social Work and Christianity; 48(4):368-378, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21397,""
"The Call of the Faithful: The Integration of Spirituality and Social Work Practice in the Time of COVID-19","This has been a season of change worldwide. It has become virtually impossible to ignore distressing news about the state of our world. COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work, how we think, and even how we grieve. Every day, Americans are bombarded with reports of rising death tolls, massive unemployment, economic turmoil, and dismal foreseeable predictions. This health crisis has put an enormous amount of pressure on the global community, and this is especially true for our clients who are new immigrants. This pressure has manifested in mental health challenges. Social workers have reported that for many clients the uncertainty and pressure are becoming too much to handle. Typically, clients are experiencing anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, and in some cases interpersonal violence (Brodhead, 2020;Endale et al. 2020;Saltzman et al.,2020). Now imagine the impact on unaccompanied minors arriving at our borders. Prior to the pandemic, the unaccompanied children were dealing with three crises simultaneously: 1) parental and home country separation;2) trauma from a harsh journey;and 3) language barrier and cultural shock. These issues alone are overwhelming and cause powerful emotions such as anxiety in these children. So how can these emotions be managed, coupled with the dangers of COVID-19? How can social workers provide comfort and support when they may be experiencing the same emotions? This article brings this hidden reality into the public view and enrich the existing social work body of knowledge by demonstrating the restorative power of faith, spirituality, and self-care.","Newton-Guest, Shirley, Moreno, Claudia Sofia, Coyoy, Marla, Najmi, Roxanna, Martin, Tonia, Vundla, Sikholiwe","https://doi.org/10.34043/swc.v48i4.241","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Social Work and Christianity; 48(4):379-392, 2021.; Publication details: Social Work and Christianity; 48(4):379-392, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21398,""
"Developing Secure Healthcare Video Consultations for Corona Virus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Many health networks became increasingly interactive in implementing a consulting approach to telemedicine before the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate patient trafficking and reduce the virus exposure in health centers, several GPs, physicians and people in the video were consulted during the pandemic at the start. Video and smartphone consultations will allow well-insulated and high-risk medical practitioners to maintain their patient care security. Video appointments include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, stroke, mental health, chemotherapy and chronic pain. Many urgent diseases, including an emergency triage for the eye, may also be used for online consultations and triages. The COVID-19 pandemic shows that healthcare option for healthy healthcare and the potential to increase to a minimum, such as video consultations, have grown quickly. The dissemination of COVID-19 viruses now aims at extending the use of Video-Health Consultations by exchanging insights and simulations of health consultations and saving costs and healthcare practices as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our paper focuses on video consulting privacy. This essay further presents the advantages and inconveniences of video consultation and its implementation. This paper suggests the most recent video encryption method known as high efficiency video coding selective encryption (HEVC SE). Our video consultation schema has been improved to secure video streaming on a low calculation overhead, with the same bit rate and to ensure compatibility with the video format. The contribution is made with RC5, a low complexity computer, to encrypt subsets of bin-strings binarized in the HEVC sense using the context adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) method through the bypass binary arithmetic coding. This sequence of binstrings consists of a non-zero differential transforming cosine (DCT) coefficient bit, MVD sign bits, remainder absolute DCT suffixes and absolute MVD suffixes. This paper also examines the efficiency assessment of the use of the RC5 with its modes of operations in the HEVC CABAC SE proposed. This study chooses the best operating mode for RC5 to be used for the healthcare video consultation application. Security analysis, such as histogram analysis, correlation coefficient testing and key sensitivity testing, is presented to protect against brute force and statistical attacks for the proposed schema.","AlZain, M.

"Emotional states of athletes in the first lockdown due to Covid-19: A comparison of Polish and Spanish samples","Background: The situation of the coronavirus pandemic has affected the lives of many athletes from different disciplines. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of Covid-19 first lockdown on emotional states and motivation of athletes from Spain and Poland. Material and methods: Polish male (N=24) and female (N=94) and Spanish male (N=81) female (N=95) athletes were investigated. The respondents did online ad hoc questionnaires, namely Emotional and Adaptative reactions during confinement (COVID-19-RECOVID-19), and Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Significant differences were observed in training conditions by country, with the Polish sample having higher scores than Spaniards. Stressing thoughts characterized Polish female athletes significantly more than others;Spanish athletes, both females and males were characterized by the highest agreement to confinement rules. Females, relative to males, had a higher level of fatigue. Moreover, significant differences by country appeared in anger, vigor, friendship, tension, and depressed feelings. Polish female athletes were characterized by the highest scores apart from friendship, which was similarly high among Polish athletes. Conclusions: Monitoring the mental conditions of sports professionals and designing psychological interventions that would match athletes' personal needs seems crucial to similar, tremendously complex, and socially isolating situations, such as lockdown due to Covid-19.","Wilczynska, D.; Rubio, D.

"Filipino teacher professional development in the new normal","The Covid-19 pandemic has posed various challenges particularly in the education sector where the â€˜new normalâ€™ experience is all about online interaction and distance learning. As the health protocols enforce physical distancing measures, actual and personal interaction and engagements are limited. As teacher professional development (TPD) becomes a melting pot of best practices and strategies that work, teachers receive a perspective that helps them create their own professional vision. The findings of this study revealed that for teachers, TPD is a route to enhance and upgrade their knowledge and skills and professional growth, with teaching as a life-long learning process. PreCovid-19 TPD programs included initiatives on content, pedagogy and technology, action learning, graduate studies, leadership and management, and action research. During the pandemic, teachers were exposed to webinars and training on online teaching and learning, technological capacity, and mental health. Regardless of age and years of teaching experience, teachers have a mindset to grow in the profession and be better educators. They want to unlearn the old, and relearn new knowledge and skills because they want their students to learn according to their current needs and what the world needs in the future.

"Neuropsychological symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by the general population and particularly by the healthcare personnel","Undoubtedly, the outbreak of COVID-19 still represents an overanxious event for both society and population. The fear of getting infected is ubiquitous in the time of the pandemic. The population presented worrying thoughts related to the fact that the health care system was not able to provide enough services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of the hospital beds and ventilators was insufficient in order to ensure enough care, considering the increased number of COVID-19 cases that were admitted to the hospitals. Furthermore, people were fearful about the possibility of the global economy becoming decimated. The fright and also the feelings of anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic can become overpowering and create negative psychological states. In addition, mental health can be affected and influenced during outbreaks of infectious diseases and can be related to the misconception of symptoms, for example perception related phenomenon and corporal modifications. The population that could experiment these feelings, could instantly relate them to the coronavirus infection and express furthermore unpleasant sensations, in connection to more expressed anxiety and fear. Particularly affected were the healthcare workers of the medical system, who were the main combatants in this pandemic. The neuropsychological problems were difficult to avoid by the general population and this became even more difficult to be dealt with by the medical personnel.","Stroe, A. Z.; Stuparu, A.

The participants were divided into 2 groups: experimental group (n=16) â€” those with COVID-19 pneumonia;comparison group (n=10) â€” those without pneumonia. All subjects underwent a complex of clinical and diagnostic tests. Results. Military men with COVID-19 pneumonia were significantly older (23,0 [20,5;28,5] years vs 19,5 [19,0;20,0] years, p=0,001). They had a prolonged PQ interval (154,5 [140,0;163,5] ms vs 137,0 [134,0;144,0] ms;p=0,014). According to echocardiography, the following parameters were significantly larger in experimental group: anteroposterior right ventricular dimension (26,0 [24,5;27,5] mm vs 23,5 [22,0;25,0] mm, p=0,012), right atrium length (48,0 [46,0;51,5] mm and 45,5 [44,0;47,0] mm, p=0,047), tricuspid regurgitation peak gradient (18,0 [15,5;22,0] mm vs 14,0 [12,0;20,0] mm, p=0,047), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (30,3 [27,6;34,0] mm Hg vs 23,0 [20,5;30,5] mm Hg, p=0,038), mean pulmonary artery pressure (20,3 [18,9;22,7] mm Hg vs 16,8 [14,5;20,6] mm Hg, p=0,038). The estimated pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly higher in the study group (1,50 [1,2;1,8] Wood units vs 1,17 [1,1;1,2] Wood units, p&lt;0,001). The groups did not differ significantly in terms of symptoms of stress (perceived stress scale score of 10) and anxiety and depression disorders (GAD7 and PHQ9 questionnaires), quality of life (SF-36 survey). Conclusion. In young military personnel, COVID-19 pneumonia in the long term after the disease is associated with longer PQ interval, older age and larger right heart sizes on echocardiography, as well as with a higher tricuspid regurgitation peak gradient, PASP, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance. In this category of population, no association was found between the severity of COVID-19 and psychological status parameters.","Yaroslavskaya, E. I.; Krinochkin, D. V.; Krinochkina, I.

"Knowledge, attitudes, practices, fear and stress before Covid-19 in nursing students and recent graduates in Colombia","Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the emotional health of human resources in health care, despite having knowledge about the virus and its management, health care personnel, including nurses, have shown stress and fear of Covid-19. Objective. To describe and correlate the level of fear, stress, knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding Covid-19 in nursing students and recent graduates in Colombia. Method. A cross-sectional and analytical observational study was conducted in Colombia between October and November 2020. The instruments of fear, stress and knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding Covid-19 were answered online by 1621 nursing students and recent graduates. Results. A mean fear score of 20.69 Â± 6.1 points, a mean stress score of 89.15 Â± 29.5 points and relative frequencies above 80% for knowledge, attitudes and practices to Covid-19 were observed. Direct correlations were observed between knowledge and attitudes and, in turn, attitudes with the practice. Fear was inversely correlated with knowledge and directly correlated with Covid-19 stress. Conclusion. An adequate cognitive level is observed in nursing students and recent graduates, but an emotional deficiency in the Covid-19, in terms of stress and fear. It is necessary to establish mental health support strategies for this key population in the current and future control of health crisis situations. Â© 2021 Revista Cuidarte.","Moreno, S. P.

"A reply to Monteiro et al's (2020) 'Alcohol policy and coronavirus: An open research agenda'","Comments on article by M. G. Monteiro et al. (see record 2020-61236-001). Monteiro and colleagues (2020) wrote that we might see increases in alcohol-related morbidity and mortality because of the economic decline related to the COVID-19 pandemic. They also noted that there could be increases in alcohol-attributable suicides. The current authors wish to point out that there might be policy-relevant linkages among these phenomena. Several studies reviewed and suggest that suicide is frequently associated with acute alcohol consumption. Acute alcohol use might be one of the mechanisms underlying the complex connections between unemployment and suicide. Importantly, the current authors' research shows that alcohol ingestion itself might be a key risk factor for suicide during and shortly after economic contractions.

Bonn et al. (see record 2021-06968-003). As a result of both legitimate and diverted prescription opioids, more people became addicted to opioids, developed physical dependence on opioids, and died from opioid use. Increased supply fueled demand as consumers turned toward cheaper and more readily available illicit sources such as heroin and illicit fentanyl. Bonn et al. argue that a safe supply would ""facilitate physical isolation by preventing a need to seek funds to purchase unknown substances from unregulated drug markets"". The current author agrees that their plan would facilitate isolation, which might be helpful for reducing transmission of COVID-19, but it would potentially increase addictive use and overdose death.

"Studentsâ€™ stress coping strategies during the covid-19 pandemic Methodology of research","Aim. To present a review of the scientific literature on the problem of studying studentsâ€™ coping behavior in the situation of Covid-19 pandemic, approaches as well as program of interdisciplinary research of studentsâ€™ coping strategies during urgent transition to distance learning in the conditions of anti-epidemic measures. Results. The characteristic of the ways of revealing productive coping-strategies under stress is given with the allocation of conditions, evaluation of the situation, resources which are available for students. From the point of view of medical and hygienic research when assessing coping behavior, individual indicators of physical, mental health, lifestyle, hygienic skills and standards should be taken into account. When assessing psychological and pedagogical factors of coping behavior one should pay attention to academic performance, peculiarities of social and psychological in-teraction with classmates and teachers, socio-economic status, gender and personal characteristics of the individual. Conclusion. The interdisciplinary medical-psychological-pedagogical approach to the study of studentsâ€™ coping behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic causes the construction of a typology of coping behavior, allows to identify productive and non-productive coping strategies for coping with stressful situations, to determine and describe additional factors influencing their choice. The development of recommen-dations on the application of the typology of coping strategies obtained on the basis of interdisciplinary scientific approach, will allow the administration of universities to reasonably approach the development of medical-hygienic and psychological-ped-agogical preventive measures in the design of the educational environment in the conditions of the pandemic.

"An Analysis of the #CovidPain Tweet Chat During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020","Introduction: In March 2020, we organized two tweet chats to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people affected by chronic pain. The objective of this study is to evaluate the #CovidPain tweet chat activities that took place at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a quantitative analysis of the magnitude, range, engagement, and sentiment of each tweet chat. The data was extracted from Twitter and analyzed in Twitter Analytics and Symplur Signals using frequency and distributions. Then, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of the narrative tweets generated in response to the questions posted during the tweet chats. Results: The two tweet chats attracted 2305 participants, which generated 4351 tweets. The participants were healthcare providers, patient advocates, researchers/academics, and caregivers. COVID-19 had both negative and positive impacts. The negative consequences of COVID-19 included the reduction of physical activity, canceled appointments and treatments, more isolation, deterioration of preexisting mental health problems, and economic consequences. The positive consequences included efficient use of telemedicine, innovative methods for self-management, and at-home interventions. Conclusion: Twitter and tweet chats are useful in involving a diverse group of stakeholders for taking a deep dive into the topical issues relevant to a community that might be disproportionately affected by a public health crisis.","Furlan, A.

"COVID-19 kÃ¼resel salgininin toplumsal etkileri The social effects of COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The purpose of this study is to measure people's perceptions, attitudes, and behavior regarding the New Coronavirus Pandemic and the process itself in our country, to examine social tendencies towards the pandemic, and to develop recommendations for policymakers based on the findings. Methods: According to the survey, 40 percent of the participants said their anxiety about death and dying has increased. In comparison, 51 percent reported that their anxiety about getting the virus has increased, and 79 percent stated that their anxiety about losing their loved ones has increased. Especially the existential anxiety of women, those in the lowest income group working in jobs that require close contact, is much higher than men. Strong social ties are an influential factor in alleviating people's anxiety. Results: Sixty-six percent of the respondents stated they feared that they will not be able to meet their basic needs in the future, and 58 percent reported that their income has decreased after the pandemic;only 14.80 percent stated that they find people to be generally trustworthy. As the variables of age, income, and education level decrease, so does trust. The findings reveal that the level of trust is lower among women than men. The percentage of those who see coronavirus as â€œa conspiracy of the great powersâ€ is 56.5 percent in Turkey. Twenty-seven percent of the respondents reported that verbal violence, and 17 percent said physical violence has increased around them after the coronavirus. On the other hand, 11 percent stated that verbal violence, while 4 percent stated that physical violence against them has increased during the same period. Conclusion: This research shows that existential anxiety in society increases as the duration of the pandemic increases. Over time the people have become tired. The pandemic has triggered some negative attitudes such as indifference, weariness, and denial, resulting in developing a type of come-what-may mood in some people. Those who have relatively strong social ties (high level of trust) and those who rely on state institutions cope more easily with the uncertainty and anxiety posed by the pandemic.

"The collateral damage of a worldwide crisis: The impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the work experiences of gastroenterologists","This study investigated the impact of work changes as a result of COVID-19 on the work experiences of 248 gastroenterologists (GEs) working in Dutch hospitals. Specif ically, we studied how the work of GEs changed as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, and what effect this has on burnout, engagement, job satisfaction, employability, work ability, physical and psychological health. Participants completed a questionnaire in the run-up to the second COVID-19 wave in October 2020. Results show that the COVID-19 crisis signif icantly reduced their number of working hours, and a small proportion of GEs worked temporarily in other units to care for COVID-19 patients. At the time of this study, the impact of these changes on the work experiences of GEs appears to be small. Although before the COVID-19 crisis GEs were slightly more positive about their work ability, physical and mental health than during this crisis, the changes in their work as a result of the COVID-19 crisis had no apparent negative ef fects on other aspects of their work experience. This study underscores the importance of not equating healthcare workers in drawing conclusions about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Dif ferent groups can experience the COVID-19 crisis dif ferently, and variation can also exist within professional groups. Attention for work perceptions remains important because doctors who experienced more stress/work pressure reported less favorable outcomes. Â© 2021, Amsterdam University Press.

"Patients attitude and practice toward reporting potential covid-19 symptoms among the al-ahsa population in Saudi Arabia","Background. The new coronavirus pandemic, which appeared at the end of the year 2019, was the greatest in recent decades, and it affected almost all countries and economies, causing a highly significant number of deaths. Objectives. This study aimed to evaluate patientsâ€™ knowledge and attitude when experiencing potential COVID-19 symptoms toward reporting their illness and following viral preventive precautions. Material and methods. AÂ cross-sectional study conducted among the general population in Al-Ahsa, Eastern region, Saudi Arabia. AÂ self-administered questionnaire distributed among the general population, divided into three parts: Socio-demographic characteristics, previous COVID-19 infection and attitude toward experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. AÂ total of 504 responses collected in this study from December 15, 2020 to January 15, 2021. Results. We found that 31.7% were positive among the participants who did COVID-19 testing (48.8%). The level of knowledge showed that more than half (52.2%) were classified at a low knowledge level, while the rest were classified as good (47.8%). Regarding attitude, nearly two-thirds (64.1%) showed a negative attitude, while 35.9% showed a positive attitude. The workplace during the pandemic and family history of COVID-19 were the factors associated with both good knowledge and a positive attitude. Conclusions. The knowledge and attitude toward reporting potential COVID-19 symptoms were generally suboptimal. Male participants, holders of a university degree in the medical field, health practitioners or having a family member working in the medical field demonstrated better knowledge, while those who had a COVID-19 test and those with a family history of the disease positively influenced the attitude.","Albarqi, M.; Almaqhawi, A.; Alrasheed, A.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Schizophrenia Patients","The Covid-19 pandemic affected human life globally, inducing much stress on daily living (Ã‡akiroglu et al. 2020). Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004;Dinan et al., 2004;Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. Â© 2021. Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi.

"Tackling anxiety in schools: Lessons for children aged 3-13","Anxiety is the biggest mental health problem in children, and research tells us it's on the rise. Modern life creates many challenges and pressures for them and the COVID-19 pandemic has only added to this growing problem. Tackling Anxiety in Schools supports all children to get into good habits of recognising their feelings of anxiety and equips them with a repertoire of coping strategies they can use in their day-to-day lives. This book explains how schools can create a safe climate for children and introduces a course of interactive lessons for all ages of primary school and the years beyond. It uses evidence-based preventative strategies, which are suitable for the whole class, based on the needs of children at each stage of development. The intervention programmes include lively activities, resources and courses of lessons which emphasise positivity and are engaging and enjoyable for pupils. With over 55 years' combined experience teaching and working on mental health issues in schools, the authors of this book have focused on providing practical advice and lesson plans that schools can use directly in the classroom. Being able to recognise and deal with anxiety is a vital skill for good mental health and will benefit children for life. The insightful and structured lessons in Tackling Anxiety in Schools teach children the coping skills they need to develop emotional resilience and thrive.

"A qualitative study of mood states in CDC staff in Beijing during the COVID-19 epidemic","Objective: To analyze the mood states and related factors in staff of centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Remote individual depth interviews were performed to investigate the mood states of CDC staff from 5 district-level CDCs of Beijing by using semi-structural interview outline. And the thematic framework analysis was applied to analyze qualitative data. Results: Nine of 18 respondents had different levels of anxiety, 4 reported involuntary worries, 3 had lost in interests, and 5 had depression symptoms, respectively. Shortage of protective equipment (n = 5), insufficient sleep (n = 5), public misunderstand of CDC (n = 4), worries about being infected (n = 3) and policies changes (n = 2) were main factors associated with mood problems of CDC staff.

"Impact of COVID-19 on employees' emotional health: A conceptual model","The COVID-19 pandemic has wrecked havoc on the mankind and caused dramatic disruptions in personal and professional lives of the people. With economies at the verge of collapse, businesses pushed to a standstill, forced alterations in work environment, and uncertainty about the future, this global health crisis has severely impacted employees and organizations. The virus has not only impacted employees physically but also psychologically as they experienced plethora of intense emotional fluctuations. In this regard, the present study aims to synthesize and analyze the existing literature on the subject and present a conceptual framework to aid understanding of the emotional repercussions of pandemic for employees and organizations at large. The extensive review of literature suggests that the perilous crisis resulted in numerous negative emotional outcomes which majorly converge into three i.e. stress, burnout, and depression. This emotional turmoil gets further reflected in employees' performance at work and thus a conceptual model is developed to holistically capture and present such varied impacts of pandemic on employees. The study also posits that the deleterious emotional impacts can have grave ramifications for the organizations and thus, seek immediate attention of the organizational leaders, managers, and policy makers. Against this backdrop, the practical implications of the study are mentioned and recommendations are made, that may help employees and organizations to survive and sustain any such future crisis situations.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child health","Most Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in children are mild or asymptomatic. Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is infrequent. An estimated 0.3-1.3% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to hospital, and of these 13-23% needed critical care. SARS-CoV-2 related deaths were very rare in children, estimated at 2 per million. The vast majority of admitted children had one of shortness of breath, fever, and cough, but atypical symptoms are more common in children. Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardinal symptoms include prolonged fever, clinical signs of inflammation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, and cardiac dysfunction. Twenty two to 80% of patients with MIS-C needed critical care;mortality of MIS-C is around 2%. Six to 24% of children with MIS-C had coronary artery dilatation or cardiac aneurysms. Equipoise still exists between first-line treatment with immunoglobulins and steroids. Outcomes for children with MIS-C are generally very good in those recognised early and started on appropriate treatment. Vaccination schemes for children are rapidly expanding, with the benefits of preventing severe COVID-19 disease and MIS-C and reducing community transmission outweighing the risks of adverse events of, amongst others, myocarditis temporally related to COVID-19 vaccination in children and young adults. The imposed social distancing measures reduced the overall number of children with acute illness or injury presenting to urgent and emergency care facilities worldwide. No clear signal was seen that large numbers of children had a delayed presentation to emergency care departments with a serious illness. The social distancing measures negatively impacted the mental health of children.","Nijman, R.

"The Virality of Pandemics: Reassembling the Social in the Anthropocene","Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was the first pandemic of the twenty-first century, viral epidemics, such as the avian flu, swine flu, Ebola, COVID-19, et cetera, have been appearing with increasing frequency. The adaptation of existing diseases and the emergence of novel viruses are a cause of concern and need to be situated in the context of the anthropogenic events such as deforestation, collapsing biodiversity, species extinction and the melting of polar ice caps. Can the virus make us rethink the categories of lifeâ€“non-life and classificatory practices of biology? How does the trope of immunity link viral diseases and modern forms of biopower? I attempt to locate the virus as an actor in the evolution of life on the planet that sutures the domains of biological, social, political and the geological. The virus forces us to re-examine our conception of sociality, which is predicated on instituting dichotomies of humanâ€“non-human and natureâ€“culture. The reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic may help in overcoming the inertia and helplessness in facing planetary climate crisis.

"A Longitudinal Study on the Mental Health of College Students in Jinan during the Peak Stage of the COVID-19 Epidemic and the Society Reopening","Introduction: COVID-19, a continuously emerging human-to-human infectious disease, has exerted a significant impact on the mental health of college students. However, little is known regarding the variations in the mental health issues experienced by college students during the peak versus reopening stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods: To assess these issues, an online longitudinal survey was conducted via a WeChat applet. Undergraduates (n = 300) were recruited from 26 universities throughout Jinan in February 2020 (T1-the epidemic peak stage) and in January 2021 (T2-the society reopening stage). Their mental status was determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Results: Of the original 300 college students recruited for this survey, 294 responses at T1 and 285 at T2 were analyzed. Compared with responses obtained at T1, college students at T2 showed a greater prevalence of depression (65.3 vs. 51.0%;p = 0.001) and anxiety (47.7 vs. 38.1%, p = 0.019), and experienced more severe depression (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001). Both males (p = 0.03) and females (p &lt; 0.01) showed higher levels of depression at T2 versus T1, while no differences were obtained with regard to anxiety and insomnia. At T1, Grade 4 students showed greater levels of depression (p = 0.005) and anxiety (p = 0.008) than that of Grade 1 students. While at T2, only greater levels of depression (p = 0.004) were present when compared with that of Grade 1 students. Additionally, Grade 4 college students demonstrated a greater prevalence of depression at T2 versus T1 (p = 0.03), but no statistically differences were present for anxiety and insomnia. No statistically significant differences were obtained among the 4 grades of college students for insomnia at either the T1 or T2. Conclusion: With progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, college students showed increasing levels of depression and anxiety, with Grade 4 college students being most seriously affected. It is imperative that intervention strategies be implemented to mitigate against these mental health issues resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zheng, X.; Guo, Y.; Ma, W.; Yang, H.; Luo, L.; Wen, L.; Zhou, X.; Li, Q.; Bi, J.; Wang, P.; Wang, H.","https://doi.org/10.1159/000519586","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Biomedicine Hub;: 102-110, 2021.; Publication details: Biomedicine Hub;: 102-110, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21420,""
"Mood reactive disorders among COVID-19 inpatients: Experience from a monocentric cohort","Objective: We aimed to investigate the presence and severity of depressive symptoms among Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients and any possible changes after their discharge. Subject and Methods: We collected data of patients admitted to the Infectious Disease Unit in Sassari, Italy, for COVID-19, from March 8 to May 8, 2020. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was performed one week after admission (T0) and one week after discharge (T1). The cut-off point chosen to define the clinical significance of depressive symptoms was 20 (at least moderate). Results: Forty-eight subjects were included. Mean age was 64.3 Â± 17.6 years, and 32 (66.7%) were male. Most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases (19;39.6%) and hypertension (17;35.4%). When performing BDI-II at T0, 21 (43.7%) patients reported depressive symptoms at T0, according to the choosen cut-off point (BDI-II= 20). Eight (16.7%) patients had minimal symptoms. Mild mood disturbance, moderate and severe depressive symptoms were found in 24 (50%), 14 (29.2%), and two (4.2%) patients, respectively at T0. Comparison of the BDI-II questionnaire at T0 with T1 showed a significant improvement in total score (p &lt; 0.0001) as well as in four out of the five selected questions of interest (p &lt; 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that kidney failure and the death of a roommate were significantly associated with severity of mood disorders. Conclusion: Mood disturbances and depressive symptoms commonly occur among COVID-19 inpatients. Our results show that COVID-19 inpatients might be at higher risk for developing depressive reactive disorders and could benefit from an early psychological evaluation and strategies improving sleep quality.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on gynecological cancer healthcare: patientÂ´s perspective","Introduction/Background*COVID -19 pandemic has shown a huge impact in health-care systems. In the field of gynecology oncology, we had to postpone routinary tests and check-ups, as well as attend patients that had undergone an oncological process via telephone. Due to their vulnerability, the psychological impact on this patient has been even worse than on other users of the health system. The aim in this study is to evaluate the concerns, global health status and quality of life of patients with gynecological cancer during the pandemic.MethodologyThe GineonCoVID study is a multicenter Spanish study that collect data from a national survey. The anonymous survey consists of 23 questions regarding the personal experience of the patient and modifications in health care during follow up of patient with gynecological malignancies from April to May 2021. The survey has been divided into 3 sections. In this sub-analysis the results of the questions related to anxiety, concerns, quality of life and state of mind of the interviewed patients will be evaluated.Result(s)*376 patients responded to the survey. The median age was 58 years. 43% of the patients were diagnosed with endometrial cancer, 27.3% with ovarian cancer and 24.1% with cervical cancer. 39.6% and 33.6% of patients suffered anxiety and depression respectively during the pandemic. 81% of the patients report having a good quality of life during the last year. Results showed that 54.2% of the respondents are not concerns about viral infection and 67.9% consider that the risk of being infected during follow-up is low. 94% do not perceive changes in follow up, but if they do, 44% believe that clinical health care has experienced a change. 71.4% of the patients are concern about not being able to attend clinical visits.Conclusion*The pandemic could increase anxiety and depression, although it does not appear to worsen the quality of life in patients with gynecological cancer. More than half of the patients consider that they have a low risk of being infected during follow-up but are concerned about not being able to attend clinical visits due to the pandemic.","Carbonell, M.; Gracia, M.; Diestro, M.

"Attitudes of Healthcare Professionals and General Population Toward Vaccines and the Intention to Be Vaccinated Against COVID-19 in Spain","Background: To achieve herd immunity, the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by the population, especially healthcare professionals, plays a key role. The objective of the present paper is to address the differences in attitudes among Spanish healthcare professionals compared with the general population regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This cross-sectional study included data from 2,136 adults (n = 664 healthcare professionals) from an online survey conducted from May 6 to June 9, 2021. The Vaccination attitudes examination scale was used to measure the negative attitudes toward vaccines. Four subscales: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about the unforeseen future effect, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity were calculated. Generalized linear mixed models were conducted to study these associations. Results: Between 10.2 and 22.6% of the subjects showed high levels of negative attitudes toward vaccines. However, only 1.5% of our sample (2.1% among healthcare professionals) refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it was offered because they chose otherwise. Retired people showed the lowest concerns and the highest trust in vaccines. No statistically significant effects were found between working in a healthcare field and having higher positive attitudes toward vaccines. Conclusion: Low levels of rejection against the COVID-19 vaccine were identified in the present sample. However, despite being at a higher risk, health care professionals did not show higher positive attitudes toward vaccines. Furthermore, refusal percentage to vaccination was higher among healthcare professionals compared with non-healthcare professionals. Developing a strategy to increase positive attitudes against the COVID-19 vaccine should be an objective for public health policy.","Iguacel, Isabel; Luna Maldonado, Aurelio; Luna Ruiz-Cabello, Aurelio; SamatÃ¡n, Eva; AlarcÃ³n, Judith; Ãngeles Orte, MarÃ­a; Santodomingo Mateos, Silvia; MartÃ­nez-Jarreta, BegoÃ±a","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.739003","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Public Health;9: 739003, 2021.; Publication details: Front Public Health;9: 739003, 2021.; COVID-19; Vaccines; Adult; Attitude; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Intention; SARS-CoV-2; Spain; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21424,""
"Parallel Pandemics Illustrate the Need for One Health Solutions","African Swine Fever (ASF) was reported in domestic pigs in China in 2018. This highly contagious viral infection with no effective vaccine reached pandemic proportions by 2019, substantially impacting protein availability in the same region where the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently emerged. We discuss the genesis, spread, and wide-reaching impacts of this epidemic in a vital livestock species, noting parallels and potential contributions to ignition of COVID-19. We speculate about impacts of these pandemics on global public health infrastructure and suggest intervention strategies using a cost: benefit approach for low-risk, massive-impact events. We note that substantive changes in how the world reacts to potential threats will be required to overcome catastrophes driven by climate change, food insecurity, lack of surveillance infrastructure, and other gaps. A One Health approach creating collaborative processes connecting expertise in human, animal, and environmental health is essential for combating future global health crises.","Tucker, Claire; Fagre, Anna; Wittemyer, George; Webb, Tracy; Abworo, Edward Okoth; VandeWoude, Sue","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.718546","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Microbiol;12: 718546, 2021.; Publication details: Front Microbiol;12: 718546, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21425,""

METHODS: The study was an anonymous survey sent by the state-owned gambling operator to online gamblers (N=619, among whom 54 percent moderate-risk/problem gamblers) who reached the weekly limit on online gambling during the summer of 2020. RESULTS: Sixty percent were aware of having been limited by a COVID-19-related deposit limit, and a minority (23 percent) perceived the intervention as fairly bad or very bad. Among those aware of the intervention, 39 percent believed this intervention decreased their overall gambling, whereas eight percent believed it rather increased it. However, 83 percent reported having gambled on more than one operator after the limit, and the most common gambling type reported to have increased at another operator was online casino (42 percent in moderate-risk/problem gamblers and 19 percent in others, p<0.001). Having increased gambling following the intervention was associated with being a moderate-risk/problem gambler, and by negative attitudes towards the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A weekly deposit limit had relatively high acceptability, but the study highlights the limitations of a single-operator deposit limit, given the high number of gamblers also reporting to gamble on other operators, and the lower effect in clients with gambling problems.","HÃ¥kansson, Anders; Sundvall, Andreas; Lyckberg, Axel","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/33066","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2021 Sep 18.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2021 Sep 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","",21426,""
"The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy Using Virtual Reality on Apathy in Residential Aged Care: Multisite Nonrandomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder symptom. Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. Recommended nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information and communication technology. Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Research using VR for the symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine whether using HMDs as a tool for reminiscence therapy improves the symptoms of apathy compared with using a laptop computer and physical items with older adults living in residential aged care. METHODS: In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. The primary outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group. RESULTS: Mixed model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=-2.24, SE 1.89; t40=-1.18; P=.24). Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time (estimate=-0.26, SE 1.66; t40=-0.16; P=.88). There were no significant secondary outcomes. Most participants in the VR group stated that they would prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen (&#935;22=11.2; P=.004), side effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms of technology. It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting with correct protocols in place. Providing residents in aged care with a choice of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities. We cannot dismiss the importance of immediate effects while the therapy was in progress, and this is an avenue for future research.

"Emotion recognition by People with autism spectrum disorder during COVID-19 pandemia","<h2>Condition:</h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder;F84.5 - Asperger syndrome<br><br><h2>Intervention:</h2>Intervention 1: The study participant is shown photos from the database ""The Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expressions Set"" on a screen using the PresentationÂ® software. In the photos, the facial expressions of seven different emotions (anger, joy, sadness, fear, pride, embarrassment and a neutral facial expression) of 12 models are shown. The photos were processed using PhotoshopÂ® with the consent of the authors of the database, so that each photo is shown in a randomized order once with a face mask, once with sunglass and once without both utensils (duration approx. 30 minutes). During the presentation of the photos, eye tracking is used to measure the motion of the eyes and the pupil size in response to the photos shown. PresentationÂ® records the reaction time required for the answer as well as the correctly answered items in%. Following the emotion recognition task, the participant has to fill out a few questionnaires: 26-point Toronto alexithymia scale, autism quotient, multiple choice vocabulary intelligence test, Beck depression inventory and a specially developed questionnaire for the subjective recording of emotion recognition during COVID -19 pandemic. Intervention 2: Health controll group<br><br><h2>PrimaryÂ outcome:</h2>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of wearing a face mask on emotion recognition in people with autism. For this purpose, the study participants are presented with photos with facial expressions in a randomized order in an emotion recognition task. The photos are shown in three different conditions: once with a face mask, once with sunglasses and once without both utensils. The measurement is carried out using the PresentationÂ® software, which also shows the photos. Both the correctly answered items (in %) and the required reaction time (in ms) are measured. The respective data are generated by PresentationÂ® at the end of the emotion recognition task. <br>During the emotion recognition task, eye tracking measures the motion oft he eyes and the pupil size in response to the photos shown. This data is measured by a Tobii Eye Tracker and then sent to the PresentationÂ® software. The eye tracking examines whether people with autism look more at the mouth than at the eyes in comparison to the control group when recognizing emotions. The pupil size serves as a measure of aversion. <br>Following the emotion recognition task, the participants fill out a few more questionnaires: 26-point Toronto alexithymia scale (alexithymia is a common phenomenon in autism and has a strong influence on emotion recognition, which is why it should be controlled), autism quotient (as Markers for the severity of autism), multiple choice vocabulary intelligence test (as a performance test to measure the general intelligence level), Beck depression inventory (to exclude a depression as a possible influencing factor on emotion recognition) as well as a specially developed questionnaire for the subjective recording of emotion recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br><h2>Criteria:</h2>Inclusion criteria: 1.

"The effect of progressive muscle relaxation training with demonstration methods on the level of stress, anxiety and depression","<h2>Condition:</h2>Condition 1: stress. Condition 2: Anxiety. Condition 3: depression. <br>Stressful work schedule <br>Phobic anxiety disorders <br>Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified;Z56.3;F32.9<br><br><h2>Intervention:</h2>Intervention 1: Intervention group: The intervention group will perform Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique for 2 weeks, once a day for 20 minutes each time at home. The practical demonstration of a progressive muscle relaxation technique is performed and taught by the researcher himself in the hospital amphitheater during two 60-minute sessions (Every other day). The first session will be a practical demonstration of how to relax and the second session will be a repetition of the first session in order to consolidate the training. At the end of the training sessions, the video of that session will be given to the test group to act only according to the training they have received in practice. The progressive muscle relaxation technique taught will be such that the nurse is sitting or lying in a comfortable chair. Preferably, the subjects' clothes are loose and the watch takes off its bracelet. Then, with the guidance of the instructor and by listening to the audiotape, he contracts and relaxes different muscle groups along with effective and deep breathing. In this technique, large muscle groups are first contracted and relaxed; Because the contraction and relaxation of these muscles and understanding the difference between these two feelings at the beginning of the work is more tangible for people. When the participant contracts and relaxes each of his muscles, he is able to easily and spontaneously relax his whole body in the way he has learned, and from anxiety, stress, and any unpleasant mental, psychological and physical feelings.
