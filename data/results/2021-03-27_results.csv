"Racial/ethnic disparities in sleep in mothers and infants during the Covid-19 pandemic","Study Objectives: To quantify the association between race/ethnicity and maternal and infant self-reported sleep health at 4 months, exploring the role of maternal depression, stress and symptoms of trauma related to the COVID-19 pandemic as potential mediators. Methods: Participants were recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) cohort at Columbia University (N=71 non-Hispanic White, N=14 African American (AA), N=113 Hispanic, N=40 other/declined). Data on infant sleep were collected at 4 months postpartum. A subset of 149 women also completed questionnaires assessing maternal mental health and sleep. Multivariable regressions were used to separately estimate associations of race/ethnicity and mental health with multiple sleep domains for infants and mothers adjusting for individual-level covariates. Results: Compared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic infants slept less at night ({beta}=-101.7{+/-}17.6, p<0.0001) and AA and Hispanic infants went to bed later (respectively {beta} =1.9{+/-}0.6, p<0.0001, {beta}=1.7{+/-}0.3, p<0.0001). Hispanic mothers were less likely to perceive infant sleep as a problem ({beta}=1.0{+/-}0.3, p=0.006). Compared to non-Hispanic White mothers, Hispanic mothers reported worse maternal sleep latency ({beta}=1.2{+/-}0.4, p=0.002), and efficiency ({beta}=0.8{+/-}0.4, p=0.03), but better subjective sleep quality ({beta}=-0.7{+/-}0.4, p=0.05), and less daytime dysfunction ({beta}=-0.8{+/-}0.4, p=0.04). Maternal mental health scores were statistically significant predictors of multiple domains of maternal sleep but did not mediate the association between race/ethnicity and sleep. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic disparities in maternal and infant sleep are observable at 4 months post-partum. Maternal stress, depression and symptoms of trauma related to the COVID-19 pandemic did not mediate these associations.","Maristella Lucchini; Margaret Kyle; NicolÃ³ Pini; Ayesha Sania; Vanessa Babineau; Morgan R.

"Acute and longer-term psychological distress associated with testing positive for COVID-19: longitudinal evidence from a population-based study of US adults","Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has produced a considerable public health burden but the impact that contracting the disease has on mental health is unclear. In this observational population-based cohort study, we examined longitudinal changes in psychological distress associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Methods: Participants (N = 8,002; Observations = 139,035) were drawn from 23 waves of the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative survey of American adults followed-up every two weeks from April 1 2020 to February 15 2021. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Results: Over the course of the study 576 participants reported testing positive for COVID-19. Using regression analysis including individual and time fixed effects we found that psychological distress increased by 0.29 standard deviations (p <.001) during the two-week period when participants first tested positive for COVID-19. Distress levels remained significantly elevated (d = 0.16, p <.01) for a further two weeks, before returning to baseline levels. Coronavirus symptom severity explained changes in distress attributable to COVID-19, whereby distress was more pronounced among those whose symptoms were more severe and were slower to subside. Conclusions: This study indicates that testing positive for COVID-19 is associated with an initial increase in psychological distress that diminishes quickly as symptoms subside. While COVID-19 may not produce lasting psychological distress among the majority of the general population it remains possible that a minority may suffer longer-term mental health consequences.","Michael Daly; Eric Robinson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.21254326","20210326","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12408,""
"Public Opinion about the UK Government during COVID-19 and Implications for Public Health: A Topic Modelling Analysis of Open-Ended Survey Response Data","Confidence in the central UK Government has declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while this may be linked to specific government actions to curb the spread of the virus, understanding is still incomplete. Examining public opinion is important, as research suggests that low confidence in government increases the extent of non-compliance with infection-dampening rules (for instance, social distancing); however, the detailed reasons for this association are still unclear. To understand public opinion on the central UK government during COVID-19, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 4000 free-text survey responses, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. We identified eleven topics, among which were topics related to perceived government corruption and cronyism, complaints about inconsistency in rules and messaging, lack of clear planning, and lack of openness and transparency. Participants reported that elements of the government's approach had made it difficult to comply with guidelines (e.g., changing rules) or were having impacts on mental wellbeing (e.g., inability to plan for the future). Results suggested that consistent, transparent communication and messaging from the government is critical to improving compliance with measures to contain the virus, as well as protecting mental health during health emergencies.","Liam Wright; Alexandra Burton; Alison McKinlay; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.21254094","20210326","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12409,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on utilization of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain and clinical outcomes","The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the delivery of health care services throughout the United States, including those for patients with chronic pain. To measure changes in patients' utilization of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain and related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A pre-post study was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using data in the 3 months before and 3-6Ã‚Â months after the declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19. Participants 21-79 years old with chronic low back pain were included in the study and provided self reported data at relevant quarterly encounters. Use of exercise therapy, yoga, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and opioids for low back pain was measured. The primary outcomes were low back pain intensity and back related functioning measured with a numerical rating scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life scales measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, including scales for physical function, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and activities, and pain interference with activities. A total of 476 participants were included in this study. The mean age of participants at baseline was 54.0 years (standard deviation, Ã‚Â±13.2 years; range, 22-81 years). There were 349 (73.3%) female participants and 127 (26.7%) male participants in the study. Utilization of exercise therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.57), massage therapy (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83), and spinal manipulation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93) decreased during the pandemic. A reduction in NSAID use was also observed (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99). Participants reported a significant, but not clinically relevant, improvement in low back pain intensity during the pandemic (mean improvement, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; Cohen's <i>d</i>, 0.11). However, White participants reported a significant improvement in low back pain intensity (mean improvement, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.46), whereas Black participants did not (mean improvement,Ã‚Â -0.13; 95% CI,Ã‚Â -0.46 to 0.19; p for interaction=0.03). Overall, there was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain interference with activities (mean improvement, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.20-2.02; Cohen's <i>d</i>, 0.20). The use of NSAIDs during the pandemic was associated with marginal increases in low back pain intensity. Overall, decreased utilization of treatments for chronic low back pain did not adversely impact pain and functioning outcomes during the first 6 months of the pandemic. However, Black participants experienced significantly worse pain outcomes than their White counterparts.","Licciardone","https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2020-0334","20210326","COVID-19; chronic low back pain; nonpharmacological therapy; opioids; pain management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12410,""
"How to bring residents' psychosocial well-being to the heart of the fight against Covid-19 in Belgian nursing homes-A qualitative study","Nursing homes (NH) for the elderly have been particularly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic mainly due to their hosted vulnerable populations and poor outbreak preparedness. In Belgium, the medical humanitarian organization MÃƒÂ©decins Sans FrontiÃƒÂ¨res (MSF) implemented a support project for NH including training on infection prevention and control (IPC), (re)-organization of care, and psychosocial support for NH staff. As psychosocial and mental health needs of NH residents in times of Covid-19 are poorly understood and addressed, this study aimed to better understand these needs and how staff could respond accordingly. A qualitative study adopting thematic content analysis. Eight focus group discussions with direct caring staff and 56 in-depth interviews with residents were conducted in eight purposively and conveniently selected NHs in Brussels, Belgium, June 2020. NH residents experienced losses of freedom, social life, autonomy, and recreational activities that deprived them of their basic psychological needs. This had a massive impact on their mental well-being expressed in feeling depressed, anxious, and frustrated as well as decreased meaning and quality of life. Staff felt unprepared for the challenges posed by the pandemic; lacking guidelines, personal protective equipment and clarity around organization of care. They were confronted with professional and ethical dilemmas, feeling 'trapped' between IPC and the residents' wellbeing. They witnessed the detrimental effects of the measures imposed on their residents. This study revealed the insights of residents' and NH staff at the height of the early Covid-19 pandemic. Clearer outbreak plans, including psychosocial support, could have prevented the aggravated mental health conditions of both residents and staff. A holistic approach is needed in NHs in which tailor-made essential restrictive IPC measures are combined with psychosocial support measures to reduce the impact on residents' mental health impact and to enhance their quality of life.","Kaelen, van den Boogaard, Pellecchia, Spiers, De Cramer, Demaegd, Fouqueray, Van den Bergh, Goublomme, Decroo, Quinet, Van Hoof, Draguez","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249098","20210326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12411,""
"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Healthcare Personnel and Their Household Contacts at a Tertiary Academic Medical Center: Protocol for a Longitudinal Cohort Study","Healthcare personnel are at high risk for exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While personal protective equipment may mitigate this risk, prospective data collection on its use and other risk factors for seroconversion in this population is needed. The primary objectives of this study are to (1) determine the incidence of and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel at a tertiary medical center and (2) actively monitor personal protective equipment use, interactions between study participants via electronic sensors, secondary cases in households, and participant mental health and well-being. To achieve these objectives, we designed a prospective, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel and their household contacts at an academic tertiary care medical center in North Carolina. Enrolled healthcare personnel completed frequent surveys on symptoms and work activities and provided serum and nasal samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing every two weeks. Additionally, interactions between participants and their movement within the clinical environment were captured with a smartphone app and Bluetooth sensors. Finally, a subset of participants' households was randomly selected every two weeks for further investigation and enrolled households provided serum and nasal samples via at-home collection kits. As of December 31, 2020, 211 healthcare personnel and 53 household participants have been enrolled. Recruitment and follow-up are ongoing and expected to continue through March 2021. Much remains to be learned regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel and their household contacts. Through the use of a multi-faceted prospective study design and a well-characterized cohort, we will collect critical information regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks in the healthcare setting and its linkage to the community.","Ciccone, Zivich, Lodge, Zhu, Law, Miller, Taylor, Chung, Xu, Volfovsky, Beatty, Abernathy, King, Garrett, Markmann, Rebuli, Sellers, Weber, Reyes, Alavian, Juliano, Boyce, Aiello","https://doi.org/10.2196/25410","20210326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12412,""

"Postintensive Care Syndrome in Survivors of Critical Illness Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019: Cohort Study From a New York City Critical Care Recovery Clinic","Determine the characteristics of postintensive care syndrome in the cognitive, physical, and psychiatric domains in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors. Single-center descriptive cohort study from April 21, to July 7, 2020. Critical care recovery clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adults who had critical illness due to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring an ICU stay of 7 days or more and who agreed to a telehealth follow-up in the critical care recovery clinic 1-month post hospital discharge. None. Patient-reported outcome measures assessing physical and psychiatric domains were collected electronically, a cognitive test was performed by a clinician, and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical records. Outcome measures assessed postintensive care syndrome symptoms in the physical (Modified Rankin Scale, Dalhousie Clinical Frailty Scale, Neuro-Quality of Life Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Function, Neuro-Quality of Life Fatigue), psychiatric (Insomnia Severity Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), and cognitive (Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment) domains. The 3-Level Version of Euro-QoL-5D was used to assess the physical and psychiatric domains. A diagnosis of postintensive care syndrome was made in cases with evidence of impairment in at least one postintensive care syndrome domain. We included 45 patients with a mean (SD) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition. Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome.

"The psychological burden of waiting for procedures and patient-centred strategies that could support the mental health of wait-listed patients and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review","Waiting for procedures delayed by COVID-19 may cause anxiety and related adverse consequences. To synthesize research on the mental health impact of waiting and patient-centred mitigation strategies that could be applied in the COVID-19 context. Using a scoping review approach, we searched 9 databases for studies on waiting lists and mental health and reported study characteristics, impacts and intervention attributes and outcomes. We included 51 studies that focussed on organ transplant (60.8%), surgery (21.6%) or cancer management (13.7%). Most patients and caregivers reported anxiety, depression and poor quality of life, which deteriorated with increasing wait time. The impact of waiting on mental health was greater among women and new immigrants, and those of younger age, lower socio-economic status, or with less-positive coping ability. Six studies evaluated educational strategies to develop coping skills: 2 reduced depression (2 did not), 1 reduced anxiety (2 did not) and 2 improved quality of life (2 did not). In contrast, patients desired acknowledgement of concerns, peer support, and periodic communication about wait-list position, prioritization criteria and anticipated procedure date. Findings revealed patient-centred strategies to alleviate the mental health impact of waiting for procedures. Ongoing research should explore how to optimize the impact of those strategies for diverse patients and caregivers, particularly in the COVID-19 context. Six patients and four caregivers waiting for COVID-19-delayed procedures helped to establish eligibility criteria, plan data extraction and review a draft and final report.","Gagliardi, Yip, Irish, Wright, Rubin, Ross, Green, Abbey, McAndrews, Stewart","https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13241","20210326","anxiety; depression; implementation science; mental health; patient-centred care; quality improvement; quality of life; review; waiting lists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12415,""
"Predictors of UK healthcare worker burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is putting health professionals under increasing pressure. This population is already acknowledged to be at risk of burnout. We aim to provide a 'snapshot' of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 open to any UK healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, distress and subjective measures of stress were also recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. A total of 539 persons responded to the survey; 90% female, 53% nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% versus 33% under 40 years, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031), twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and were almost 4 times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012). Independent predictors of burnout were being younger, redeployment, exposure to patients with COVID-19, being female, and a history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.","Ferry, Wereski, Strachan, Mills","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcab065","20210326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12416,""
"Greatest changes in objective sleep architecture during COVID-19 lockdown in night-owls with increased REM sleep","The Covid-19 pandemic has had dramatic effects on society and people's daily habits. In this observational study we recorded objective data on sleep macro- and microarchitecture repeatedly over several nights before and during the Covid-19 government-imposed lockdown. The main objective was to evaluate changes in patterns of sleep duration and architecture during home confinement using the pre-confinement period as a control. Participants were regular users of a sleep-monitoring headband that records, stores, and automatically analyses physiological data in real time, equivalent to polysomnography. We measured: sleep onset duration (SOD), total sleep time (TST), duration of sleep stages (N2, N3 and REM), and sleep continuity. Via the user's smartphone application participants filled-in questionnaires on how lockdown changed working hours, eating behaviour, and daily-life at home. They also filled-in the Insomnia Severity Index, reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires allowing us to create selected sub-groups. The 599 participants were mainly men (71%) of median age 47 [IQR: 36;59]. Compared to before lockdown, during lockdown individuals slept more overall (mean +3Ã‚Â·83Ã‚Â min; SD: Ã‚Â±1.3), had less deep sleep (N3), more light sleep (N2) and longer REM sleep (mean +3Ã‚Â·74Ã‚Â min; SD: Ã‚Â±0.8). They exhibited less week-end specific changes, suggesting less sleep restriction during the week. Changes were most pronounced in individuals reporting eveningness preferences, suggesting relative sleep deprivation in this population and exacerbated sensitivity to societal changes. This unique dataset should help us understand the effects of lockdown on sleep architecture and on our health.","PÃƒÂ©pin, Bailly, Mordret, Gaucher, Tamisier, Ben Messaoud, Arnal, Mignot","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab075","20210326","Covid-19 lockdown; chronotype; sleep architecture; sleep monitoring headband","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12417,""

This study investigated (1) patterns of volunteering among older adults in Hong Kong during COVID-19; (2) associations between volunteering and mental health of older adults during COVID-19; and (3) associations between key psychological resources (e.g., self-efficacy and self-esteem) and volunteering among older adults during COVID-19. This study applied a cross-sectional design with data collected from 128 older adults in June 2020, who were trained as volunteers in a volunteer program that began before COVID-19. The study found that older adults continued to actively contribute to their communities by engaging in volunteering during COVID-19. The specific type of volunteering activities was linked to few depressive and anxiety symptoms. Older adults with increased self-esteem prior to COVID-19 were more likely to participate in volunteering activities related to COVID-19. Our study suggested that encouraging older adults to volunteer during the pandemic is a key pathway to maintain mental health.

"Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health and Motor Deficits in Cuban Patients with Cerebellar Ataxias","Although there are no convincing evidences of detrimental effect of SARS-CoV2 infection on the cerebellum, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the life quality of patients with cerebellar ataxias, but few studies have addressed this concern. To assess the motor and mental health changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemics in Cuban patients with cerebellar ataxias, three hundred four patients with cerebellar ataxias and 167 healthy controls were interviewed for risks of exposure to COVID-19, and the self-perception of the pandemics' impact on the disease progression and on the mental health. All subjects underwent the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The patients reported low exposition to SARS-CoV2 infection, but one case was confirmed with a mild COVID-19. Overall, depressive and anxiety symptoms were significantly and marginally increased in patients, respectively, with higher scores in cases with severe and moderate ataxia. Positive patient's impression of psychopathological changes was associated to increased age, age at onset, and anxiety. Sixty-seven patients had a positive self-perception of ataxia progression, which was mainly influenced by higher anxiety scores but not by the adherence to at-home exercise programs. However, the practice of physical exercise was related with lower depression and anxiety scores, but this therapeutical effect was not significantly influenced by the disease stage. We demonstrated the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and motor deficits in Cuban patients with cerebellar ataxias and the positive effect of the at-home physical exercise programs on their mental well-being. These findings give rationales to develop tele-medicine approaches to minimize these health impacts and to study the long-term effects of such sequelae and accordingly define their treatments.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-GarcÃƒÂ©s, DomÃƒÂ­nguez-Barrios, Zayas-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Sigler-Villanueva, Canales-Ochoa, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez Oliver, RamÃƒÂ­rez-Bautista, Caballero-Laguna, Arrufat-Pie, Carrillo-Rodes, Medrano-Montero, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-ÃƒÂlvarez, GÃƒÂ¡mez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Guerra-RondÃƒÂ³n, Aguilera-Batista, Vazquez-Mojena, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Labrada, VelÃƒÂ¡zquez-PÃƒÂ©rez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-021-01260-9","20210326","COVID-19; Cerebellar ataxias; Mental health; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12420,""
"Canadian Adolescents' Internalized Symptoms in Pandemic Times: Association with Sociodemographic Characteristics, Confinement Habits, and Support","Adolescence is a time of increased risk for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression, especially for girls. The stress and social isolation experienced during confinement add new threats to already vulnerable adolescents' daily lives. This study is aimed at determining which sociodemographic characteristics (age, family composition, achievement), confinement habits (schedule, new hobby, sleep duration, cellphone and computer use, sports, schoolwork), and sources of support (parents and teachers) are associated with more or less internalized symptoms in Canadian adolescents. Differences between boys and girls are also investigated. Between April 8 and 30 (2020) and through an online survey, 895 Canadian adolescents (74% girls) aged between 12 and 17Ã‚Â years (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.7) were recruited. Path analysis was performed to identify significant associations between sociodemographic characteristics, confinement habits, support variables, and internalized symptoms. Independent samples t-tests and invariance tests were conducted to compare boys and girls. Results suggest that certain confinement habits (time spent using cellphones, doing sports and schoolwork, finding a new hobby) and support variables (parents working outside the home) were significantly and negatively associated with internalized symptoms. Regarding the sex differences, girls used their cellphones more and invariance test results showed that all associations between predictors and symptoms were statistically similar for boys and girls. This study's results help understand better adolescents' experience in confinement. It sheds light on the habits likely to characterize those who are less at risk of experiencing distress, making it possible to better support adolescents during this challenging period.","Tardif-Grenier, Archambault, DupÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©, Marks, Olivier","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09895-x","20210326","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Confinement; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12421,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Shutdown on Mental Health in Appalachia by Working Status","To slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, businesses shutdown in Spring 2020. Research has indicated the impact on frontlines workers, yet little is known about the impact on those who were not working outside the home or switched to working remotely. The purpose of this report is to identify the financial and healthcare issues and mental health impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on Appalachians by worker categories. An online survey was administered from May 8 - June 6, 2020 to a convenience sample of previous research participants and shared through social media networks, i.e., snowball sampling. Questions investigated mental health, financial and healthcare issues, and employment status. Survey responses were summarized by percentages overall and by working categories. Of the 751 participants, 276 (42%) resided in Appalachia. After removing 17 who lost their job due to COVID-19, 59 (23%) indicated not working outside the home prior to COVID-19, whereas 111 (43%) and 89 (34%) switched to working remotely and continued working outside the home during the shutdown. Respondents were predominately Caucasian and female. Nearly a quarter of participants had lost or reduced income due to the shutdown. Approximately half missed or postponed healthcare appointments. Mental health impacts were similar across the groups, with half of the respondents reporting anxiety due to COVID-19. Further research is needed to explore health outcomes associated with missed healthcare appointments during the shutdown. Mental health support may be needed equally by those isolated at home and frontline workers.","Haynes, Hilbert, Westneat, Leger, Keynton, Bush","https://doi.org/10.13023/jah.0301.03","20210326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12422,""
"The Job Demands and Resources Related to COVID-19 in Predicting Emotional Exhaustion and Secondary Traumatic Stress Among Health Professionals in Spain","The current COVID-19 crisis may have an impact on the mental health of professionals working on the frontline, especially healthcare workers due to the increase of occupational psychosocial risks, such as emotional exhaustion and secondary traumatic stress (STS). This study explored job demands and resources during the COVID-19 crisis in predicting emotional exhaustion and STS among health professionals. The present study is a descriptive and correlational cross-sectional design, conducted in different hospitals and health centers in Spain. The sample consisted of 221 health professionals with direct involvement in treating COVID-19. An online survey was created and distributed nationwide from March 20 to April 15 which assessed: sociodemographic and occupational data, fear of contagion, contact with death/suffering, lack of material and human protection resources (MHRP), challenge, emotional exhaustion, and STS. Descriptive findings show high levels of workload, contact with death/suffering, lack of MHPR and challenge, and are moderately high for fear of contagion, emotional exhaustion, and STS. We found an indirect significant effect of lack of MHPR on predicting (1) emotional exhaustion through the workload and (2) on STS through fear of contagion, contact with death/suffering, and workload. To conclude, this study examines the immediate consequences of the crisis on health professionals' well-being in Spain, emphasizing the job demands related to COVID-19 that health professionals are facing, and the resources available in these health contexts. These findings may boost follow-up of this crisis among health professionals to prevent them from long-term consequences.","Moreno-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Blanco-Donoso, Chico-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Belda Hofheinz, Moreno-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Garrosa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.564036","20210326","COVID-19 crisis; challenge; emotional exhaustion; health professionals; job demands; job resources; secondary traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12423,""

"Implementation of office-based buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder","Buprenorphine-based medication-assisted treatment (B-MAT) is a powerful, concrete intervention that can be provided by nurse practitioners (NPs) to reduce opioid-related overdoses in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, multiple barriers exist to provide and access this therapy. A rural Midwestern county struggled with increasing OUD and scant access to B-MAT. A nurse-led, community clinic had the potential to expand access to treatment but no support structure to provide it. In this quality improvement project, a one-group posttest-only design was used to assess treatment access, care quality, and patient characteristics. An evidence-based, nurse led weekly B-MAT clinic using a low-threshold, chronic-care model for treatment of OUD. The B-MAT clinic expanded county-wide access by 34% over seven months. A total of 23 patients were seen with 21 eligible for treatment with B-MAT. All nine patients with at least 90-day continuous treatment were retained in the program. Three quarters of patients had at least 30 days of active buprenorphine-naloxone coverage and 17% of all patients were lost to follow up. There were no induction-related adverse events, no fatalities, and one nonfatal overdose. In a chart review, 85% of patients met at least six of eight quality criteria. This low-barrier approach to OUD expanded access to treatment and demonstrated a model stable enough to continue delivering care throughout the first 5 months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. NPs in primary care settings can effectively provide B-MAT in a low-threshold, office-based setting.","Carroll","https://doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000588","20210326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12425,""
"A Survey of Mental Health in Graduate Nursing Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression are common symptoms in graduate students pursuing a degree in the health care professions. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic likely complicated these existing issues. To confirm this hypothesis, researchers created a survey to examine the experiences of graduate nursing students during COVID-19. Graduate nursing students (n = 222) completed the survey, which included 2 instruments: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale (IES-R). Nearly 25% of students expressed moderate to extremely severe levels of negative emotional states on the DASS-21, and 23.8% of students scored within the area of clinical concern for the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder on the IES-R. Understanding levels of mental health and associated factors that may contribute to changes can assist administration, faculty, and staff in targeting resources and interventions to support graduate nursing students to continue their education.","Rosenthal, Lee, Jenkins, Arbet, Carrington, Hoon, Purcell, Nodine","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNE.0000000000001013","20210326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12426,""
"COVID-19 and Breast Radiologist Wellness: Impact of Gender, Financial Loss, and Childcare Need","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the emotional and financial impact of COVID-19 on breast radiologists to understand potential consequences on physician wellness and gender disparities in radiology. A 41-question survey was distributed from June to September 2020 to members of the Society of Breast Imaging and the National Consortium of Breast Centers. Psychological distress and financial loss scores were calculated on the basis of survey responses and compared across gender and age subgroups. A multivariate logistic model was used to identify factors associated with psychological distress scores. A total of 628 surveys were completed (18% response rate); the mean respondent age was 52 Ã‚Â± 10 years, and 79% were women. Anxiety was reported by 68% of respondents, followed by sadness (41%), sleep problems (36%), anger (25%), and depression (23%). A higher psychological distress score correlated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; PÃ‚Â = .001), younger age (OR, 0.8 per SD; PÃ‚Â = .005), and a higher financial loss score (OR, 1.4; P &lt; .0001). Participants whose practices had not initiated wellness efforts specific to COVID-19 (54%) had higher psychological distress scores (OR, 1.4; PÃ‚Â = .03). Of those with children at home, 38% reported increased childcare needs, higher in women than men (40% vs 29%, P &lt; .001). Thirty-seven percent reported that childcare needs had adversely affected their jobs, which correlated with higher psychological distress scores (OR, 2.2-3.3; P &lt; .05). Psychological distress was highest among younger and female respondents and those with greater pandemic-specific childcare needs and financial loss. Practice-initiated COVID-19-specific wellness efforts were associated with decreased psychological distress. Policies are needed to mitigate pandemic-specific burnout and worsening gender disparities.","Milch, Grimm, Plimpton, Tran, Markovic, Dontchos, Destounis, Dialani, Dogan, Sonnenblick, Zuley, Dodelzon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2021.02.022","20210326","COVID-19; breast radiology; burnout; disparity; gender; pandemic; physician wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12427,""

"Psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia: an online cross-sectional study to identify the need for equal attention of intervention","The COVID-19 pandemic led individuals to suffer from different levels of mental health problems such as psychological distress, anxiety, depression, denial, panic, and fear. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors among the Ethiopian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was performed through an online survey using different online platforms. The questionnaire was created through Google Form and the survey link was administered by e-mail, LinkedIn, Telegram, and Facebook. Educated Ethiopian population who have access to the internet were invited to participate through an online survey and addressed to 929 respondents. The study participants completed the survey anonymously without any personal identifier. The psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 10-item tool to measure psychological distress. Data were analyzed using SPSS and logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. A generalized additive model was also employed to identify additional predictors using R. The prevalence of high psychological distress among the study population was 236 (25.5%). Of all respondents, 421 (45.1%) had low psychological distress, 274 (29.4%) had moderate psychological distress, 164 (17.6%) had high psychological distress, and 72 (7.3%) had very high psychological distress. Psychological distress increased with being at young and middle-aged adults, getting information from social media, and not correctly practicing infection prevention and control measures to prevent COVID-19 infection. Respondents with high perceived severity had increased psychological distress. On the contrary, those with the highest score of perceived response efficacy had low distress. Prevalence of psychological distress was substantial. The need for intervention of psychological distress inline with the prevention of COVID-19 is critically essential. The intervention target groups are those whose information sources are from social media, young and middle-aged adults, and those who do not correctly practice infection prevention and control measures against COVID-19 infection.","Ambelu, Birhanu, Yitayih, Kebede, Mecha, Abafita, Belay, Fufa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00344-4","20210326","COVID-19; Ethiopia; Online survey; Pandemic; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12429,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child health and the provision of Care in Paediatric Emergency Departments: a qualitative study of frontline emergency care staff","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health guidance to reduce the spread of the disease have wide-reaching implications for children's health and wellbeing. Furthermore, paediatric emergency departments (EDs) have rapidly adapted provision of care in response to the pandemic. This qualitative study utilized insight from multidisciplinary frontline staff to understand 1) the changes in paediatric emergency healthcare utilization during COVID-19 2) the experiences of working within the restructured health system. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with frontline staff working in two paediatric EDs and two mixed adult and children EDs. Participants included emergency medicine clinicians (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5), nursing managerial staff (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6), social workers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2) and nursing staff (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2). Thematic Analysis (TA) was applied to the data to identify key themes. The pandemic and public health restrictions have had an adverse impact on children's health and psychosocial wellbeing, compounded by difficulty in accessing primary and community services. The impact may have been more acute for children with disabilities and chronic health conditions and has raised child protection issues for vulnerable children. EDs have shown innovation and agility in the structural and operational changes they have implemented to continue to deliver care to children, however resource limitations and other challenges must be addressed to ensure high quality care delivery and protect the wellbeing of those tasked with delivering this care. The spread of COVID-19 and subsequent policies to address the pandemic has had wide-reaching implications for children's health and wellbeing. The interruption to health and social care services is manifesting in myriad ways in the ED, such as a rise in psychosocial presentations. As the pandemic continues to progress, policy makers and service providers must ensure the continued provision of essential health and social services, including targeted responses for those with existing conditions.","Conlon, McDonnell, Barrett, Cummins, Deasy, Hensey, McAuliffe, Nicholson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06284-9","20210326","COVID-19; Paediatric emergency medicine, psychosocial, mental health; Public health restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","",12430,""
