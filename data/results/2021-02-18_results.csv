"Excess Mortality in Suicide caused by COVID-19 in Japan","Background: Countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdown and voluntary restrictions against going out adversely affect human stress and economic activity. Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide. Object: We examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19. Method: We applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through September, 2020 for the whole of Japan for both genders. Effects of the great earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the estimation model. Results: Significant excess mortality in suicide was found in July, August and September in 2020 for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total, 810 excess cases of mortality were identified. Discussion and Conclusion: Excess mortality during the two months was 1.4 times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing. Countermeasures against COVID-19 should be chosen carefully in light of suicide effects.","Junko Kurita; Yoshiyuki Sugishita; Tamie Sugawara; Yasushi Ohkusa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251670","20210218","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10806,""
"Mortality from injury, overdose and suicide during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, March-July, 2020","Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial rates of all-cause excess mortality. The contribution of external causes of death to excess mortality including drug overdose, homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries during the initial outbreak in the United States is less well documented.

MethodsUsing public data published by the National Center for Health Statistics on February 10, 2021, we measured monthly excess mortality (the gap between observed and expected deaths) from five external causes using national-level data published by National Center for Health Statistics; assault (homicide); intentional self-harm (suicide); accidents (unintentional injuries); and motor vehicle accidents. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) models developed with cause-specific monthly mortality counts and US population data from 2015-2019 and estimated the contribution of individual cause-specific mortality to all-cause excess mortality from March-July 2020.

ResultsFrom March-July, 2020, 212,825 (95% CI 136,236-290,776) all-cause excess deaths occurred in the US). There were 8,540 excess drug overdoses (all intents) (95% CI 5,106 to 11,975), accounting for 4% of all excess mortality; 1,455 excess homicide deaths (95% CI 708 to 2202, accounting for 0.7% of excess mortality; 5,492 excess deaths due to unintentional accidents occurred (95% CI 85 to 10,899, accounting for 2.6% of excess mortality. Though a non-significantly 135 (95% CI -1361 to 1,630) more MVA deaths were recorded during the study period, a significant decrease in April (525; 95% CI -817 to -233) and significant increases in June-July (965; 95% CI 348 to 1,587) were observed. Suicide deaths were statistically lower than projected by 2,067 (95% CI 941-3,193 fewer deaths).

MeaningExcess deaths from drug overdoses, homicide, and addicents occurred during the pandemic but represented a small fraction of all-cause excess mortality. The excess external causes of death, however, still represent thousands of lives lost. Notably, deaths from suicide were lower than expected and therefore did not contribute to excess mortality.","Jeremy Faust; Chengan Du; Katherine Mayes; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Michael L Barnett; Harlan M Krumholz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682","20210216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10807,""
"In the eye of a quiet storm: A critical incident study on the quarantine experience during the coronavirus pandemic","In 2020, the COVID-19 appeared in Italy with an exponential transmission capacity and serious consequences for the whole population. To counter the spread of the virus, the Italian government has adopted an extensive lockdown, forcing citizens to stay at home and avoid social contact. The COVID-19 quarantine represents a unique phenomenon in the recent centuries, and its long-term consequences on people's lives and mental health are still to be understood. This study aimed to explore significant experiences of people who did not contract the virus, yet experienced the quarantine as a potentially stressful condition. Italians who did not contract the COVID-19 were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews employing the Critical Incident Technique. Interviews were designed to capture the significant experiences related to the lockdown period in Italy. Participants were asked to describe the most significant (1) negative and (2) positive critical events that they personally experienced during the ongoing quarantine. Such events were meant to provide information on their experience of the quarantine as a whole. The audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed following Critical Incident Technique's indications. Twenty two participants described a total of 43 critical events, including 22 negative episodes and 21 positive events experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Three categories emerged from the negative episodes and four categories emerged from the positive events described by the participants. Relevant themes both positive and negative concerned mostly relationships (with partners, family, and friends), and the alteration of everyday activities, Also a specific &quot;sensation of emergency&quot; that the participants felt during the pandemic emerged, as an emotionally-charged response to quarantine-related external stimuli. To our knowledge this is the first in-depth qualitative study investigating the significant negative and positive events that people experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Future research could employ analogous event recollection methods but focus on other populations (e.g., fragile subjects or on other national contests), in order to extend the information on the quarantine experience and its possible long-lasting effects.","Durosini, Triberti, Savioni, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247121","20210217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10808,""
"Well-Being of Pediatric Hematology Oncology Providers and Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the New York and New Jersey Epicenter","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the well-being of healthcare workers to varying degrees. The aim of the current study was to investigate how the pandemic has affected the burnout, stress, and emotional well-being of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) providers and staff in the New York and New Jersey epicenter. The study was conducted in June 2020 during the pandemic through an electronic survey. The survey contained questions surrounding demographics, pandemic experiences, and validated burnout, stress, and emotional well-being measures. Two hundred fifty-two PHO providers and staff responded to the survey. Overall, half of the participants reported high levels of burnout, average stress scores were in the mild-moderate range, and the majority scored in the none-to-mild symptomatology range for their well-being. Self-reported burnout levels before the pandemic and geographic work location were statistically significant risk factors for all outcomes. Additional predictors for some outcomes included hospital role, lack of trust in leadership, and deployment. The majority of participants (87.0%) reported that their hospitals had made mental health resources related to COVID-19 available to them but only 8.4% reported having used them. PHO providers and staff in the NYC/NJ area are experiencing a range of emotional experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the majority are not using current resources. With the continuation of the pandemic, we must continue efforts to improve provider and staff distress to mitigate the degree of potential negative short-term and long-term impact.","Moerdler, Steinberg, Jin, Cole, Levy, Rosenthal","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.20.00882","20210217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10809,""

"Propensity of aerosol and droplet creation during oculoplastic procedures: A risk assessment with high-speed imaging amidst COVID-19 pandemic","The study uses principles of liquid and gas mechanics to verify and quantify the generation of aerosols in oculoplastic procedures, namely surgery using a scalpel, electrosurgical device, and a mechanized drill. Surgical techniques were performed ex vivo using the electrosurgical device, scalpel, and mechanized drill on the muscle and bone of commercially available chicken. The liquid and gas dynamics were observed using a high-speed high-resolution Photron SA5 camera (0.125 to 8 ms temporal resolution, 0.016 to 0.054 mm/pixel spatial resolution) and stroboscopic lighting (Veritas 120 E LED Constellation). The analysis was performed using in-house algorithms and ImageJ software. The use of a mechanized drill at 35000 rpm and a 3 mm fluted burr generated aerosol with particle size 50 to 550 microns with a spread of 1.8 m radius. Surgical smoke was generated by an electrosurgical device in both cutting and coagulation modes. Dispersion of the smoke could be controlled significantly by the use of suction, mean smoke spread ratio being 0.065 without suction and 0.002 with use of suction within 2 cm. The quantification of the aerosol generation will help surgeons take practical decisions in their surgical techniques in the pandemic era.","Gupta, Pandey, Thomas, Basu, Shetty, Shetty, Roy","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.IJO_2859_20","20210217","Aerosol; electrosurgical device; high-resolution high-speed imaging; surgical drill; surgical smoke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10811,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Online Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Support Community Members: Survey Study","People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research from the first two months of the pandemic suggests that a small proportion of people with OCD experienced worsening in their OCD symptoms since the pandemic began, whereas the rest experienced either no change or an improvement in their symptoms. However, as society-level factors relating to the pandemic have evolved, the effects of the pandemic on people with OCD have likely changed as well, in complex and population-specific ways. Therefore, this study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people and demonstrates how differences across studies might emerge when studying specific populations at specific timepoints. This study aimed to assess how members of online OCD support communities felt the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their OCD symptoms, around 3 months after the pandemic began. We recruited participants from online OCD support communities for our brief survey. Participants indicated how much they felt their OCD symptoms had changed since the pandemic began and how much they felt that having OCD was making it harder to deal with the pandemic. We collected survey data from June through August 2020 and received a total of 196 responses, some of which were partial responses. Among the nonmissing data, 65.9% (108/164) of the participants were from the United States and 90.5% (152/168) had been subjected to a stay-at-home order. In all, 92.9% (182/196) of the participants said they experienced worsening of their OCD symptoms since the pandemic began, although the extent to which their symptoms worsened differed across dimensions of OCD; notably, symmetry and completeness symptoms were less likely to have worsened than others. Moreover, 95.5% (171/179) of the participants felt that having OCD made it difficult to deal with the pandemic. Our study of online OCD support community members found a much higher rate of OCD symptom worsening than did other studies on people with OCD conducted during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as quarantine length, location, overlapping society-level challenges, and differing measurement and sampling choices may help to explain this difference across studies.","Kaveladze, Chang, Siev, Schueller","https://doi.org/10.2196/26715","20210217","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; obsessive-compulsive disorder; online support communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10812,""
"Evaluation of an Intergenerational and Technological Intervention for Loneliness: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial","Social integration and mental health are vital aspects of healthy aging. However, close to half of Canadians older than 80 years report feeling socially isolated. Research has shown that social isolation leads to increased mortality and morbidity, and various interventions have been studied to alleviate loneliness among older adults. This proposal presents an evaluation of an intervention that provides one-on-one coaching, is intergenerational, provides both educational and socialization experiences, and increases technology literacy of older adults to overcome loneliness. This paper describes the protocol of a randomized, mixed-methods study that will take place in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an intergenerational technology literacy program can reduce social isolation and depression in older adults via quantitative and qualitative outcome measures. This study is a randomized, mixed-methods, feasibility trial with 2 conditions. Older adults in the intervention condition will receive 1 hour of weekly technological assistance to send an email to a family member, for 8 weeks, with the assistance of a volunteer. Participants in the control condition will not receive any intervention. The primary outcomes are loneliness, measured using the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, and depression, measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, both of which are measured weekly. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, as assessed using the Older People's Quality of Life-Brief version, and technological literacy, evaluated using the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire-12, both of which will be administered before and after the intervention. Semistructured interviews will be completed before and after the intervention to assess participants' social connectedness, familiarity with technology, and their experience with the intervention. The study will be completed in a long-term care facility in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Significance was set at P&lt;.05. This study was funded in April 2019 and ethical approval was obtained in August 2019. Recruitment for the study started in November 2019. The intervention began in February 2020 but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial will be restarted when safe. As of March 2020, 8 participants were recruited. Information and communication technology interventions have shown varying results in reducing loneliness and improving mental health among older adults. Few studies have examined the role of one-on-one coaching for older adults in addition to technology education in such interventions. Data from this study may have the potential to provide evidence for other groups to disseminate similar interventions in their respective communities.

Results indicated that COVID-19-exposed first responders were more likely to be emergency medical services [EMS] personnel (vs. non-EMS) in career (vs. volunteer) roles. COVID-19-exposed first responders reported higher alcohol use severity; no other between-group differences were noted. COVID-19-related worry and medical vulnerability were incrementally associated with more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression; only COVID-19-related worry was associated with alcohol use severity. Among the subset of first responders (<i>n</i> = 122) who reported COVID-19 exposure, COVID-19-related worry was significantly associated with PTSD symptom severity.

"Anxiety sensitivity, COVID-19 fear, and mental health: results from a United States population sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented consequences. Transdiagnostic factors, such as anxiety sensitivity, could be an important component to understand how individuals experience COVID-19 specific fear, depression and anxiety. A US representative sample (5,023) completed measures including the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8. Analyses controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, education level, working status, household income, and COVID-19 exposure. Results were consistent with prediction. First, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with above average COVID-19 fear (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.19). Second, the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 fear; one SD increase on the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was associated with almost a twofold risk of reaching above average levels of COVID-19 (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.93). Third, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with higher anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.22) and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.20). Finally, COVID-19 fear mediated the relationship between ASI-3 Total scores and anxiety (17% of effect mediated) as well as ASI-3 Total scores and depression (16% of effect mediated).

"Anonymized location data reveals trends in legal Cannabis use in communities with increased mental health risks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increases in felt negative affect for many. This is concerning as individuals at increased risk for mental health issues are often more likely to use substances to cope with stressors. The aim of the current study is to examine whether communities reporting an increased risk for developing mental health issues showed differential patterns of legal cannabis use as the pandemic began. A secondary goal is to examine the feasibility of using anonymized location data to uncover community consumption patterns of potential concern. Anonymized location data from approximately 10% of devices in the United States provided a count of the number of visitors to 3,335 cannabis retail locations (medical and recreational) each day from December 1<sup>st</sup> 2019 through April 2020. Visitor counts were merged with the average number of mentally unhealthy days (aMUDs) reported in the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county the retailer was located along with FIPS county population and poverty rate estimates. A Poisson spline regression predicting visitors by day, aMUDs, as well as their interaction was performed, entering population and poverty rate as covariates. As the pandemic began communities reporting a greater aMUDs showed greater visitation to cannabis retailers. These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have led to increased legal cannabis use in at risk communities. They also highlight the value anonymized location data can provide policymakers and practitioners in uncovering community level trends as they confront an increasingly uncertain landscape.","Ashby","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2021.1886831","20210217","COVID-19; Cannabis; mental health; substance abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10816,""
"Fulminant myocarditis in a COVID-19 positive patient treated with mechanical circulatory support - a caseÃ‚Â report","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province in China, is an expanding global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Even though respiratory failure is the cardinal form of severe COVID-19, concomitant cardiac involvement is common. Myocarditis is a challenging diagnosis due to heterogeneity of clinical presentation, ranging from mild symptoms to fatal arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock (CS). The aetiology is often viral and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard for definite myocarditis. However, the diagnosis is often made on medical history, clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood tests. We present a 43-year-old man with mixed connective tissue disease treated with hydroxychloroquine who rapidly developed CS 4 days from symptom onset with fever and cough, showing positive polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. While computed tomography of the thorax was normal, high-sensitivity troponin T was elevated and electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation and low voltage as signs of myocardial oedema. Echocardiography showed severe depression of left ventricular function. The myocardium recovered completely after a week with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). EMB was performed but could neither identify the virus in the cardiomyocytes, nor signs of inflammation. Still the most probable aetiology of CS in this case is myocarditis as a sole symptom of COVID-19. COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalization present commonly with respiratory manifestations. We present the first case of fulminant myocarditis rapidly progressing to CS in a COVID-19 patient without respiratory failure, successfully treated with inotropes and MCS.","Papageorgiou, Almroth, TÃƒÂ¶rnudd, van der Wal, Varelogianni, Lawesson","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa523","20210217"," Endomyocardial biopsy; COVID-19; Cardiogenic shock; Case report; Mechanical circulatory support; Myocarditis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10817,""

The players from 36 professional football teams (n=977) among Turkish Super League and First League teams were invited to complete a questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Impact of Event Scale-Revised Scores (IES-R) and short form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The online survey was completed by 237 players (24.3%). The mean number of self-quarantine day of participants was 26.9Ã‚Â±6.2 days. The median CES-D Scale and IES-R scores were 6.0 (min:0, max:42) and 23.0 (min:0, max:59), respectively. IPAQ scores of the players showed that four-fifths of the players still maintain high physical activity levels. There were negative, very weak and significant correlations between CES-D score and being married (r=-0.146, p=0.024), as well as between CES-D score and IPAQ-Walking (r=-0.189, p=0.004). A significant positive very weak correlation was observed between CES-D score and self-quarantine days (r=0.148, p=0.024). IPAQ-Walking was an independent predictor of CES-D.

"Social Determinants of Mental Health As Mediators and Moderators of the Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Contracting COVID-19, being exposed to it, or being affected by societal containment measures can have consequences that are themselves social determinants of health. Preexisting social determinants of health also drive the disproportionately high prevalence of COVID-19 infection and deaths among minority, marginalized, and other vulnerable populations. Thus, the social determinants of mental health act as both mediators and moderators of the pandemic's impacts, and like all social determinants, the effects of the pandemic are underpinned by public policies and social norms. The major economic impacts of containment measures have had cascading effects that will affect mental health for years to come.","Bernardini, Attademo, Rotter, Compton","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000393","20210217","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Social determinants; Social psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10821,""
"Social touch deprivation during COVID-19: effects on psychological wellbeing, tolerating isolation and craving interpersonal touch","Social touch has positive effects on social affiliation and stress alleviation. However, its ubiquitous presence in human life does not allow the study of social touch deprivation â€˜in the wildâ€™. Nevertheless, COVID-19-related restrictions such as social distancing allowed the systematic study of the degree to which social distancing affects tactile experiences and mental health. In this study, 1746 participants completed an online-survey to examine intimate, friendly and professional touch experiences during COVID-19-related restrictions, their impact on mental health and the extent to which touch deprivation results in craving touch. We found that intimate touch deprivation during COVID-19-related restrictions is associated with worse psychological wellbeing, even though this type of touch is still the most experienced during the pandemic. Moreover, intimate touch is reported as the type of touch most craved during this period, thus being more prominent as the days practicing social distancing increase. However, our results also show that the degree to which individuals crave touch during this period depends on individual differences in attachment style: the more anxiously-attached, the more touch is craved; with the reverse pattern for avoidantly-attached. These findings point to the important role of interpersonal and particularly intimate touch in times of distress and uncertainty.","Mariana Von Mohr et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-90C-C36","20210218","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Touch, Taste, and Smell; covid-19; social touch; wellbeing; anxiety; attachment","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-18","",10822,""
