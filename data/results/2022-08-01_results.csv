"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health in Low and Middle Income Countries","We track the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in eight Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America utilizing repeated surveys of 21,162 individuals. Many respondents were interviewed over multiple rounds pre- and post-pandemic, allowing us to control for time trends and within-year seasonal variation in mental health. We demonstrate how mental health fluctuates with agricultural crop cycles, deteriorating during pre-harvest ""lean"" periods. Ignoring this seasonal variation leads to unreliable inferences about the effects of the pandemic. Controlling for seasonality, we document a large, significant, negative impact of the pandemic on mental health, especially during the early months of lockdown.  In a random effects aggregation across samples, depression symptoms increased by around 0.3 standard deviations in the four months following the onset of the pandemic. The pandemic could leave a lasting legacy of depression. Absent policy interventions, this could have adverse long-term consequences, particularly in settings with limited mental health support services, which is characteristic of many LMICs.","Nursena Aksunger; Corey Vernot; Rebecca Littman; Maarten Voors; Niccolo Meriggi; Amanuel Abajobir; Bernd Beber; Katherine Dai; Dennis Egger; Asad Islam; Jocelyn Kelly; Arjun Kharel; Amani Matabaro; Andres Moya; Pheliciah Mwachofi; Carolyn Nekesa; Eric Ochieng; Tabassum Rahman; Alexandra Scacco; Yvonne Van Dalen; Michael Walker; Wendy Janssens; Ahmed  Mushfiq Mobarak","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.29.22278182","20220731","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35408,""
"Two years after lockdown: longitudinal trajectories of sleep disturbances and mental health over the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of age, gender, and chronotype","Since the first lockdown of Spring 2020, the COVID-19 contagion waves pervasively disrupted the sleep and mental health of the worldwide population. Notwithstanding the largest vaccination campaign in human history, the pandemic has continued to impact the everyday life of the general population for two years now. The present study provides the first evidence of the longitudinal trajectories of sleep disturbances and mental health throughout the pandemic in Italy, also describing the differential time course of age groups, genders, and chronotypes. A total of 1062 Italians participated in a three-time points longitudinal study covering two critical stages of the emergency [the first lockdown (April 2020) and the second lockdown (December 2020)] and providing a long-term overview two years after the pandemic outbreak (April 2022). We administered validated questionnaires to evaluate sleep quality/habits, insomnia, depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms. Analyses showed a gradual improvement in sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety. Conversely, sleep duration progressively decreased, particularly in evening-type and younger people. Participants reported substantial earlier bedtime and get-up time. Stress levels increased during December 2020 and then stabilised. This effect was stronger in the population groups apparently more resilient during the first lockdown (older people, men, and morning-types). Our results describe a promising scenario two years after the pandemic onset. However, the improvements were relatively small, the perceived stress increased, and the re-establishment of pre-existing social/working dynamics led to general sleep curtailment. Further long-term monitoring is required to claim the end of the COVID-19 emergency on Italians' sleep and mental health.","Federico Salfi; Giulia Amicucci; Domenico Corigliano; Lorenzo Viselli; Aurora D'Atri; Daniela Tempesta; Maurizio Gorgoni; Serena Scarpelli; Valentina Alfonsi; Michele Ferrara","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.29.22278180","20220731","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35409,""
"Higher Perceived Stress during the COVID-19 pandemic increased Menstrual Dysregulation and Menopause Symptoms","Purpose The increased stress the globe has experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health, disproportionately affecting women. However, how perceived stress in the first year affected menstrual and menopausal symptoms has not yet been investigated. Methods Residents in British Columbia, Canada, were surveyed online as part of the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE). A subgroup (n=4171) who were assigned female sex at birth (age 25-69) and were surveyed within the first 6-12 months of the pandemic (August 2020-February 2021), prior to the widespread rollout of vaccines, were retrospectively asked if they noticed changes in their menstrual or menopausal symptoms, as well as completing validated measures of stress, depression, and anxiety. Results We found that 27.8% reported menstrual cycle disturbances and 6.7% reported increased menopause symptoms. Those who scored higher on perceived stress, depression, and anxiety scales were more likely to have reproductive cycle disturbances. Free text responses revealed that reasons for disturbances were perceived to be related to the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to research womens health issues, such as menstruation. Our data indicates that in the first year of the pandemic, almost a third of the menstruating population reported disturbances in their cycle, which is approximately two times higher than in non-pandemic situations and four times higher than any reported changes in menopausal symptoms across that first year of the pandemic.","Romina Garcia de Leon; Alexandra Baaske; Arianne Albert; Amy Booth; C.

"Assessing medical students' perception and educational experience during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the traditional delivery of medical education. Medical education programmes have had to cope with limitations on face-to-face learning, and accelerate the adoption of digital learning. In addition, the pandemic has potential serious implications on the psychological well-being of medical students. We aim to assess the changes in perceptions and experiences of medical students as a consequence of this pandemic. Cross-sectional survey of medical students at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) between March and April 2022 was performed. The survey explored student satisfaction with the current education program, teaching delivery and the impact of COVID-19 on education and student well-being. 175 medical students participated in the survey. Overall, the majority of students were happy/neutral with their medical education. 93 (53.1%) felt tutorials and problem-based learning (PBL) to be the most effective method of teaching, followed by laboratory and clinical placements in 78 participants (44.6%) and hybrid-learning in 85 participants (48.6%). There was a mixed reaction to the changes in the delivery of education brought about by the pandemic. 67 participants (40.6%) felt happy with the changes, another 64 participants (38.8%) felt neutral, whilst only 34 participants (20.6%) were unhappy. However, most participants felt the pandemic negatively impacted their mental health, with 96 participants (55.8%) reporting negative responses. 58% of participants (n = 102/175) reported utilising the student support services at university campus and 49% (n = 50) were satisfied with their services. Digital content and delivery confer the benefit of greater flexibility in learning, the ability to learn at one's own pace and in a preferred environment, however lacks the advantage of bedside teaching and hands-on training. Our findings reinforce the potential advantages of online learning.","Low, O'Sullivan, Sharma, Sebastian, Meagher, Alomairi, Alhouti, Donohoe, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-022-03118-3","20220730","COVID-19 pandemic; Digital education; Formative assessment; Hybrid learning; Medical education; Mental health; Summative assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35411,""
"Psychiatric emergencies during, after, and before the COVID-19 lockdown: what happened to our patients? A naturalistic observational study","Despite concerns on mental health problems related to lockdowns, recent reports revealed a reduction in psychiatric admissions in Emergency Departments (ED) during the lockdown period compared with the previous year in several countries. Most of the existing studies focused on the first lockdown not considering the different phases of the COVID-19 crisis. The present study aimed to analyze differences in ED admission for psychiatric consultation during three different phases of the COVID-19 health crisis in Italy. Information on ED admission for psychiatric consultations were retrospectively collected at the ED of the Santo Spirito Hospital in Rome (Italy), and compared between the three periods: the lockdown (March-June 2020) and the post-lockdown period (June 2020-June 2021) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 2019-March 2020). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the risk of accessing ED for psychiatric consultation before, during, after the lockdown. Three thousand and eight hundred seventy-one ED psychiatric consultations were collected. A significant reduction of psychiatric consultations in ED during the lockdown period and the post-lockdown (H 762,45; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) was documented. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that compared to pre-lockdown during the lockdown and post-lockdown patients were more likely to be men (RRR 1.52; 95% CI 1.10-2.12) and more often diagnosed with non-severe mental illnesses (nSMI) (relative risk ratio [RRR] 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.15; and 1.72, 95% CI 1.42-2.08); during the lockdown, patients were also more often diagnosed with alcohol/substance abuse (A&amp;S) (RRR 1.70; 95% CI 1.10-2.65). several changes in the clinical characteristics of psychiatric consultations during and after the lockdown emerged from the present study; nSMI and A&amp;S abuse patients were more likely to present at the ED in the lockdown and post-lockdown periods while SMI patients appeared to be less likely. These may inform clinicians and future preventive strategies among community mental health services.","Brandizzi, Polselli, Corigliano, Tamorri, Venturini, Azzoni, Grasso, Onofri, Pesce, Romani, Polselli, Forte","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-022-00408-z","20220730","COVID 19; Emergency department; Lockdown; Psychiatric consultation; Psychiatric emergency; Severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35412,""
"The feasibility of delivering the ADVANCE digital intervention to reduce intimate partner abuse by men receiving substance use treatment: protocol for a non-randomised multi-centre feasibility study and embedded process evaluation","Compared to men in the general population, men in substance use treatment are more likely to perpetrate intimate partner abuse (IPA). The ADVANCE group intervention for men in substance use treatment is tailored to address substance use and IPA in an integrated way. In a feasibility trial pre-COVID, men who received the ADVANCE intervention via face-to-face group delivery showed reductions in IPA perpetration. Due to COVID-19, ADVANCE was adapted for remote digital delivery. This mixed-methods non-randomised feasibility study, with a nested process evaluation, will explore the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the ADVANCE digital intervention to men in substance use treatment who have perpetrated IPA towards a female partner in the past year. Sixty men will be recruited from seven substance use treatment services in Great Britain. The ADVANCE digital intervention comprises a preparatory one-to-one session with a facilitator to set goals, develop a personal safety plan, and increase motivation and a preparatory online group to prepare men for taking part in the intervention. The core intervention comprises six fortnightly online group sessions and 12 weekly self-directed website sessions to recap and practise skills learned in the online group sessions. Each website session is followed by a one-to-one video/phone coaching session with a facilitator. Men will also receive their usual substance use treatment. Men's female (ex) partners will be invited to provide outcome data and offered support from integrated safety services (ISS). Outcome measures for men and women will be sought post intervention (approximately 4 months post male baseline interview). Feasibility parameters to be estimated include eligibility, suitability, consent, recruitment, attendance, retention and follow-up rates. In-depth interviews or focus groups will explore the intervention's acceptability to participants, facilitators and ISS workers. A secondary focus of the study will estimate pre-post-differences in outcome measures covering substance use, IPA, mental health, self-management, health and social care service use, criminal justice contacts and quality of life. Findings will inform the design of a multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the ADVANCE digital intervention for reducing IPA.

"Navigating inequities in the delivery of youth mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives of youth, families, and service providers","There have been concerns about the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian youth (aged 16-24) as they have the highest rates of mental health concerns. The objectives of the present study were to explore the experiences of youth with mental health and/or addiction concerns and their families during the pandemic, and to examine how adequate and equitable mental health services have been for youth and families from the perspectives of youth, parents, and service providers. Using a descriptive qualitative research design and a university-community partnership, we conducted individual interviews with youth, parents, and service providers. The study involved a total of 25 participants (n=15 service users, n=10 service providers). Among the service users, 11 participants were parents and four were youth. We used thematic analysis to analyze interview data. The thematic analysis identified three themes in the data: (1) youth mental health concerns have increased, whereas supports have decreased, (2) families end up being the treatment team with increased burden, little support, and lack of recognition, and (3) inadequate and inequitable mental health services for youth and families are amplified during the pandemic. At a time when mental health needs were higher, the mental health care system offered less support to youth and their families. For a more equitable response to the pandemic, we need an accessible and integrated mental health care system that shows a commitment to addressing social determinants and reducing health disparities and inequities in access to mental health services. RÃƒÂ©SUMÃƒÂ©: OBJECTIFS: Les effets indÃƒÂ©sirables de la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID-19 sur les jeunes (16 Ãƒ 24 ans) du Canada suscitent des inquiÃƒÂ©tudes, car ce sont les jeunes qui prÃƒÂ©sentent les taux les plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s de problÃƒÂ¨mes de santÃƒÂ© mentale. Nous avons voulu explorer les expÃƒÂ©riences de jeunes aux prises avec des problÃƒÂ¨mes de santÃƒÂ© mentale et/ou de toxicomanie et de leurs familles durant la pandÃƒÂ©mie, et Ãƒ dÃƒÂ©terminer si les services de santÃƒÂ© mentale sont suffisants et ÃƒÂ©quitables pour les jeunes et leurs familles du point de vue de jeunes, de parents et de prestataires de services. MÃƒÂ©THODE: Ãƒâ‚¬ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un plan de recherche qualitative descriptive et dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un partenariat entre les milieux universitaire et associatif, nous avons menÃƒÂ© des entretiens individuels avec des jeunes, des parents et des prestataires de services. Vingt-cinq personnes ont participÃƒÂ© Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tude (n = 15 utilisateurs et utilisatrices de services, n = 10 prestataires de services). Parmi les utilisateurs et utilisatrices de services, 11 ÃƒÂ©taient des parents et 4 ÃƒÂ©taient des jeunes. Nous avons eu recours Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢analyse thÃƒÂ©matique pour analyser les donnÃƒÂ©es des entretiens. RÃƒÂ©SULTATS: Trois thÃƒÂ¨mes se sont dÃƒÂ©gagÃƒÂ©s de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢analyse thÃƒÂ©matique des donnÃƒÂ©es : 1) les problÃƒÂ¨mes de santÃƒÂ© mentale des jeunes augmentent, tandis que les mesures dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide diminuent, 2) ce sont les familles qui finissent par constituer lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©quipe de traitement, ce qui reprÃƒÂ©sente un fardeau accru, peu de soutien et un manque de reconnaissance, et 3) lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢insuffisance et lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢iniquitÃƒÂ© des services de santÃƒÂ© mentale offerts aux jeunes et Ãƒ leurs familles ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© amplifiÃƒÂ©es durant la pandÃƒÂ©mie. CONCLUSION: Alors que les besoins en santÃƒÂ© mentale ÃƒÂ©taient plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s, le systÃƒÂ¨me de soins de santÃƒÂ© mentale a offert moins de soutien aux jeunes et Ãƒ leurs familles.

"Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review/meta-analysis","Responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with MS (pwMS) varies by disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We perform a meta-analysis and systematic review of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pwMS. Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase from January 1, 2019-December 31, 2021, excluding prior SARS-CoV-2 infections. The meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were applied. The data were pooled using a fixed-effects model. Eight-hundred sixty-four healthy controls and 2203 pwMS from 31 studies were included. Antibodies were detected in 93% healthy controls (HCs), and 77% pwMS, with &gt;93% responses in all DMTs (interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, cladribine, natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, and teriflunomide) except for 72% sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators (S1PM) and 44% anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). T-cell responses were detected in most anti-CD20 and decreased in S1PM. Higher antibody response was observed in mRNA vaccines (99.7% HCs) versus non-mRNA vaccines (HCs: 72% inactivated virus; pwMS: 86% vector, 59% inactivated virus). A multivariate logistic regression model to predict vaccine response demonstrated that mRNA versus non-mRNA vaccines had a 3.4 odds ratio (OR) for developing immunity in anti-CD20 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0052) and 7.9 OR in pwMS on S1PM or CD20 mAbs (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Antibody testing timing did not affect antibody detection. Antibody responses are decreased in S1PM and anti-CD20; however, cellular responses were positive in most anti-CD20 with decreased T cell responses in S1PM. mRNA vaccines had increased seroconversion rates compared to non-RNA vaccines. Further investigation in how DMTs affect vaccine immunity are needed.","Gombolay, Dutt, Tyor","https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51628","20220719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35415,""
"Mental health symptoms in Australian general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic","General practitioners (GPs) play a central role during the COVID-19 pandemic, and yet awareness of their mental health is limited. A nationwide online survey of self-identified frontline healthcare workers was conducted between 27 August and 23 October 2020. Participants were recruited through health and professional organisations, colleges, universities, government contacts, and media. A subset of the findings on GPs and hospital medical staff (HMS) was used for this study. Of 9518 responses, there were 389 (4%) GPs and 1966 (21%) HMS. Compared with HMS, GPs received significantly less training on personal protective equipment usage or care for COVID-19 patients, and less support or communication within their workplace. GPs were significantly more concerned about household income, disease transmission to family and being blamed by colleagues if they became infected, all of which were associated with worse psychological outcomes. Significantly more GPs reported burnout, and experienced moderate-to-severe emotional exhaustion than HMS. Both groups used similar coping strategies, except fewer GPs than HMS used digital health applications or increased alcohol consumption. Less than 25% of either group sought professional help. GPs are vital in our healthcare systems, yet face unique workplace challenges and mental health stressors during the pandemic. Targeted workplace and psychological support is essential to protect wellbeing among the primary care workforce.","Ng, Robins-Browne, Putland, Pascoe, Paul, Willis, Smallwood","https://doi.org/10.1071/PY21308","20220719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35416,""
"Police-reported suicides during the first 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador: A time-series analysis of trends and risk factors until June 2021","Background There are widespread concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may increase suicides. Few studies have analysed effects beyond the pandemic's early months or examined changes in known suicide risk factors. Methods Using time series models fit with Poisson regression, we analysed monthly police-reported suicides in Ecuador from January 2015 to June 2021. Treating March 2020 as the start of the pandemic, we calculated rate ratios (RRs) comparing the observed to the expected number of suicides for the total population and by age and sex groups. We investigated changes in risk factors, precipitants, geographic distribution, and suicide methods. Findings There was no evidence that suicide rates were higher than expected during the pandemic (RR 0Â·97 [95% CI 0Â·92â€“1Â·02]). There was some evidence of fewer than expected male suicides (RR 0Â·95 [95% CI 0Â·90â€“1Â·00]). The proportion of suicides occurring in urban and coastal areas increased but decreased amongst indigenous and other minorities. The proportions of suicides with evidence of alcohol consumption, disability, and amongst married and cohabiting individuals decreased, whereas suicides where mental health problems were considered contributory increased. There were relative increases in the proportion of suicides by hanging but decreases in self-poisoning and other suicide methods. Interpretation The pandemic did not appear to adversely impact overall suicide numbers nationwide during the first 16 months of the pandemic. Reduced alcohol consumption may have contributed to the decline in male suicides. Funding None.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2022.100324","20221001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35417,""
"Increased antidepressant use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, 2015â€“2020","Background Few studies investigated the impact of the pandemic on antidepressant (AD) use. Methods The Social and Health Information System of Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, provided data on AD use. Sex, age, AD class and month used the amount of AD prescriptions, measured by defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, to compare AD use in 2020 with the period 2015â€“2019. A linear trend model predicted AD use for 2020, based on years 2015â€“2019. Results AD use was on average 20% higher in each month of 2020 when compared with the same month for the period 2015â€“2019, with an increase of more than 30% in the first four and in the last two months of 2020. The observed AD use in 2020 was higher than predicted, particularly in men, and in the 30â€“59 years age group. Limitations Descriptive study of AD use without analysis of data at the individual level. No information on psychiatric diagnoses of AD users. Conclusion AD use was higher in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Vascularized free fibula flap oral rehabilitation using tissue engineered mucosa: Report of 3 cases","The aim of this report is to introduce the use of the dermal substitute IntegraÂ® in the context of free fibula flap prelamination for mandibular reconstruction. Three cases of mandibular reconstruction with prefabricated and Integra-prelaminated vascularized fibula flaps are reported in this article. The patients reported in this case series presented with the following tumours: an extensive cemento-ossyfying fibroma, a multicystic ameloblastoma and an extensive calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour. Virtual three-dimensional (3D) planning and 3D-printed cutting guides were used for the mandibulectomies, the flap harvest and the positioning of the implants. The dermal substitute Integra was used for prelamination instead of skin grafts. Treatment of all 3 patients was performed in two stages; the first consisted of the fibula prefabrication (dental implant insertion) and prelamination, and the second consisted of tumor resection and reconstruction with the vascularized implant-bearing fibula flap. Integra was shown to be able to generate complete mucosa-like tissue over the fibula flaps and in the peri-implant areas. The patients have been followed up for 1, 3 and 7 years, respectively, with satisfactory prosthetic, functional and aesthetic results. None of the patients developed peri-implant disease. It was observed that prelamination with the dermal substitute Integra leads to development of mucosal lining with clinical features similar to oral mucosa. In this report of three cases, use of Integra as part of the prelamination and prefabrication process, instead of skin grafts, appears able to clinically generate mucosal lining with avoidance of skin grafts.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2022.05.004","20220601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35419,""

The relationship between OAS3 and EVs is still unclear. Here, we reveal that OAS3, superior to OAS1 and OAS2, significantly inhibited EV71 replication in vitro. However, EV71 utilized autologous 3C protease (3Cpro) to cleave intracellular OAS3 and enhance viral replication. Rupintrivir, a human rhinovirus 3C protease inhibitor, completely abolished the cleavage of EV71 3Cpro on OAS3. And the proteolytically deficient mutants H40G, E71A, and C147G of EV71 3Cpro also lost the ability of OAS3 cleavage. Mechanistically, the Q982-G983 motif in C-terminal of OAS3 was identified as a crucial 3Cpro cutting site. Further investigation indicated that OAS3 inhibited not only EV71 but also Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), Enterovirus D68 (EVD68), and Coxsackievirus A6 (CA6) subtypes. Notably, unlike other four subtypes, CA16 3Cpro could not cleave OAS3. Two key amino acids variation Ile36 and Val86 in CA16 3Cpro might result in weak and delayed virus replication of CA16 because of failure of OAS and 3AB cleavage. Our works elucidate the broad anti-EVs function of OAS3, and illuminate a novel mechanism by which EV71 use 3Cpro to escape the antiviral effect of OAS3. These findings can be an important entry point for developing novel therapeutic strategies for multiple EVs infection.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virs.2022.04.013","20220601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35420,""

"Experiences of healthcare workers across the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa","Background: Little is known about the experiences and impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCWs) particularly in Global South contexts where there are significant resource shortages and disparities between public and private healthcare systems. Objective: As part of a larger study exploring mental health amongst HCWs in this context, we examined the qualitative experiences of HCWs at different points during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Methods: We used a survey design that included open-ended questions about participantsâ€™ general work and life experiences and their support mechanisms. Our sample included 621 HCWs from various professions and health sectors who completed the survey during the pandemic peaks of waves I, II and III in South Africa. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: We identified three overarching themes in the data, namely stress, adjustment to work during COVID-19, and support experiences and needs. These major themes were generally common across all three survey waves, with some minor differences noted across the waves. An overarching thread of uncertainty seems central to HCWsâ€™ experiences of working during COVID-19, related to pressures in the South African healthcare system that have been aggravated by the pandemic. Conclusions: These findings have the potential to inform the development of contextually relevant approaches to support the mental health needs of HCWs during and after the pandemic. In particular, workplaces need to actively offer psychological support to all HCWs, not just to workers traditionally defined as frontline.","Jennifer Watermeyer et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E017D-D63-9F6","20220801","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; covid-19; qualitative; experience; healthcare worker; mental health; south africa","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","",35425,""
