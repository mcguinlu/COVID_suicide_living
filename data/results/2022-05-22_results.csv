"Exploring barriers and facilitators to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","Objectives Quantitative data show that physical activity (PA) reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with differential impacts across demographic groups. Qualitative research is limited, so reasons for this have not been explored in-depth. This study aimed to understand barriers and facilitators to PA during the pandemic, focusing on groups more likely to have been affected by restrictions, and to map these onto the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Model of Behaviour (COM-B). Design Semi-structured qualitative interview study. Methods One-to-one telephone/videocall interviews were conducted with younger (aged 18-24) and older adults (aged 70+), those with long-term physical health conditions or mental health conditions, and parents of young children, probing about their experiences of PA. Barriers and facilitators were identified using reflexive thematic analysis, and themes were mapped onto COM-B dimensions. Results 116 participants were included (18-93 years old, 61% female, 71% White British). Key themes were the importance of the outdoor environment, impact of COVID-19 restrictions, fear of contracting COVID-19, and level of engagement with home exercise. Caring responsibilities and conflicting priorities were a barrier. PA as a method of socialising, establishing new routines, and the importance of PA for protecting mental health were motivators. Most themes mapped onto the physical opportunity (environmental factors) and reflective motivation (evaluations and plans) COM-B domains. Conclusions Future interventions should increase physical opportunity and reflective motivation for PA during pandemics, to avoid further negative health outcomes following periods of lockdown. Strategies could include tailoring PA guidance depending on location and giving education on the health benefits of PA.","Charlotte Roche; Abigail Fisher; Daisy Fancourt; Alexandra Burton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.18.22275240","20220521","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31731,""
"Knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 infection among chronic disease patients visiting tertiary hospitals of Nepal: a cross-sectional study (preprint)","Aim:  To access the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 disease among chronic diseases patients visiting tertiary hospitals of Kathmandu. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic disease patients who visited Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital and Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Center, Kathmandu. Semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect patientsâ€™ socio-demographic data and perspectives on COVID-19. Results: : Four hundred chronic disease patients participated in the study, with 53.2% female and 46.8% male, and 56.8% of age =50 years. Overall, 55.5% of the participants had good knowledge, 56.2% had good practice, and 30.7% had positive attitude towards COVID-19. Younger patients, 18-34 years, were found to have higher odds of having good knowledge compared to other age groups (aOR: 2.5;95% CI: 1.3-6.0). The patients with less than average family income and those unable to read and write had lower odds of having positive attitude towards COVID-19 (aOR: 0.6;95% CI: 0.4-0.9 and aOR: 0.4;95%CI: 0.2-0.9, respectively). A statistically significant correlation was found between the patientsâ€™ knowledge and practice, knowledge and attitude, and attitude and practice (p &lt;0.001). Conclusion:  Nearly half of the chronic disease patients in Nepal had poor knowledge and practice whereas more than two-third had negative attitude towards COVID-19 disease. Older age of the patient was significantly associated with poor knowledge and poor practice. These study findings could be helpful for the government and non-government stakeholders while planning COVID-19 awareness campaigns to the targeted patient groups.","Ranabhat, Kamal, Bhattarai, Anil, Saud, Bhuvan, Bhattarai, Suraj, Paudel, Kiran, Acharya, Devaka Kumari, Tripathi, Sangita, Shah, Sangam, Bhatta, Nikita, Das, Santa Kumar, Devkota, Surya, Marahatta, Sujan Babu","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1615003/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31732,""
"Social and mental health needs of Palestine refugees and UNRWA responses in Gaza during the Covid-19 pandemic: a qualitative assessment (preprint)","Background:  Refugees are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of the pandemic due to pre-existing challenges, but the impact of the pandemic on this group remains to be understood. In this study, we aimed to uncover the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of Palestine refugees in Gaza, disentangling the role of social determinants. We further aimed to explore views on the effectiveness and acceptability of policies and strategies the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) implemented during the pandemic. Methods This qualitative study took place between August and November 2020. Twenty-nine key-informant interviews were conducted with UNRWA Headquarters, Gaza Field Office, Health and Relief and Social Service staff and with community leaders and members residing in Rafah and Jabalia camps. We collected information on UNRWAâ€™s strategies, peopleâ€™s perception of those strategies, and personal and professional stressors during the pandemic. Data was coded based on the framework for social determinant of mental health. Results Interview data suggest that the pandemic and social determinants mutually aggravated one another resulting in a major impact on the physical and mental health of Gazans. Women, children and daily-paid workers were acutely more disadvantaged than other groups of the community, experiencing violence and anxieties. Financial strain, violence, food insecurity, and disruption in the education process were reported by all participants. UNRWA reconfigured its methods of service delivery to continue the provision of essential services. The strategies enacted by UNRWA during the pandemic were generally perceived as helpful, yet not enough to respond to Gazansâ€™ needs. Conclusion The pandemic serves as a stark reminder of the need to broaden the public health response beyond disease management and prevention to address social determinants in order to improve refugeesâ€™ health and decrease their vulnerability to future shocks. UNRWA deployed telemedicine and mental telehealth services at short notice and the need to evaluate these new modes of remote service delivery is essential. The use of a hybrid approach, a combination of online and face-to-face therapy, could be useful as a long-term solution.","Jamal, Zeina, ElKhatib, Zoheir, AlBaik, Shatha, Horino, Masako, Waleed, Mohammed, Fawaz, Farah, Loffreda, Giulia, Akihiro, Seita, Witter, Sophie, Diaconu, Karin","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1612205/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31733,""
"Long-COVID post-viral chronic fatigue and affective symptoms are associated with oxidative damage, lowered antioxidant defenses and inflammation: a proof of concept and mechanism study (preprint)","The immune-inflammatory response during the acute phase of COVID-19, as assessed using peak body temperature (PBT) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), predicts the severity of chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety (â€œphysio-affectiveâ€) symptoms three to four months later. The present study was performed to characterize whether the effects of SpO2 and PBT on the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID are mediated by immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Both PBT and SpO2 strongly predict OSTOX/ATIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the physio-affective symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation. Post-viral physio-affective symptoms have an inflammatory origin and are partly mediated by neuro-oxidative toxicity.","Al-Hakeim, Hussein Kadhem, Al-Rubaye, Haneen Tahseen, Al-Hadrawi, Dhurgham Shihab, Almulla, Abbas, Maes, Michael","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1610917/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31734,""
"Comparison Between Indoor Air Quality Of Private And Governmental Health Care Institution (preprint)","Background:  Indoor air quality is ""of interest"" to scientists and specialists in the fields of science because of its importance in maintaining the health of individuals, as the air can transmit various microbes, including pathogenic ones.Poor indoor air quality may significantly affect the increase in the incidence of various types of diseases, especially for those with immunodeficiency diseases. So, the hospital environment requires special attention to ensure healthy indoor air quality (IAQ) to protect the patient, patient's family, and health care workers from an infection acquired by hospitals and occupational diseases. Objectives:  This study aimed to identify the different types of airborne bacteria and fungi among private and governmental health care institutions, An-Najah National University Hospital (NNUH) and Rafidia Governmental Surgical Hospital.Another aim was to evaluate the relationship between the spread of different types of them and the characteristics of the surrounding atmosphere such as temperature and humidity.As well as, it aimed to compare the results before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic;to find the effect of adhering to the public health and safety guidelines imposed by the Ministry of Health (MOH). Materials:  and Methods Samples were collected by passive method from two different hospitals at five departments where most activities and tasks are performed inside, Besides two different sites outside the hospital, in an average of three hours. The positive colonies were identified by using several biochemical tests. Then, the Total Microbial Load (CFU/plate) was calculated for each plate.Furthermore, the temperature and humidity of each room from which samples were taken were also measured to find the relationship between them and the percentage of microbial airborne. Results:  The predominant Gram-positive bacteria in Rafidia Governmental Surgical Hospital was S. aureus that presents in daycare and emergency departments, and Aer. hydrophila gr.1 among Gram-negative bacteria found in the surgical department. While in NNUH, the predominant Gram-positive bacteria were S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus that present in departments of surgery and laboratories, respectively. and Pseudomonas luteola among Gram-negative bacteria found in daycare department.Also, the level of airborne microbial pollutants in Rafidia Governmental Surgical Hospital appeared in greater proportions than in NNUH, as it reached in Rafidia Governmental Surgical Hospital (12430.1188 CFU/m 3 ), while in NNUH (11779.3501 CFU/m 3 )Besides, it was also found that the levels of microbial airborne in confined and crowded areas are much higher than in sparsely populated areas. Besides, the percentage was also high in rooms with high temperature and humidity. Conclusions:  The levels of airborne microbes were affected by the surrounding area according to the degree of crowding, temperature, and humidity. Because of these factors, we concluded that Rafidia Governmental Surgical Hospital is more polluted with microbial airborne, another reason could be due to the smallness of its facilities compared to NNUH. In this study, we will note the evidence and results that confirm our conclusion.Besides, compared with previous studies, we concluded that infection levels during the Corona pandemic period are lower than the pre-pandemic period, which means that thereâ€™s a commitment by the hospitalâ€™s staff and patients to the public health and safety guidelines imposed by MOH including the necessary sterilizations, wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing.**The comparison occurred in one common section between the two studies, which is the Department of Surgery","Menawi, Wafaa, darwazeh, alaa, ateeq, tasbeeh, sobuh, rahaf, haneesh, taimaa abu","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1601870/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31735,""
"Resilience in older adults despite COVID-19 A multidimensional approach (preprint)","Researchers have mainly focused on aging risk factors and COVID-19 consequences. However, older adults have proved their ability to overcome adversities along their life. Resilience is a protective variable that dampens the impact of stress. Based on MacLeodÂ´s et al.

Older participants, women, having better perceived health and not losing a loved one because of the virus were associated with more resilience. Moreover, higher levels of gratitude, personal growth, life purpose and lower levels of depression were associated with greater scores in resilience.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Foot Care Services in Ontario, Canada (preprint)","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has directly affected the delivery of health care services in Canada, including foot care. The goal of this descriptive study was to understand the impact of the early COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to April 2021) on chiropodistsâ€™ and podiatristsâ€™ clinical practices and foot care service delivery in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A web-survey was completed by participating chiropodists and podiatrists registered with the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. The survey consisted of 31 multiple choice and open-ended items on clinical practice characteristics, foot care service delivery changes, perceived barriers during the pandemic, and its impact on clinicians. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and examine cliniciansâ€™ responses, and qualitative content analysis was used to explore opened-ended items.RESULTS: Of the 773 eligible clinicians, 279 participated for a response rate of 36.1%. Most respondents reported a decline in patient volume, an increase in urgent foot health problems, a financial impact on their clinical practices, an emotional impact, and substantial changes to how they provided foot care services. Factors that impact cliniciansâ€™ perception of future pandemic preparedness are identified.CONCLUSION: This study describes foot care service delivery in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase in urgent foot health problems, decline in patient volume, and impacted cliniciansâ€™ mental health and emotional well-being. Future studies should examine patientsâ€™ experiences of foot care service delivery and maintaining their foot health during the pandemic, and further examination of factors that impact clinicians' perception of pandemic preparedness.","Lu, Suzanne, McLaren, Ann-Marie, Pinsker, Ellie","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1594378/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31737,""
"Trends in Psychiatric Admissions of Children and Adolescents During Early Corona Period Year (2020) Compared to Pre-Corona Year (2018): A Cross Sectional Study in Israel (preprint)","Background:  the current study sought to assess the patterns and characteristics of psychiatric admissions among children and adolescents during the early corona period (2020) compared to a year before the corona pandemic started (2018), and analyzing on a deeper level the psychiatric admissions that were related directly to corona stressors and their correlations with sociodemographic variables. Method:  a cross-sectional study was conducted in The Child and Family Guidance Unit in The Galilee Medical Center, a psychiatric department for patients aged 6-18 years. The medical records of psychiatric admissions in the year 2020 and 2018 were analyzed on the same dates. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.20. Since all the variables were not normally distributed according to Shapiro-Wilk, non-parametric tests were conducted, including Mann-Whitney U and Chi-Square tests. Results:  the study showed 17% increase in psychiatric admissions in 2020 compared with 2018. In 2018 most admissions were at November while in 2020 most of them were at May. The most common cause of admissions in 2018 was outbursts and violence 43% while in 2020 it was suicidal thoughts and behaviors 36%. Almost a third of patients admitted in 2020 reported a corona stressor in their admission, the majority was changes in daily routines. Conclusion:  Changing daily routine and inconsistency in school attendance may have been the main stress factor on children and adolescents and might have caused a rise in hospital admissions caused by suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Thus, future studies should monitor the mental health of children and adolescents during the continual corona pandemic.","Saad, Ali, Hamady, Hadeel, Kronos, Tanya, Sandler, Ludmila, Itah, Dorit","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1585242/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31738,""
"Sociodemographic profile associated with perinatal depression during the COVID-19 era (preprint)","Objective:  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused an increase in perinatal depression. The aim of this research was to identify which sociodemographic variables are related to the increase in perinatal depression due to the pandemic. In addition to estimating to what extent they predict perinatal depression, differentiating the prenatal and postnatal period. Methods: The sample consisted of 3,356 subjects, 1,402 in the prenatal period and 1,954 in the postnatal period. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptomatology. A subset of 14 questions was included to collect demographic data. Items from the Spanish version of the Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences Survey were also included. Results: Experiencing the change of environment due to COVID-19 as negative and having a history of mental health predict perinatal depression, otherwise having higher education decreases the risk. In the prenatal stage having symptoms compatible with COVID-19 is a predictor of perinatal depression and having more than 3 years living together with the partner and being a housewife decreases the risk. In the postnatal stage being unemployed is a predictor of prenatal depression and being a first-time mother decreases the risk. Conclusions: This study highlights the relevance of sociodemographic status. It is essential to be aware of the risk factors of perinatal depression, to make adequate prevention and to create health policies to alleviate the consequences of the pandemic.","Kovacheva, Katina, RodrÃ­guez-MuÃ±oz, Maria de la Fe, GÃ³mez-Baya, Diego, DomÃ­nguez-Salas, Sara, Motrico, Emma","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1567938/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31739,""
"Psychosocial work stress and parent-child bonding during the COVID-19 pandemic: clarifying the role of parental symptoms of depression and aggressiveness (preprint)","Background:  Parental work stress and impaired mental health seem to have intensified during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Both can have a negative impact on parent-child bonding: psychosocial work stress in the course of a spillover effect from work to family and symptoms of impaired mental health as part of a crossover effect from parent to child. This potentially affects the child's development in the long term. Method:  This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between psychosocial work stress and parent-child bonding during the early COVID-19 pandemic (Mayâ€“July 2020). Symptoms of depression and aggressiveness were considered as mediators of this relationship. The sample consisted of employees in Eastern Germany ( n = 380;42.9% mothers, 57.1% fathers), aged 24â€“55 years, with children aged 0â€“36 months. Results: : After including potential confounders, higher psychosocial work stress predicted weaker parent-child-bonding (ÃŸ = 0.148, p = .017, 95% CI [0.566, 5.614]). The older the child was (ÃŸ = 0.123, p = .035, 95% CI [0.008, 0.209]) and the more a parent worked in home office (ÃŸ = 0.127, p = .010, 95% CI [0.494, 3.562]), the weaker the parent-child bonding. When stratifying for parentsâ€™ sex, results showed that the more hours mothers worked (ÃŸ = -0.252, p = .006, 95% CI [-0.340, -0.059]) and if they did not work in home office (ÃŸ = 0.181, p = .018, 95% CI [0.536, 5.672]), the stronger the mother-child bonding, which was not true for fathers. Symptoms of depression predicted father-child bonding (ÃŸ = 0.420, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [0.470, 0.944]), but mother-child bonding was associated with the confounders higher number of hours worked (ÃŸ = -0.215, p = .021, 95% CI [-0.315, -0.026]) and not working in home office (ÃŸ = 0.154, p = .038, 95% CI [0.146, 5.167]) and not symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression (ab = 2.491, 95% CI [1.472, 3.577]) as well as of aggressiveness (ab = 2.091, 95% CI [1.147, 3.279]) mediated the relationship between psychosocial work stress and parent-child bonding. Discussion:  The results of this study highlight the importance of prevention as well as intervention measures in relation to psychosocial work stress that may play a debilitating role in the context of family relationships. In addition, the results suggest that both employers and employees should be made aware of the importance of psychosocial work stress, as it can have a negative impact on mental health, which in turn may have a major influence on family relationships. Since working in home office and the amount of hours at work seem to have a differential impact on mothers and fathers as well as on their family relationships, these aspects should be investigated in further research.","Koerber, Mirjam, Mack, Judith, Seefeld, Lara, Kopp, Marie, Weise, Victoria, Starke, Karla Romero, Garthus-Niegel, Susan","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1555317/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31740,""
"Immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers, general population and affected individuals of SARS and COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis (preprint)","Background:  Any infectious diseases outbreak may lead to negative detrimental psychological impact to individuals and community at large, however;there was no systematic review nor meta-analysis that examined the relationship between early stages of infectious disease outbreaks and mental health in Asia. Methods: /design: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from 1/1/2000 to 1/6/2020. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyzed the psychological impact on confirmed/suspected cases, healthcare workers and the general public during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemics. Primary outcomes included prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, aggression, sleeping problems and psychological symptoms. Result:  Twenty-three eligible studies (N=27,325) were included. Random effect model was used to analyze the data using STATA. Of these studies, 11 were related to the SARS outbreak and 12 related to COVID-19 outbreaks. The overall prevalence rate of anxiety during SARS and COVID-19 was 37.8% (95% CI: 21.1- 54.5, P&lt;0.001, I2 = 96.9%) and 34.8% (95% CI: 29.1- 40.4), respectively. For depression, the overall prevalence rate during SARS and COVID-19 was 30.9% (95% CI: 18.6-43.1, P&lt;0.001, I2 = 97.3%) and 32.4% (95% CI: 19.8-45.0, P&lt;0.001, I2 = 99.8%), respectively. The overall prevalence rate of stress was 9.4% (95% CI: -0.4 -19.2, P = 0.015, I2 = 83.3%) and 54.1% (95% CI: 35.7- 72.6, P&lt;0.001, I2 = 98.8%) during SARS and COVID-19, respectively. The overall prevalence of PTSD was 15.1% (95% CI: 8.2-22.0, P &lt; 0.001) during SARS epidemic, calculated by random-effects model (P &lt; 0.05), with significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 93.5%). Conclusion:  The SARS and COVID-19 epidemics have brought about high levels of psychological distress to individuals. Psychological interventions and contingent digital mental health platform should be promptly established nationwide for continuous surveillance of the increasing prevalence of negative psychological symptoms. Health policymakers and mental health experts should jointly collaborate to provide timely, contingent mental health treatment and psychological support to those in need to reduce the global disease burden.","Cheung, Teris, Cheng, Calvin Pak Wing, Fong, Tommy Kwan Hin, Sharew, Nigussie Tadesse, Anders, Robert, Xiang, Yu-Tao, Lam, Simon Ching, Working-Group, S.

"Factors That Influence Mental Health Of University And College Students In The UK: A Rapid Review (preprint)","Background:  Worsening mental health of students in higher education is a public policy concern and the impact of measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has heightened awareness of this issue. Preventing poor mental health and supporting positive mental wellbeing needs to be based on an evidence informed understanding what factors influence the mental health of students. Objectives:  To identify factors associated with mental health of students in higher education. Methods: : We undertook a rapid review of observational studies that measured factors associated with student mental wellbeing and poor mental health. Extensive searches were undertaken across five databases. We included studies undertaken in the UK and published within the last decade (2010-2020). Due to heterogeneity of factors, and diversity of outcomes used to measure wellbeing and poor mental health the findings were analysed and described narratively. Findings:  We included 30 studies, most of which were cross sectional in design. Those factors most strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing poor mental health included students with experiences of trauma in childhood, those that identify as LGBTQ and students with autism. Factors that promote wellbeing include developing strong and supportive social networks. Students who are prepared and able to adjust to the changes that moving into higher education presents also experience better mental health. Some behaviours that are associated with poor mental health include lack of engagement both with learning and leisure activities and poor mental health literacy. Conclusion:  Improved knowledge of factors associated with poor mental health and also those that increase mental wellbeing can provide a foundation for designing strategies and specific interventions that can prevent poor mental health and ensuring targeted support is available for students at increased risk.","Campbell, Fiona, Blank, Lindsay, Cantrell, Anna, Baxter, Susan, Blackmore, Christopher, Dixon, Jan, Goyder, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1325503/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31742,""
"Emotional Reaction to the First Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine: Post Vaccination Decline in Anxiety and Stress Among Anxious Individuals and Increase Among Individuals with Normal Anxiety Levels Pre Vaccination (preprint)","Although vaccinating the world is adopted by the WHO to limit COVID-19 transmission, people&rsquo;s worries about vaccines may suppress their desire for vaccination despite vaccine availability. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of stress and anxiety among 250 Jordanians who received their first vaccine dose at a local community health center. The respondents completed the stress and anxiety subscales of the Depression Anxiety and Stress scale 21 (DASS-21) pre- and post-vaccination. The respondents expressed more moderate-severe levels of stress pre than post vaccination (20.8% and 13.2%, respectively). Meanwhile, 37.2% and 45.2% of the respondents expressed moderate-severe anxiety pre and post vaccination, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the drop in the level of stress from pre (median (IQR) = 5 (1-8)) to post vaccination (median (IQR) = 3 (1-7)) was statistically significant (z = -3.81, p = 0.001, r = 0.17) while the increase in anxiety was not. Anxiety median significantly dropped among individuals experiencing mild to severe anxiety pre vaccination. Similarly, stress and anxiety significantly increased among individuals expressing normal anxiety pre vaccination (z = -3.57 and -8.24, p values = 0.001, r = 0.16 and 0.37, respectively). Age positively correlated with post vaccination anxiety among respondents with mild pre vaccination anxiety, and it negatively correlated with pre vaccination level of stress in the normal anxiety group. Gender, marital status, respondents&rsquo;level of education, and history of COVID-19 infection had no significant correlation with anxiety or stress at either point of measurement. Overcoming their hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccine, individuals with normal levels of anxiety experienced a rise in their distress symptoms following immunization. On the contrary, vaccination seemed to desensitize anxious individuals. Policymakers need to formulate a population-specific plan to increase vaccine preparedness and promote psychological well-being over all during the pandemic.","Al-Amer, Rasmieh, Malak, Malakeh Zuhdi, Burqan, Hala Mohammad Ramadan, Stanculescu, Elena, Nalubega, Sylivia, Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed, Hendawy, Amin Omar, Ali, Amira Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202205.0082.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31743,""
"Describing the Function, Disability, and Health of Adults With Disabilities and Older Adults During the Early Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Restrictions (preprint)","Coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions impacted Canadians' daily living, especially those at higher risk of compromised health conditions. This study aimed to describe the physical, psychological, and social well-being of adults with disabilities, and older adults from May to June 2020. An online survey was used to administer standardized measures of mobility, anxiety and depression, boredom, resilience, technology readiness, social support, social networks, and participation. Seventy-two participants were recruited, with a mean age (SD) of 61.2 (13.8). 69.4% of participants had a disability, and 51.4% were older adults. 27.8% and 16.7% of participants exceeded the anxiety and depression cut-off scores, respectively. Boredom and restriction in participation were experienced by 76.4% and 80.1% of participants, respectively. Participants' mean (SD) resilience and life space scores were 72.4 (14.0) and 51.9 (24.0), respectively. Individuals with disabilities have comparatively higher mean anxiety (5.5 to 3.3), depression (4.8 to 2.9), and boredom (92.2 to 72.3) scores than those without. Individuals with a disability had lower resilience (69.9 to 78.0) and felt more life space restrictions (45.4 to 67.6).

"Healthcare workersâ€™ mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Longitudinal analysis of interview and social media data (preprint)","ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the fractures of healthcare systems around the world, particularly in relation to the healthcare workforce. Frontline staff, in particular, have been exposed to unprecedented strain and delivering care during the pandemic has impacted their safety, mental health and wellbeing. The aim of this paper was to explore the experiences of HCWs delivering care in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand their wellbeing needs, experiences and strategies used to maintain wellbeing (at individual and organizational levels). We analysed 94 telephone interviews with HCWs and 2000 tweets about HCWs mental health taking place during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results were grouped under six themes: redeployment;wellbeing support and coping strategies;mental health effects;organisational support;social network and public support. These findings demonstrate a need for open conversations, where staffâ€™s wellbeing needs and strategies can be shared and encouraged, rather than implementing solely top-down psychological interventions. At the macro level, findings also highlighted the impact on HCWâ€™s wellbeing of public and government support, as well as the need for ensuring protection through PPE, testing, and/or vaccines for frontline workers.","Vera San Juan, Norha, Martin, Sam, Badley, Anna, Maio, Laura, Gronholm, Petra, Buck, Caroline, Flores, Elaine, Vanderslott, Samantha, Syversen, Aron, Mulcahy Symmons, Sophie, Uddin, Inayah, Karia, Amelia, Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274481","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31745,""
"Implementation strategies for telemental health: a systematic review (preprint)","Background The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from traditional face-to-face care provision towards delivering mental health care remotely through telecommunications, often referred to as telemental health care. However, the manner and extent of telemental health implementation have varied considerably across settings and areas, and substantial barriers are encountered. There is, therefore, now a need to identify what works best for service users and staff and establish the key mechanisms for efficient integration into routine care. Objective We aimed to identify investigations of pre-planned strategies intended to achieve or improve effective and sustained implementation of telemental health approaches, and to evaluate how different strategies influence implementation outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted, with five databases searched for relevant literature using any methodological approach, published between January 2010 and July 2021. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they took place in secondary or tertiary mental health services and focused on pre-planned strategies for achieving or improving delivery of mental health care through remote communication between mental health professionals or between mental health professionals and service users, family members, unpaid carers, or peer supporters. All included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Data were synthesised using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) compilation of implementation strategies and the taxonomy of implementation outcomes. Results A total of 14 studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. A variety of implementation strategies were identified, the most commonly reported being â€˜Train and educate stakeholdersâ€™. All studies reported using a combination of several implementation strategies. Conclusions Using a combination of implementation strategies appears to be a helpful method of supporting the implementation of telemental health. Further research is needed to test the impact of specific implementation strategies on implementation outcomes.","Appleton, Rebecca, Barnett, Phoebe, San Juan, Norha Vera, Tuudah, Elizabeth, Lyons, Natasha, Parker, Jennie, Roxburgh, Emily, Spyridonidis, Spyros, Tamworth, Camilla, Worden, Minnie, Yilmaz, Melisa, Sevdalis, Nick, Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor, Needle, Justin, Johnson, Sonia","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274367","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31746,""
"Mobile Primary Healthcare for post-COVID Patients in Rural Areas: a Proof-of-Concept Study (preprint)","Introduction Post-COVID syndrome is increasingly recognized as a new clinical entity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients living in rural areas may have to travel long with subjectively great effort to be examined using all necessary interdisciplinary tools. This problem could be addressed with mobile outpatient clinics. Methods In this prospective observational study, we investigated physical fitness, fatigue, depression, cognitive dysfunction and dyspnea in patients with post-COVID syndrome in a mobile interdisciplinary post-COVID outpatient clinic. Upon referral from their primary care physician, patients were offered an appointment at a mobile post-COVID outpatient clinic close to their home. Results We studied 125 patients (female, n=79;63.2%) in our mobile unit. All patients reported symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks after acute infection. 88.3% and 64.1% of patients reported significant impairment in physical and mental quality of life. Patients reported a median of three symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (86.4%), cognitive dysfunction (85.6%), and dyspnea (37.6%). 56.0% of patients performed at &lt;2.5 th percentile at the 1 min sit-to-stand test compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls and 25 patients (20.0%) exhibited a drop in oxygen saturation. A questionnaire given to each patient regarding the mobile unit revealed a very high level of patient satisfaction. Conclusion There is an increasing need for high-quality and locally available care for patients with post-COVID syndrome. A mobile post-COVID outpatient clinic is a new concept that may be particularly suitable for use in rural regions. Patientsâ€™ satisfaction following visits in such units is very high.","Stallmach, Andreas, Katzer, Katrin, Besteher, Bianca, Finke, Kathrin, Giszas, Benjamin, Gremme, Yvonne, Hamdan, Rami Abou, Lehmann-Pohl, Katja, Legen, Maximilian, Lewejohann, Jan Christoph, Machnik, Marlene, Alsabbagh, Majd Moshmosh, Nardini, Luisa, Puta, Christian, Stallmach, Zoe, Reuken, Philipp","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.26.22274329","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31747,""
"Design and implementation of a global site assessment survey among HIV clinics participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) research consortium (preprint)","Introduction Timely descriptions of HIV service characteristics and their evolution over time across diverse settings are important for monitoring the scale-up of evidence-based program strategies, understanding the implementation landscape, and examining service delivery factors that influence HIV care outcomes. Methods The International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium undertakes periodic cross-sectional surveys on service availability and care at participating HIV treatment sites to characterize trends and inform the scientific agenda for HIV care and implementation science communities. IeDEAâ€™s 2020 general site assessment survey was developed through a consultative, 18-month process that engaged diverse researchers in identifying content from previous surveys that should be retained for longitudinal analyses and in developing expanded and new content to address gaps in the literature. An iterative review process was undertaken to standardize the format of new survey questions and align them with best practices in survey design and measurement and lessons learned through prior IeDEA site assessment surveys. Results The survey questionnaire developed through this process included eight content domains covered in prior surveys (patient population, staffing and community linkages, HIV testing and diagnosis, new patient care, treatment monitoring and retention, routine HIV care and screening, pharmacy, record-keeping and patient tracing), along with expanded content related to antiretroviral therapy (differentiated service delivery and roll-out of dolutegravir-based regimens);mental health and substance use disorders;care for pregnant/postpartum women and HIV-exposed infants;tuberculosis preventive therapy;and pediatric/adolescent tuberculosis care;and new content related to Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma diagnostics, the impact of COVID-19 on service delivery, and structural barriers to HIV care.

"Labor market participation and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic among young adults (18 to 30 years): a nationally representative study in France (preprint)","Objective: To examine the relationship between young adultsâ€™ labor force participation and depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, Participants: Data come from the nationally-representative EPICOV cohort study set up in France, and were collected in 2020 and 2021 (3 waves of online or telephone interviews) among 2217 participants aged 18-30 years. Participants with prior mental health disorder (n=50) were excluded from the statistical analyses. Results: Using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models controlled for participantsâ€™ socio-demographic and health characteristics and weighted to be nationally-representative, we found that compared to young adults who were employed, those who were studying or unemployed were significantly more likely to experience depression assessed using the PHQ-9 (multivariate ORs respectively: OR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.60 and OR: 1.50, 1.13-1.99). Stratifying the analyses by age, we observed than unemployment was more strongly associated with depression among participants 25-30 years than among those who were 18-24 years (multivariate ORs respectively 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71 and 1.41, 95% CI 0.96-2.09). Being out of the labor force was, to the contrary, more significantly associated with depression among participants 18-24 years (multivariate OR: 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.82, vs. 1.00, 95% CI 0.53-1.87 among participants 25-30 years). Stratifying the analyses by sex, we found no significant differences in the relationships between labor market characteristics and depression (compared to participants who were employed, multivariate ORs associated with being a student: men: 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.76;women: 1.19, 95% CI 0.85-1.67, multivariate ORs associated with being unemployed: men: 1.60, 95% CI 1.04-2.45;women: 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.15). Conclusions and relevance: Our study shows that in addition to students, young adults who are unemployed also experience elevated levels of depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These two groups should be the focus of specific attention in terms of prevention and mental health treatment. Supporting employment could also be a propitious way of reducing the burden of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of young adults.","Melchior, M.; Florence, A.

"Mental Health, Loneliness and Life Satisfaction in the Dynamic Context of Pandemic Policies and Healthcare Burden: A Two-Year Cohort Study in the Netherlands (preprint)","Introduction: Research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health, however understanding of who has been affected most and why is incomplete. We aimed to understand how changes in mental health varied in the dynamic context of transmission numbers and pandemic (social) restrictions, and whether trends varied between population groups. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal data from 92,062 individuals who participated in the cohort of the Corona Behavioral Unit (National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Netherlands) between April 2020 and January 2022 using multivariable linear mixed models. The main outcomes were general mental health, life satisfaction and loneliness. Findings: As the number of COVID-19 related hospital admissions and the strictness of pandemic policies increased, peopleâ€™s feelings of loneliness increased while mental health and satisfaction deteriorated. Vice versa, as restrictions were relaxed, loneliness decreased and mental health improved. Younger people, those with lower educational levels and living alone were more likely to have negative outcomes. Only for age did trajectories over time differentiate considerably: younger participants were impacted substantially more by pandemic restrictions than older participants. These patterns were consistent across multiple pandemic waves. Discussion: The findings suggest that COVID-19 burden on health care and the pandemic restrictions â€“ rather than the physical threat of COVID-19 â€“ reduced mental health and satisfaction with life for younger people in particular. However, people appeared resilient as they recovered during periods when restrictions were relaxed. The present study highlights the importance of monitoring and supporting well-being during a pandemic, in particular to reduce loneliness during periods of intensive social restrictions amongst younger people. Funding Information: The Corona Behavioral Unit initiative has been made possible by funding from ZonMW, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).","Van Den Boom, Wijnand, Marra, Elske, Van Der Vliet, Nina, Elberse, Janneke, Van Dijken, Suzan K.; Van Dijk, Mart, Euser, Saskia, Derks, Mare, Leurs, Mariken, Albers, Casper, Sanderman, Robbert, de Bruin, Marijn, Marra, Elske, Van Der Vliet, Nina, Elberse, Janneke, Van Dijken, Suzan K.; Van Dijk, Mart, Euser, Saskia, Derks, Mare, Leurs, Mariken, Albers, Casper, Sanderman, Robbert, de Bruin, Marijn","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health,+Loneliness+and+Life+Satisfaction+in+the+Dynamic+Context+of+Pandemic+Policies+and+Healthcare+Burden:+A+Two-Year+Cohort+Study+in+the+Netherlands+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31750,""

"Benefits of the Pandemic Prevention Initiative (preprint)","In the state of California, COVID-19 has killed 90,000 people. In addition, it has led to economic losses and hardships, acute and chronic diseases, education and social disruptions, and mental health harms. These damages are valued at over $1 trillion. Ballot Initiative AG #21-0022A1, the Pandemic Prevention Initiative, will reduce the probability of future pandemics affecting California, and also fund public health programs and reduce school absences and illnesses. The Pandemic Prevention Initiative will give California a total expected value of $36 billion of economic benefits, plus $31 billion worth of monetized health benefits, for a total of $67 billion in benefits, at a cost of $10 billion in taxes on high earners. Even if there is no pandemic in the near future, the Pandemic Prevention Initiative will still give California $11 billion of economic benefits, and provide $16 billion worth of monetized health benefits, for a total of $27 billion in benefits. The Pandemic Prevention Initiative will generate roughly 750 public health jobs, 1,000 building trades jobs, and 1,600 technology jobs for California.

"Longitudinal associations between multiple mental health problems and suicidal ideation among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Recent research suggested that COVID-19-related multiple mental health problems were associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideations (SIs), but population-based data demonstrating these associations are scarce. This study aimed to estimate the cumulative effects of psychological risk factors on SIs during the outbreak and remission periods of COVID-19 using a cumulative risk model, as well as sex differences. A total of 68,685 college students in China participated in the survey during two phases of the pandemic (T1 and T2). Mental health risks (acute stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) and sociodemographic characteristics were measured at T1, and SIs were assessed at T1 and T2. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the combined effect of multiple mental health problems on SIs at T1 and T2. The prevalence of SIs increased from the early periods of the COVID-19 pandemic (7.6%) to the later periods (10.0%). Depression was a powerful risk factor for SIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with &gt;3 mental risks would be most likely to experience rapidly increasing SIs during the early periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex exerted different effects on the cumulative risk model of SIs. Interventions, such as mental health education and improving utilization of student support services, should be implemented. There is a crucial need for early intervention and prevention efforts aimed at males with greater than three mental health problems.","Ma, Wang, Zhao, Zhu, Zhang, Chen, Jiang, Pan, Yang, Zhu, Liu, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.093","20220521","COVID-19; Longitudinal associations; Multiple mental health symptoms; Suicidal ideation; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31753,""

This nationwide study aimed to assess health's student mental health during the third wave in France. We did an online national cross-sectional study, which addressed all health students from April 4th to May 11th 2021. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and work conditions questions, Kessler 6 scale, and numeric scales. 16,937 students answered, including 54% nurse and 16% medical students.

"Relationship between stress response and depression in vocational medical school students in the COVID-19 epidemic: A moderated mediation model","To investigate the relationship between stress response and depression in vocational medical school students at the initial stage of COVID-19 epidemic, and to explore the mediating role of meaning in life and the moderating role of prosocial behavior. The COVID-19 Stress Response Questionnaire, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Prosocial Behavior Scale and the Depression Scale, were used to investigate 3526 vocational medical school students. The results showed that: (1) The relationship between stress response and depression in vocational medical school students was partially mediated by presence of meaning and search for meaning.

"Investigating engagement in maladaptive and adaptive exercise behaviors before and during COVID-19","Evidence suggests that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in increased mental health concerns (e.g., anxiety) and there is ample discussion of how the pandemic has resulted in increases in weight control strategies (e.g., maladaptive exercise behaviors). It remains unclear, however, if maladaptive exercise behaviors are on the rise among non-clinical samples. The objective of this study was to examine college students' engagement in exercise behaviors (both adaptive and maladaptive) before and during COVID-19. This study compared reports of compulsive exercise, weight and shape exercise, and positive and healthy exercise in two separate samples recruited from a large southeastern university. Sample 1 was collected pre-COVID-19 (August 2019-February 2020) and Sample 2 was collected during COVID-19 (August 2020-April 2021). Case-control matched samples were generated for this study (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°144; 52.1% male). Three separate analysis of covariance models tested the differences between (1) adaptive exercise; (2) compulsive exercise; and (3) weight and shape exercise in pre- and during COVID-19 samples, controlling for sex. Individuals in the during COVID-19 sample reported significantly more compulsive exercise (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), weight and shape exercise (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and adaptive exercise (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) compared to individuals inÃ‚Â the pre-COVID-19 sample. Effects were of medium to large sizes. Consistent with reports from the research literature and popular press, the current study observed that both adaptive and maladaptive exercise were higher among college students during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. Level V: Opinions of authorities, based on descriptive studies, narrative reviews, clinical experience, or reports of expert committees.","Palermo, Rancourt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40519-022-01413-7","20220521","COVID-19; College students; Compulsive exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31756,""
"The Lived Experience of Military Women With Chronic Pain: A Phenomenological Study","Chronic pain, a persistent or recurrent pain lasting more than 3Ã‚Â months, is a widespread problem among military women due to combat-related injuries and post-deployment stressors. Risk factors associated with chronic pain include gender, mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder, and prior physical or military sexual trauma. The most common prevalence of chronic pain is musculoskeletal (e.g., low back and neck), migraine, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Following deployment, 25% of military women are at risk for chronic pain. Military women are prescribed opioids for pain at a higher rate than men and are at risk for prescription opioid addiction. The unique medical needs of military women, including chronic pain, are poorly understood by health care providers and need to be addressed to achieve full integration into the military. The purpose of this study was to explore a typical day for military women living with chronic pain by examining the participants' daily life experiences. Using van Manen's approach, 13 active duty, retired, and veteran women were interviewed to explore these lived experiences. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of San Diego. Eight themes emerged from an analysis of the participants' experiences: (1) chronic pain is a frustrating, persistent, daily, and an hourly struggle; (2) resilience in living with chronic pain is the new normal; (3) mission first and the impact of invisible pain; (4) self-care management and internal locus of control with nonpharmacological therapies; (5) pain accepted and managed to improve quality of life; (6) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diminished social interactions; (7) pain of sexual trauma is not reported; and (8) disparities in health care due to self-perception of provider bias as pain is not understood. The study generated new knowledge in Force Health Protection, ensuring (1) a fit and operational readiness force; (2) pre- to post-deployment care for women warriors; and (3) access to health care. The study findings supported previous research and could help direct future research into nursing, medicine, and allied health treatments for military and veterans' gender-specific health care, education, and training. Furthermore, the military women in this study provided insight into the need for future research to explore unconscious gender bias, health disparities, and a raised awareness of military women living with chronic pain. Findings from this study merit further exploration using other qualitative research methodologies including mixed methods.","Peppard, Burkard, Georges, Dye","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac134","20220521","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31757,""
"Association between sedentary behavior and depression among Japanese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional online survey","Sedentary behavior, particularly prevalent during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been shown to lead to depression. In medical students, this could negatively affect the provision of healthcare. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between sedentary behavior and depression in Japanese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 30 to August 30, 2021, using anonymous questionnaire system to assess respondents' sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, sedentary behavior among 1000 Japanese university students. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). The data of 484 respondents (48.4%) were included in a stepwise analysis, where we set the difference between medical and non-medical students as Model 1 and that between medical students with and without depression as Model 2. For group comparisons of both models, the chi-square test was used for sociodemographic characteristics, and the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for physical activity and sedentary behavior. In Model 2, factors associated with depression among medical students were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. In Model 1, medical students were less physically active (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), had longer sedentary time (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and had higher PHQ-2 scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048) than non-medical students. In Model 2, medical students with depression had longer sedentary time (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004) and longer leisure screen time than those without depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007). Moreover, logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that sedentary time (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.001, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048) and leisure screen time (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.003, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) were significantly associated with depression among medical students. Based on these results, it is evident that reducing Japanese medical students' sedentary time and leisure screen time can help combat depression during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, these results can guide the development of appropriate interventions to prevent and treat depression.","Tashiro, Maeda, Tsutsumi, Komiya, Arima, Mizuta, Fukui, Nishikawa, Urabe","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03997-x","20220520","COVID-19; Depression; Japan; Medical students; Online survey; Pandemic; Screen time; Sedentary behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31758,""
"Real-world study of multiple naloxone administration for opioid overdose reversal among bystanders","The increasing prevalence of highly potent, illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues (IMF) in the USA is exacerbating the opioid epidemic which has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. NarcanÃ‚Â® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for opioid-related overdoses. Due to the high potency of IMF, multiple naloxone administrations (MNA) may be needed per overdose event. It is essential to determine the patterns of naloxone use, including MNA, and preferences among bystanders who have used naloxone for opioid overdose reversal. A cross-sectional web-based survey was administered to 125 adult US residents who administered 4Ã‚Â mg NarcanÃ‚Â® Nasal Spray during an opioid overdose in the past year. The survey asked about the most recent overdose event, the use of NarcanÃ‚Â® during the event and the associated withdrawal symptoms, and participant preferences regarding dosages of naloxone nasal spray. An open-ended voice survey was completed by 35 participants. Participants were mostly female (70%) and white (78%), while reported overdose events most frequently occurred in people who were males (54%) and white (86%). Most events (95%) were successfully reversed, with 78% usingÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 doses and 30% usingÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°3 doses of NarcanÃ‚Â® Nasal Spray. Over 90% were worried that 1 NarcanÃ‚Â® box may not be enough for a successful future reversal. Reported withdrawal symptoms were similar in overdose events where 1 versusÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 sprays were given. Eighty-six percent of participants reported more confidence in an 8Ã‚Â mg versus a 4Ã‚Â mg naloxone nasal spray and 77% reported a stronger preference for 8Ã‚Â mg over 4Ã‚Â mg. MNA occurred in most overdose events, often involving more sprays than are provided in one NarcanÃ‚Â® nasal spray box, and participants predominantly expressed having a stronger preference for and confidence in an 8Ã‚Â mg compared to a 4Ã‚Â mg nasal spray. This suggests the need and desire for a higher dose naloxone nasal spray formulation option. Given that bystanders may be the first to administer naloxone to someone experiencing an opioid overdose, ensuring access to an adequate naloxone supply is critical in addressing the opioid overdose epidemic.","Abdelal, Raja Banerjee, Carlberg-Racich, Darwaza, Ito, Shoaff, Epstein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00627-3","20220520","Bystander; COVID-19; Dosing; Fentanyl; Layperson; Multiple naloxone administrations; Naloxone; Narcan; Opioid overdose; Synthetic opioid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31759,""
"People with Parkinson's Views of In-Person and Virtual Group Exercise Before and During the Pandemic","Due to COVID-19, many health/wellness programs transitioned from in-person to virtual. This mixed methods study aims to explore older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD) perceptions of in-person versus virtual-based Parkinson's-specific exercise classes (PDEx). Explore people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) experiences, perceptions, and perceived impact of participating in and transitioning from in-person to virtual PDEx. Cross-sectional mixed methods design using an online survey and focus groups. PwPD who participated in an in-person and virtual PDEx (n=26) were recruited to participate and completed online surveys and focus groups from their home during the COVID-19 pandemic. PwPD who participated in an in-person and virtual PDEx and agreed to participate completed an online survey (n=16; male=8; mean age=74Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) and focus groups (n=9; male=4; mean age=75Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed survey questions and participated in focus groups regarding their perceptions, attitudes, and perceived changes in PD-related symptoms since participating in the PDEx, as well as barriers and facilitators to participating in virtual PDEx. Participants felt PDEx was somewhat to very safe and beneficial. In the computer, comfort, and perceptions survey participants reported perceived improved mobility (63%), balance (75%), and overall health (63%) since participating the PDEx while some participants reported improved mental health (38%). Participants reported minimal difficulty with accessing virtual PDEx. Most participants stated they would prefer to participate in a combination of in-person and virtual programming. Focus group participants emphasized that virtual PDEx provided social and emotional support and improved confidence to perform and maintain an exercise regimen. PwPD who transitioned from an in-person to a virtual PDEx felt the program was safe, effective, and improved or prevented declines in their mobility and balance. PwPD who transitioned to a virtual PDEx also reported benefits in non-motor symptoms such as social isolaton. This article is protected by copyright.

"Type 1 diabetes and the challenges of emotional support in crisis situations: results from a feasibility study of a multidisciplinary teleintervention","The association between type 1 diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a teleguided intervention on emotional disorders in patients with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak. This studyÃ‚Â was performed during the social distancing period in the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil. Individuals with type 1 diabetes agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years were selected to receive a teleguided multidisciplinary intervention or the usual care plus an educational website access. The proposed intervention aimed addressing aspects of mental health, diabetes care and lifestyle habits during the pandemic. The feasibility outcome included the assessment of recruitment capability and adherence to the proposed intervention. Moreover, we evaluated the presence of positive screening for emotional disorders (Self Report Questionnaire 20) after a 16-week intervention, patients' perceptions of pandemic-related changes, diabetes-related emotional distress, eating disorders, and sleep disorders. Data were analyzed with the intent-to-treat principle. Fifty-eight individuals (mean age, 43.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.6Ã‚Â years) were included (intervention group, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29; control group, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29). At the end of the study, a total of 5 participants withdrew from the study in the intervention group compared to only 1 in the control group. Participants who dropout from the study had similar mean age, sex and income to those who remained in the study. The analysis of mental health disorders was not different between the groups at the follow up: a positive screening result was found in 48.3% and 34.5% of participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29). The intervention group felt more supported in their diabetes care during the social distancing period (82.8% vs. 48.3% in the control group, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Our study identified a disproportionate higher number of withdrawals in the intervention group when compared to the control group.

"Living with spinal cord injury during COVID-19: a qualitative study of impacts of the pandemic in Nepal","A qualitative study using focus group discussion. To explore the impacts of COVID-19 on multiple aspects of the lives of individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Nepal. Community settings in Nepal. A qualitative phenomenological study was conducted using two virtual focus group discussions. Fourteen individuals with SCI residing in different parts of Nepal participated. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyze and interpret the participants' responses. The four key themes for the impacts of COVID-19 on individuals with SCI were: (1) physical health with subthemes of (a) difficulty due to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and (b) deterioration in secondary conditions; (2) mental health with subthemes of (c) constant fear of COVID-19 and (d) psychological distress; (3) social life with subthemes of (e) social stigma and (f) social isolation, and (4) economic problems with subthemes of (g) financial burden and (i) inadequate resources. The pandemic has tremendously impacted the physical, mental, social, and economic aspects of the lives of individuals with SCI. These, in turn, could impede the functioning and well-being of this population. The utilization of telehealth to provide education, psychosocial support, social awareness programs, and the provision of essential medical supplies appear necessary to maintain and improve the well-being of individuals with SCI during this pandemic. Future studies using an in-depth interview approach and psychosocial interventions are recommended.","Bhattarai, Limbu, Sherpa","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-022-00812-y","20220520","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31762,""
"Parental socioeconomic and psychological determinants of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine uptake in children","Before COVID-19, the previous pandemic was caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009. Identification of factors behind parental decisions to have their child vaccinated against pandemic influenza could be helpful in planning of other pandemic vaccination programmes. We investigated the association of parental socioeconomic and psychosocial factors with uptake of the pandemic influenza vaccine in children in 2009-2010. This study was conducted within a prospective birth-cohort study (STEPS Study), where children born in 2008-2010 are followed from pregnancy to adulthood. Demographic and socioeconomic factors of parents were collected through questionnaires and vaccination data from electronic registers. Before and after the birth of the child, the mother's and father's individual and relational psychosocial well-being, i.e. depressive symptoms, dissatisfaction with the relationship, experienced social and emotional loneliness, and maternal anxiety during pregnancy, were measured by validated questionnaires (BDI-II, RDAS, PRAQ, and UCLA). Of 1020 children aged 6-20Ã‚Â months at the beginning of pandemic influenza vaccinations, 820 (80%) received and 200 (20%) did not receive the vaccine against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. All measures of parents' psychosocial well-being were similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated children. Children of younger mothers had a higher risk of not receiving the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine than children of older mothers (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.52-4.43, for mothersÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 27.7Ã‚Â years compared toÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 33.6Ã‚Â years of age). Children of mothers with lower educational level had an increased risk of not receiving the vaccine (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.00-2.14). Mother's younger age and lower education level were associated with an increased risk for the child not to receive the 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine, but individual or relational psychosocial well-being of parents was not associated with children's vaccination. Our findings suggest that young and poorly educated mothers should receive targeted support in order to promote children's vaccinations during a pandemic.","Salo-Tuominen, Teros-Jaakkola, Toivonen, Ollila, Rautava, Aromaa, Lahti, Junttila, Peltola","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.05.012","20220520","Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus; Influenza vaccine; Maternal age; Pandemic vaccine; Parental education level; Parental psychosocial well-being; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31763,""
"[Pre-post evaluation of an intergenerational program to improve wellbeing in older adults and age stereotypes in primary and secondary students: CRENCO project]","The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the CRENCO project which was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic including intergenerational activities shared by students from primary and secondary education and users of two centers for older adults and a day hospital in Catalonia. The effectiveness was assessed in terms of well-being in older adults and on negative stereotypes about the elderly in primary and secondary students. Three interventions were carried out in which 32 older persons (9 users of centers for older adults and 23 of a day hospital), 99 primary students and 56 secondary students participated. Participants answered a questionnaire before and after the interventions. Through multilevel linear models for repeated measures, changes in feelings of loneliness, social support, anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-reported health and health-related quality of life were evaluated in older people. In primary and secondary students, changes in age stereotypes were evaluated. Health-related quality of life and self-reported health improved statistically after the interventions in older persons. Users of the day hospital also reported an improvement in social support. Primary school students improved their age stereotypes; no statistically significant changes were detected in secondary students. The results of the present study contribute to underlining the importance of intergenerational programs such as the one proposed by CRENCO, capable of improving well-being and providing a more realistic vision of the older adults. Our results suggest that these programs should be implemented during childhood in order to prevent the proliferation of ageist stereotypes in later life stages.","DomÃƒÂ¨nech-Abella, DÃƒÂ­az-Cofine, Rubio-Valera, Aznar-Lou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2022.04.005","20220520","Ageism; Ansiedad; Anxiety; Calidad de vida; DepresiÃƒÂ³n; Depression; Edadismo; EvaluaciÃƒÂ³n pre-post; Intergenerational programs; Loneliness; Pre-post evaluation; Programas intergeneracionales; Quality of life; Social support; Soledad; Soporte social","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","",31764,""
