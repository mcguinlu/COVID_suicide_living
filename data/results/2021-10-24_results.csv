"Acceptance and commitment training for veterans with polytrauma: A randomized controlled trial protocol","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a signature wound of Veterans of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (i.e., OIF/OEF/OND). Most Veterans with mTBI also experience stress-based psychopathology (e.g., depression, posttraumatic stress disorder) and chronic pain. This combination - referred to as polytrauma - results in detrimental long-term effects on social, occupational, and community reintegration. This study will compare the efficacy of a one-day Acceptance and Commitment Training plus Education, Resources, and Support (ACT+ERS) workshop to a one-day active control group (ERS) on symptoms of distress and social, occupational, and community reintegration. We will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment response. This is an ongoing randomized clinical trial. 212 OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with polytrauma are being recruited. Veterans are randomly assigned to a one-day ACT+ERS or a one-day ERS workshop with two individualized booster sessions approximately two- and four-weeks post-workshop. Veterans complete assessments prior to the workshop and again at six weeks, three months, and six months post-workshop. Of note, workshops were converted to a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcomes are symptoms of distress and reintegration; secondary outcomes are post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and pain interference. Secondary analyses will assess whether changes in avoidance at three months mediate changes in distress and reintegration at six months. Facilitating the psychological adjustment and reintegration of Veterans with polytrauma is critical. The results of this study will provide important information about the impact of a brief intervention for Veterans with these concerns.","Uzdavines, Gonzalez, Price, Broadway, Smith, Rodrigues, Woods, Zimmerman, Jorge, Dindo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106601","20211023","Acceptance commitment therapy; Brief intervention; Mild traumatic brain injury; Polytrauma; Randomized controlled trial; Veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19060,""
"Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were a risk factor for suicidal and self-injurious ideation: A study of the psychological status of hospital workers in Chongqing, China, at the late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak","Hospital workers have been under intense psychological pressure since the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed the psychological status of hospital staff in the late period of the COVID-19 to provide a basis for the construction of global health care after the COVID-19 outbreak. We used online surveys to assess participants' self-reported symptoms at the late stage of the outbreak. This study collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, epidemic-related factors, psychological status (PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PHQ-15), psychological assistance needs, perceived stress and support, PTSD symptoms (PCL-C) and suicidal and self-injurious ideation (SSI). Participants were hospital workers in all positions from 46 hospitals. Chi-square tests to compare the scales and logistic regression analysis were used to identify risk factors for PTSD and SSI. Among the 33,706 participants, the prevalences of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and SSI were 35.8%, 24.4%, 49.7%, 5.0%, and 1.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that work in a general ward, attention to the epidemic, high education, work in non-first-line departments, insufficient social support, and anxiety and somatization symptoms were influencing factors of PTSD (P&lt;0.05). The independent risk factors for SSI were female gender; psychological assistance needs; contact with severe COVID-19 patients; high stress at work; single or divorced marital status; insufficient social support; and depression, anxiety or PTSD symptoms (P&lt;0.05). This cross-sectional study could not reveal causality, and voluntary participation may have led to selection bias. The longer longitudinal studies are needed to determine the long-term psychological impact. This COVID-19 pandemic had a sustained, strong psychological impact on hospital workers, and hospital workers with PTSD symptoms were a high-risk group for SSI in the later period of the epidemic. Continuous attention and positive psychological intervention are of great significance for specific populations.","Lixia, Xiaoming, Lei, Su, Wo, Xin, Jianmei, Qi, Ming, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.013","20211023","2019 novel coronavirus disease; PTSD symptoms; hospital workers; psychological status; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19061,""
"Training During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Knowledge, Beliefs, and Practices of 12,526 Athletes from 142 Countries and Six Continents","Our objective was to explore the training-related knowledge, beliefs, and practices of athletes and the influence of lockdowns in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Athletes (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12,526, comprising 13% world class, 21% international, 36% national, 24% state, and 6% recreational) completed an online survey that was available from 17 May to 5 July 2020 and explored their training behaviors (training knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, and practices), including specific questions on their training intensity, frequency, and session duration before and during lockdown (March-June 2020). Overall, 85% of athletes wanted to ""maintain training,"" and 79% disagreed with the statement that it is ""okay to not train during lockdown,"" with a greater prevalence for both in higher-level athletes. In total, 60% of athletes considered ""coaching by correspondence (remote coaching)"" to be sufficient (highest amongst world-class athletes). During lockdown,Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°40% were able to maintain sport-specific training (e.g., long endurance [39%], interval training [35%], weightlifting [33%], plyometric exercise [30%]) at pre-lockdown levels (higher among world-class, international, and national athletes), with most (83%) training for ""general fitness and health maintenance"" during lockdown. Athletes trained alone (80%) and focused on bodyweight (65%) and cardiovascular (59%) exercise/training during lockdown. Compared with before lockdown, most athletes reported reduced training frequency (from between five and seven sessions per week to four or fewer), shorter training sessions (fromÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â min), and lower sport-specific intensity (~Ã¢â‚¬â€°38% reduction), irrespective of athlete classification. COVID-19-related lockdowns saw marked reductions in athletic training specificity, intensity, frequency, and duration, with notable within-sample differences (by athlete classification). Higher classification athletes had the strongest desire to ""maintain"" training and the greatest opposition to ""not training"" during lockdowns. These higher classification athletes retained training specificity to a greater degree than others, probably because of preferential access to limited training resources. More higher classification athletes considered ""coaching by correspondence"" as sufficient than did lower classification athletes. These lockdown-mediated changes in training were not conducive to maintenance or progression of athletes' physical capacities and were also likely detrimental to athletes' mental health. These data can be used by policy makers, athletes, and their multidisciplinary teams to modulate their practice, with a degree of individualization, in the current and continued pandemic-related scenario. Furthermore, the data may drive training-related educational resources for athletes and their multidisciplinary teams. Such upskilling would provide athletes with evidence to inform their training modifications in response to germane situations (e.g., COVID related, injury, and illness).","Washif, Farooq, Krug, Pyne, Verhagen, Taylor, Wong, Mujika, Cortis, Haddad, Ahmadian, Al Jufaili, Al-Horani, Al-Mohannadi, Aloui, Ammar, Arifi, Aziz, Batuev, Beaven, Beneke, Bici, Bishnoi, Bogwasi, Bok, Boukhris, Boullosa, Bragazzi, Brito, Cartagena, Chaouachi, Cheung, Chtourou, Cosma, Debevec, DeLang, Dellal, DÃƒÂ¶nmez, Driss, PeÃƒÂ±a Duque, Eirale, Elloumi, Foster, Franchini, Fusco, Galy, Gastin, Gill, Girard, Gregov, Halson, Hammouda, HanzlÃƒÂ­kovÃƒÂ¡, Hassanmirzaei, Haugen, HÃƒÂ©bert-Losier, MuÃƒÂ±oz HelÃƒÂº, Herrera-Valenzuela, Hettinga, Holtzhausen, Hue, Dello Iacono, Ihalainen, James, Janse van Rensburg, Joseph, Kamoun, Khaled, Khalladi, Kim, Kok, MacMillan, Mataruna-Dos-Santos, Matsunaga, Memishi, Millet, Moussa-Chamari, Musa, Nguyen, Nikolaidis, Owen, Padulo, Pagaduan, Perera, PÃƒÂ©rez-GÃƒÂ³mez, Pillay, Popa, Pudasaini, Rabbani, Rahayu, Romdhani, Salamh, Sarkar, Schillinger, Seiler, Setyawati, Shrestha, Suraya, Tabben, Trabelsi, Urhausen, Valtonen, Weber, Whiteley, Zrane, Zerguini, Zmijewski, Sandbakk, Ben Saad, Chamari","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-021-01573-z","20211023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19062,""
"Predictors of Psychological Distress and Resilience in the Post-COVID-19 Era","The COVID-19 global pandemic has hadÃ‚Â profound effects on mental health and wellbeing. The present study examined trends in distress and recovery in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Predictors that might increase risks or provide protections again distress were explored. Participants were recruited using social media during the COVID-19 pandemic to complete a baseline and 6-week follow-up survey (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°241). The change patterns of PTSD symptoms from baseline to follow-up were characterized using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to explore the differences in the depressive symptoms across trajectory groups. Multinominal logistic regression was performed to investigate potential predictors of the outcome trajectories. Four longitudinal outcome trajectories were identified: chronic (PTSD symptoms remained high; 14.9%), resilient (symptoms remained low; 43.2%), recovered (symptoms decreased from symptomatic levels to asymptomatic; 19.5%), and delayed (symptoms increased from asymptomatic levels to symptomatic; 22.4%). Hopelessness and maladaptive coping strategies were unique predictors of distress and resilience as well as longer-term trajectories. Individuals evidenced four outcome trajectories of distress in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Despite the uncertainty and high levels of stress related to the pandemic, the majority of the sample demonstrated resilience and recovery. It is essential to identify individuals at risk for chronic and delayed distress in order to build resilience.","Lin, Yi, Zhang, Veldhuis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-021-10036-8","20211023","COVID-19; Distress; Hopelessness; Resilience; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19063,""
"Exposure to Social Media Racial Discrimination and Mental Health among Adolescents of Color","Offline and online racial discrimination has been associated with mental health problems among adolescents of color. Pandemic shelter-at-home policies and the reignited racial justice movement increased the use of social media among youth of color, potentially exposing them to social media racial discrimination. Yet, it is unclear which aspects of social media significantly contributed to youth exposure to racial discrimination and associated mental health issues during this period. This study assessed the relationships among social media use (hours, racial intergroup contact, and racial justice civic engagement), individual and vicarious social media discrimination (defined as personally directed versus observing discrimination directed at others), and mental health among 115 black, 112 East/Southeast Asian, 79 Indigenous, and 101 Latinx adolescents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°407, 82.31% female, aged 15-18 years, MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.47, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses indicate that hours of use and racial justice civic engagement were associated with increased social media racial discrimination, depressive symptoms, anxiety, alcohol use disorder, and drug use problems. Furthermore, individual social media racial discrimination fully mediated the relationship between racial justice civic publication and depressive and alcohol use disorder. Vicarious social media racial discrimination fully mediated the relationship between racial justice activity coordination with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and alcohol use disorder. Alternative SEM models indicate that exposure to individual and vicarious social media racial discrimination increased depressive symptoms and drug use problems among youth of color, further increasing their social media use frequency and racial justice civic publication. The findings call for strategies to mitigate the effects of social media racial discrimination in ways that support adolescents' racial justice civic engagement and mental health.","Tao, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-021-01514-z","20211023","Adolescent; COVID-19; Mental health; Racial discrimination; Racial justice; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19064,""
"Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome negatively impacts physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life and participation","This report describes persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), and the impact of these symptoms on physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life and participation. Cross-sectional observational study design. Patients attending Mount Sinai's PACS Clinic completed surveys containing patient-reported outcomes. A total of 156 patients completed the survey, at a median (range) time of 351 (82 to 457) days post COVID-19 infection. All patients were pre-vaccination. The most common persistent symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%) and headache (n = 94, 60%). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%) and dehydration (n = 77, 49%). Increased levels of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and dyspnea (Medical Research Council) were reported, alongside reductions in levels of regularly completed physical activity. Ninety-eight (63%) patients scored for at least mild cognitive impairment (Neuro-Qol), and the domain of the EQ-5D-5 L most impacted was Self-care, Anxiety/Depression and Usual Activities. Persistent symptoms associated with PACS appear to impact physical and cognitive function, health-related quality of life and participation in society. More research is needed to further clarify the relationship between COVID-19 infection and PACS symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and treatment options.","Tabacof, Tosto-Mancuso, Wood, Cortes, Kontorovich, McCarthy, Rizk, Rozanski, Breyman, Nasr, Kellner, Herrera, Putrino","https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000001910","20211023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19065,""
"Effects of a Pandemic and Isolation on Alcohol and Psychoactive Medication Use in a Population of Rehabilitation and Pain Patients","The conjunction of the coronavirus disease lockdown and the use of illicit drugs suggests the potential increase in drug usage and opioid deaths. Because of other studies, we felt the need to examine if the lockdown has caused a change in the drug intake of our population of substance abuse and pain management patients. Urine drug testing is a strategy to reduce harm to patients in pain management and substance abuse treatment programs. We analyzed trends in the clinical drug testing patterns of urine specimens sent by substance abuse and pain clinics to monitor their patients. These specimens were tested by a national clinical laboratory using LC-MS/MS definitive methods. The time frame of these comparative observations was the past five years, including the time of the pandemic. The only decrease was a 30% reduction in test requests during the second quarter of 2020. Among the patients tested, positivity decreased greatly for the illicit drugs heroin and cocaine but increased for methamphetamine and fentanyl. Use of the antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs remained consistent or declined for some drugs, relative to pre-pandemic patterns. The percent of patients prescribed the opiates morphine and oxycodone decreased, while the use of hydrocodone increased. Positivity for the drug gabapentin increased greatly. The use of alcohol did not increase significantly during the lockdown period. In summary, these findings demonstrate relatively consistent drug use, with decreased positivity for high-risk drugs and dangerous drug combinations. We speculate that monitoring of these patients mitigates the possibility of drug misuse and potential overdose and is in concordance with the goals of these monitoring programs.","Pesce, Sundyhanata, Ritz, Thomas, Ackerman, Bollman","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+a+Pandemic+and+Isolation+on+Alcohol+and+Psychoactive+Medication+Use+in+a+Population+of+Rehabilitation+and+Pain+Patients.","20211023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19066,""

"Challenges to manage pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Iran with a special situation: a qualitative multi-method study","With the unprecedented expansion of COVID-19 in the world since December 2019, Iran's health system, like other countries, faced various challenges in managing the disease, which led to numerous experiences and lessons learned. This study was conducted to identify these challenges regarding unique political, economic, and cultural issues, which could help other countries with similar situations. The present study was performed using a qualitative multi-method approach with a content analysis method. The data were collected through in-depth and semi-structured interviews and focused group discussions with 60 key persons who were selected purposefully, including policymakers, health care workers, and affected people by the disease, and the review of all available national reports between February 21, 2020, and March 22, 2021. The data collection and analysis were done simultaneously. Identified critical challenges for the management of COVID-19 in the health system were limited evidence and scientific controversies, poor social prevention and social inequalities, burnout and sustained workload among healthcare workers, improper management of resources and equipment, the lack of a guideline for contact tracing, and patient flow management, and mental health problems in the community. According to our results, measures should be taken to conduct a continuous comprehensive risk assessment and develop a national response plan with an emphasis on precise contact tracing, active screening, patient flow, paying attention to the psychological and social dimensions of the disease, and also transparency of social inequalities in the face of risk factors of the COVID-19. Also, the social protection programs should become a vital tool for policymakers and supporting the vulnerable groups using the capacity of the community and international cooperation to develop a vaccine, which is difficult to procure due to the sanctions.","Khankeh, Farrokhi, Roudini, Pourvakhshoori, Ahmadi, Abbasabadi-Arab, Bajerge, Farzinnia, Kolivand, Delshad, Khanjani, Ahmadi-Mazhin, Sadeghi-Moghaddam, Bahrampouri, Sack, Stueck, Domres","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11973-5","20211023","COVID-19; Challenge; Iran; Lessons learned; Multi-method study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19068,""
"Depressive and Neurocognitive Disorders in the Context of the Inflammatory Background of COVID-19","The dysfunctional effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on the nervous system are established. The manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms during and after infection is influenced by the neuroinvasive and neurotrophic properties of SARS-CoV-2 as well as strong inflammation characterised by a specific ""cytokine storm"". Research suggests that a strong immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection and psychological stressors related to the pandemic may cause chronic inflammatory processes in the body with elevated levels of inflammatory markers contributing to the intensification of neurodegenerative processes. It is suggested that neuroinflammation and associated central nervous system changes may significantly contribute to the etiopathogenesis of depressive disorders. In addition, symptoms after a COVID-19 infection may persist for up to several weeks after an acute infection as a post-COVID-19 syndrome. Moreover, previous knowledge indicates that among SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group antidepressants, fluoxetine is a promising drug against COVID-19. In conclusion, further research, observation and broadening of the knowledge of the pathomechanism of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on potential complications are necessary. It is essential to continue research in order to assess the long-term neuropsychiatric effects in COVID-19 patients and to find new therapeutic strategies.","DÃ„â€¦browska, GaliÃ…â€žska-Skok, Waszkiewicz","https://doi.org/10.3390/life11101056","20211023","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; complications; depression; depressive disorders; long-term; neurocognitive disorders; neuroinflammation; post-covid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19069,""
"Course and Survival of COVID-19 Patients with Comorbidities in Relation to the Trace Element Status at Hospital Admission","Selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) are essential trace elements needed for appropriate immune system responses, cell signalling and anti-viral defence. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at two hospitals in Ghent, Belgium, to investigate whether Se and/or Zn deficiency upon hospital admission correlates to disease severity and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with or without co-morbidities. Trace element concentrations along with additional biomarkers were determined in serum or plasma and associated to disease severity and outcome. An insufficient Se and/or Zn status upon hospital admission was associated with a higher mortality rate and a more severe disease course in the entire study group, especially in the senior population. In comparison to healthy European adults, the patients displayed strongly depressed total Se (mean Ã‚Â± SD: 59.2 Ã‚Â± 20.6 vs. 84.4 Ã‚Â± 23.4 Ã‚Âµg L<sup>-1</sup>) and SELENOP (mean Ã‚Â± SD: 2.2 Ã‚Â± 1.9 vs. 4.3 Ã‚Â± 1.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) concentrations at hospital admission. Particularly strong associations were observed for death risk of cancer, diabetes and chronic cardiac disease patients with low Se status, and of diabetes and obese patients with Zn deficiency. A composite biomarker based on serum or plasma Se, SELENOP and Zn at hospital admission proved to be a reliable tool to predict severe COVID-19 course and death, or mild disease course. We conclude that trace element assessment at hospital admission may contribute to a better stratification of patients with COVID-19 and other similar infectious diseases, support clinical care, therapeutic interventions and adjuvant supplementation needs, and may prove of particular relevance for patients with relevant comorbidities.","Du Laing, Petrovic, Lachat, De Boevre, Klingenberg, Sun, De Saeger, De Clercq, Ide, Vandekerckhove, Schomburg","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13103304","20211023","biomarker; cancer; diabetes; micronutrient; nutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19070,""
"Coping Strategies and Health-Related Quality of Life in Pregnant Women with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","<i>Background and Objectives:</i> As maternal deaths associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection remain at several times greater than the general population, significant factors that might contribute to the higher mortality and morbidity rate are the psychological impact of the disease and pregnancy itself. Therefore, the current study's main objective was to assess how pregnant women react and cope with the stress of COVID-19 disease and how it influences their overall health and quality of life in healthcare facilities. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> In this cross-sectional study, we included 304 pregnant women who successfully completed standardized forms to assess our topics of interest, comprising of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Short Form Health Survey-12, the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory scale, the CORE-Outcome Measure Questionnaire, and the Quality from the Patient's Perspective questionnaire. <i>Results</i>: Unemployed, pregnant women living in poverty in the rural areas had higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates during pregnancy. They faced higher anxiety levels and depression rates, with associated increased physical burden and exhaustion. However, these findings are not influenced by hospital care since it remained unchanged among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 maternity units, excepting significantly lower technical competence scores of COVID-19 facilities. <i>Conclusions</i>: As the pandemic's consequences emerge and additional outbreaks occur, care must prioritize the additional physical burden experienced by pregnant women who have contracted COVID-19, as well as psychological, emotional, and mental health support.","Timircan, Bratosin, Vidican, Suciu, Turaiche, Bota, Mitrescu, Marincu","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57101113","20211023","COPE; CORE-OM; COVID-19; HADS; QPP; SARS-CoV-2; SF-12; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19071,""

"Uncertainty, Anxiety and Isolation: Experiencing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown as a Woman with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic and the related lockdown measures presented a significant risk to physical and mental wellbeing in affected populations. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are predisposed to several cardio-metabolic risk factors which increase the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and also exhibit increased likelihood of impaired mental health wellbeing. Therefore, these women who usually receive care from multiple primary and specialist healthcare services may be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic and the related restrictions. This study aimed to explore the lived experience of the first UK national lockdown as a woman with PCOS. <b>Methods:</b> As part of a larger cross-sectional study, 12 women with PCOS living in the UK during the first national COVID-19 lockdown were recruited to a qualitative study. Telephone interviews were conducted in June/July of 2020, and data collected were subjected to thematic analysis. <b>Results:</b> Five themes were identified. ""My PCOS Journey"" describes participants' experiences of diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their PCOS. ""Living Through Lockdown"" describes the overall experience and impact of the lockdown on all aspects of participants' lives. ""Self-care and Managing Symptoms"" describe multiple challenges to living well with PCOS during the lockdown, including lack of access to supplies and services, and disruption to weight management. ""Healthcare on Hold"" describes the uncertainty and anxiety associated with delays in accessing specialised healthcare for a range of PCOS aspects, including fertility treatment. ""Exacerbating Existing Issues"" captures the worsening of pre-existing mental health issues, and an increase in health anxiety and feelings of isolation. <b>Conclusion:</b> For the women with PCOS in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic and the first national lockdown was mostly experienced as adding to the pre-existing challenges of living with their condition. The mental health impact experienced by the study participants was increased due to lack of access to their normal support strategies, limitations on healthcare services and uncertainty about their risk of COVID-19.","Atkinson, Kite, McGregor, James, Clark, Randeva, Kyrou","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11100952","20211023","COVID-19; PCOS; lived experience; lockdown; mental health; polycystic ovary syndrome; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19073,""
"Association of Moral Distress with Anxiety, Depression, and an Intention to Leave among Nurses Working in Intensive Care Units during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Wide geographical variations in depression and anxiety rates related to the ethical climate have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic in intensive care units (ICUs). The objective was to investigate whether moral distress is associated and has predictive values for depression, anxiety, and intention to resign. 79 consenting ICU nurses completed MMD-HP and PHQ-4 scales in this cross-sectional study between October 2020-February 2021, after ethical approval. The association between MMD-HP and PHQ-4, and the predictive value of MMD-HP for anxiety, depression, and an intention to leave were analyzed (linear regression and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis). From MMD-HP items, system related factors had highest scores (Kruskal-Wallis test, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). MMD-HP and PHQ-4 were weakly correlated (r = 0.41 [0.21-0.58]). MMD-HP and its system-related factors discriminate between nurses with and without depression or anxiety, while system-related factors differentiate those intending to resign (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The MMD-HP score had 50 [37.54-62.46] sensitivity with 80.95 [60-92.33] specificity to predict the intention to leave, and 76.12 [64.67-84.73] sensitivity with 58.33 [31.95-80.67] specificity to detect anxiety or depression symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, system-associated factors seem to be the most important root factors inducing moral distress. Moral distress is associated with negative psychological outcomes.","PetriÃˆâ„¢or, Breazu, Doroftei, MÃ„Æ’rieÃˆâ„¢, Popescu","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101377","20211023","COVID-19; ethics; moral distress; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19074,""
"Stress Levels and Mental Well-Being among Slovak Students during e-Learning in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has forced far-reaching changes in higher education. Isolation from peers and distance learning have significantly limited interpersonal contacts, which might have affected the mental well-being of students. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the level of perceived stress during e-learning among Slovak students and to identify the variables that have the most significant impact on mental health among students. The study included 3051 participants, 1773 women (58%) and 1278 (42%) with a mean age of 22.37 years. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were used to measure the severity of stress and depression level. In addition, an author's survey was used assessing the areas of social life, education skills, economic field, nutrition habits, and drugs. Almost all study participants were characterized by increased stress level and 47% of them were depressed. Moreover, isolation affected women more, especially in terms of social life and economics. It seems necessary to implement appropriate support programs for students, which could have the potential to improve their psychological condition.","Rutkowska, Liska, CieÃ…â€ºlik, Wrzeciono, BroÃ„ÂÃƒÂ¡ni, BarcalovÃƒÂ¡, GurÃƒÂ­n, Rutkowski","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101356","20211023","COVID-19; Slovakia; anxiety; depression; e-learning; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19075,""
"Smartphone Addiction and Depression among Low-Income Boys since COVID-19: The Moderating Effect of Being an Only Child","Even though boys' depression has become important, and their smartphone use has increased since COVID-19, little is known about low-income middle and high school boys' depression in the context of whether they have siblings. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between smartphone addiction and depression as well as the moderating effect of being an only child on the relationship. Participants were limited to middle and high school students whose families were regarded as having a low-income. A total of 129 low-income boys were selected for the final sample. The PROCESS macro 3.4 for Statistical Product and Service Solutions was used to identify the moderating effect. Smartphone addiction was positively related to depression among low-income male students. Being an only child significantly moderated the relationship between smartphone addiction and depression. This study contributes to understanding the importance of examining mental health problems among middle school boys since COVID-19, particularly among low-income boys. It is necessary to provide tailored mental health services for middle school boys in low-income families. Alternative activities and social programs should be provided for adolescent boys who are only children to safely socialize with friends and peers without a smartphone.","Lee, Lim, Allen, Choi, Jung","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101350","20211023","being an only child; boys; depression; low-income; smartphone addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19076,""
"A Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Mind-Body Modalities to Manage the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Era","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become an unprecedented threat to humanity worldwide, including healthcare workers (HCWs). Mind-body modalities have been used to improve the mental health, well-being, quality of life, and physical health of clinical and general populations, and may also be used to improve the mental health of HCWs during COVID-19. The objective of this review is to analyze the effectiveness of mind-body modalities for the mental health of HCWs in the COVID-19 era. Six electronic bibliographic databases were comprehensively searched to find intervention studies using mind-body modalities, including meditation, mindfulness-based intervention, autogenic training, yoga, tai chi, qigong, breathing exercise, music therapy, guided imagery, biofeedback, prayer, and faith-based techniques for HCWs. All intervention studies conducted from December 2019 to August 2021 will be included. Quality assessment will be performed according to study type, and Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool will be used for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). If sufficient homogeneous data from RCTs exist, a meta-analysis will be performed. Dichotomous data and continuous data are presented as risk ratios and mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through the publication of a manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal or by presentation at a conference.","Kwon, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101320","20211023","COVID-19; healthcare personnel; mental health; mindÃ¢â‚¬â€œbody therapies; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19077,""
"Feelings of Entrapment during the COVID-19 Pandemic Based on ACE Star Model: A Concept Analysis","This study aimed to analyze the concept of the ""feelings of entrapment"" during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic using a systematic review. We included literature based on content and outcomes related to feelings of entrapment, such as antecedents, attributes, and consequences. The exclusion criteria were studies that did not have inappropriate subject, content, conceptual definition, and degree thesis was excluded. Walker and Avant's process of concept analysis was used in this systematic literature review. The attributes of the concept of feelings of entrapment during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to be feelings of: (1) being out of control, (2) no escape, (3) being trapped, (4) being robbed, and (5) hopelessness. The causes for these were identified as (1) the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) lockdown system, (3) restricted situation, (4) uncertain future, (5) economic hardship, and (6) poor coping abilities. Consequences of the concept were: (1) increased suicide, (2) decreased mental health, and (3) decreased well-being. In situations such as COVID-19, it is important need to know what feelings of entrapment's antecedents and attributes are to prevent suicide and enhance mental health and well-being. Based on the results of this study, counseling services, policies, and systems for relieving feelings of entrapment in the COVID-19 situation are recommended.","Lee, Park","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101305","20211023","COVID-19 pandemic; academic center for evidence-based practice (ACE) star model; concept analysis; feelings of entrapment; lockdown system; mental health; no escape; out of control; suicide; trapped","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19078,""
"Psychological Aspects of Media Communication during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from Healthcare and Pharmacy Specialists in Lithuania","In the setting of disasters, people seek information as they hope that knowledge will provide security. This makes the media a critical source of crisis exposure. The aim of the study described in this article was to analyze COVID-19 pandemic-related psychological aspects of media use by healthcare and pharmacy workers in Lithuania and to reveal the subjective effects of media consumption on their psychological well-being. 967 healthcare workers and pharmacists in Lithuania completed an electronic survey, which consisted of questions about the changes in well-being experienced since the beginning of the lockdown and media use in the search for information on COVID-19. It was found that communication might have ambiguous effects on psychological well-being. Excessive, unreliable, misleading, contradictory information and ""catastrophizing"" were subjectively related to impaired psychological well-being. Objective and reliable, relevant, clear, timely, hopeful and supportive information had a subjective positive effect. Seeking COVID-19-related information many times a day was associated with increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19, feeling unable to control the risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of infecting relatives with COVID-19 and feeling that other people would avoid interaction with healthcare workers and pharmacists because of their job.

"A Comprehensive Examination of Severely Ill ME/CFS Patients","One in four myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients are estimated to be severely affected by the disease, and these house-bound or bedbound patients are currently understudied. Here, we report a comprehensive examination of the symptoms and clinical laboratory tests of a cohort of severely ill patients and healthy controls. The greatly reduced quality of life of the patients was negatively correlated with clinical depression. The most troublesome symptoms included fatigue (85%), pain (65%), cognitive impairment (50%), orthostatic intolerance (45%), sleep disturbance (35%), post-exertional malaise (30%), and neurosensory disturbance (30%). Sleep profiles and cognitive tests revealed distinctive impairments. Lower morning cortisol level and alterations in its diurnal rhythm were observed in the patients, and antibody and antigen measurements showed no evidence for acute infections by common viral or bacterial pathogens. These results highlight the urgent need of developing molecular diagnostic tests for ME/CFS. In addition, there was a striking similarity in symptoms between long COVID and ME/CFS, suggesting that studies on the mechanism and treatment of ME/CFS may help prevent and treat long COVID and vice versa.","Chang, Hung, Kogelnik, Kaufman, Aiyar, Chu, Wilhelmy, Li, Tannenbaum, Xiao, Davis","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101290","20211023","antibody and antigen; clinical symptoms; cognitive tests; laboratory tests; long COVID; post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC); quality of life; severe ME/CFS; sleep; viral infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19080,""
"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): An Overview","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic systemic disease that manifests via various symptoms such as chronic fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive impairment described as ""brain fog"". These symptoms often prevent patients from keeping up their pre-disease onset lifestyle, as extended periods of physical or mental activity become almost impossible. However, the disease presents heterogeneously with varying severity across patients. Therefore, consensus criteria have been designed to provide a diagnosis based on symptoms. To date, no biomarker-based tests or diagnoses are available, since the molecular changes observed also largely differ from patient to patient. In this review, we discuss the infectious, genetic, and hormonal components that may be involved in CFS pathogenesis, we scrutinize the role of gut microbiota in disease progression, we highlight the potential of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) for the development of diagnostic tools and briefly mention the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection causing CFS.","Deumer, Varesi, Floris, Savioli, Mantovani, LÃƒÂ³pez-Carrasco, Rosati, Prasad, Ricevuti","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10204786","20211023","COVID-19; ME/CFS; depression; diagnosis; dysbiosis; genetics; hormone; immunity; miRNA; therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19081,""
"How Does Food Addiction Relate to Obesity? Patterns of Psychological Distress, Eating Behaviors and Physical Activity in a Sample of Lebanese Adults: The MATEO Study","Food addiction is currently not an official diagnosis (as a standalone disorder substance-related and addictive disorder) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). To best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on differences between addictive-like eating behavior regarding its associations with psychological distress, eating behaviors and physical activity among individuals with obesity. The objective of the present study was to distinguish psychological and behavioral patterns of individuals with obesity concerning food addiction using a cluster analysis. We determined the profiles of the participants in terms of psychological distress, eating behaviors and physical activity and evaluated their association with food addiction. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September and November 2020, during the lockdown period imposed by the government for the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 507 individuals with obesity aged between 18 and 65 years participated in the present study by filling in the online questionnaire, including the validated Arabic version of the modified version of the Yale Food Addiction Scale, the Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, and the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A cluster analysis was performed using the K-mean method to identify and group participants according to their patterns/profiles. A stepwise linear regression was conducted, taking the food addiction score as the dependent variable. Higher levels of uncontrolled eating, emotional eating and stress were significantly associated with higher food addiction score. Belonging to cluster 2 (psychological well-being and cognitive restraint) (B = 14.49) or cluster 3 (moderate psychological distress and cognitive restraint) (B = 6.67) compared to cluster 1 (psychological well-being, appropriate physical activity levels and eating behaviors) was significantly associated with higher food addiction score. The present research revealed that food addiction is significantly associated with higher psychological distress and maladaptive eating behaviors. Higher levels of uncontrolled eating, emotional eating and stress as well as belonging to clusters 2 and 3 were found to be predictors of food addiction in individuals with obesity in the present study. This knowledge could be useful in regard to psychological treatment of obesity and addictive-like eating behavior.","Brytek-Matera, Obeid, Akel, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010979","20211023","eating behaviors; food addiction; obesity; physical activity; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19082,""
"Gender Self-Perception and Psychological Distress in Healthcare Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to analyze university Health Sciences students' self-perception regarding gender stereotypes, and to explore whether there was any association between gender stereotypes and clinical/socio-demographic variables. This cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 252 university students who completed a self-administrated online questionnaire (18.3% males, 81.7% females). We evaluated the self-perception of gender stereotypes as determined using the BSRI-12 questionnaire and explored the association of this measure with the impact of perceived stress measured using a modified scale (PSS-10-C) as well as anxiety and depression according to scores on the Goldberg scale (GADS). According to the students' self-perception of gender stereotypes, 24.9% self-perceived themselves as feminine, 20.1% as masculine, 24.9% as androgynous, and 30% as undifferentiated. The degree determines self-identification with gender stereotypes. Nursing and Occupational Therapy are studied mostly by women, 28.4% and 45%, respectively, while Physiotherapy is studied mainly by men (71.2%). Females indicated more anxiety (75.7%) and depression (81.7%) than males (52.9% and 67.3%, respectively). In contrast, males developed more stress (88.5%) than females (74.1%). University degree, anxiety, depression, and stress determined self-identification with gender stereotypes.

"Moving Forward: Understanding Correlates of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour during COVID-19-An Integrative Review and Socioecological Approach","Population-level physical activity (PA) and sedentary time/behaviour estimates represent a significant public health issue exacerbated by restrictions enforced to control COVID-19. This integrative review interrogated available literature to explore the pandemic's impact on correlates of such behaviours in adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years). Five electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2021. Data extracted from 64 articles were assessed for risk-of-bias using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool, with correlates identified, coded, and themed via thematic analysis. A socioecological model of during-pandemic PA was conceptualized and mapped to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change mechanisms, which illustrates influences over five levels: Individual (biological)-general health; Individual (psychological)-mental health, cognition, motivation, and behaviour; Social-domestic situation, sociodemographic factors, support, and lifestyle choices; Environmental-resources and area of residence; and Policy-COVID-19-related rules. For sedentary time/behaviour, individual level factors, namely general and mental health, may be important correlates. Neither age or sex were clearly correlated with either behaviour. As we transition into a new normal, understanding which behaviour mechanisms could effectively challenge physical inactivity is essential. Targeting capability on a psychological level may facilitate PA and limit sedentary time/behaviour, whereas, on a physical level, maximizing PA opportunities could be crucial.","Knight, McNarry, Sheeran, Runacres, Thatcher, Shelley, Mackintosh","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010910","20211023","COM-B model; SARS-CoV-2; adults; behaviour change; coronavirus; determinants; movement behaviours; older adults; physical inactivity; sedentary time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19084,""
"Association between Breastfeeding Attitudes and Postpartum Depression among Mothers with Premature Infants during COVID-19 Pandemic","Breastfeeding is the best form of feeding for premature infants. However, mothers with premature delivery are frequently reported to be depressed, and this has been especially the case during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to measure the level of breastfeeding attitude and its association with postpartum depression among mothers with premature infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 248 mothers with a premature infant were observed in this cross-sectional study from the chosen NICUs of government hospitals in Selangor, Malaysia. The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Score (IIFAS) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, along with sociodemographic questionnaires, were used to obtain information on the mothers' attitudes towards breastfeeding and the risk of postpartum depression. A higher percentage of mothers had a positive attitude towards breastfeeding (64.9%), with a mean IIFAS score of 66.30 Ã‚Â± 6.92. Meanwhile, about 27% of mothers with premature infants were reported to have high risk of depressive symptoms. Mothers with a high risk of depression were less likely to have a positive attitude towards breastfeeding (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.199, 0.675) as compared to mothers with a low risk of depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). We found that there is an association between the risk of depression and the attitude towards breastfeeding.

"Smoking Behaviors, Mental Health, and Risk Perceptions during the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Mexican Adult Smokers","Mexico is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19. Studies have found that smoking behaviors have been impacted by the pandemic as well; however, results have varied across studies, and it remains unclear what is causing the changes. This study of an open cohort of smokers recruited from a consumer panel (<i>n</i> = 2753) examined changes in cigarettes per day (CPD), daily vs. non-daily smoking, recent quit attempts, perceived stress, depression, and perceived severity of COVID-19 at two points during the pandemic: March and July 2020. Differences in CPD between waves were estimated with Poisson regression using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Differences in perceived stress were estimated with linear regression using GEE, and differences in recent quit attempts, depression, and perceived severity of COVID-19 were estimated using separate logistic regression GEE models. Rates of depression were higher in July compared to March (AOR = 1.55, 95% C.I. 1.31-1.85), and the likelihood of recent quit attempt was lower in July compared to March (AOR = 0.85, 95% C.I. 0.75-0.98). There was no statistically significant change in CPD, daily smoking, or perceived stress. Perceived COVID-19 severity for oneself increased significantly (AOR: 1.24, 95% C.I. 1.02-1.52); however, the perceived COVID-19 severity for smokers remained constant. Our study suggests that as the COVID-19 pandemic expanded in Mexico, smoking frequency remained stable, and quit attempts decreased, even as adult smokers increasingly perceived infection with COVID-19 for themselves as severe. These results can aid in the development of health communication strategies to educate smokers about their risk for COVID-19, potentially capitalizing on concerns that stem from this syndemic of communicable and smoking-related non-communicable disease.","Loud, Gallegos-Carrillo, Barrientos-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, Arillo-SantillÃƒÂ¡n, Lambert, Zavala-Arciniega, Thrasher","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010905","20211023","COVID-19; risk perceptions; smoking; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19086,""
"The Interplay between Housing Environmental Attributes and Design Exposures and Psychoneuroimmunology Profile-An Exploratory Review and Analysis Paper in the Cancer Survivors' Mental Health Morbidity Context","Adult cancer survivors have an increased prevalence of mental health comorbidities and other adverse late-effects interdependent with mental illness outcomes compared with the general population. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) heralds an era of renewed call for actions to identify sustainable modalities to facilitate the constructs of cancer survivorship care and health care delivery through physiological supportive domestic spaces. Building on the concept of therapeutic architecture, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) indicators-with the central role in low-grade systemic inflammation-are associated with major psychiatric disorders and late effects of post-cancer treatment. Immune disturbances might mediate the effects of environmental determinants on behaviour and mental disorders. Whilst attention is paid to the non-objective measurements for examining the home environmental domains and mental health outcomes, little is gathered about the multidimensional effects on physiological responses. This exploratory review presents a first analysis of how addressing the PNI outcomes serves as a catalyst for therapeutic housing research. We argue the crucial component of housing in supporting the sustainable primary care and public health-based cancer survivorship care model, particularly in the psychopathology context. Ultimately, we illustrate a series of interventions aiming at how housing environmental attributes can trigger PNI profile changes and discuss the potential implications in the non-pharmacological treatment of cancer survivors and patients with mental morbidities.","Hernandez-Garcia, Chrysikou, Kalea","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010891","20211023","cancer survivorship; design for wellbeing; household environmental health; housing; inflammation biomarkers; mental health comorbidities; non-pharmacological interventions; psychoneuroimmunology; supportive domestic spaces; therapeutic architecture","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19087,""
"Generalized Anxiety as a Risk Factor for Dysfunctional Eating Behavior after Obesity Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Purpose:</b> The present study investigates the impact of obesity surgery on mental health (i.e., eating behavior and distress) during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred fifty-four participants were recruited via social media. One hundred fourteen (44.53%) of them were surgery candidates (waiting for obesity surgery), while 142 (55.46%) had already undergone surgery. Participants who underwent surgery were compared to participants that did not yet undergo surgery in terms of mental burden (depression and anxiety), as well as safety and eating behavior. Further moderation analyses attempted to identify risk factors for increased COVID-19-related dysfunctional eating behavior after surgery. <b>Results:</b> Participants who underwent surgery showed generally lower levels of depression and general anxiety on a trend level. Moderation analyses suggested that people with high levels of generalized anxiety actually show more dysfunctional COVID-19-specific eating behavior after obesity surgery. <b>Conclusion:</b> On a trend level, obesity surgery appears to attenuate symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression. Yet, surgery patients with high levels of generalized anxiety exhibit even higher levels of dysfunctional eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore particularly important to support people at risk.","Pfeiffer, Schweda, SchÃƒÂ¼ren, Niedergethmann, Steinbach, Rentrop, Robitzsch, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Teufel, Skoda, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010890","20211023","COVID-19; anxiety; eating disorder; mental health; obesity; obesity surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19088,""
"Socioeconomic Status and COVID-19-Related Psychological Panic in China: The Role of Trust in Government and Authoritarian Personality","Although the health and economic risks of COVID-19 may differ for higher- and lower-socioeconomic-status (SES) populations, some studies found that people with lower SES do not necessarily experience more psychological panic. In this research, we examine how SES is related with psychological panic during the COVID-19 pandemic using a large nationwide Chinese sample. Participants were 933 adults (mean age = 30.04, SD = 8.19) who completed an online questionnaire between 11 and 12 February 2020. Lower SES individuals have higher trust in government and thus experience less psychological panic, and the indirect effect of this trust suppresses the direct negative association between SES and psychological panic. In addition to this difference in trust in government between lower- and higher-status individuals, the indirect effect of the trust only exists among people with low (not high) authoritarian personalities. This study provides evidence that political trust may serve as a buffer, suppressing the negative association between SES and psychological panic; thus, policies and actions enhancing political trust are vital to support the mental health of individuals with lower SES during the pandemic, especially for citizens with low authoritarian personalities.","Xie, Wu, Zhang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010888","20211023","COVID-19; authoritarian personality; psychological panic; socioeconomic status; trust in government","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19089,""
"Challenges for Workplace Risk Assessment in Home Offices-Results from a Qualitative Descriptive Study on Working Life during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Latvia","Epidemiological restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have raised legal and practical questions related to the provision of workplace risk assessment in home offices of teleworkers. The objective of this qualitative study was to analyze practical experience of employers and occupational safety and health experts performing workplace risk assessment in Latvia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that employers have not sufficiently implemented their legal obligations related to workplace risk assessment which can result in an increased number of physical and mental health problems of teleworkers in the short term and in the future. Work from home has shown how different working conditions can be for the same type of work (office work); therefore, the promotion of personalized workplace risk assessment should be encouraged. Even if virtual workplace visits using photos and videos are not the traditional way the workplace risk assessment should be done, it is effective; workers who report that their employers assessed their working conditions report fewer health effects. The experience of workers in participation in workplace risk assessment for telework might change the level and role of worker participation in the management of health and safety hazards at work in general.","MatisÃ„Âne, Paegle, AkÃ…Â«lova, VanadziÃ…â€ Ã…Â¡","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010876","20211023","distance work; home assessment; home office; occupational health; occupational safety; risk assessment methods; telework; workplace risk assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19090,""
"The Relationships between Character Strengths and Subjective Wellbeing: Evidence from Greece under Lockdown during COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019. As long as this type of coronavirus was new, the main way for governments to avoid the spread of the infection was enforced quarantine. Besides public health protection, quarantine can have a psychological impact on the residents, with main symptoms being angst, anxiety, depressive, and PTSD symptoms. As it has been found that character strengths can promote subjective wellbeing, the purpose of the study was to examine this relationship under the new situation of quarantine in the Greek population in adults who were in quarantine for at least two weeks. The total sample consisted of 354 participants who were aged 18-72-years-old. A total of 263 participants were women (74.3%), 91 were men (25.7%), and 94.6% of them were highly educated. The sample was a convenience sample. The tools used were PANAS, PERMA and finally VIA-114GR. The data analysis was completed using SPSS software version 26.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2019. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp) and EQS 6.1 (Multivariate Software Inc.: Encino, CA, USA, 2006).

"The Relationship between Mental Health, Educational Burnout and Strategies for Coping with Stress among Students: A Cross-Sectional Study of Poland","This study sought to investigate the risk factors of poor psychosomatic health among students during the quarantine of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was conducted on-line, on a sample of 1978 respondents in Poland. The study was carried out towards the end of the summer 2020 semester. The questionnaire used in the study was designed so that it allows for the observation of the main risk factors which have an impact on the students' mental health. Variance analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used to determine the predictors of mental health problems. The results indicate that average and high levels of psychosomatic disorders were observed among 61% of respondents. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that an increase in the level of educational burnout, a decreased life satisfaction, and use of negative strategies of coping with stress, were accompanied by a deteriorated mental condition of students. Moreover, it was observed that female respondents scored higher on the scale of disorders in comparison to males.","DÃ…â€šugosz, Liszka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010827","20211023","COVID-19; Poland; coping; educational burnout; philosophy of education challenges; psychosomatic disorders; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19092,""
"Generalized Anxiety among Swiss Health Professions and Non-Health Professions Students: An Open Cohort Study over 14 Months in the COVID-19 Pandemic","To date, little is known about the long-term trajectory of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms in health professions (HP) students over the course of the pandemic. Like health professionals in general, HP students may have a significantly greater susceptibility to GAD symptoms due to their involvement in the health care system and the associated specific stressors and risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The HEalth in Students during the Corona pandemic study (HES-C) provided the opportunity to investigate the long-term course of GAD symptoms with eight measurement points over 14 months in 9380 HP and non-HP students in Switzerland between March 2020 and June 2021. We employed logistic regression models with clustered sandwich standard errors to estimate unadjusted and adjusted prevalence of GAD symptoms. In the full model, we adjusted for age, gender, nationality, social status, social support, self-efficacy, and COVID-19 symptoms in the past 4 weeks. At baseline, the estimated adjusted GAD symptom prevalence was 17.6% (95% CI = 14.4-20.7) in HP students and 24.4% (95% CI = 22.3-26.5) in their peers. With the peak of the second SARS-CoV-2 infection wave in October/November 2020, GAD symptom prevalence substantially increased and then remained stable over time, despite changes in the epidemiological situation and its associated containment measures. At the last follow-up in June 2021, GAD symptom prevalence in HP and non-HP students was 22.9% (95% CI = 16.3-29.5) and 36.9% (95% CI = 32.9-40.9), respectively. Absolute differences in GAD symptom prevalence between student groups over all eight measurement points ranged from 6.2% to 14.9% (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Non-HP students are identified as a specifically vulnerable group. Accordingly, target group-specific public health campaigns and interventions should be developed with the aim to strengthen their resources, reducing GAD symptoms, and preventing chronification.","Volken, Zysset, Amendola, von Wyl, Dratva, On Behalf Of The Hes-C Research Group","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010833","20211023","COVID-19; generalized anxiety disorder; health professions; mental health; students; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19093,""
"Comparison of the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable and Non-Vulnerable Groups: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies","Vulnerable populations may be more vulnerable to mental health problems posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A systematic review was performed to compare the mental health impact of COVID-19 between vulnerable and non-vulnerable groups. Five electronic databases were searched for observational studies reporting the psychological outcomes of both vulnerable populations and healthy controls during the COVID-19 era. The primary outcomes are the severity of depression and anxiety, and secondary outcomes include other aspects of mental health such as stress or sleep disturbance. Meta-analysis was performed for the severity of mental health symptoms, and the results were presented as standardized mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. A total of 25 studies were included. According to the findings, the elderly generally experienced significantly lower levels of psychological symptoms including depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. Pregnant women, patients with chronic diseases, and patients with pre-existing severe mental disorders showed mixed results according to each mental health outcome. The results indicate that vulnerable groups have been affected differently in the COVID-19 era. Though the insufficient number and heterogeneity of included studies leave the results inconclusive, our findings may contribute to identifying priorities of mental health needs among various vulnerable populations and allocating health resources with efficiency.","Nam, Nam, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010830","20211023","COVID-19; coronavirus; mental health; pandemic; vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19094,""
"Fears, Reassurance, and Milestones: A Twitter Analysis around World Prematurity Day during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Preterm birth (birth &lt;37 completed weeks' gestation) is common, affecting 10.6% of live births globally (nearly 15 million babies per year). Having a new baby admitted to a neonatal unit often triggers stress and anxiety for parents. This paper seeks to explore experiences of preterm birth via Twitter. The intermingling of COVID-19 restrictions and World Prematurity Day allows for an understanding of both the additional stresses incurred as a consequence of the pandemic and the more ""everyday"" experiences in the NICU and beyond. The content analysis of the data included 3161 tweets. Three themes were identified: 1. COVID-19 was not the only trauma; 2. Raising awareness, especially World Prematurity Day; and, 3. Baby milestones. These themes highlight the multi-level challenges faced by parents of premature babies and the healthcare professionals involved in their care. The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions imposed on parents' contact with their babies have resulted in immense emotional strain for families. The reported COVID-19 pandemic ""baby blind spot"" appears to particularly impact this group of babies.

"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Psychiatric Symptoms among Swiss Elite Athletes during the First Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated first lockdown measures may have had a relevant impact on the mental health of competitive athletes. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of various mental health issues in a Swiss elite athletes' cohort during the first lockdown of the pandemic, and to assess their association with different potential risk factors. Elite athletes from different disciplines were interviewed during the first lockdown in spring 2020 by means of an online questionnaire on symptoms of existing anxieties, depression and sleep disorders, as well as on training circumstances and physical performance before and during the lockdown. Additionally, the economic situation, secondary occupations and current physical health problems were surveyed. A total of 203 (92 female, 111 male) athletes met the inclusion criteria and participated in the survey. Training volume and intensity decreased significantly during lockdown from 3.1 to 2.7 h/day. Financial existential fears increased and were associated with higher training volumes and higher trait anxiety scores. Depressive symptoms and insomnia were present but not exceptionally frequent during the lockdown. Depressive symptoms were associated with higher anxiety scores, higher insomnia severity scores, lower training intensity and worse coping with the measures taken by the authorities against the pandemic. Changes in training and daily habits due to the first lockdown may have affected the mental health of elite athletes. Longitudinal studies should, however, further investigate the long-term effects of the pandemic on mental health.","FrÃƒÂ¶hlich, Imboden, Iff, SpÃƒÂ¶rri, Quednow, Scherr, Seifritz, Claussen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010780","20211023","SARS-CoV-2; competitive sports; mental problems and disorders; sports medicine; sports psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19096,""

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Personality: Agreeable People Are More Stressed by the Feeling of Missing","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain it have substantial consequences for many people, resulting in negative effects on individual well-being and mental health. In the current study, we examined whether individual changes in perceived stress relative to pre-pandemic levels depended on differences in behavior, appraisal, and experience of pandemic-related constraints. In addition, we tested whether this potential relationship was moderated by personality traits. We conducted an online survey during the end of the first lockdown in Germany in spring 2020, and assessed pandemic-related individual consequences as well as perceived stress. These data were related to the big five personality traits and to ratings of perceived stress obtained from the same participants in a study conducted before the outbreak of the pandemic, using the same standardized stress questionnaires. There was no overall increase, but a large interindividual variety in perceived stress relative to pre-pandemic levels. Increased stress was associated especially with strong feelings of missing. This relationship was moderated by agreeableness, with more agreeable people showing a higher association of the feeling of missing and the increase of perceived stress. In addition, openness and conscientiousness were positively correlated with an increase in stress. The results highlight the importance of considering personality and individual appraisals when examining the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived stress and well-being.","Getzmann, Digutsch, Kleinsorge","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010759","20211023","COVID-19 pandemic; longitudinal analysis; perceived stress; personality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19098,""
"Leveraging HIV Care Infrastructures for Integrated Chronic Disease and Pandemic Management in Sub-Saharan Africa","In Sub-Saharan Africa, communicable and other tropical infectious diseases remain major challenges apart from the continuing HIV/AIDS epidemic. Recognition and prevalence of non-communicable diseases have risen throughout Africa, and the reimagining of healthcare delivery is needed to support communities coping with not only with HIV, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, but also cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression. Many non-communicable diseases can be prevented or treated with low-cost interventions, yet implementation of such care has been limited in the region. In this Perspective piece, we argue that deployment of an integrated service delivery model is an urgent next step, propose a South African model for integration, and conclude with recommendations for next steps in research and implementation. An approach that is inspired by South African experience would build on existing HIV-focused infrastructure that has been developed by Ministries of Health with strong support from the U.S. President's Emergency Response for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. An integrated chronic healthcare model holds promise to sustainably deliver infectious disease and non-communicable disease care.

This qualitative study examines Australian experiences related to healthcare access during the early months of the pandemic. The study aimed to identify key areas of concern as well as opportunities for services to prevent, manage and treat health concerns when normal access was disrupted. Fifty-nine semi-structured interviews were analysed. Participants were interviewed between August and December in 2020 over telephone or Zoom and were located across Australia. Rapid identification of themes with an audio recordings technique was used to generate themes from the data. Participants described a variety of influences on their health-seeking behaviours, resulting in decisions to delay care or being unable to reach care. Many individuals accessed health services via telehealth and offered a range of perceptions and views on its effectiveness and appropriateness. The findings illustrate that maintenance of health and access to healthcare and psychosocial support were compromised for some individuals, leading to negative impacts on both mental and physical health.

"Are Sleep Problems Related to Psychological Distress in Healthy Aging during the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Review","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, characterized by home confinement and other restrictive measures to reduce the spread of the infection, led to significant changes in people's habits and lifestyle. One of the most common problems is the worsening of sleep quality or quantity, which could have negative effects on psychological wellbeing, particularly in older adults. The purposes of the present literature review considering healthy aging subjects are (a) to examine the existing research on sleep alterations during the current pandemic and (b) to highlight possible relationships between sleep problems and psychological distress. A systematic search strategy was implemented according to PRISMA guidelines in the international literature online databases, up to 1 July 2021. After identification and screening phases, 11 articles were included in this review. The studies found possible associations between sleep problems and mood changes-particularly in terms of depression and anxiety. In addition, altered sleep patterns seemed to be related to changes in individual aspects, lifestyle, and attitudes adopted by older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, the pandemic could affect the sleep and psychological wellbeing of the older population, even in healthy aging.","Cipriani, Bartoli, Amanzio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010676","20211023","COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; cognitive decline; depressive symptoms; healthy aging; psychological distress; sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19101,""
"Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Self-Isolation on Students and Staff in Higher Education: A Qualitative Study","This qualitative study explored the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation and social restriction measures on university students, through the perspectives of both students and the staff supporting them. The study comprised 11 focus groups (students) and 26 individual interviews (staff) at a higher education institution in England during a period of national lockdown (January-March 2021). Participants were university students (<i>n</i> = 52) with self-isolation experiences and university staff (<i>n</i> = 26) with student-facing support roles. Focus group and interview data were combined and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Four themes emerged: 'Adaptation during the pandemic', 'Practical, environmental, and emotional challenges of self-isolating', 'Social factors and their impact on COVID-19 testing and self-isolation adherence', and 'Supporting self-isolation'. Students and staff struggled with the imposed restrictions and shift to online education. Students found it difficult to adapt to new expectations for university life and reported missing out on professional and social experiences. Students and staff noted concerns about the impact of online teaching on educational outcomes. Students endorsed varied emotional responses to self-isolation; some felt unaffected whilst others experienced lowered mood and loneliness. Students were motivated by pro-social attitudes; campaigns targeting these factors may encourage continued engagement in protective behaviours. Staff struggled to manage their increased workloads delivering support for self-isolating students. Universities must consider the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student wellbeing and educational attainment. Greater support should be provided for staff during transitional periods, with ongoing monitoring of workforce stress levels warranted.","Knight, Carlisle, O'Connor, Briggs, Fothergill, Al-Oraibi, Yildirim, Morling, Corner, Ball, Denning, Vedhara, Blake","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010675","20211023","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; focus groups; mental health; qualitative; semi-structured interviews; social isolation; staff; students; workforce; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19102,""
"Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 on Healthcare Trainees and Perceptions towards a Digital Wellbeing Support Package","We explore the impact of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of healthcare trainees, and the perceived value of a digital support package to mitigate the psychological impacts of the pandemic (PoWerS Study). This mixed-methods study includes (i) exposure to a digital support package; (ii) participant survey to assess wellbeing, perceptions of work and intervention fidelity; (iii) semi-structured qualitative interviews. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed, data were handled and analysed using principles of thematic framework analysis. Participants are 42 health and medical trainees (9M, 33F) from 13 higher education institutions in the UK, studying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey findings showed high satisfaction with healthcare training (92.8%), but low wellbeing (61.9%), moderate to high perceived stressfulness of training (83.3%), and high presenteeism (50%). Qualitative interviews generated 3 over-arching themes, and 11 sub-themes. The pandemic has impacted negatively on emotional wellbeing of trainees, yet mental health is not well promoted in some disciplines, and provision of pastoral support is variable. Disruption to academic studies and placements has reduced perceived preparedness for future clinical practice. Regular check-ins, and wellbeing interventions will be essential to support the next generation health and care workforce, both in higher education and clinical settings. The digital support package was perceived to be accessible, comprehensive, and relevant to healthcare trainees, with high intervention fidelity. It is a useful tool to augment longer-term provision of psychological support for healthcare trainees, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blake, Mahmood, Dushi, Yildirim, Gay","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010647","20211023","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; digital; healthcare; pandemic; psychological wellbeing; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19103,""
"Teaching and Practicing Cognitive-Behavioral and Mindfulness Skills in a Web-Based Platform among Older Adults through the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an acceleration in the development of web-based interventions to alleviate related mental health impacts. The current study explored the effects of a short-term digital group intervention aimed at providing cognitive behavioral and mindfulness tools and skills to reduce loneliness and depression and to increase social support among older adults in Israel. This pilot randomized controlled trial included community-dwelling older adults (<i>n</i> = 82; aged between 65-90 years; 80% female) who were randomized either to an intervention group (<i>n</i> = 64) or a wait-list control group (<i>n</i> = 18). The intervention included seven online sessions, over 3.5 weeks. Depression, loneliness, and social support measures were administered at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression in the intervention group, with results maintained at one-month follow-up. Loneliness levels also significantly decreased post-intervention; however, this benefit was not maintained at one-month follow-up. Social support slightly increased both post-intervention and 1-month follow-up-but these changes were not statistically significant. There were no overall changes for the wait-list control group. Our intervention provided promising evidence regarding the effectiveness of an online group intervention to alleviate mental health effects and to promote the coping of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. This relatively simple model can be effectively utilized by communities globally to help connect lonely and isolated older inhabitants, both during the pandemic and in more routine times.","Shapira, Cohn-Schwartz, Yeshua-Katz, Aharonson-Daniel, Clarfield, Sarid","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010563","20211023","COVID-19; depression; loneliness; randomized controlled trial; social support; web-based group intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19104,""
"Influence of Confinement Due to COVID-19 on Physical Activity and Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Its Relationship with Self-Esteem in Pre-Adolescent Students","Regular physical activity and good adherence to the Mediterranean diet are important for improving physical and mental health. Confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a lack of exercise and poor nutrition. Preadolescent mental health, specifically regarding self-esteem, may have been affected. This is particularly relevant between the ages of 10 and 14. The influence of total confinement due to COVID-19 on physical activity and Mediterranean diet adherence, and its relationship with self-esteem was studied in third-year primary school students and first-year secondary school students in the provinces of Granada and Malaga, Spain. Validated questionnaires were administered to evaluate physical activity (PAQ-C), Mediterranean diet adherence (KIDMED) and self-esteem (Rosenberg Scale). In the same way, the FAS III test was used to evaluate socioeconomic status and an ad-hoc questionnaire was developed to collect sociodemographic data and evaluate screen time. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 25.0 statistical software. During the period of total confinement, statistically significant differences were found between examined variables, according to sex, school year, school type, socioeconomic status and whether or not the participant had contracted COVID-19. These data were compared with those collected during a previous time period. Those with a low socioeconomic status and girls were most affected.","Villodres, GarcÃƒÂ­a-PÃƒÂ©rez, Corpas, Muros","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8100848","20211023","COVID-19; diet; physical activity; self-esteem; socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19105,""
"Trends in Coffee and Tea Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Over the last two years, many countries have enforced confinement to limit both the spread of COVID-19 and the demand for medical care. Confinement has resulted in a disruption of work routines, boredom, depression, and changes in eating habits, among them consumption of coffee and tea. Following six databases, we examined articles tracking consumption of these beverages. Out of 472 articles, including 23 beverage entries, 13 matched our criteria. While no clear trend in coffee consumption during the coronavirus pandemic emerged (7 of 13 studies indicated an increase, accounting for 53.8%), tea consumption clearly increased (70% versus 30%). Considering the global health emergency continuum, more research is needed to better understand the paths underlying food choices and the ways those changes may influence health outcomes, including those related to COVID-19 disease.","Castellana, De Nucci, De Pergola, Di Chito, Lisco, Triggiani, Sardone, Zupo","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10102458","20211023","COVID-19; beverage consumption; coffee; dietary behavior; tea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19106,""
"The Differential Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Sleep Quality, Insomnia, Depression, Stress, and Anxiety among Late Adolescents and Elderly in Italy","The restraining measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak deeply affected the general population's sleep health and psychological status. The current literature proposes young and older people as two particularly at-risk groups. However, the differential impact of the lockdown period in these specific age categories needs to be disentangled. Through a web-based survey adopting validated questionnaires, we evaluated and compared sleep quality/habits, insomnia, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms of Italian late adolescents (<i>n</i> = 670; mean age Ã‚Â± SD, 19.38 Ã‚Â± 0.74, 18-20 years) and elderly (<i>n</i> = 253; 68.18 Ã‚Â± 2.79, 65-75 years). Young respondents reported more severe insomnia symptoms, worse subjective sleep quality, longer sleep latency, higher daytime dysfunction, and a more prevalent disruption of sleep habits (bedtime, get-up time, nap) than the elderly. On the other hand, older participants showed shorter sleep duration, lower habitual sleep efficiency, and greater use of sleep medications. Finally, the younger population displayed higher levels of depression and perceived stress. Our findings indicate that the lockdown period had more pervasive repercussions on sleep and the mental health of late adolescents. The implementation of supportive strategies is encouraged for this vulnerable population group.","Amicucci, Salfi, D'Atri, Viselli, Ferrara","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11101336","20211023","COVID-19 pandemic; elderly; late adolescents; lockdown; mental health; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19107,""
"Stigmatization and psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on frontline healthcare Workers in Nigeria: a qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great toll on global health. Frontline healthcare workers (FHCW) directly involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have faced some physical and psychological challenges. This study explored the stigma and traumatic experiences of the FHCW during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. We recruited twenty FHCW directly involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients through purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted for all participants, and qualitative analysis of data was done using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Five themes identified were: Early stage of the pandemic (fear, anxiety, public fright, other countries repatriating their citizens, the socio-economic impact of the pandemic and a call to duty for the FHCW); working with COVID-19 patients (excitement on patients recovery and duty stress); psychological, mental and emotional trauma; stigmatization (stigmatized by colleagues, family, friends or their residential communities, reasons for stigmatization which were fear of infection, limited knowledge of the virus and working at the isolation centre and the effect of stigma); and recommendations (education and awareness creation, government showing more care towards the FHCW and provision of health insurance for FHCW to take care of those that get infected in the line of duty). Stigmatization has proven to be a major challenge for FHCW in conducting their duties. The psychological impact experienced by FHCW may affect the quality of the services rendered by these workers. The study reveals the need of education and awareness creation in the ongoing pandemic. There is a need for the government and society to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of FHCW.","Kwaghe, Kwaghe, Habib, Kwaghe, Ilesanmi, Ekele, Umeokonkwo, Balogun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03540-4","20211023","COVID-19; COVID-19 isolation Centre; Coronavirus; Frontline healthcare workers; Mental health; Nigeria; Stigmatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19108,""
"Acute pericarditis, Graves' disease, and thymic hyperplasia: a case report","Acute pericarditis as a sign of mediastinal mass is rare and aetiological diagnosis can be challenging without adequate imaging. An 18-year-old woman came to our attention describing acute sharp chest pain radiated to the left arm, exacerbated with supine positioning and attenuated while sitting or leaning forward. The electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, with sinus tachycardia. Cardiac biomarkers and D-dimer were negative; echocardiography showed no abnormalities and the absence of pericardial effusion. Her blood work revealed no sign of inflammation or bacterial infection (PCR and procalcitonin were normal); thyroid-stimulating hormone plasma levels were suppressed, showing decompensated thyrotoxicosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19, and Adenovirus tests were normal. Her past medical history was silent, apart from Grave's disease on treatment with methimazole. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and showed the presence of slightly increased density pericardial effusion, with a maximum thickness of 15 mm in the upper mediastinum. Finally, cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) identified a mass of 73 Ãƒâ€” 51 mm located in the upper mediastinum. The mass was subsequently biopsed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and the histological analysis showed thymic hyperplasia. This case shows the importance of an adequate clinical suspicion of thymic hyperplasia in the context of acute pericarditis symptoms and known Graves' disease. In this case, a negative chest CT finding may not be sufficient to rule out the diagnosis and cardiac MR imaging is necessary.","Acquaro, Breviario, Greco, Ghio","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab392","20211023","Acute pericarditis; Cardiac MR; Case report; GravesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; Thymic hyperplasia; disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19109,""
"Child-Focused Mental Health Interventions for Disasters Recovery: A Rapid Review of Experiences to Inform Return-to-School Strategies After COVID-19","There is a worldwide need for mental health interventions to address the mental health needs of children under 12 who are returning to school in the post-COVID-19 environment. The basic characteristics of child-focused, post-crisis interventions are currently unknown, but they are essential for developing high-quality, expedient RTC programs. We conducted a rapid systematic review, via established PICO methodology, to appraise the characteristics of such interventions. We queried databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, ERIC) for English and Spanish publications describing mental health interventions to reduce mental health symptoms and sequelae among children exposed to disasters and other community crises. We described the following characteristics: type of intervention, length, number of sessions, number of staff delivering the intervention, and other characteristics. A total of 18 original articles met the inclusion criteria: 11 correspond to a controlled trial type of study and 15 addressed PTSD after disaster or crisis situations. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was the most common intervention type, school-based/related interventions were the most common method, and five articles described an important role of teachers as mediators of therapy.","GÃƒÂ³mez, Basagoitia, Burrone, Rivas, SolÃƒÂ­s-Soto, Dy Juanco, Alley","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.713407","20211023","COVID-19; children; crisis and disaster; interventions; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19110,""
"Understanding the Mediating Role of Anxiety and Depression on the Relationship Between Perceived Stress and Sleep Quality Among Health Care Workers in the COVID-19 Response","There is an increasing amount of evidence exploring the adverse effects of perceived stress or anxiety and depression independently on sleep quality during the COVID-19 outbreak, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of anxiety and depression as a potential mediator between perceived stress and sleep quality among health care workers. Data were collected through an online survey using the snowball sampling method and comprised 588 current health care workers in Zhejiang and Hubei provinces, China, from February to March 2020. We administered the Sleep Quality Questionnaire (SQQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) and the sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related characteristics questionnaire. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the direct and indirect relationships between perceived stress, anxiety and depression, and sleep quality. The average scores for sleep quality and perceived stress were 16.01 (95% CI [15.40, 16.57]) and 15.46 (95% CI [15.05, 15.87]), respectively. The positive rates of anxiety and depression symptom tests were 9.86% and 10.37%, respectively. The SEM results indicated that the original relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality was beta = 0.52 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and reduced to beta = 0.25 (<i>P</i> = 0.045) while introducing anxiety and depression as mediating variables. Perceived stress was positively associated with anxiety and depression (beta = 0.78, <i>P</i> = 0.014), and anxiety and depression were positively associated with sleep quality (beta = 0.42, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Poor sleep quality and high perceived stress were common during the COVID-19 crisis. Reducing perceived stress could help reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, thereby improving sleep quality among health care workers. In an attempt to promote psychological resources, we should perhaps take multiple measures, including personal tailored intervention and organizational humanistic concern.","Luo, Fei, Gong, Sun, Meng","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S313258","20211023","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health care workers; perceived stress; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19111,""
"The Relationship Between Social Support and Internet Addiction Among Chinese Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multiple Mediation Model of Resilience and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms","Lockdowns and online homeschooling during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic have significantly increased Internet use and adolescents' risk of developing or reinforcing related addictive behaviors. While various theoretical propositions have suggested that social support, resilience, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms can predict Internet addiction, no study has yet examined the combined influence of these factors on Internet addiction. This study therefore aimed to investigate the mediating roles of resilience and PTSD symptoms in the relationship between perceived social support and the Internet addiction of Chinese adolescents in the context of COVID-19. This study included 2544 adolescents living in the south China city of Qinzhou. The participants completed a self-report questionnaire one week before their return to classes after homeschooling. To examine whether resilience and PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship between social support and Internet addiction, we performed serial mediation analysis using the Model 6 PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2013). Social support was negatively and directly associated with Internet addiction and indirectly via resilience, PTSD symptoms, and by the multiple mediation of resilience to PTSD symptoms. The results of this study suggest that, to address Internet addiction, it may be more effective to focus not on addictive behaviors themselves but on individuals' existing mental health. It is important to provide adequate social support to improve the resilience of adolescents, thereby reducing PTSD symptoms and Internet addiction.","Cui, Chi","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S305510","20211023","COVID-19 pandemic; Internet addiction; PTSD symptoms; adolescents; resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19112,""
"Investigating Binge-Watching Adverse Mental Health Outcomes During Covid-19 Pandemic: Moderating Role of Screen Time for Web Series Using Online Streaming","Watching multiple episodes using streaming services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Youku, has become widespread in recent years. While much attention has been paid to binge-watching, there is, however, a dearth of research on binge-watching and its adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, less attention has been paid to understanding the multiple influences of binge-watching on binge-watchers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the past studies on this topic mainly underscored the individual's motivations for binge-watching. Also, past studies were limited and inconclusive as they mostly espoused only the underpinning adverse effects of binge-watching without looking into the association between binge-watching and screen time for web series through online streaming services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study sought to fill this gap by probing the association between binge-watching and psychological aftereffects. The study employed a cross-sectional research design vis-ÃƒÂ -vis the survey method. A sample of 1089 adult respondents was collected through an online administrated questionnaire. The findings of this study demonstrated that extensive binge-watching is an antecedent of stress, loneliness, insomnia, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, it was found that screen time on binge-watching could intensify these adverse effects of binge-watching. Interestingly, the moderating effect of screen time on binge-watching was found to be insignificant for stress and loneliness. The findings of this study suggest that binge-watching correlates with psychological and mental health symptoms including stress, loneliness, insomnia, depression and anxiety. Hence, this study suggests that consumption of web series through online streaming services related literacy interventions are imperative to help the audience become critical about online streaming content and its comparison to the real social world.","Raza, Yousaf, Sohail, Munawar, Ogadimma, Siang","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S328416","20211023","COVID-19; anxiety; binge-watching; depression; insomnia; loneliness and online addiction; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","",19113,""
"Mental Health in Hospitalised COVID 19 Patients in Quarantine During Second Wave in a South Indian Private Teaching Hospital","Covid 19 lockdown measures were taken all of a sudden during the devastating second wave in India, when there was a considerable loss and suffering in the country. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental well-being globally. To assess the prevalence and evaluate risk factors of depression, insomnia or sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation among covid 19 positive patients admitted in covid wards with mild-to-moderate disease. A total of 635 hospitalised patients who were covid-19 positive were requested to fill an online quality of life pre-validated questionnaire comprising of 4 sections - the sociodemographic information section, health care assessment related to depression symptoms, insomnia assessment and assessment of suicidal ideation. The survey comprised of pre-validated questions on sociodemographics, knowledge of covid 19, fear of covid 19, insomnia, feeling of sadness, depression, feeling of rejection and suicidal ideation among the covid 19 positive inpatients in quarantine due to mild or moderate covid 19 disease. The prevalence of depression and insomnia or sleep disturbances after being diagnosed as covid 19 positive and hospitalized was nearly 40% and 28.8%, respectively, among the inpatients. Depression was significantly observed in female group (p &lt; 0.001), unmarried or separated individuals (p &lt; 0.001), housewives (p &lt; 0.001) and patients with comorbidities (p &lt; 0.001). Insomnia was more likely to be present in elderly covid positive patients (p &lt; 0.001) and separated or divorced group of participants (p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 5% of the total covid 19 positive patients participated in this study, and it was significantly observed among separated or divorced patients, cancer patients, patients from suburban residence and among graduates (p &lt; 0.001).
