"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19","Background Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses  Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as â€œcoronaphobiaâ€, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society  So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19  Methods Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- â€œCOVID-19â€, â€œSARS-CoV2â€, â€œPandemicâ€, â€œPsychologyâ€, â€œPsychosocialâ€, â€œPsychitryâ€, â€œmarginalizedâ€, â€œtelemedicineâ€, â€œmental healthâ€, â€œquarantineâ€, â€œinfodemicâ€, â€œsocial mediaâ€ andâ€ â€œinternetâ€  Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context  Results Disease itself multitude by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run  These have been fueled by an â€œinfodemicâ€ spread via different platforms social media  Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported  Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD  Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children&#039;s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress  The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention  Conclusion For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders  Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated  Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary","Dubey, Souvik; Biswas, Payel; Ghosh, Ritwik; Chatterjee, Subhankar; Dubey, Mahua Jana; Chatterjee, Subham; Lahiri, Durjoy; Lavie, Carl J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1457,""

"Iran Without Mandatory Quarantine and with Social Distancing Strategy Against Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)","The new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes (COVID-19) have had an impact on the public&#039;s health and the global economy  At this writing, this infection has involved more than 210 countries with more than 2,800,000 confirmed infected cases and nearly 200,000 deaths  The United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the UK, China, and Iran have reported the highest number of confirmed cases 1,2 In Iran, on February 19, 2020, 2 patients in Qom city were confirmed as COVID-19 positive  The disease spread rapidly in adjacent provinces, including Tehran, Markazi, Isfahan, and Semnan, and shortly thereafter in all 31 provinces of the country and most cities and towns  To date (April 12, 2020), according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, the total number of positive infected people has reached 71,686, with 4,474 deaths 3 In the early days of the outbreak, which primarily affected Qom and Guilan provinces, Iran could have instituted quarantines to slow the spread of COVID-19  However, as time passed and the disease spread, quarantine proved more difficult to implement because of the vastness of the affected areas  As a result, Iran has not implemented forced quarantine on provinces and cities  Meanwhile, other countries such as China, Italy, and the United States have used this strategy  China locked down whole cities, and Italy imposed restrictions throughout the country  In the United States, thousands of people have been subjected to legally enforceable quarantines or are in â€œself-quarantine â€4 Quarantines and travel bans are often the first response to highly transmissible diseases;they may delay the introduction of the disease to a country or area or they may delay the peak of an epidemic in an area where local transmission is ongoing, or both  However, if not implemented properly, quarantine may also create additional sources of contamination and dissemination of the disease as well as significant mental health and security problems 5 On February 23, 2020, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran, by the order of the president and with the approval of the Supreme Leader of Iran, the National Committee to Combat Corona was formed  The members of this committee are the ministers of health (who serves as the head), science, interior, education, and culture;the head of the national radio and television;the spokesman of the government;and the disciplinary and armed forces commanders  This committee makes all the important decisions regarding the fight against COVID-19 and the imposition of restrictions and closures 6 From the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Iran has focused on social distancing, rather than mandatory quarantine, to slow the spread of this infection, using measures such as the closure of schools and universities, mosques, shrines, and Friday (Jummah) prayers;canceling sport events;and closing government jobs, with the exception of essential jobs 7 There were no mandatory restrictions on travel and commuting  People have been encouraged to voluntarily self-quarantine and stay home, and limited thermal testing has been done at the entrances to some cities and suspicious cases have been identified, while stricter measures were expected to be in place to reduce travel near the New Year&#039;s holidays  With the exception of the closure of sightseeing attractions and tourism centers, some hotels, and some restaurants, no further action was taken to prevent Nowruz trips, but the reduction in travel rates was significant compared to previous years  According to the statistics provided by the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, rail travel has decreased by 94%, public road travel by bus by 75%, and air travel by 70%, and personal road travel also has decreased significantly 8 Finally, on March 26, 2020, the National Committee to Combat Corona decided to take stricter measures  In addition to previous measures, they decided to close down shopping malls and big markets, sport places and swimming pools, parks, and museums  The National Committee also decided to take stricter measures to reduce travel: interprovincial car traffic was banned (relief cars, police, cargo, foods, and fuel not subject to restrictions) and transport by air, train, and intercity bus were restricted, while fully implementing health protocols 9Figure 1 shows Iran&#039;s measures to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 from February 1 to April 11 [truncated]","Abdi, Milad; Mirzaei, Rasoul","https://doi.org/10.1089/HS.2020.0041","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1461,""

"The management of surgical patients during the coronavirus dieases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised several issues regarding the management of surgical patients. The aim of the current study was to clarify the management of oncologic and surgical patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers&#039; safety, were included. The last date of research for this study was April 4,Â 2020. RESULTS: We analyzed 28 papers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and computed tomography scans were considered useful for cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Cancer patients and surgical patients were confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and negative outcome. To guarantee adequate care to these patients, while minimizing the risk for infection, the early postponing of elective surgery, the creation of COVID-free facilities and the identification of COVID- dedicated operating theaters and teams have been proposed. The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer. Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting. Also, clinicians should value the importance of self-protection and mental health care.","Spolverato, Gaya; Capelli, Giulia; Restivo, Angelo; Bao, Quoc Riccardo; Pucciarelli, Salvatore; Pawlik, Timothy M; Gronchi, Alessandro","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.04.036","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1471,""

"Changes in Provision of Psychotherapy in the Early Weeks of the COVID-19 Lockdown in Austria","Reducing personal contacts is a central measure against the spreading of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  This troubles mental health, but also mental health care as treatments usually take place in personal contact and switching to remote treatments might be necessary in times of COVID-19  The present study investigated the question how the provision of psychotherapy changed in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and whether there were differences between the four therapeutic orientations eligible in Austria (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral)  Psychotherapists (N = 1547) completed an online survey  They entered their number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via Internet) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria as well as (retrospectively) in the months before  The number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (on average 81%;p &amp;lt;0 001), whereas the number of patients treated on average per week via telephone and via Internet increased (on average 979% and 1561%;both p &amp;lt;0 001)  Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (p &amp;lt;0 001)  No differences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged  Results imply an undersupply of psychotherapy in the COVID-19 lockdown and that further changes are necessary to cover the increased need for timely psychotherapy in times of COVID-19","Probst, Thomas; Stippl, Peter; Pieh, Christoph","https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH17113815","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1474,""
"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","Background COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally  We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020  We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death  Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19  Results COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety  Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety  Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity  However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity  Limitations Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country  Conclusions Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use  While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use","Elhai, Jon D.; Yang, Haibo; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J.

"My journey in coping reseach and practice: The impetus and the relevance","My journey in the field of stress and coping began in the mid 1980s when I was researching the rather new field of childhood depression  It was a relatively under-explored field, and as a clinical and educational psychologist it was becoming increasingly apparent that there were concerns of young people, with some of these reflected in their experiences of sadness and despair  However, as I researched and measured the depression construct, I became aware of despair as a growing phenomenon, with an increased focus and emphasis on stress, anxiety and depression  In time, the statistics would bear out the concerns, as one in four young people have identified as being or are likely to be depressed in their lifetime in some Western communities like Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom (WHO, )  Given the growing â€˜ill healthâ€™ of our Western communities, something had to change  In the 1980s, young people were concerned about their future with the fear of nuclear war  As I was writing this invited retrospective in late 2019, there were widespread concerns about global warming, and in the first half of 2020 concerns arising from the pandemic of COVID-19 are dominating  Coping theory research and practice can make a significant contribution to how we cope with our world in general and the specifics of our lives in particular  This article reports a body of work in the field of coping to illustrate the value of the core constructs and their applications in diverse settings providing opportunities for helpful adaptation and development in the face of whatever circumstances arise","Frydenberg, Erica","https://doi.org/10.1017/edp.2020.9","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1478,""
"COVID-19 encephalopathy masquerading as substance withdrawal","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, is the virus responsible for the current pandemic known as COVID-19. We report the case of a patient with past medical history of substance abuse who presented with suspected drug overdose. He was agitated and altered in the emergency room and he was treated with benzodiazepines for his agitation. He was admitted for substance withdrawal, however his encephalopathy did not improve and he developed choreiform movements. Metabolic, infectious, and rheumatologic workup was negative until he subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. An MRI was performed which showed multiple focal enhancing lesions primarily affecting the bilateral medial putamen and left cerebellum along with subcortical lesions suggesting COVID-19 encephalopathy. He was given glucocorticoids and his mentation and choreiform movements improved. While neurologic presentations are increasingly becoming more common, encephalopathy with choreiform movements appears to be a rare manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, and may be due to direct viral invasion or, more likely, autoimmune mediated toxicity precipitated by the initial viral infection This article is protected by copyright.

"Flattening the Mental Health Curve: COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders are Associated with Alterations in Mental Health Search Behavior in the United States","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to dramatic changes globally in persons&#039; everyday lives. To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale. METHODS: In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, eleven of the fifty states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the U.S. allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. The current manuscript examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020 across each state and Washington D.C. Specifically, the current manuscript examines differential change in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.","Jacobson, Nicholas; Lekkas, Damien; Price, George; Heinz, Michael V; Song, Minkeun; O&#039;Malley, A James; Barr, Paul J","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19347","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1480,""

"Airborne Aerosol Generation During Endonasal Procedures in the Era of COVID-19: Risks and Recommendations","OBJECTIVE: In the era of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of infectious airborne aerosol generation during otolaryngologic procedures has been an area of increasing concern. The objective of this investigation was to quantify airborne aerosol production under clinical and surgical conditions and examine efficacy of mask mitigation strategies. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of airborne aerosol generation during surgical and clinical simulation. SETTING: Cadaver laboratory and clinical examination room. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Airborne aerosol quantification with an optical particle sizer was performed in real time during cadaveric simulated endoscopic surgical conditions, including hand instrumentation, microdebrider use, high-speed drilling, and cautery. Aerosol sampling was additionally performed in simulated clinical and diagnostic settings. All clinical and surgical procedures were evaluated for propensity for significant airborne aerosol generation. RESULTS: Hand instrumentation and microdebridement did not produce detectable airborne aerosols in the range of 1 to 10 Âµm. Suction drilling at 12,000 rpm, high-speed drilling (4-mm diamond or cutting burs) at 70,000 rpm, and transnasal cautery generated significant airborne aerosols (P &lt; .001). In clinical simulations, nasal endoscopy (P &lt; .05), speech (P &lt; .01), and sneezing (P &lt; .01) generated 1- to 10-Âµm airborne aerosols. Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (P &lt; .05). Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread. CONCLUSION: Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 Âµm under surgical conditions. During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing. Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.","Workman, Alan D; Jafari, Aria; Welling, D Bradley; Varvares, Mark A; Gray, Stacey T; Holbrook, Eric H; Scangas, George A; Xiao, Roy; Carter, Bob S; Curry, William T; Bleier, Benjamin S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0194599820931805","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1488,""
"The potential long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on patients with non-communicable diseases in Europe: consequences for healthy ageing","The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies. While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decreaseÂ and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and theÂ private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.","Palmer, Katie; Monaco, Alessandro; Kivipelto, Miia; Onder, Graziano; Maggi, Stefania; Michel, Jean-Pierre; Prieto, Rita; Sykara, Georgia; Donde, Shaantanu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01601-4","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1489,""

"Uptrend in distress and psychiatric symptomatology in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","INTRODUCTION: Prenatal maternal distress has a negative impact on the course of pregnancy, fetal development, offspring development and later psychopathologies. The study aimed to determine the extent to which the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may aggravate pregnant women prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two cohorts of pregnant volunteer women were evaluated, one that was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (n=496) through advertisements in prenatal clinics in Quebec, Canada, from April 2018 to March 2020; the other (n=1258) was recruited online during the pandemic from April 2 to April 13 2020. Prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology were measured with the Kessler Distress Scale (K10), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). RESULTS: The 1754 pregnant women (Mage =29.27, SD=4.23) were between 4 and 41 gestational weeks (M=24.80, SD=9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had post-high school training) and financially well-resourced (85.3% were above the low-income cut-off). A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational age, household income, education and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms (Wilks&#039; &amp;#955;=0.68, F6,1400 =108.50, p &lt; 0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.32). According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES=0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES=0.22 and 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES=0.19), negative affectivity (ES = 0.96) and less positive affectivity (ES=0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms [OR=1.94, &amp;#967;2(1)=10.05, p=.002]. Multiple regression analyses indicated that COVID-19 pregnant women having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.","Berthelot, Nicolas; Lemieux, Roxanne; Garon-Bissonnette, Julia; Drouin-Maziade, Christine; Martel, Ã‰lodie; Maziade, Michel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13925","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1493,""
"The impact of having inadequate safety equipment on mental health","BACKGROUND: Concerns are being raised about the impact of inadequate safety equipment on the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 medical response. AIMS: To assess the impact of inadequate safety equipment on the mental health of service personnel deployed on operations in order to better understand the impact on those working under the similarly demanding conditions of the COVID-19 medical response. METHODS: Self-report surveys were conducted in four operational environments with 3435 personnel providing data. Surveys recorded data on socio-demographic, military and operational characteristics, mental health measures and specific occupational stressors. Analysis through logistic regression explored the association between inadequate equipment and all other factors. RESULTS: A total of 3401 personnel provided data on their perceptions of the adequacy of their equipment, of which 532 (15%) stated that they had a lot of concerns that they did not have the right equipment in working order. Analysis found significantly greater odds of reporting symptoms of common mental health disorders (CMD), 2.49 (2.03-3.06), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 2.99 (2.11-4.24), poorer global health 2.09 (1.62-2.70) and emotional problems 1.69 (1.38-2.06) when individuals reported working with inadequate equipment. Analyses remained significant when adjusted for confounding factors such as rank, sex and operational environment. CONCLUSIONS: An individual&#039;s perception of having inadequate equipment is significantly associated with symptoms of CMD, probable PTSD, poorer global health and increased reporting of emotional problems. This in turn may impact on their ability to safely carry out their duties and may have longer-term mental health consequences.","Simms, A; Fear, N T; Greenberg, N","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa101","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1494,""
"Digital technology can revolutionize mental health services delivery: The COVID-19 crisis as a catalyst for change","The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis presents an imperative for mental health care systems to make digital mental health interventions a routine part of care. Already because of COVID-19, many therapists have rapidly moved to using telehealth in place of in-person contact. In response to this shift, Waller and colleagues compiled a series of expert recommendations to help clinicians pivot to delivering teletherapy to address eating disorders during COVID-19. However, numerous barriers still impede widespread adoption and implementation of digital interventions. In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems- and policy-level requirements that are needed. We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions. We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system. Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.","Taylor, C Barr; Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E; Graham, Andrea K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eat.23300","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1495,""
"Stress resilience during the coronavirus pandemic","The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency with multifaceted severe consequences for people&#039;s lives and their mental health.

"Overdose and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019","BACKGROUND: There have been significant efforts to respond to the two public health emergencies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and overdose in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015-2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. METHODS: Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. RESULTS: Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. CONCLUSION: Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","Slaunwhite, Amanda Kathleen; Gan, Wen Qi; Xavier, Chloe; Zhao, Bin; Buxton, Jane A; Desai, Roshni","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1497,""
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is penetrating to dementia research","1. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer&#039;s patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer&#039;s patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer&#039;s patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer&#039;s patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.","Bostanciklioglu, Mehmet","https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567202617666200522220509","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1498,""
"Potential effects of &quot;social&quot; distancing measures and school lockdown on child and adolescent mental health","Age-related metabolic and renal changes predispose older people to an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and diabetic kidney disease, respectively.

"The disaster worker resiliency training program: a randomized clinical trial","OBJECTIVES: Disaster workers are at elevated risk for mental health problems as a result of trauma exposures during response efforts. One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. METHODS: Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. RESULTS: Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (ÃŽÂ·2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (ÃŽÂ·2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (ÃŽÂ·2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 Â (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (ÃŽÂ·2 = .07, p &lt; .01), PTSD (ÃŽÂ·2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (ÃŽÂ·2 = .07, p &lt; .01) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term health effects of participation in the program.","Mahaffey, Brittain L; Mackin, Daniel M; Rosen, Jonathan; Schwartz, Rebecca M; Taioli, Emanuela; Gonzalez, Adam","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00420-020-01552-3","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1500,""
"Medications in COVID-19 patients: summarizing the current literature from an orthopaedic perspective","PURPOSE: The review aims to provide a summary of the current literature regarding common medications prescribed in orthopaedic surgery and their potential implications in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. CONCLUSION: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.","Tan, Si Heng Sharon; Hong, Choon Chiet; Saha, Soura; Murphy, Diarmuid; Hui, James Hoipo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04643-5","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1501,""
"The prevalence and influencing factors in anxiety in medical workers fighting COVID-19 in China: a cross-sectional survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2 virus) has been sustained in China since December 2019, and has become a pandemic. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff in China from 10 February 2020 to 20 February 2020 using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, with the criteria of normal (Ã¢Â©Â½49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (Ã¢Â©Â¾70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g. having direct contact when treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Of 512 medical staff in China, 164 (32.03%) had had direct contact treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers suffering from moderate (1.36%) and four workers suffering from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients experienced higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (ÃŸ value = 2.33, confidence interval (CI) 0.65-4.00; P = 0.0068). A similar trend was observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (ÃŸ value = 3.67, CI 1.44-5.89; P = 0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (ÃŸ value = 4.44, CI 1.55-7.33; P = 0.0028). In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases. Governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate psychological intervention programmes, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety.","Liu, Chen-Yun; Yang, Yun-Zhi; Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Xu, Xinying; Dou, Qing-Li; Zhang, Wen-Wu; Cheng, Andy S K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268820001107","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-01","",1502,""

Overall, there was a &#039;horizontal&#039; increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students.
