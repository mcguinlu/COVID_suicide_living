"Conditions of Confinement in US Carceral Facilities during COVID-19: Individuals Speak: Incarcerated during the COVID-19 Epidemic (INSIDE)","Objectives: We aimed to describe conditions of confinement among people incarcerated in the United States during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and assess the feasibility of a community science data collection approach. Methods: We developed a web-based survey with community partners to collect information on confinement conditions (COVID-19 safety, basic needs, support). Formerly incarcerated adults released after March 1, 2020, or non-incarcerated adults in communication with an incarcerated person (proxy) were recruited through social media from July 25, 2020, through March 27, 2021. Descriptive statistics were estimated in aggregate and separately by proxy or formerly incarcerated status. Additionally, we compared responses between proxy and formerly incarcerated respondents using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate based on alpha=0.05. Results: Of 378 responses, 94% were by proxy, and 76% reflected state prison conditions. Participants reported inability to physically distance (>6ft at all times) (92%), inadequate access to soap (89%), water (46%), toilet paper (49%) and showers (68%). Among people who received mental healthcare before the pandemic, 75% reported reduced care. We found that responses were consistent between formerly incarcerated people and proxy-respondents. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a community-science approach to data collection is feasible. Based on these findings, COVID-19 safety and basic needs were not sufficiently addressed within some carceral settings. Thus, we recommend the lived experiences of incarcerated individuals should be included to make informed and equitable policy decisions.","Nicole Cassarino; Harika Dabbara; Carla B.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in an urban setting, Bangladesh","Aim The deleterious impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has been reported by earlier studies globally. However, such studies are limited in Bangladesh;therefore, we performed a cross-sectional study to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. Methodology The cross-sectional study was performed from 1st June to 31st October, 2020, and included a total of 503 real time RT-PCR confirmed stable hospitalized adult (aged =18 years) COVID-19 patients using the convenience sampling approach. However, patients with prior mental illness, unstable vital signs, severely ill, oxygen saturation &lt; 92%, impaired consciousness were excluded from the study. We collected data by using a semi-structured questionnaire including Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI-7), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were carried out to determine the mental health outcomes. Results The study found that about 42.5 %, 30.7%, 46.7%, and 28.5% of patients suffered from moderate to severe depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. The physical symptoms, fever, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, blurred vision, chest pain, and diarrhoea were significantly associated with augmented mental distress among the hospitalized patients. Furthermore, depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia were strongly linked with patientsâ€™ education, occupation, infected family members, exposure to COVID-19 patients, smoking, comorbidities, infection among the neighbors or acquaintances, and preexisting stress. Conclusion The negative psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic comprising depression, anxiety, insomnia and stress worsened the physical condition of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These patients' poor mental health status needed to be addressed by devising an integrated approach towards improving patients' wellbeing at the post-COVID period.","Nabi, Shah Golam, Rashid, Md Utba, Sagar, Soumik Kha, Ghosh, Prakash, Shahin, Md, Afroz, Fahdia, Noor, Irfan Nowroze, Hossain, Irin, Mondal, Dinesh, Ahmed, Helal Uddin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09110","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09110, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28521,""
"Sleep quality and associated factors among undergraduate medical students during Covid-19 confinement","Problem considered Medical students are vulnerable to poor sleep quality which may lead to attention difficulties and poor academic performance. Good quality sleep is needed for optimal neurocognitive and psychomotor functions as well as physical and mental health. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of poor sleep quality among undergraduate medical students during home confinement at the time of Covid-19 pandemic and analyze the relationship between sleep quality and relevant socio-demographic and psychological variables. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 284 undergraduate medical students of a teaching hospital of Bhubaneswar from Octoberâ€“November, 2020. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, relevant information was collected. Sleep quality of the students was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and mental health status of the students using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21). Results The prevalence of poor sleep quality among undergraduate medical students was 45%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that students doing exercise for &lt;3 days/week (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.01â€“3.23), spending =8Â h screen time/day (AOR: 2.02, 95%: 1.12â€“3.66), having anxiety symptoms (AOR: 3.61, 95% CI: 1.72â€“7.57), and those who were not satisfied with own self (AOR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.35â€“5.38) were more likely to report poor sleep quality. Conclusion Poor sleep quality was prevalent among undergraduate medical students during their home confinement at the time of Covid-19 pandemic. Sleep educational programs, anxiety management, and lifestyle modifications can be recommended to improve sleep quality among medical students.","Mishra, Jayanti, Panigrahi, Ansuman, Samanta, Priyadarsini, Dash, Kulumina, Mahapatra, Pranab, Behera, Manas Ranjan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2022.101004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health;: 101004, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28522,""
"Racial Inequities in Emergency Department Administration of Buprenorphine and Methadone Among Patients With Opioid Use Disorder","Study Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated longstanding inequities in opioid use disorder (OUD) that reflect multiple facets of structural racism. In Massachusetts, opioid overdose deaths in 2020 rose by nearly 70% in Black men compared to just 5% overall. Emergency department (ED) visits in people with OUD may represent key touchpoints for overdose prevention. Although racial inequities in buprenorphine and methadone maintenance initiation, dosing, and retention have been well documented, less is known about the administration of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD, buprenorphine and methadone), in the ED. ED leadership initiated an internal review to explore racial equity in multiple clinical quality metrics, including frequency of MOUD administration in patients with OUD. Methods: Retrospective data were analyzed for quality improvement (QI) purposes. Patients presenting to the ED with OUD July 29, 2020-March 12, 2021 were identified via ICD-10 codes. Patient demographics and MOUD administration were explored using descriptive statistics;c2 tests compared the frequency of MOUD administration by race. An intensive QI intervention to improve MOUD utilization will be delivered to all ED prescribers in June 2021. The intervention includes content on racial inequities in OUD treatment and factors that drive them, including provider bias, reasons for mistrust of the medical system among patients of color, and structural barriers to OUD treatment and retention. Through educational sessions for providers, transparency of data of current MOUD trends in the ED, and structured on-shift reminders by ED pharmacists, we plan to improve provider-patient communication and MOUD utilization in the ED. The QI initiative will be followed by a three-month monitoring period (July-September 2021) to evaluate for changes in MOUD administration. Results: A total of 998 unique patients with OUD were seen for 1452 ED visits. Documented race was 56.7% White, 21.5% Black, 13.5% Hispanic, 1.7% Other, and 6.6% unknown. MOUD were administered during 945/1452 visits (65.1%). The likelihood of administration varied significantly by race: 80.3% of White patients received MOUD compared to 35.9% of Black patients, and 59.9% of Hispanic patients (p&lt;0.001, Table 1). Significant differences in treatment were also observed when comparing white and Black patients (p&lt;0.001) and white and Hispanic patients (p&lt;0.001) directly. Conclusion: Renewed attention to ensuring racial equity in clinical practice prompted an exploration of ED data at our institution, including equitable administration of buprenorphine and methadone in patients with OUD. This QI analysis identified a racial inequity, prompting the development of a QI initiative to improve overall utilization of MOUD, with a specific focus on mitigating observed racial inequities. Data analysis from the post-QI intervention period will be completed prior to presentation at ACEP. [Formula presented]","Weisenthal, K.; Farrell, N.; Nentwich, L.; Taylor, J.; Manchanda, E.

"Preliminary Results From an Emergency Department Pain Coach Service and Discharge Toolkit Pilot Project During COVID-19","Study Objectives: Amid the US opioid epidemic, emergency providers and patients are searching for non-opioid or nonpharmacologic pain treatment options. The challenge of managing pain without opioids was escalated by the COVID-19 pandemic with opioid related overdoses and deaths increasing by 20-40%. Most healthcare professionals have limited knowledge, resources or time for pain education, especially in the emergency department (ED). To address these needs a novel pain coaching program was designed including a menu of nonpharmacologic patient discharge toolkit materials. Study objectives were to determine descriptive patient and toolkit utilization data and challenges in the first 4 months of a novel pain program. Methods: Target population consisted of patients =14 years of age seen by a new ED Pain Coaching staff from January 4, 2021- April 30, 2021. The two ED sites consisted of an urban, academic center with trauma center, pediatric ED, etc. and an affiliated community ED. Patients were determined by ED rounding, ED census review and consultation by ED staff, physicians, physical therapy, palliative care and pharmacy. Summary statistics for patient demographics, pain type, REALM-SF score, educational topics, toolkit materials, challenges and other data were ed from coaching and patient notes on a daily basis using a REDCap database for analysis. Upon request, there were select inpatient and repeat coaching encounters. Results: During this 4-month pilot, 296 coaching sessions were completed on 276 unique patients;20 screen outs for severe pain, procedures, violent behavior or other obstacles. Average age was 43 with 85% between 20-70 years of age;62% female;60% African American. Pain was 46% acute, 50% acute on chronic and 4% chronic with patients often having multiple pain etiologies: musculoskeletal (74%), inflammatory (71%), post-trauma (15%), headache (14%), post-surgical (4%) and neuropathic (3%). Education topics provided with accompanying toolkit items: hot/cold gel packs (90%), car with 4 flat tires analogy (90%), pain neuroscience education (88%), aromatherapy inhalers (82%), breathing techniques (69%), virtual reality (51%), exercise (38%), stretching (35%), diet (20%), acupressure (11%). The majority of patients were seen in 2 EDs or associated trauma center (87%);however, the coach received referrals for selected inpatients (13%). Seventeen educational brochures were made available to patients with aromatherapy, managing pain, pain and stress, and nonpharmacologic management being most utilized. Challenges to coaching included medical condition (14%), too much pain (11%), time constraints (7%);52% had no challenges. Regarding patient feedback, 61% indicated the session was helpful and 39% were unsure at the time. Conclusion: Results from this novel ED pain coach and discharge toolkit model provide valuable insights for development of a national pain coach model. Coaching scripts, note template, brochures, videos, inventory and other programmatic materials will be published for further implementation. Future plans include longitudinal patient follow-up, staff satisfaction assessment and addition of new modalities.","Pain, Assessment, Management, Initiative, Hendry, P.; Suffield, D.; Sheikh, S.; Spindle, N.; Schmitzberger, M.; Velasquez, E.; Lott, M.; Fishe, J.; Johnson, B.; Kendall Webb, L.; Norse, A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.226","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S86, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28524,""
"Is Working in the Emergency Department Hazardous to Your Health? Psychological and Physical Features of Emergency Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Study Objective: Previous work has established that frontline health care workers (HCWs), such as emergency physicians and nurses, are vulnerable to the development of adverse behavioral, psychological, and physical sequelae, which may persist long after the disaster. we examine the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress in ED clinicians working during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined psychological and physiological (sleep, resting heart rate, blood pressure) of a sample of frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: This was a sample of 50 clinicians (physicians, residents, nurses, PAs, NPs) who were frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic across a diverse (academic, community, urban, and suburban) range of four emergency departments in the New York Metropolitan area during July 2020-September 2020. Study design is a longitudinal prospective cohort design. At baseline, we conducted a psychological test battery including measures of COVID-19-related stress, PTSD (PCL-5), anxiety (GAD-5), depression (PHQ-9), and burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory). We also assessed home blood pressure at wake/sleep, resting heart rate, and sleep duration using an accelerometer watch device (Fitbit). Results: Baseline demographics in our sample had more self-identified women participants (62%), caucasian (67%), with median age of 42. Sample was diverse, containing physicians/advanced practice providers (45%) nurses (43%) and residents (12%) At baseline, positive screens for psychological symptoms were common;48% for acute stress, 37% for depressive, and 30% for anxiety symptoms. Overall, housestaff rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from attendings or nurses. Overall participants had elevated levels of emotional exhaustion on burnout surveys (median 24, SD 3.5). Average sleep duration was 6.2 hours (SD 1.3), resting heart rate of 86 (SD 18.2), and home blood pressure of 128/76. Increased levels of emotional exhaustion was positively associated with elevated resting blood pressure (Pearson r=.32), and resting heart rate (r=.38), while negatively associated with sleep duration (r=.23). Conclusion: Our preliminary work and others have highlighted that HCWs are experiencing significant COVID-19-related psychological and physical distress. Future work and data will address key questions such as whether such elevated distress symptoms remain persistent with the evolution of the pandemic. This work and others emphasize the need for continued mental health support measures for HCWs both during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Chang, B.; Shecter, A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.061","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S22, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28525,""
"Depression in Emergency Department Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Brooklyn, NY","Study Objectives: emergency department (ED) health care workers (HCW) have experienced extensive mental health burdens in the fight against COVID-19. This study measured depressive symptoms in ED HCW in Brooklyn, New York, at the peak 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An email-distributed survey of ED HCW at Maimonides Medical Center was conducted September 8â€“December 31, 2020, with reference period March-May 2020. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 10- item depressive symptom scale, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D). CES-D items were summed, with a possible total score of 0-30. A CES-D score &gt;10 was deemed clinically relevant. Our main predictor was HCW status, which was dichotomized as clinical (MD/DO, nurses, ED technicians) vs non-clinical. Covariates included sex, age, race, SARS-CoV-2 testing status (not tested vs +test vs -test), social support (range: 0-&gt;=4 people to talk to), number of COVID-related home problems (range: 0-9), mental health care disruption during COVID-19 (yes/no), 3-item Loneliness Brief Survey (LBF) score (range: 3-9), and survey date. General linear regression and logistic regression analysis were used to predict CES-D score (ÃŸ- coefficient, p-value) and clinically relevant depressive symptoms (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI)), respectively. A p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among 222 HCW respondents, the mean age was 38.2Â±10.8y;and 59.4% were White, 52.5% were male, 80.1% were clinical HCW (38.5% MD/DO, 29.7% nurses, 31.8% ED technicians), and 61.6% tested for SARS-CoV-2. The mean CES-D score was 11.8Â±8.2. A clinically relevant depressive symptom burden was reported by 51.6% of HCW-55.4% of clinical HCW vs 36.4% of non-clinical HCW (p=0.024). There was no difference in the odds of clinically relevant depressive symptoms by type of clinical HCW (MD/DO, nurses, ED technicians) compared to non-clinical HCW;and no difference in mean CES-D score by clinical vs non-clinical HCW status. Increasing CES-D scores were also observed with increasing age (ÃŸ=0.12, p=0.01), number of COVID-19-related home problems (ÃŸ=0.99, p=0.035), and LBF score (ÃŸ= 2.17, p&lt;0.0001). A clinically-relevant depressive symptom burden was also observed with increasing age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11), among those who reported increasing COVID-19-related home problems (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11), and LBF score (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.63-2.65). Conclusions: Over half of clinical HCW experienced a clinically relevant depressive symptom burden during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, number of COVID-19-related home problems, and loneliness were also associated with higher depressive symptom burden. To deepen our understanding of mental health outcomes, create effective interventions, and promote mental health-related policy changes, such as expanding insurance coverage for mental health care, temporal associations between mental health outcomes and associated factors must continue to be investigated.","Gao, H.; Ma, X.; Apple, S.; Cirrone, G.; Huang, A.; Kabariti, S.; Saad, A.; Yucel, R.; Gustafson, D.; Motov, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.058","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S21, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28526,""

"Socio-demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics as predictors of self-reported Covid-19 history among older adults: 2006-2020 Health and Retirement Study","Background To identify key socio-demographic, lifestyle and health predictors of self-reported coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) history, examine cardiometabolic health characteristics as predictors of self-reported Covid-19 history and compare groups with and without a history of Covid-19 on trajectories in cardiometabolic health and blood pressure measurements over time, among U.S. older adults. Methods Nationally representative longitudinal data on U.S. older adults from the 2006-2020 Health and Retirement Study were analyzed using logistic and mixed-effects logistic regression models. Results Based on logistic regression, number of household members (OR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.52), depressive symptoms score (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.42) and number of cardiometabolic risk factors or chronic conditions (â€˜1-2â€™ versus â€˜0â€™) (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.67) were significant predictors of self-reported Covid-19 history. Based on mixed-effects logistic regression, several statistically significant predictors of Covid-19 history were identified, including female sex (OR=3.06, 95% CI: 1.57, 5.96), other race (OR=5.85, 95% CI: 2.37, 14.43), Hispanic ethnicity (OR=2.66, 95% CI: 1.15, 6.17), number of household members (ORÂ =Â 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.42), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (1-4 times per month vs. never) (OR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.78) and number of cardiometabolic risk factors or chronic conditions (â€˜1-2â€™ versus â€˜0â€™) (OR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.60).

"Unmet mental health needs associated with Covid must be addressed","Psychological morbidity associated with the pandemic continues to worsen. Though figures remain anecdotal, the available evidence points to unprecedented demand for mental health services. In February 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that over 40% of adults in the US had experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression associated with the epidemic. This issue of the Journal of Health Service Psychology illustrates the numerous cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial consequences of COVID. Management and prevention of acute infection remain the critical public health priority, but as the pandemic unfolds, increasing attention must be paid to longer-term consequences. We are, as previously noted, experiencing a rapid increase in demand for mental health services that the current mental health workforce cannot meet. The psychological and psychosocial consequences of COVID will continue to manifest, and it is improbable that these consequences are transient. As the immediate infectious disease threat diminishes, we must proactively devote resources to developing effective screening and intervention strategies of post-acute COVID symptoms. The inefficiencies in educating and training psychologists and other mental health providers have long been recognized. Urgent attention by educators and planners to acknowledge and correct these inefficiencies is required if we care to address the long-term consequences of the disease.

"""The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows"": Enacting the athlete identity narrative in stigmatizing mental health communication","The purpose of this dissertation was to examine how athletes construct mental health by researching how mental health is communicated to athletes and the role of athlete identity in contributing to stigma of mental health. The following research questions guided this research: 1) What influences athletes' interpersonal communication about mental health? 2) How do social media outlets and online forums impact athletes' communication about mental health? 3) What role does athlete identity have in stigma of mental health? Using the theoretical framework of the communication theory of identity as a guide, this dissertation examined how multiple frames of identity contribute the construction, communication, and perceived stigma of mental illness in college sports through a qualitative design where data were collected through individual interviews with 30 former and current college student-athletes and fieldnote observations. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling. They completed an online questionnaire to collect basic demographic information and completed the individual interview on Zoom. Individual interviews were conducted via Zoom, an online video conferencing platform to abide by public health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of a thematic and narrative analysis in Chapter Four, yielded five themes: ""Athlete Identity: Constructing the Narrative of What is an Athlete,"" ""Illness as a Mentality: The Toughness/Weakness Narrative in Navigating Mental Illness,"" ""Staying Strong: How Athlete Identity Contributes to the Stigma of Communicating Mental Illness,"" ""Social Media: Breaking the Barrier of Communication,"" and ""Moving Forward: Normalizing Mental Illness Disclosure in Sports."" Woven together, these results create a narrative that demonstrates how athlete identity affects the stigma and communication of mental illness in the sport environment. These findings add to gaps in existing literature of how mental health is communicated and defined in the sport environment.

"Psychological distress among healthcare professionals at the frontlines: Anaesthesiologists' perspective","The prevalence of burnout and depression among healthcare practitioners in Malaysia has never been studied during a pandemic prior to this study. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, this question has again been pushed into the forefront, due to concerns with maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of clinicians handling this pandemic. At the same time, there is also no data on the factors associated with psychological distress among Malaysian medical workers, which is not desirable when planning for preventative strategies in alleviating their psychological distress. To answer these questions, we set forth to capture a snapshot of the situation in Malaysia with regards to burnout and depression among frontline anaesthesiology clinicians working in Sungai Buloh Hospital, the national infectious disease centre of Malaysia and the hospital gazetted to be an exclusive COVID-19 hospital in Malaysia.

"Problematic smartphone use among high school students and its relationships with depression, stress, self-esteem, grit and academic performance","The world currently has more than three billion smartphone users. The smartphone is fully integrated into the daily life of individuals, including 95% of American teenagers. Excessive use of the smartphone leads to smartphone addiction and Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU), which has been associated with depression, stress, reduced self-esteem, and decreased academic performance. This study addresses a gap in research by surveying high school students to assess for associations among PSU, depression, perceived stress, self-esteem, grit, and academic performance. This quantitative study was conducted in a comprehensive Southern California high school district. This study contributes empirical research to deepen the understanding of the relationship high school students have with their smartphones and the negative outcomes of PSU and device dependency. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 global pandemic during school campus closures, distance learning, and campus hybrid re-openings of the 2020-2021 school year. Participants for this study included 319 high school students. Results of this study report student use of the smartphone to support learning inside and outside of the classroom. Results also indicate significant correlations among the variables of PSU, depression, perceived stress, self-esteem, grit, and academic performance and reveal evidence of PSU among some students in each of the grade levels and different levels of academic performance. Implications of this study include informing families, educators, district administrators, and policymakers to more fully and rigorously utilize the electronic device policy provided in California Assembly Bill 272 and to implement more robust and thoughtful classroom smartphone policies. This study also aims to build awareness among students, families, and the educational community regarding PSU behaviors to support teenage high school students experiencing PSU to find productive smartphone uses and establish healthy boundaries between user and device.

"Assessment of COVID-19-related new onset of Depression and Anxiety: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study","Aim: The aim of the present study assessment of new-onset depression and anxiety associated with COVID-19. Methods: This analytical, cross-sectional study was done the Department of Psychiatry Adesh Medical College Hospital Ambala Haryana, India for 10 months. By using Google Form platform contained validated online survey among Indian population which includes all adult males and females during or post COVID-19 infection and compared to the non-COVID-19 population as a control group. Results: 38% of participants were male while 62% are females. 26% of participants were married while 70% were single. 60% of participants are students and 38% are employed while 2% are retired. Regarding the COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative participants, 25% of participants reported having been diagnosed with COVID-19. Scores of PHQ-9 ranged from 0 to 27 (the mean is and the standard deviation is 6.12). Depression prevalence in our sample was 40%. Scores of GAD-7 ranged from 0 to 21 (the mean of 8.99 and the standard deviation is 5.33). Anxiety prevalence in our sample was 41%. The model shows a significant overall effect of gender [F(489) = 39.02, p&lt;0.001], a non-significant effect of COVID-19 infection [F(489)=1.88, p=0.177] and a trending effect of the interaction between gender and COVID-19 [F(489) = 3.25, p=0.069]. Since the effect is not significant, we did not run any post hoc analyses. Conclusion: Significant levels of depression and anxiety were observed among the study population.

"""Changes in mental health during three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: A repeated cross-sectional study among polish university students"": Publisher correction","Reports an error in ""Changes in mental health during three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: A repeated cross-sectional study among Polish university students"" by Aleksandra M. Rogowska, Dominika Ochnik, Cezary Kusnierz, Karolina Chilicka, Monika Jakubiak, Maria Paradowska, Luiza Glazowska, Dawid Bojarski, Julia Fijolek, Marcin Podolak, Maciej Tomasiewicz, Dominika Nowicka, Marek Kawka, Maksymilian Grabarczyk and Zuzanna Babinska (BMC Psychiatry, 2021[Dec][15], Vol 21[627]). In the original article, the authors identified that the captions were incorrectly assigned to Figs. 3, 4, and 5. The figures with the correct captions are given in the erratum. (The following  of the original article appeared in record 2022-16134-001). Background: Research indicates that mental health worsened during the Coronavirus crisis, in particular among women and university students. However, few longitudinal studies have so far investigated the changes in mental health outcomes across three subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to examine changes in mental health among university students. Methods: A total of 1,961university students from Poland, at mean age 23.23 years (SD = 3.16, 57.47% of women) were included in this repeated cross-sectional study across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: W1 (n = 657), W2 (n = 654), and W3 (n = 650). They completed the online survey with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), General Self-Rated Health (GSRH), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), as well as sociodemographic variables. Results: The prevalence of people at high risk of anxiety and perceived stress, poorer physical health, and low life satisfaction changed significantly across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the two-way ANOVA showed that both the wave (W1&lt;W2&lt;W3) and gender (men&lt;women) had a significant impact on the level of anxiety. Statistically significant changes in perceived stress were found between pandemic waves (W1&gt;W2, W1&gt;W3), and genders (men&lt;women). Self-reported physical health significantly deteriorated in W3 compared to W1 and W2 (W1&gt;W3, W2&gt;W3), and was significantly worse in women than in men. The level of life satisfaction also decreased significantly in W3 (W1&gt;W3, W2&gt;W3), but did not differ between men and women. High GAD risk was presented two times more frequently among women and people who subjectively assessed their health as poor, three times more likely in participants dissatisfied with their lives, and seven times more probably in persons with high-stress levels. Conclusions: The results of this study consistently indicate (using parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis) that there are significant differences in mental health problems across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. It suggests that pandemic waves should be considered in future review studies and meta-analyses. Furthermore, these findings indicate a potential role for prevention and intervention programs aimed at alleviating life satisfaction and subjective assessment of health and improving coping skills to reduce stress and anxiety.

"Assessment of the impact of patient/family video visitation on depression severity scores at a hospital-based skilled nursing facility","Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in regulations severely restricting patient visitation in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF). Lack of family visitation can have a negative impact on patients such as loneliness, social isolation, and feelings of depression. Therefore, prompting this facility act to reduce the barriers for this, often fragile, patient population, at high risk for depression. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project was to improve the resources provided by a hospital-based SNF to prevent or lessen depression in patients, related to restricted family visitation, through implementation of a patient-family video visitation initiative. Methods: This QI project used a before and after design to implement a technology-based patient/family video visitation initiative aimed at preventing or decreasing depression severity in patients cared for in a hospital-based SNF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video visitation was implemented using an I-pad and the Microsoft Teams platform to allow for face-to-face visitation. PHQ-9 scores and patient/family satisfaction with video visitation were measured before and after the intervention. Conclusion: The initiation of a technology-based, patient-family visitation resource by the SNF resulted in patients scoring in the minimal depression category before and after the intervention, supporting the use of video visitation to prevent depression or worsening depression due to prolonged isolation of patients. The initiative illuminated the organizational and feasibility factors to be considered and mitigated when introducing new technology and processes into an already strained health care setting. Lessons learned and similar positive outcomes, can be expanded to many health settings faced with long lengths of patient stays where family members have regulatory, organizational, or personal barriers to visitation.

"Finding Opportunity in Adversity","I remember the early days of 2020, which feels like a lifetime ago, first hearing the name that would turn our world upside down: COVID-19. None of us could have imagined that we'd still be battling the pandemic two years later, let alone predict the ways it would change nearly every aspect of business and our daily lives. From supply chain disruptions to homeschooling, remote working to normalizing mental health discussions, our world has changed and there's no going back. That's not necessarily a bad thing. As the last two years demonstrate, we can't predict what comes next, but our pandemic-honed agility will serve us well.","Pugliese, Anthony C. I. A. C. P. A.

"Non-psychiatric registered nurses' perceptions of caring for persons with mental illness in a non-psychiatric healthcare setting","Patients with mental illness receive care in acute medical facilities for medical and acute psychiatric problems. Non-psychiatric nurses are responsible for the care of patients with mental illness regardless of their training in psychiatric nursing skills. The purpose of this study was to inform the nursing profession and nursing education of the needs of non-psychiatric nurses in caring for patients with mental illness. This study also sought to discover non-psychiatric nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research study used qualitative descriptive phenomenology to explore the research phenomenon. Eight participants were interviewed virtually using a semi-structured interview guide with interview prompts to explore participants' lived experiences. Data analysis was accomplished using Colaizzi's (1978) seven-step analysis method. Findings from the first research question revealed five themes with an overarching theme of barriers to caring for patients with mental illness. A significant barrier in caring for patients with mental illness was the lack of mental health resources. In some cases, patients were housed in the emergency department for extended periods of time as the staff searched for a psychiatric facility that would accept the patient. Nurses and nursing leaders need to take an active role in educating legislators and policymakers on the need for improved funding for psychiatric services and the significant issue resulting from using the emergency department as an entry point for mental health treatment. This study added to the literature on evidence-based strategies to inform the nursing profession and nursing education in nursing care for patients with iv mental illness. Findings from this study indicated multiple strategies that support non-psychiatric nurses in caring for this population. This study also explored the stressors and perceived preparation of non-psychiatric nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings indicated a nurse's responsibility to enforce visitation restrictions during the pandemic, even for patients who did not have COVID-19, was a major stressor, potentially resulting in moral distress for the nurses caring for patients during the pandemic. Also consistent with the literature on nurses caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was the concern for the short- and long-term effects of psychological stress, anxiety, burnout, exhaustion, and depression.

"Improving therapeutic communication in mental health nursing: A quality improvement project","Over 46 million adults in the United States (U.S.) live with a mental illness. Locally in Nevada, the psychiatrist to patient ratio is approximately 700:1, and patients are seen primarily in the inpatient setting, if seen at all, due to the wait average of 85 hours in the hospital emergency rooms for access into mental health hospitals or specialty units of a general hospital. Moreover, costs for mental health mood disorders alone are estimated at over seven million dollars annually. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) opined the need for change in healthcare to redesign practice and clinical communication with patients in all healthcare settings;however, more is still needed in mental health. Therapeutic communication is essential to meet the patient's physical and psychological needs while establishing the nurse-patient trusting relationship. Clinical outcomes in mental health settings remain poor, with non-therapeutic communication resulting in poor patient outcomes. A leading cause of inadequate treatment includes non-therapeutic communication during pre- and post-discharge treatment. It is not well described in the literature what role nurses play, nationally or locally, in ensuring the safe transition of mental health patients from an emergency room to a specialty unit. Mental health nurses are expected to complete clinical assessments on admitted clients, including effective therapeutic interpersonal communication techniques and psychosocial intervention skills to provide safety, trust, collaboration with rapport, respect, genuineness with the caring emphasis, and empathy. Nurses may be able to decrease adverse events within mental health settings, in part, by practicing therapeutic communication;unfortunately, evidence shows that nurses are often unprepared in mental health to incorporate therapeutic communication and relationship building among their patients. Expected knowledge of, and competence in therapeutic communication would seem to be a logical requirement for mental health nurses;however, Nevada's current practice does not require demonstrated knowledge and competency in therapeutic communication between mental health nurses and patients in hospital settings. Competency development may guide nurses to develop critical thinking skills to practice and support psychiatric patients to achieve optimal outcomes. The lack of required knowledge and competency related to therapeutic communication is the underlying impetus for this Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project. The purpose of this DNP project was to develop, implement, and evaluate an educational module for mental health nurses and staff to improve knowledge and competency in therapeutic communication with their patients. The TeamSTEPPS Program was adapted to develop a mental health-specific educational module focused on therapeutic communication to accomplish this purpose. The educational module was implemented online due to Covid-19 Pandemic, and this intervention was evaluated using four previously validated TeamSTEPPS instruments. Fifty-two participants were included in this project. Results indicated a statistically significant change in knowledge and competency pre- compared to the post-intervention with the educational module. Based on the results of this project, one may conclude that implementing additional mental health education for nurses may improve their knowledge and competency related to therapeutic communications with their patients, as was demonstrated in this project.

"Essays in the economics of mental health","One in five adults in the United States experiences mental illness in a typical year. Less than half get treatment. The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased mental health pressures above that baseline. This dissertation addresses the intersection between mental health and economic issues building upon two important findings: (1) the economic finding of a bidirectional causal relationship between mental health and economic outcomes and (2) the psychiatric finding that mental-wellness-focused smartphone applications (apps) are effective. Mental wellness apps are low-cost, scalable, and pandemic-appropriate, but current use is limited. Given the relationship between mental health and economic outcomes and the efficacy of mental wellness apps, can we leverage mental wellness apps to improve economic outcomes? The first two chapters of this dissertation report on my randomized controlled trials testing strategies to expand usage of mental wellness apps. First, I find providing mental-wellness-app privacy ratings increases selection of privacy-preferred apps by six percentage points among likely app users, a significant shift that could drive competitive pressures toward improved privacy protections. Likely app users care about this issue and are willing to pay one third of the average monthly app price to access the ratings, suggesting $80 million in social welfare gains from implementing privacy ratings nationally. Second, among individuals willing to download apps, I find offering $3 for downloading, installing, and using a mental wellness app for two weeks does not have significant mental wellbeing or work productivity impacts on my sample as a whole. Instead, high-productivity individuals see productivity increases of 0.127 standard deviations, worth $20 per high-productivity participant over the measured second week of treatment. However, low-productivity participants experience no change or negative changes in productivity as a result of the intervention. Taken together, these findings suggest further research is necessary to clarify the conditions under which workplace use of mental wellness apps is beneficial before broadly implementing similar incentive schemes. Third, I investigate the presence and impacts of gender-identity-related social stigma on health and work outcomes using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I find transgender status is associated with poorer mental and physical health and controlling for mental and physical health status and demographic characteristics, transgender Americans experience poorer work outcomes than similarly situated cisgender (that is, not transgender) Americans, by about $10,000 per year. This outcome is not the result of using stigmatized health behaviors, as after controlling for adverse childhood experiences, transgender people use no more stigmatized health behaviors than their cisgender peers. Mental wellbeing is a key component of individual and social welfare and human capital. This dissertation investigates the intersection between mental health and economics, a promising and important area for economic research.

"Analyzing the mental health and resilience of undergraduate nursing students during the COVID-19 outbreak","The study of risk, resilience, and mental health is timely and important to nursing education because today's nursing students are experiencing a global pandemic, with the rapid outbreak of COVID-19. This novel crisis and circumstances require research that documents how pre-service healthcare professionals are reacting and coping to the current global pandemic. This need is evident because COVID-19 has uniquely positioned nurses as first responders who often must risk their lives in order to provide patient care. This transformational role and experience will likely have a profound effect on the profession and those entering the profession. The purpose of this descriptive-exploratory study is to understand the relationship of risk (e.g., anxiety, stress, and COVID-19 Induced Risk Factors) resilience, and mental health factors among undergraduate nursing students in response to COVID-19. The sample population for this study is undergraduate nursing students enrolled in the upper division of a four-year BSN program at a large, public institution in the Southeastern United States. This study is designed as a descriptive-exploratory study to describe and explore the immediate reactions of nursing students to the COVID-19 Pandemic-a crisis that profoundly affects nurses and other healthcare professionals. Data was collected in the Spring Semester of 2020 using an online QualtricsÂ© Survey emailed to participants via a student email list-serv with prior approval and after IRB approval was obtained. Students answered one survey with six instruments that were self-report measures for resilience, grit, stress, coping, depression, and anxiety. Students also answered demographic questions that addressed life events and environment changes due to COVID-19. Since many of today's nursing pre-service professionals will enter the workforce while the current global crisis is on-going, research is needed that highlights the social, psychological, and instrumental supports that may protect the profession from undesirable attrition.

"The cost of caring during recent epidemics: a rapid review of risk factors, psychological manifestations, and strategies for its treatment Running head: The cost of caring during pandemics","Background. During pandemics, Healthcare Workers (HCWs) are particularly exposed to the risk of secondary trauma. If not effectively addressed, the consequences of such psychological distress can progress to more severe conditions. Methods. A systematic search of several databases on the effect of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 pandemics on the mental health of HCWs was performed according to both the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the WHO Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research. Results. The 77 reviewed studies highlighted that work organization and individual characteristics can add to mental health risk. Providing adequate training to prevent infection and prepare HCWs to handle the epidemic, strengthening team work to improve organization, and ensuring appropriate protective equipment is available can help prevent the risk of psychiatric illness. Conclusions. Monitoring and addressing through tailored interventions the mental health consequences of pandemics in HCWs is necessary.","Ferrara, Maria, Funaro, Melissa C.; Vacca, Francesca, Kusmann, Federica, Tedeschini, Enrico, Galeazzi, GianMaria, Scattoni, Maria Luisa, Starace, Fabrizio","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+cost+of+caring+during+recent+epidemics:+a+rapid+review+of+risk+factors,+psychological+manifestations,+and+strategies+for+its+treatment.+Running+head:+The+cost+of+caring+during+pandemics","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annali dell'Istituto Superiore di Sanita; 57(1):1-7, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28542,""

"The COVID-19 pandemic and university of Oregon students' food security and eating behaviors","Food insecurity is highly prevalent among U.S. college students and is associated with poor eating behaviors, physical and mental health, and academic performance. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused immense income loss in the United States. Income loss is associated with increased food insecurity. Little is known about how college students' food security and eating behaviors have changed during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess how University of Oregon (UO) students' food security and eating behaviors changed during the pandemic, as well as mediators of these potential changes between February 2020 and Fall 2020. In Fall 2020, 779 UO students responded to a Qualtrics survey that assessed their demographic characteristics, including undergraduate vs graduate status, international status, race and ethnicity, and sexual orientation, as well as food insecurity (USDA six-item short form food security scale) and eating behaviors (National College Health Assessment). Items asked students to report on these constructs for February 2020 and Fall 2020 (pre and during pandemic). Close to half of respondents reported food insecurity in February 2020 (46.8%) and Fall 2020 (47.3%). When examined by group, change in food security only varied significantly by students' sexual orientation. LGBQIA+ students reported significantly greater increases in food insecurity from February 2020 to Fall 2020 where heterosexual students had no change (p &lt; .01). Overall, there were no significant changes in any of the eating behaviors between February 2020 and Fall 2020. Change in income partially mediated change in vegetable consumption (p &lt; .001), but no other eating behaviors. Change in food security partially mediated changes in fruit (p &lt; .001), whole grain (p &lt; .001), and protein (p &lt; .001) consumption. These findings provide UO and other college administrators a better understanding of college students' food security and eating behaviors before and during the pandemic, and can inform future and existing programs to promote food security, and in turn, healthy eating among college students.

"Vulnerability to COVID-19, prejudice, and support for economic restrictions towards countries with high level of contamination","Recent research has extensively investigated how the current COVID-19 pandemic can affect intergroup relations. Much less is known about the impact of COVID-19 on economic and trade decisions. Could the intergroup effects of this pandemic shape support for international economic policies? The aim of this study was to examine the support for restrictive economic policies towards countries with very high levels of COVID-19 contamination (China and Italy) during the first lockdown period (March - April 2020). The survey was conducted in Romania (N = 669) and included measures of COVID-19 vulnerability, prejudice, and support for economic restrictive policy (e.g., to reduce international trade;to set higher taxes). Results showed that higher support for restrictive policies toward China was associated with greater perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 and this link was partially mediated by prejudice toward China. In contrast, support for economic restrictive policies toward Italy was greater when perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 was high, but this relationship between variables was not explained by negative attitudes towards Italy. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

"Pets During Covid-19 Pandemic: Significant Role as Stress Buster for their Owners","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyoneâ€™s lives in many different ways since January 2020 globally. COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of humans to disorders related to loneliness due to physical distancing measures and it has also highlighted the positive aspects of the relationship between animals and humans. Apart from physical wellbeing, psychological wellness has also been a matter of concern during lockdown. Animal assisted therapy aims at improving physical, mental and emotional aspects of human life. Aim & Objective: To evaluate the Role of pets in an individualâ€™s life during Covid-19 Pandemic Methodology: Questionnaire on PSS-10-C and a questionnaire on human animal relationship with relevant demographic data was distributed electronically via social media to subjects of age group more than 18 years after taking consent for participation in the study during April-May 2021. Subjects having any psychiatric disorder or taking any medication were excluded from the study. Result: Out of 230 participants 69 (30%) had pets amongst which dog was the most preferred pet. Many pet owners were concerned about their pet during lockdown, reason being restriction to veterinary treatment, etc. Stress of non-pet owners was significantly high as compared to pet owners. Regardless of owning a pet, 82% participants agreed that pets act as stress busters. Conclusion: Human-animal bond has beneficial effect on humanâ€™s physical and mental health. Animal assisted therapy utilises this interaction to promote the health of patients. Animals as pet played an important role in reducing stress among their owners during COVID-19 pandemic. Animal assisted therapy therefore can be promoted in certain ailments which will not only cure the patients but improve the well-being of animals too.","Ahmed, I.; Lakshmi, V.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pets+During+Covid-19+Pandemic:+Significant+Role+as+Stress+Buster+for+their+Owners","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research; 13(5):162-169, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28546,""

"Psychiatric comorbidities and dehydration are more common in children admitted to the emergency department for eating disorders in the COVID-19 era","Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and home confinement had a significant impact on children, especially on those with eating disorders (ED). The primary objective of this retrospective study was to describe and analyze the demographic and clinical profiles of children presenting with ED during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a retrospective review of clinical charts of patients with ED younger than 18Ã‚Â years who accessed the emergency department of the Bambino GesÃƒÂ¹ Children's Hospital, Rome, between March 2019 and March 2021. Of these, we reported and compared the demographic, clinical and laboratory data before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and looked for predictors of ED severity. A total of 211 admissions for ED were recorded. The patients, mostly females (86.3%) were on average 14.1Ã‚Â years old. The mean weight loss on admission was 11Ã‚Â kg. Bradycardia was observed in 31.3% of the study sample. 16.6% of patients had an associated psychiatric disorder and 60.2% required psychotropic drugs. 68.7% of the patients required hospitalization. Respectively, 96 and 115 patients were admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The latter were hospitalized more (78.3 vs 57.3%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), yet for less time (19 vs 26Ã‚Â days; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), had a higher mean serum creatinine (0.68 vs 0.47; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and were more frequently diagnosed with an associated psychiatric disorder (23.5 vs 8.3%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003). Our study shows a significant increase of hospitalizations of children with ED during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a shorter length of stay, more psychiatric comorbidities, and some distinctive features at the laboratory work-up, such as an increase of serum creatinine and/or a reduction of serum albumin.

"Long-lasting clinical symptoms 6Ã‚Â months after COVID-19 infection in the French national cohort of patients on dialysis","Systematic reviews have shown a high prevalence of long-term persistent sequelae after COVID-19. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and risk factors associated with long-lasting clinical symptoms (LLCS) in survivors on chronic dialysis at 6Ã‚Â months after the onset of acute COVID-19 infection in the pre-vaccination period. This national cohort study included all French patients on dialysis who had SARS-Cov-2 infection between March and December 2020 and who were alive and still on dialysis 6Ã‚Â months after infection. A form was filled in at 6Ã‚Â months concerning the presence of the following persistent symptoms: extreme fatigue, headache, muscle or weight loss ofÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°5%, respiratory sequelae, tachycardia, chest pain, joint or muscle pain, persistent anosmia or ageusia, diarrhea, sensory disorders, neuro-cognitive disorders, post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression, and anxiety. Complete survey results were available for 1217 patients (25.2% of those included); 216 (17.7%) had some LLCS. Probability of 6-month LLCS was higher in patients who were hospitalized in a medical or intensive care unit: OR 1.64 (95% CI 1.16-2.33) and 5.03 (2.94-8.61), respectively. Younger patients had a lower probability of LLCS. Each year on dialysis, as well as diabetes, overweight or obesity were associated with a higher probability of LLCS by 1.03 (1.01-1.06), 1.53 (1.08-2.17), 1.96 (1.10-3.52) and 2.35 (1.30-4.26), respectively. This national study shows that at least one in six patients on dialysis who have COVID-19 will have LLCS. Systematic screening in dialysis patients would allow us to identify those who need more careful prevention and long-term care and to address them towards a rehabilitation pathway.","Belkacemi, Baouche, Gomis, Lassalle, Couchoud","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-022-01295-z","20220316","Cohort-registry; Dialysis; SARS-Cov-2; Sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28549,""
"Post-COVID-19 syndrome: assessment of short- and long-term post-recovery symptoms in recovered cases in Saudi Arabia","Recent studies investigated the endurance of symptoms and occurrence of complications three monthsÃ‚Â afterÃ‚Â SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to examine the prevalence, variation, and severity of continual symptoms in the post-COVID-19 using a single-center questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed among populationÃ‚Â in Saudi Arabia who recovered from COVID-19 between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. A total of 744 participants completed the questionnaire, 318 (42.8%) recovered less than 3Ã‚Â months, 75 (10.1%) recovered 3-6Ã‚Â months, while 351 (47.2%) recovered more than 6Ã‚Â months. About half of the participants 353 (47.5%) had incessant symptoms and of those patients, more than half had two or more symptoms. Common symptoms included fatigue 189 (25.4%), headache 118 (15.9%), and myalgia 63 (8.5%). Of the participants, 189 (21.4%) experienced continual symptoms including anxiety in 98 (13.2%) and depression in 70 (9.5%). The current study showed a high proportion of individuals with long-COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, proper assessment of the individuals in the post-recovery period can guide the patients to the relevant clinics for rehabilitation.

"Determinants and Effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination Among Patients with Atopic Dermatitis: A Population-Based Study","The effectiveness of messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is yet to be delineated. It remains largely unknown how AD-related immunosuppressive medications affect the development of vaccine-induced immunity. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine among patients with AD and to assess its effectiveness in protecting against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality. A specific analysis additionally examined whether AD-related immunosuppressive drugs influenced the effectiveness of the vaccine. A population-based cohort study was performed using the database of Clalit Heath Services, Israel, to follow adult patients with AD. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses were utilized to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) of the incident outcomes. As of 26 June, 2021, 58,582 (75.4%) out of 77,682 adult patients with AD completed two BNT162b2 vaccine doses in Israel. Adulthood-onset AD (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.28-1.40; p &lt; 0.001) and moderate-to-severe AD (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.21; p = 0.001) predicted an increased vaccination rate. Vaccinated patients with AD demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted HR, 0.20; 95% CI 0.16-0.26; p &lt; 0.001), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.08; 95% CI 0.04-0.18; p &lt; 0.001), and COVID-19-associated mortality (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI 0.01-0.20; p &lt; 0.001). Exposure to immunosuppressive drugs (n = 597; 0.8% of patients) did not impair the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination (adjusted HR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.13-6.81; p = 0.958). In patients with AD, COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective for a wide range of COVID-19-related outcomes. Immunosuppressive drugs did not impair the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in this retrospective analysis.","Kridin, Schonmann, Onn, Bitan, Weinstein, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40257-022-00672-5","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28551,""
"Mental health of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 during mandated isolation and compliance with recommendations-A population-based cohort study","Isolation is an indispensable measure to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it may have a negative impact on mental health and overall wellbeing. Evidence on the isolation experience, facilitating and complicating factors is needed to mitigate negative effects. This observational, population-based cohort study enrolled 1547 adults from the general population with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to authorities between 27 February 2020 and 19 January 2021 in Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed the proportion of individuals reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety before, during and after isolation (by DASS-21), and queried worries, positive experiences, and difficulties. We analyzed the association of these outcomes with socio-demographics using ordinal regression. Additionally, we report free-text statements by participants to capture most important aspects of isolation. The proportion of participants affected by depression or anxiety increased during isolation from 10Ã‚Â·0% to 17Ã‚Â·1% and 9Ã‚Â·1% to 17Ã‚Â·6%, respectively. Ordinal regression showed that taking care of children increased the difficulty of isolation (OR 2Ã‚Â·10, CI 1Ã‚Â·43-3Ã‚Â·08) and risk of non-compliance (OR 1Ã‚Â·63, CI 1Ã‚Â·05-2Ã‚Â·53), especially in younger participants. A facilitating factor that individuals commonly expressed was receiving more support during isolation. Isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 presents a mental burden, especially for younger individuals and those taking care of children. Public health authorities need to train personnel and draw from community-based resources to provide targeted support, information, and guidance to individuals during isolation. Such efforts could alleviate the negative impact isolation has on the mental and physical health of individuals and ensure compliance of the population with recommendations.","Domenghino, Aschmann, Ballouz, Menges, Strebel, Derfler, Fehr, Puhan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264655","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28552,""
"The prevalence of nurse burnout and its association with telomere length pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Burnout is a work-related stress syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Nurse burnout is related to nurses' deteriorating mental health and poorer patient care quality and thus, is a significant concern in healthcare. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has swept the world and distressed the healthcare systems. Because of the body's stress mechanism, it is vital to examine the current prevalence of nurse burnout and understand it at a biological level, using an epigenetic biomarker, telomere length. To determine the prevalence of burnout among nurses in the Peri-Operative and Labor &amp; Delivery settings pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the effects of burnout on absolute telomere length. This is a cross-sectional study assessing the prevalence of nurses' burnout and the relationships between nurses' burnout and telomere length. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to stop the study during the mid of data collection. Even though the study was not designed to capture changes before and during the pandemic, we analyzed two groups' data before and during the pandemic. The study took place in a US hospital. Nurses in the hospital's Operating Room, Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, and Labor &amp; Delivery Unit participated in the study. Maslach Burnout Inventory survey and nurses' demographics were administered online. Telomere length was measured via finger-prick blood. 146 nurses participated in the study, with 120 participants' blood samples collected. The high-level burnout rate was 70.5%. Correlation analysis did not reveal a direct correlation between nurse burnout and telomere length. However, in a multiple regression analysis, the final model contained the burnout subscale of emotional exhaustion, years as an RN, and work unit's nursing care quality. There was a low degree of departure from normality of the mean absolute telomere length in the pre-pandemic group and a substantial degree of departure in the during-pandemic group. Nurse burnout is a prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, and this study indicates that nurses currently experience high levels of burnout. Nurses' cellular biomarker, telomere length, is shorter in the group of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Appropriate measures should be implemented to decrease nurses' burnout symptoms and improve nurses' psychological and physical health. Nurses, especially those younger than 60, report higher burnout symptoms, particularly emotional exhaustion. This study indicates the need for intervention to promote nurses' health during the pandemic and beyond. If not appropriately managed, nurse burnout may continue to be a significant issue facing the healthcare system.","Wei, Aucoin, Kuntapay, Justice, Jones, Zhang, Santos, Hall","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263603","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28553,""
"Association between social isolation and reduced mental well-being in Swedish older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of cardiometabolic diseases","Social isolation has been recommended as a strategy for reducing COVID-19 risk, but it may have unintended consequences for mental well-being. We explored the relationship between social isolation and symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed the role of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) in this association. Between May and September 2020, 1,190 older adults from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen were surveyed about their behaviors and health consequences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 913 (76.7%) participants reported socially isolating at home to avoid infection during this period. Social isolation was associated with a greater likelihood of reduced mental well-being (i.e., feelings of depression or anxiety) (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.15-2.65). In joint exposure analysis, there was a significant likelihood of reduced mental well-being only among people who were socially isolating and had CMDs (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.22-3.71) (reference: not isolating, CMD-free). In conclusion, social isolation as a COVID-19 prevention strategy was related to reduced mental well-being in an urban sample of Swedish older adults, especially among individuals with CMDs.","Dove, Guo, CalderÃƒÂ³n-LarraÃƒÂ±aga, Vetrano, Fratiglioni, Xu","https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203956","20220316","COVID-19; anxiety; cardiometabolic disease; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28554,""

"Suicide attempts as a cause of pelvic injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic","We decided to compare the incidence and spectrum of pelvic fractures in 2020 affected by the anti-pandemic measures due to COVID-19 with previous years 2018 and 2019. This retrospective study included 391 patients treated at the author's clinic for pelvic fractures. From the medical records we recorded gender, age, mechanism of injury, trauma energy, fracture type based on the AO classification and severity of injury. As expected, we observed no difference in the number of fractures caused by simple falls. However, we failed to prove a reduction in the number of high-energy injuries. In contrary, we observed an increase in the number of high-energy injuries in the period between lockdowns (p=0.0375). A surprising result was a dramatic increase in suicide attempts as a cause of pelvic fractures, with 6 (2.2 %) in 2018 and 2019 compared to 13Ã‚Â (10 %) in 2020 alone (p=0.0017). We observed the increased number of suicidal attempts only on a limited number of specific patients with pelvic fractures; therefore,Ã‚Â we cannot formulate any general conclusions regarding the incidence of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To examine changes in adult MH-related emergency department (ED) visits into the Delta variant pandemic period and identify changes and inequities in these visits before and during COVID-19 case surges. This epidemiologic cross-sectional study used National Syndromic Surveillance Program data from US adults aged 18 to 64 years from 1970 to 2352 ED facilities from January 1, 2019, to August 14, 2021. All MH-related ED visits and visits related to 10 disorders (ie, anxiety, depressive, bipolar, schizophrenia spectrum, trauma- and stressor-related, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, disruptive behavioral and impulse, obsessive-compulsive, eating, and tic disorders) were identified. The following periods of MH-related ED visits were compared: (1) high Delta variant circulation (July 18-August 14, 2021) with a pre-Delta period (April 18-May 15, 2021), (2) after a COVID-19 case peak (February 14-March 13, 2021) with during a peak (December 27, 2020-January 23, 2021), and (3) the Delta period and the period after a COVID-19 case peak with the respective corresponding weeks during the prepandemic period. ED visits for 10 mental disorders and all MH-related visits. This cross-sectional study included 107Ã¢â‚¬Â¯761Ã¢â‚¬Â¯319 ED visits among adults aged 18 to 64 years (59Ã¢â‚¬Â¯870Ã¢â‚¬Â¯475 [56%] women) from January 1, 2019, to August 14, 2021. There was stability in most MH-related ED visit counts between the Delta and pre-Delta periods (percentage change, -1.4% to -7.5%), except for eating disorders (-11.9%) and tic disorders (-19.8%) and after a COVID-19 case peak compared with during a peak (0.6%-7.4%). Most MH-related ED visit counts declined in the Delta period relative to the prepandemic period (-6.4% to -30.7%); there were fluctuations by disorder when comparing after a COVID-19 case peak with the corresponding prepandemic period (-15.4% to 11.3%). Accounting for ED visit volume, MH-related ED visits were a smaller proportion of visits in the Delta period compared with the pre-Delta period (visit ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.86) and prepandemic period (visit ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79-0.80). After a COVID-19 case peak, MH-related ED visits were a larger proportion of ED visits compared with during a peak (visit ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) and the corresponding prepandemic period (visit ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.11-1.12). Of the 2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯510Ã¢â‚¬Â¯744 ED visits included in the race and ethnicity analysis, 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯592 (1%) were American Indian or Alaska Native persons, 33Ã¢â‚¬Â¯697 (1%) were Asian persons, 494Ã¢â‚¬Â¯198 (20%) were Black persons, 389Ã¢â‚¬Â¯740 (16%) were Hispanic persons, 5000 (0.2%) were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander persons, and 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯172Ã¢â‚¬Â¯683 (47%) were White persons. There was between- and within-group variation in ED visits by race and ethnicity and increases in selected disorders after COVID-19 peaks for adults aged 18 to 24 years. Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that EDs may have increases in MH-related visits after COVID-19 surges, specifically for young adults and individual racial and ethnic minoritized subpopulations. Public health practitioners should consider subpopulation-specific messaging and programmatic strategies that address differences in MH needs, particularly for those historically marginalized.","Anderson, Radhakrishnan, Lane, Sheppard, DeVies, Azondekon, Smith, Bitsko, Hartnett, Lopes-Cardozo, Leeb, van Santen, Carey, Crossen, Dias, Wotiz, Adjemian, Rodgers, Njai, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0164","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28557,""
"Association of Screen Time With Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Problems in Children 12 Years or Younger: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Currently, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the association between screen time (eg, television, video games) and children's behavior problems. To assess the association between the duration of screen time and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems among children 12 years or younger. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published from January 1960 to May 2021. Reference lists were manually searched for additional studies. Included studies measured screen time (ie, duration) and externalizing or internalizing behavior problems in children 12 years or younger, were observational or experimental (with baseline data), were available in English, and had data that could be transformed into an effect size. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded. Of 25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯196 nonduplicate articles identified and screened for inclusion, 595 met the selection criteria. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Extracted variables were child age, sex, and socioeconomic status; informants and measurement type for screen time and behavior problems; study publication year; and study design and quality. Data were extracted by 2 independent coders and were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was the association of screen time duration with externalizing (eg, aggression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms) and internalizing (eg, depression, anxiety) behaviors or diagnoses. Of the 595 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 87 studies met all inclusion criteria, comprising 98 independent samples and 159Ã¢â‚¬Â¯425 participants (mean [SD] age, 6.07 [2.89] years; 83Ã¢â‚¬Â¯246 [51.30%] male). Increased duration of screen time had a small but significant correlation with more externalizing problems (90 samples; r, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.10-0.12) and internalizing problems (43 samples; r, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08) in children. Several methodological moderators explained between-study heterogeneity. There was evidence of significant between study heterogeneity (I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°87.80). This systematic review and meta-analysis found small but significant correlations between screen time and children's behavior problems. Methodological differences across studies likely contributed to the mixed findings in the literature.","Eirich, McArthur, Anhorn, McGuinness, Christakis, Madigan","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0155","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28558,""
"Mental health of nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","To identify the prevalence of and factors associated with: (1) major depressive episodes; (2) minor psychiatric disorders (MPDs); and (3) suicidal ideation among nursing professionals from a municipality in southern Brazil. Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited 890 nursing professionals linked to 50 Primary Care units, 2 walk-in clinics, 2 hospital services, 1 emergency room service, 1 mobile emergency care service, and 1 teleconsultation service, in addition to the municipal epidemiological surveillance service and the vacancy regulation center between June and July 2020. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire to evaluate the studied outcomes. Associations between the outcomes and variables related to sociodemographic profile, work, health conditions, and daily life were explored using Poisson regression models with robust variance estimators. The observed prevalence of depression, MPDs, and suicidal ideation were 36.6%, 44%, and 7.4%, respectively. MPDs were associated with the assessment of support received by the service as 'regular' (PR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.19-1.85) or 'poor' (PR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.23-1.94), with a reported moderate (PR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.29-2.07), or heavy (PR: 2.54; 95% CI: 2.05-3.15) workload, and with suspected COVID-19 infection (PR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.25-1.66). Major depressive episodes were associated with a reported lack of personal protective equipment (PR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.42), whereas suicidal ideation was inversely related to per capita income &gt; 3 minimum monthly wages (PR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.11-0.68), and positively related to the use of psychotropic drugs (PR: 3.14; 95% CI: 1.87-5.26). Our results suggest that nursing professionals' working conditions are associated with their mental health status. The need to improve working conditions through adequate dimensioning, support and proper biosafety measures is only heightened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oliveira, Treichel, Bakolis, Alves, Coimbra, Cavada, Sperb, Guedes, Antonacci, Willrich","https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2022056004122","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28559,""
"[Perceived risk from COVID-19 and depression, anxiety, and stress among workers in healthcare units]","The objective was to analyze associations between perceived risk from COVID-19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among workers in healthcare units. This was a cross-sectional study of workers from different professions who appeared voluntarily at one of the first COVID-19 Testing Centers in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The workers were invited to answer an online questionnaire from May to August 2020. The COVID-19 Risk Perception Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Of the total sample (N = 2,996), 81.5% were women, and mean age was 40.7 years. About half presented mild, moderate, or severe depression, anxiety, or stress, and the rates for workers with severe symptoms were 18.5%, 29.6%, and 21.5%, respectively. The associations between perceived risk and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress increased with the increase in each symptom's severity. Workers with higher perceived risk from COVID-19 showed higher OR for severe symptoms of depression (OR = 4.67), anxiety (OR = 4.35), and stress (OR = 4.97). The findings point to the demand for measures to protect workers' health and that should not be limited to personal protective equipment. It is essential for health system administrators to promote collective spaces for discussion and actions to favor workers' recovery in the context of a prolonged pandemic.

"Online teaching, quality of life and anxiety of Brazilian dental professors during the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in academic teaching and dental education, but the impact on dental professors' mental health and quality of life remains poorly understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of social distancing and online teaching related to COVID-19 on the quality of life and anxiety of Brazilian dental professors. This was a cross-sectional study conducted from August 2020 to October 2020. Three instruments were used in an online version: a questionnaire about personal data, academic information and online teaching activities, the Generalized Anxiety Disorders 7 (GAD7) scale, and the Abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref) scale. All instruments were sent by e-mail, social media, and messaging apps to private and public universities and professors. Of the 318 responses, 187 (58.8%) were from female professors. Moreover, lack of good internet access and adequate place for online teaching, difficulties in producing teaching materials, and housework roles had a significant impact on the quality of life and anxiety scores (all p-values &lt; 0.05). Also, Brazilian dental professors who declared that they would make greater efforts if the activities were face-to-face had significantly worse quality of life and anxiety scores, and female professors had significantly higher anxiety scores (all p-values &lt; 0.05). These results provide evidence of a negative effect of social distancing and online teaching activities related to COVID-19 outbreak on the health-related quality of life and mental health of Brazilian dental professors.","Pucinelli, Oliveira, Nelson Filho, Silva, Castro, Lima, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2022.vol36.0036","20220316","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28561,""

"Predictors of Covid-19 level of concern among older adults from the health and retirement study","The purpose of this longitudinal study is to construct a prediction model for Covid-19 level of concern using established Covid-19 socio-demographic, lifestyle and health risk characteristics and to examine specific contributions of obesity-related cardiometabolic health characteristics as predictors of Covid-19 level of concern among a representative sample of U.S. older adults. We performed secondary analyses of existing data on 2872 2006-2020 Health and Retirement Study participants and examined 19 characteristics in relation to the outcome of interest using logistic regression and machine learning algorithms. In mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models, a history of diabetes, stroke as well as 1-2 cardiometabolic risk factors and/or chronic conditions were associated with greater Covid-19 level of concern, after controlling for confounders. Female sex, birth cohort, minority race, Hispanic ethnicity and total wealth as well as depressive symptoms were associated with higher level of Covid-19 concern, and education was associated with lower level of Covid-19 concern in fully adjusted mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models. The selected socio-demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics accounted for &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°70% of the variability in Covid-19 level of concern based on machine learning algorithms. Independent risk factors for Covid-19 level of concern among U.S. older adults include socio-demographic characteristics and depressive symptoms.

"Mindful self-care, self-compassion, and resilience among palliative care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Given the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the wellbeing of palliative care providers, there is a growing need to better understand protective variables such as self-care, mindfulness and self-compassion, as they relate to resilience. To investigate mindful self-care, self-compassion, and resilience as reported by palliative care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive, cross-sectional survey. An electronic questionnaire captured data from validated instruments measuring each study variable, as well as participant demographics and perceived impacts of COVID-19 on professional quality of life. Positive, statistically significant correlations were found between mindful self-care, self-compassion, and resilience. These variables were also associated with greater satisfaction with professional life and perceived lessened impairment in physical and/or mental health due to a decrease in self-care activities stemming from altered routines during COVID-19. Those with higher resilience had worked in palliative care longer and also reported higher levels of self-compassion and mindful self-care, explaining 50% of variance. Self-compassion, satisfaction with professional life, and changes in self-care routine due to professional activities in the pandemic explained 44.3% of variance in mindful self-care. Self-compassion, female gender, and working as a frontline responder to the COVID-19 pandemic accounted for 35% variance in resilience levels. Results from this study extend the currently limited knowledge of self-care, mindfulness and self-compassion, as protective variables related to resilience in palliative care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Changes in cannabis use and associated correlates during France's first COVID-19 lockdown in daily cannabis users: results from a large community-based online survey","Lockdown measures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France led to serious public health concerns over people who use illicit drugs, especially in terms of mental health. We assessed changes in cannabis use during the first lockdown in France among daily cannabis users and associated correlates. CANNAVID is a French, national, cross-sectional web-based survey, conducted from 17 April to 11 May 2020. Daily cannabis users agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years and living in France were invited to participate through advertisements. Respondents completed an ad hoc questionnaire on a dedicated online platform. We analyzed changes in cannabis use during the first lockdown (i.e., stopped, decreased, unchanged, or increased) and performed a multinomial logistic regression analysis to evaluate correlates of these changes. Of the 4019 participants, 74.0% were men. Median age was 27Ã‚Â years (interquartile range: 22-37). With regard to cannabis use, 293 (7.3%) persons stopped, 1153 (28.7%) decreased, 1146 (28.5%) did not change, and 1427 (35.5%) increased their use during the lockdown. A multinomial logistic regression model revealed several sociodemographic, behavioral and health-related factors associated with changes in cannabis use. Compared with participants with an unchanged level of cannabis use during the lockdown, those who increased and those who stopped cannabis use were more likely to have increased tobacco and alcohol use and to have experienced depression and sleep disorders intensification. Those who stopped cannabis use were also more likely to have increased benzodiazepine use and to have experienced pain increase during lockdown. France's first COVID-19-related lockdown had a differential impact on daily cannabis users' consumption patterns. Most study respondents reported changes to their cannabis consumption pattern. Those who reported a stable cannabis use were more likely to report fewer negative changes. Specific interventions are needed for this population, as well as research to assess the long-term impacts of these changes.","Mezaache, Donadille, Martin, Le Brun Gadelius, Appel, Spire, Briand Madrid, Bastien, Roux","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00611-x","20220316","COVID-19; Cannabis; Mental health; Pain; Quarantine; Sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28565,""
"Emotional distress in COVID-19 patients in Maldives","Researchers are exploring the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, vaccination and the challenges faced by healthcare authorities. However less focus is being paid towards the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of the patients. This study is a cross-sectional study, measuring the prevalence of emotional distress among patients with COVID-19 in the Maldivian population. This study was conducted in Maldivian nations above 18 of age with COVID-19 who were admitted in isolation facilities. Patients who were on treatment for any other chronic medical conditions, severe and critical COVID-19 disease were excluded. This study was conducted over a period of 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months by administering a local translated version of DASS21 questionnaire. The total of 195 patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 40 (CI at 95% 38-42) years. The respondents were 48.7% men and 51.3% women. Overall, 9% of patients with COVID-19 had depression while 23% of patients had anxiety and 12% of the patients had stress. There was a statistically significant relationship between gender and depression, anxiety and stress (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Symptomatic cases had a significantly higher level of stress than asymptomatic patients (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), but no significant association was observed with symptomatic status and anxiety or depression.

"A comparative study on mental health and adaptability between older and younger adults during the COVID-19 circuit breaker in Singapore","While older age is associated with better emotional well-being, it is unclear whether such age advantages remain during a pandemic. This study examined differences in mental health, adaptive behaviours, social support, perceived stress, digital media usage, and perceived change in circumstances between younger and older adults during the circuit breaker period (partial lockdown) in Singapore. A door-to-door survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of 602 younger (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°302) and older (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°300) adults aged 21-89Ã‚Â years from Singapore from 17 October to 27 November 2020. All participants self-reported their depression, anxiety, stress, adaptive behaviours, social support, perceived stress, change in circumstances, and digital media usage during the partial lockdown period. Older adults were found to report significantly lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress as compared to younger adults. Although older adults were less able to perform essential activities during the lockdown, they were more adaptable psycho-socially. Logistic regression analyses revealed that for older age group, adaptability and health status significantly predicted better mental health. Older adults had higher odds of low depression scores [odds ratio (OR) 1.81, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.07-3.08], anxiety scores (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.05-3.08), and stress scores (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.72-5.41). In addition, adaptability was found to moderate the relationship between age and mental health with detrimental effects of low adaptability stronger for younger adults than older adults. During the lockdown period, older adults in Singapore had better mental health, perceived less stress-related concerns and were more adaptable psycho-socially as compared to younger adults. This study's findings extend current evidence that age-related advantages in emotional well-being persisted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yu, Tou, Low","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12857-y","20220316","Aging; Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28567,""
"Eating attitudes, depressive symptoms, physical activity levels and menopausal symptoms of postmenopausal women diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a case-control study","The purpose of this study is to compare the eatingt attitudes, depressive symptoms, physical activity levels, and menopausal symptoms of postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and women without. This study utilized a case-control design and included 137 postmenopausal women, 70 women in the case group and 67 women in the control group. The case group was composed of all postmenopausal women who were registered in the COVID-19 polyclinic of a public hospital in Turkey, who had positive PCR results, and who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 at least one month before. Each woman in the case group was matched by age (Ã‚Â±1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year) with controls who visited the Family Health Center for any reason and who did not have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease. Data were collected using the Socio-demographic Form, the Eating Attitudes Test, the Beck Depression Inventory, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, and the Menopause Rating Scale between the 27<sup>th</sup> of January and the 5<sup>th</sup> of March 2021. Statistical analyses included percentage distributions, arithmetic means, standard deviation, t-test in independent groups, chi-square, Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, binary logistic regression analysis, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results showed that women who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 had the risk of experiencing postmenopausal symptoms 1.36 times more than the women without (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.36 , %95Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.084-1.48, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). A statistically significant difference was found between women who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and women without (FÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.372, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) in the ANCOVA model established to see the effect of depressive symptoms, physical activity levels, and eating attitudes on menopausal symptoms by eliminating the effects of smoking, age and menopause hormone therapy (MHT) use, and it explained 4.2% of the variance (ÃˆÂ 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.042). This study showed that postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 experienced more menopausal symptoms. Health professionals are recommended to carefully evaluate the menopausal symptoms of postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with COVID-19.","Nacar, Timur TaÃ…Å¸han","https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2022.2047139","20220316","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Eating attitudes; Menopausal symptoms; Physical activity level; Postmenopausal women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28568,""
"A Data-Driven Robust Optimization Model by Cutting Hyperplanes on Vaccine Access Uncertainty in COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Chain","The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic sparked such a wave of concern that made access to vaccines more necessary than before. As the vaccine inaccessibility in developing countries has made pandemic eradication more difficult, this study has presented a mathematical model of a sustainable SC for the COVID-19 vaccine that covers the economic, environmental and social aspects and provides vaccine both domestically and internationally. It has also proposed a robust data-driven model based on a polyhedral uncertainty set to address the unjust worldwide vaccine distribution as an uncertain parameter. It is acceptably robust and is also less conservative than its classical counterparts. For validation, the model has been implemented in a real case in Iran, and the results have shown that it is 21% less conservative than its classical rivals (Box and Polyhedral convex uncertainty sets) in facing the uncertain parameter. As a result, the model proposes the construction of two domestic vaccine production centers, including Pasteur Institute and Razi Institute, and five foreign distributors in Tehran, Isfahan, Ahvaz, Kermanshah, and Bandar Abbas strategically.","Gilani, Sahebi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2022.102637","20220316","COVID-19 Pandemic, Sustainability, Data-Driven Optimization; Cutting Hyperplanes; Robust Optimization; Vaccine Supply Chain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28569,""
"Racial and socioeconomic status differences in stress, posttraumatic growth, and mental health in an older adult cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the most vulnerable and widened the health disparity gap in both physical and mental well-being. Consequentially, it is vital to understand how to best support elderly individuals, particularly Black Americans and people of low socioeconomic status, in navigating stressful situations during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The aim of this study was to investigate perceived levels of stress, posttraumatic growth, coping strategies, socioeconomic status, and mental health between Black and non-Hispanic, White older adults, the majority over the age of 70. Additionally, we investigated which variables, if any, were associated with posttraumatic growth in these populations. One hundred seventy-six community dwelling older adults (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 76.30 Ã‚Â±8.94), part of two observational studies (The Harvard Aging Brain Study and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Study) in Massachusetts, US, were included in this cross-sectional study. The survey, conducted from March 23, 2021 to May 13, 2021, measured perceived stress, behavioral coping strategies, posttraumatic growth, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated associations with post-traumatic growth in a multiple linear regression model and examined their differences by race with <i>t</i>-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Fisher's exact tests. A second multiple linear regression model was used to examine which coping strategies were associated with posttraumatic growth. Our results indicated no significant difference between the groups in terms of mental health or stress. However, Black participants showed significantly greater posttraumatic growth compared to non-Hispanic, White participants. Additionally, the coping strategies of religion and positive reframing were found to be significantly associated with posttraumatic growth. Furthermore, even with the effects of stress and coping strategies controlled for, race remained significantly associated with posttraumatic growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has differentially impacted Black and non-Hispanic White older adults. These results may help encourage further analysis on geriatric psychiatry as well as understanding how cultural values and adaptations impact posttraumatic growth and mental health in diverse populations.

"The impacts of COVID-19 on clean energy labor markets: Evidence from Multifaceted analysis of public health interventions and COVID-health factors","COVID-19 pandemic has affected clean energy labor market. Using real-time job vacancy data, this study analyzes the impacts of the pandemic on the U.S. clean energy labor market in 2020, including biomass, energy efficiency (EE), electric vehicle (EV), power/microgrid, solar, and wind industries. This study identifies how COVID-health factors and public health interventions influence clean energy job availability. Overall, California had the most energy jobs and experienced a significant decrease in April 2020. EV and solar had the highest percentages of job vacancies during the pandemic in general. Still, lockdowns had the most severe influence on EE and wind jobs. Stay-at-home orders negatively affected clean energy job vacancies in biomass, EV, power/microgrid, and wind. Social-gathering restrictions, however, did not have much influence. Increased COVID tests at the state level had the strongest and most positive influence on clean energy job postings, indicating the importance of a state's ability to manage public health infrastructure or crisis issues. COVID hospitalizations negatively influenced the job vacancies in biomass and wind but did not affect the other four sectors; conversely, as COVID death numbers increased, the number of jobs in biomass, EV, power grid, solar, and wind decreased, but not in EE jobs.","Chen, Liu, Greig, Shen, Shi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.112880","20220316","COVID-19; Clean energy jobs; Energy efficiency; Green energy jobs; Public health interventions; Renewable energy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28571,""
"Nursing Students Experiences' of Mental Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Phenomenological Study","Acute psychological stress is commonly experienced by university students as they transition through a new learning environment; however, uncontrolled and long-term stress, such as that experienced due to the global respiratory pandemic, contributes to a severe decline in the physical and mental health of nursing students and decreases their academic success. The aim of this study was to investigate the experience of mental wellness as lived by nursing students and to understand how nursing students were coping with the impact of COVID-19. Individual interviews were used as a data collection method in this qualitative study, guided by descriptive phenomenology. Nursing students from two institutions in Western Canada were recruited in the fall of 2020. Interviews with six participants were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Meaning units from the data were transformed into a constituents table which resulted in a rich description of the essence of mental wellness as experienced by participants. Key elements of the experience included: shifting support systems, disconnection, worry, sense of missing out, environmental stress and continual adaptation. The essence of the experience reflected on-going trauma. This research highlighted the importance of acknowledging the persistent, collective trauma experienced by students and faculty alike due to the global pandemic. A trauma-informed approach to nursing education, where positive coping is modelled and a safe learning space is provided, will be required going forward.","Laczko, Hodson, Dykhuizen, Knipple, Norman, Hand-Cortes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.teln.2022.03.002","20220316","COVID-19; Student nurses; mental health; nursing education; pandemic; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28572,""
"Strategies utilized to prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in two congregate, psychiatric healthcare settings during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial effect on the delivery of psychiatric health care. Inpatient psychiatric health care facilities have experienced outbreaks of COVID-19, making these areas particularly vulnerable. Our facility used a multidisciplinary approach to implement enhanced infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions in our psychiatric health care areas. In a 16-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic, our 2 facilities provided &gt;29,000 patient days of care to 1,807 patients and identified only 47 COVID-19 positive psychiatric health inpatients (47/1,807, or 2.6%). We identified the majority of these cases by testing all patients at admission, preventing subsequent outbreaks. Twenty-one psychiatric health care personnel were identified as COVID+ during the same period, with 90% linked to an exposure other than a known positive case at work. The IPC interventions we implemented provided multiple layers of safety for our patients and our staff. Ultimately, this resulted in low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates within our facilities. Psychiatric health care facilities are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks because they are congregate units that promote therapeutic interactions in shared spaces. IPC interventions used in acute medical care settings can also work effectively in psychiatric health care, but often require modifications to ensure staff and patient safety.","Schultz, Miller, Stancill, DiBiase, Ashcroft, Bybel, Gala, Penaskovic, Perryman, Teal, Weber, Witek, Zarzar, Sickbert-Bennett","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2022.02.013","20220316","Infection control; Infection prevention; Isolation precautions; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-17","",28573,""
