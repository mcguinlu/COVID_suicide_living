"Virtual Assessment of Patients with Dry Eye Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: One clinicians experience","Objectives To report on 1) the impact of DED on social, mental, and financial well-being, and 2) the use of virtual consultations to assess DED during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design & Methods An exploratory retrospective review of 35 charts. Telephone consultations for patients with DED conducted during the first lock-down period in Ontario in 2020 were reviewed. Results The most commonly reported DED symptoms were ocular dryness, visual disturbances, and burning sensation. The most common dry eye management practices were artificial tears, warm compresses, and omega-3 supplements. 20.0% of charts documented worsening of DED symptoms since the onset of the pandemic and 17.1% reported the lockdown had negatively affected their ability to perform DED management practices. 42.8% of patients reported an inability to enjoy their daily activities due to DED symptoms. 52.0% reported feeling either depressed, anxious, or both with 26.9% of patients accepting a referral to a social worker for counselling support. More than a quarter of the charts recorded financial challenges associated with the cost of therapy, and more than a fifth of patients reported that financial challenges were a direct barrier to accessing therapy. Conclusions Patients living with DED reported that their symptoms negatively affected their daily activities including mental health and financial challenges, that in turn impacted treatment practices. These challenges may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephone consultations may be an effective modality to assess DED symptom severity, the impact of symptoms on daily functioning, and the need for counselling and support.","Caroline  G McKenna; Pierre Ibrahim; Rookaya Mather","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.07.22272050","20220309","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28138,""
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of Long COVID symptoms","Background Ongoing symptoms or the development of new symptoms following a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis has caused a complex clinical problem known as Long COVID. This has introduced further pressure on global healthcare systems as there appears to be a need for ongoing clinical management of these patients. LC personifies heterogeneous symptoms at varying frequencies. The most complex symptoms appear to be driven by the neurology and neuropsychiatry spheres. Methods A systematic protocol was developed, peer reviewed and published in PROSPERO. The systematic review included publications from the 1st of December 2019 30th June 2021 published in English. Multiple electronic databases were used. The dataset has been analysed using a random-effects model and a subgroup analysis based on geographical location. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were established based on the data identified. Results Of the 302 studies, 49 met the inclusion criteria, although 36 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The 36 studies had a collective sample size of 11598 LC patients. 18 of the 36 studies were designed as cohorts and the remainder were cross-sectional. Symptoms of mental health, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, neurological, and pain were reported. Conclusions The quality that differentiates this meta analysis is that they are cohort and cross-sectional studies with follow up. It is evident that there is limited knowledge available of LC and current clinical management strategies may be suboptimal as a result. Clinical practice improvements will require more comprehensive clinical research, enabling effective evidence-based approaches to better support patients.","Arun Natarajan; Ashish Shetty; Gayathri Delanerolle; Yutian Zeng; Yingzhe Zhang; Vanessa Raymont; Shanaya Rathod; Sam Halabi; Kathryn Elliot; Peter Phiri; Jian qing Shi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.08.22272091","20220309","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28139,""
"Surviving and growing in the post-COVID world: the case of Indian hotels (Special Issue: How are hospitality and tourism businesses in India responding to the Covid-19 pandemic?)","Purpose: As the world tries to come to terms with the exact economic and human cost of the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses are trying to discern and act on the implications of the ""new normal"" in order to survive and grow. Amongst all the industries impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, travel and tourism has been the hardest hit. Operators across the value chain are trying to innovate and improvise in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on cash flows and working capital. The primary purpose of this paper then is to take a closer look at the measures adopted by the Indian hotel industry to restore revenues, conserve resources and attain greater operational and cost efficiencies in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. The article also brings to the fore the growth-enhancing measures adopted by the industry in anticipation of a ""new normal"" in the post-Covid world. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on primary data collected via a survey, followed by a series of interviews with a select group of senior finance managers from a wide spectrum of hotels based in India. Findings: Our findings suggest that Indian hotels have adopted several measures to enhance cash flows/revenues, reduce operating costs and cash outflows and conserve resources in order to tide themselves over during the crisis. Prominent cash flow-enhancing measures include price drops on special offers and reductions on list prices. Cost-cutting measures include economizing on energy consumption, reductions in labour costs and the postponement of maintenance expenses and discretionary spending. Resource conservation measures that have been adopted focus on postponement of capital expenditure and an increasing shift to localizing supply chains. Growth-enhancing measures adopted by the industry in anticipation of the long-term ""new normal"" include restructuring of the workforce and measures aimed at attracting domestic tourists and increasing product diversity. Originality/value: This study attempts to understand the short-term and long-term financial management strategies adopted by Indian hotels in the face of unprecedented disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind in the Indian context.","Raju, Majumdar","https://doi.org/10.1108/WHATT-05-2021-0064","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes; 13(5):584-598, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28140,""
"Fear of the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease: Relationship to psychological and physical outcomes","BACKGROUND: The fear of contracting COVID-19 has taken a significant toll on the psychological and physical health of adolescents and young adults (AYA), especially those with chronic health conditions. AYA with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are at increased risk for poor psychological and physical well-being. However, to date, there is no published research examining the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV- 19S) in AYA with IBD. AIMS: To assess: 1) the reliability of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in AYA with IBD, and 2) how the fear of COVID-19 relates to key psychological (i.e., anxiety, depression) and physical (i.e., fatigue, pain, disease activity) outcomes in AYA with IBD. METHODS: This ongoing study is a collaboration between Stanford University and ImproveCareNow. Participants included 64 AYA with IBD (M=18.7 years old;52% Ulcerative Colitis;60% female;60% White). Participants completed a one-time online survey. Correlation analyses examined the association between fear of COVID-19, outcome variables (i.e., anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, disease activity), and demographic variables. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses (using the F test) further examined the association between fear of COVID-19, outcome variables, and significant demographic variables (i.e., age, sex). RESULTS: The internal reliability of FCV-19S was measured using Crohnbach's alpha (a=0.88), indicating high internal consistency. Correlation analyses demonstrated that fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with anxiety, depression, and fatigue (Table 1). The overall MLR models were significant for anxiety (P&lt;0.001), depression (P=0.002), and fatigue (P=0.031), but not for pain and disease activity. Fear of COVID-19, age, and sex accounted for 29% of the variance in anxiety, 27% of the variance in depression, and 17% of the variance in fatigue. Fear of COVID-19 was not a significant independent predictor of outcomes (Table 2). Female sex was a significant independent predictor for greater levels of anxiety (b=-0.31, P=0.016) and depression (b=-0.35, P=0.008). Older age was a significant independent predictor for greater levels of depression (b=0.29, P=0.031). CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest that FCV-19S can be reliably assessed in AYA with IBD. Analyses indicate that fear of COVID-19 is associated with anxiety, depression, and fatigue in AYA with IBD. While COVID-19 fear may be important in explaining these outcomes, female sex independently predicted increased anxiety and depression, and older age independently predicted depression. This highlights the importance of assessing relevant demographic variables (e.g., female sex, young adults) when considering predictors of adjustment in AYA with IBD. Research should further investigate fear of COVID-19 in larger, more diverse IBD populations to better understand its relationship to key IBD outcomes.","Neiman, N.; Anjur, K.; Ming Yeh, A.; Bensen, R.; Wren, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izac015.144","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; 28(SUPPL 1):S89-S90, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28141,""
"'Same storm, different boat' Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, with or without shielding: A qualitative study","Background: During the Covid-19 pandemic, patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disese (IBD) were advised about shielding based on clinical risk assessment. We explored experiences of IBD patients who did or did not shield during three UK lockdowns. Methods: Participants aged 18 years+ with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease, Ulcerative Colitis or IBD-Unclassified, who had shielded or not during any lockdown period were recruited from Crohn's and Colitis UK. Semi-structured online or phone interviews (captured February-May 2021) were audio-recorded, transcribed professionally, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Of 43 participants, 24 shielded;median age 38 years (19- 63 years);27 (62.7%) females;diagnosed with Crohn's Colitis (n=2), Crohn's disease (n=21), Ulcerative colitis (n=18) and IBD-Unclassified (n=2). Median disease duration 13 years (0.6-36 years). Participants were assessed as high (n-=10), moderate (n=23) and low (n=10) risk. Four main themes emerged: Vulnerability and Risk;IBD Preparedness;The Two Faces of Janus and Transitions. Vulnerability and Risk: The 'Clinically Extremely Vulnerable' label caused alarm, despite bringing benefits. Conflicting information caused confusion;some made their own decision about risk which did not always match official advice. Participants felt vulnerable to higher risk caused by others' behaviour. Some feared catching Covid. IBD Preparedness: Living with IBD prepared participants for shielding/ social distancing. Many felt others now appreciated their usual world of periods of isolation and missing out on social events. Some realised the need to take their IBD more seriously. The Two Faces of Janus: The pandemic brought benefits and challenges to most participants. Working/studying from home often impacted positively on symptoms such as urgency and fatigue, as work and travel-related stresses eased. Loss of physical social contact with others was very distressing;many adopted new wellbeing activities to overcome social isolation. Few found the pandemic experience wholly positive. Transitions: the experience of lockdown changed over time, as did shielding patterns. The easing of restrictions (March-June 2021) left shielding and non-shielding participants feeling confused, since they felt the risk remained. Some participants continued to shield or be socially distant, often mistrusting others to behave responsibly. Conclusion: The pandemic had positive and negative effects for shielding and non-shielding participants alike. Adherence to Government shielding and/or social distancing guidelines was threatened by rising concerns about mental health and wellbeing. Any patient, regardless of official risk status, may need support to re-integrate socially.","Kemp, K.; Avery, P.; Bryant, R.; Cross, A.; Danter, K.; Kneebone, A.; Morris, D.; Walker, A.; Whitley, L.; Dibley, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab232.858","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Crohn's and Colitis; 16:i624, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28142,""
"Uptake of a switching program for patients receiving intravenous infliximab and vedolizumab to subcutaneous preparations","Background: Recent trials support the clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (sc) biologic treatment for IBD maintenance therapy. Administration of sc injections could reduce the financial burden and time required to attend for infusions and allow IBD service providers to manage increasing clinical demand. We evaluated the uptake and rationale for choosing to switch from intravenous (iv) infusions to sc injections, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on IBD service provision. Methods: All adult patients receiving standard dosing maintenance iv Infliximab or Vedolizumab therapy at a tertiary IBD centre were offered a switch to the respective sc formulations. We investigated the uptake of the switch from iv infusions to sc injections and utilised a standardised patient questionnaire to determine the rationale for switching to sc injections or not, and to identify areas for improvement in IBD service provision for the switching process. Results: In a cohort of, 232 eligible patients (258 total patients, 190 infliximab, 68 vedolizumab, 26 no longer eligible), 58% of patients receiving Infliximab and, 59% of patients chose to switch to sc treatment. Of the, 26 ineligible patients, 6 were switched to an intensified treatment schedule, 12 switched to a different biologic, 2 moved out of area, 5 had treatment stopped for clinical reasons and, 1 required operative treatment. There were no significant predictors for willingness to switch relating to patient age, sex, diagnosis, drug, line of treatment or duration of treatment (p&gt;0.05). Early results from patient questionnaires (n=23) demonstrate that a decision to switch was not influenced by the impact on their mental health, Covid-19 risk, the impact on wider IBD service provision or financial savings, but, 70% of switchers did report that time savings influenced their decision. A minority of patients reported feeling pressured to switch (10% switchers and, 15% non-switchers) or had concerns about the safety (20% switchers, 0% non-switchers) and efficacy (40% switchers, 31% non-switchers) of sc injections. The majority of patients feel they were provided with sufficient Conclusion: Switch uptake rates were, 58% with, 90% of patients eligible to switch. We found no evidence that a decision to switch was influenced by age, sex, diagnosis, drug, line of treatment or duration of treatment. Non-switchers value face-to-face support at the IBD unit highly, and switchers value the time saved by administering injections at home. Switching to sc formulation not only provided patients with a choice of saving time usually required for iv administration but also reduced pressure in an overstretched IBD service.","Alice, H.; Gemma, B.; Selinger, C.

"Asking teenagers and young adults with IBD;â€œwhat matters to youâ€ A qualitative survey during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Good paediatric to adult transition of IBD care is important to prevent disengagement and poor disease outcomes [1]. The aim of this study was to qualitatively measure what is important to patients before they attended a new transitional service. There may be a dichotomy between the treating healthcare workers' priorities and teenagers' priorities that form a barrier to effective communication. Unprepared services can result in negative consequences for those involved [2] and a greater understanding of what matters to teenagers and young adults may improve the clinicians' ability to facilitate the transition process. Methods: We asked, 75 teenagers and young adults, aged between, 14 and, 21, who attended a new transitional service at a tertiary IBD unit in the North of England, to complete a survey prior to their clinic review. This 'what matters to you' survey included, 12 suggestions they could circle, with no limitations on how many many they selected, but a suggestion to choose up to, 3 topics. The survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and UK national lockdown, between September, 2020 and September, 2021. Results: Conclusion: Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition with potentially a high morbidity from physical symptoms, and it is important not to forget this as a focus of a consultation. Medical therapies and their effects on the patient were important to, 48% of responders, and the transition process should include further education on treatment options with discussions of compliance. The impact on education and schooling feature as a significant topic and should be discussed during transition. Minimising the impact on education and employment should be considered when developing transitional services. Mental health wellbeing and body image were highly significant to a smaller number of patients and remain an important consideration. Interestingly not a single responder including the COVID-19 outbreak as a concern despite universally being on biological therapy or immunomodulators. It is important to note that whilst no patients reported 'smoking, drugs and alcohol' as important, risk-taking behaviours are increased in this patient population [3], they need to be sensitively discussed to become apparent and may be under-represented with the methodology used.

"Distance to distrust: the dilemma for internal stakeholders in post COVID-19 hospitality (Special Issue: Re-imagining a life after COVID-19)","The purpose of the study is to explore host attitudes towards tourism, which may have altered from what it had been, by the impact of the COVID-19. The study examines the possible altered nature of hospitableness, which would be relevant in the future opening of tourism destinations. The increased threats that tourism presents to the host community as a possible cause for the spread of epidemics and the impact of long-term social distancing are explored in the study. Hence, this study has investigated tourism attitudes from the host perspective. Positive and negative attitude to tourism, attitude towards the pandemic and future acceptance of the presence of tourists in their community were the variables measured in the study. The research was conducted among the residents of the city of Kottayam in Kerala, India. Considering the limitations imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, the survey was hosted online. The acceptance of tourists in close physical proximity was negatively perceived by the internal stakeholders. While there was a more positive attitude towards tourist presence in designated ""tourist"" spaces, there was lesser support of interaction in the more personally used ""public"" spaces. The role of personal benefits accruing from tourism as a moderating factor was also supported.","Smitha, Vasudevan, Kumar, F. J.

Understanding resilience in the age of COVID-19 (Special Issue: Re-imagining a life after COVID-19)","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the narratives in many facets of human activities including romantic relationships. As such, this study sought to investigate if COVID-19 stress affects relational resilience among romantic partners. Using the relational resilience theory which has an interpersonal communication theory, we engaged 510 married individuals with self-administered survey questions that elicited information regarding their stress levels, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and coping processes with relational resilience. The study makes interesting and purposeful findings. Results show that COVID-19 stress was negatively significant to relational resilience. Findings also indicated that COVID-19 was positively associated with stress to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and coping process. Besides, the coping process was also significant but negatively associated with relational resilience. Also findings showed that depression, anxiety, and coping mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and relational resilience.","Eluwole, K. K.; Arikewuyo, A. O.; Lasisi, T. T.; Arikewuyo, H.

"Is there a COVID-19 vaccination effect? A three-wave cross-sectional study (Special Issue: COVID-19 and tourism)","This research examines the impact of COVID-19 mobility restrictions and vaccinations on people's behavioural intentions to travel and their actual travel patterns. The study was conducted in Israel using three-wave cross-sectional analysis: June 2020 (n=129), November 2020 (n=211) and April 2021 (n=208). The findings reveal that the main factor supporting tourism is the desire to resume travel and not vaccination. The study also shows that domestic travel is not a substitute for international travel, at least in the case of Israel. Attitudes towards tourism are significant predictors of domestic and international travel intentions and of actual domestic travel. Nevertheless, the belief that tourism is a source of recovery is related only to intentions to travel internationally. Non-clinical depression symptoms are negatively correlated with domestic tourism. Variables previously considered relevant to resuming tourism, e.g. vaccination, economic stress and health risk factors, have little or no influence on future demand, while attitudes regarding tourism emerge as the most important factor.","Ram, Y.; Collins-Kreiner, N.; Gozansky, E.; Moscona, G.; Okon-Singer, H.","https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2021.1960285","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Current Issues in Tourism; 25(3):379-386, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28148,""

"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on older adults in 12-step programs","The purpose of this study was to understand how older adults in recovery from substance use disorders experienced the transition from in-person to virtual 12-step meetings. We interviewed 11 older adults (age 50+) who self-identified as being members of 12-step programs. Participants completed an online survey including standardized measures assessing depression, anxiety, social isolation, and quality of life. Three themes emerged from interviews: Importance of the program;Promises and Limits of Technology;and Concern for Others. Participantsâ€™ high level of commitment to their groups enabled them to adapt quickly to virtual meetings. Participants described their concerns about members of their groups who were unable to make this transition.Older adults in this study adapted quickly to virtual recovery groups. The social support participants received during groups, whether virtual or in person, may have acted as a buffer protecting them from the isolative effects of the pandemic.

"Development and Validation of Structured COVID Perception Interview Guide (COPING) for Assessing the Acute Impact of COVID-19 Diagnosis","Objective Structured COVID Perception INterview Guide (COPING) is a novel tool developed to understand the acute impact after receiving the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Indian setting. The approach carries importance for interviewing patients in a state of shock immediately after receiving the diagnosis of COVID. The tool is developed emphasizing the grief, stigma, and acute psychological perception in the immediate aftermath of receiving the positive test results of COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is characteristically different from other infectious illnesses, a structured interview guide could help to address the concerns related to acute loss of health. Materials and Methods This study follows a mixed method design conducted from August 2020 to January 2021. In-depth telephonic interviews with mild to moderate COVID patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in central India was followed by development of COPING questionnaire. Statistical Analysis Item-Content Validity Index (I-CVI) and Scale-Content Validity Index Universal Agreement (S-CVI/UA) was computed. Factor analysis, Bartlett's test, and Kaiser-Meier-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was performed. Principal component analysis, scree plots, and parallel analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine the number of factors to extract. For measuring internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was computed. Results Out of 40 items, the final tool had 15 items after computing content validity, performing factor analysis and achieving desired level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.702). Five domains identified after factor analysis were awareness, grief/bereavement, stigma, social reciprocity, and stress adaptation/coping. Conclusion COPING is a valid and reliable interview guide for Indian setting that will allow the assessment of perception of patients with acute COVID-19 infection. Taking into consideration the mental health implications of COVID-19, the availability of such a validated and reliable tool is a timely step to address the public health problem and assist the ongoing research on COVID-19 and similar illnesses in the future.","Sutar, R.; Lahiri, A.; Singh, G.; Chaudhary, S.","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1742232","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice;: 8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28151,""
"Association between FIASMA psychotropic medications and reduced risk of intubation or death in individuals with psychiatric disorders hospitalized for severe COVID-19: an observational multicenter study","The acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)/ceramide system may provide a useful framework for better understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and the repurposing of psychotropic medications functionally inhibiting the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system (named FIASMA psychotropic medications) against COVID-19. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA psychotropic medications in patients with psychiatric disorders hospitalized for severe COVID-19, in an observational multicenter study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 545 adult inpatients, 164 (30.1%) received a FIASMA psychotropic medication upon hospital admission for COVID-19. We compared the composite endpoint of intubation or death between patients who received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at baseline and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and other medical comorbidity, and other medications. FIASMA psychotropic medication use at baseline was significantly associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in both crude (HR = 0.42;95%CI = 0.31â€“0.57;p  &lt; 0.01) and primary inverse probability weighting (IPW) (HR = 0.50;95%CI = 0.37â€“0.67;p  &lt; 0.01) analyses. This association was not specific to one FIASMA psychotropic class or medication. Patients taking a FIASMA antidepressant at baseline had a significantly reduced risk of intubation or death compared with those taking a non-FIASMA antidepressant at baseline in both crude (HR = 0.57;95%CI = 0.38â€“0.86;p  &lt; 0.01) and primary IPW (HR = 0.57;95%CI = 0.37â€“0.87;p  &lt; 0.01) analyses. These associations remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Our results show the potential importance of the ASM/ceramide system framework in COVID-19 and support the continuation of FIASMA psychotropic medications in these patients and the need of large- scale clinical trials evaluating FIASMA medications, and particularly FIASMA antidepressants, against COVID-19.","Hoertel, Nicolas, SÃ¡nchez-Rico, Marina, Gulbins, Erich, Kornhuber, Johannes, Carpinteiro, Alexander, AbellÃ¡n, Miriam, de la Muela, Pedro, Vernet, RaphaÃ«l, Beeker, NathanaÃ«l, Neuraz, Antoine, Delcuze, Aude, Alvarado, JesÃºs M.; Cougoule, CÃ©line, Meneton, Pierre, Limosin, FrÃ©dÃ©ric","https://doi.org/10.1038/S41398-022-01804-5","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Translational Psychiatry; 12(1):90-90, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28152,""
"Examining early adolescent positive and negative social technology behaviors and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","Public concerns of how frequently adolescents used screens during the pandemic shutdowns fueled the need to research whether these behaviors were conducive or detrimental to their well-being. The aims of this longitudinal survey study of 586 middle school students in the Northeast U.S. were to examine (a) changes in positive and negative social technology behaviors prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (fall 2019) compared to during the pandemic (fall 2020) including any differences by subgroups and (b) whether changes in social technology behaviors were associated with well-being outcomes and any moderating factors. We found that during this time period, there were significant increases in frequency of checking social media, social technology use before bedtime, and problematic internet use. Students also experienced significant increases in social anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms, but also increased strategies of coping when stressed. By following our preregistered analytical plan, each research aim was addressed within a multilevel modeling framework with time nested within students. We found extremely small effects of social technology behaviors associated with well-being, such as online support seeking being related to strategies when coping with stress. Though we found statistically significant effects, none of the findings met our effect size criteria (i.e., effect of &gt;=.05). Overall, we did not find any strong support that the changes in well-being that adolescents experienced during the COVID-19 social distancing was meaningfully related to their social technology use, which is counter to the popular assumption that adolescent well-being is intricately tied to their social technology use.

"Discrimination and financial, occupational, and emotional well-being in strip club dancers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A call for policy reform","Due to the sexual nature of their work, strip club dancers have long been subject to marginalization and occupational stigma. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, dancers faced unique stressors due to their status as contract workers within the stigmatized commercial sex/adult entertainment industry, and these stressors have likely impacted their financial, occupational, and emotional well-being. We surveyed 102 strip club dancers across 35 U.S. states and Puerto Rico to examine how their well-being has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and to guide recommendations for policy reform. Findings revealed that during the pandemic, dancers experienced occupational stigmatization, structural and systematic exclusion from financial support during the pandemic, and numerous obstacles in obtaining employment outside of their industry, all of which contributed to reported financial and occupational stress. Furthermore, results demonstrated that strip club dancers experienced significant financial loss, and associated financial concern was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Structural changes to financial relief packages are necessary for inclusion of strip club dancers, and there is also a clear need for more efforts to decrease discrimination and violence toward strip club dancers generally, including legal recognition of sex workers as laborers.

"""A cross-sectional examination of Canadian adults' prosocial behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic"": Correction","Reports an error in ""A cross-sectional examination of Canadian adults' prosocial behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic"" by Katie J. Shillington, Leigh M. Vanderloo, Shauna M. Burke, Victor Ng, Patricia Tucker and Jennifer D. Irwin (Journal of Rural Mental Health, Advanced Online Publication, Jan 20, 2022, np). The number of participants who completed the survey was incorrect. The correct number is 2,188. All versions of the article have been corrected. (The following  of the original article appeared in record 2022-24151-001). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with distress and quality of life concerns among adults. Prosocial behavior (i.e., voluntary behavior intended to benefit another) is effective at improving individuals' mental health and well-being. COVID-19-related restrictions limit opportunities for physical and social interactions and might deter adults from engaging in prosocial acts. Impacts might be more pronounced in rural settings. The objectives of this article are to (a) provide a cross-sectional snapshot of Ontario adults' prosocialness during the initial stages of the pandemic (April-July 2020) and (b) examine whether adults' prosocial behaviors are different in urban versus rural contexts. As part of a large-scale longitudinal study, an online survey was administered to Ontario adults at baseline and included demographic information, the Prosocialness Scale for Adults (PSA), and three kindness-related questions. A total of 2,188 participants completed the survey. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, adults experienced high levels of prosocialness (M = 39.2;SD = 5.6). No significant differences were found in relation to prosocialness between adults who lived in urban versus rural locations. Prosocial behavior during the early months of the pandemic was high among Ontarians in both urban and rural areas. Additional research should be conducted to explore prosocial behavior as an approach to mitigate some of the negative effects of the pandemic on individuals' mental health.

"Binge-Watching in Times of COVID-19: A Longitudinal Examination of Changes in Affect and TV Series Consumption Patterns During Lockdown","Public Policy Relevance Statement This is the first large-scale longitudinal study specifically designed to explore the impact of TV series viewing practices on individuals' affective states during the first COVID-19 lockdown. TV series consumption patterns significantly increased over this period. Problematic binge-watching characterized by loss of control seemed to act as a maladaptive strategy to regulate emotional states, whereas watching TV series for social motives emerged as a protective factor in the lockdown context. COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have had major negative effects on individuals' mental health and psychological well-being. Isolated at home, people may engage in recreational activities such as binge-watching (i.e., viewing multiple episodes of a TV series in 1 session) as a strategy to regulate emotional states. This is the first longitudinal study assessing changes in TV series viewing patterns during the first COVID-19 lockdown and examining whether binge-watching was associated with changes in positive and negative affect throughout this period. TV series viewing practices and motivations, binge-watching behaviors, psychopathological symptoms, and affective states were jointly assessed through a 6-week longitudinal online survey at 3 time points (i.e., T1, T2, and T3), in Belgium, France, and Switzerland. Results showed significant increases in individuals' watching habits (e.g., higher daily time spent viewing, expansion of coviewing practices). Results from the longitudinal analyses principally showed that male gender and social motives for TV series watching predicted a decrease in negative affect levels. A problematic binge-watching pattern characterized by loss of control was the single predictor of an increase in negative affect over time. These findings suggest that TV series watching patterns effectively increased during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Watching TV series for social motives emerged as a protective factor, whereas problematic binge-watching seemed to act as a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy throughout these unprecedented circumstances.","Sigre-Leiros, V.; Billieux, J.; Mohr, C.; Maurage, P.; King, D.

"Meeting the needs of children through telemental health: Application for rural mental health using child-parent relationship therapy","Children living in rural communities can have higher levels of mental health needs due to limited access to developmentally appropriate care. Often the lack of play therapy training or access to mental health resources makes it difficult for children or families in rural areas to receive care. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has forced virtual methods of service delivery to increase around the world, which provide opportunities for mental health professionals to reach rural communities and families.

"Mental health services at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games during the COVID-19 pandemic","This letter discusses the provision of mental health services at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mental health service at the polyclinic in the Olympic village was open three times a week from 10 am to 7 pm. Five board-certified psychiatrists were assigned to work in rotation, and on-call telephone support was provided during the absence of a physician on duty. Eight patients visited the polyclinic for mental health services during the Olympics. Among them, three were athletes and five, members of the team staff. During the Paralympics, two patients, both of whom were members of the team staff, visited the polyclinic for mental health services. Thus, 11 people were examined at the polyclinic throughout the Olympic and Paralympic games. All patients, except for one, met the diagnostic criteria for Adjustment Disorder. During the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, those who tested positive for COVID-19 had to follow quarantine rules which possibly took a toll on their mental health. The organizing committee of the games announced that a total of 863 athletes and officials had tested positive, of which 41 were athletes. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were promptly quarantined at a designated isolation facility. Although holding the Olympic and Paralympic games under pandemic conditions appears unprecedented, future games may need to be held in similar circumstances. Therefore, it is critical to summarize the issues ahead of the 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. While it is uncertain whether the pandemic will be under control by then, we suggest that the psychological support system for athletes and officials should be further developed and expanded. The polyclinic at the 2020 Games consisted of only psychiatrists and lacked clinical psychologists. Therefore, the importance of deploying well-trained psychologists among the policlinic staff should be emphasized.

"Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis and its impacts on the mental health of healthcare workers during covid-19","Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis has severely impacted the mental health of frontline workers. With the introduction of the Taliban government, ongoing civil unrest, and other forms of violent attacks, healthcare workers (HCWs) continue to provide patient care despite minimal resources. A severe contraction in the economy, poor supply of medications, political turmoil, and insufficient humanitarian aid have added to pre-existing problems. High levels of insecurity and instability as well as decades of traumatic experiences have contributed to increasing mental health challenges amongst frontline workers. Despite the scarcity of mental health services, HCWs continue to persevere with their service to the community. However, inadequate interventions may have serious implications for HCWs bearing the brunt of multiple traumas. Thus, governmental and international involvement is needed to address both the economic and psychological needs of HCWs in Afghanistan.

"The need for an intersectional Lens in health emergencies","This commentary focuses on the next generation and is largely based on the impact the COVID19 pandemic may have on unborn babies and ""the future of a society"". This theoretical framework is disturbing;they know that public health emergencies have a gender-based impact on the lives of women, especially the most vulnerable among them. Women are the worst affected,3 and global health policies continue to turn their backs on women, even after substantial evidence shows the importance of adopting a gender lens continuity in emergency preparedness and sanitary response. For this comment, gender is not an analytical category for assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health. They fail to provide in-depth analysis of how the social determinants of inequality contribute to disproportionate burdens on women and their health or life projects. There is ample evidence to show how COVID-19 has exacerbated gender-based violence, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality and women's poverty. The reduced framework of this Comment reinforces the patriarchal bias in medicine that ""women are seen only in motherhood"";In fact, this concern for women's mental health sounds like an understatement about the fetus. As researchers and health providers from the Global South, they were particularly surprised by the conclusion of the first paragraph of the Commentary, in which women are reduced to motherhood;Their health is important because it will affect their ""unborn child"" and their ""ability to have equal abilities and opportunities in adulthood"". Pregnant women are under extreme stress in countries where vaccines are not available to them, especially those living in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Methods : Patients and providers completed online surveys evaluating their experience with TMH during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were distributed to 1,178 patients and 287 providers from July 2020 through October 2020. Results : 42.5% of providers and 21% of patients responded to the survey. The majority of patient and provider respondents rated the quality of phone and video visits as â€œequally goodâ€ or â€œsomewhat worseâ€ than in-person visits, while the majority of respondents were â€œsomewhat satisfiedâ€ or â€œvery satisfiedâ€ with video visits. Patients and providers preferred a hybrid model for future care. Common barriers to TMH included privacy, technical difficulties, and wi-fi access. Conclusions : Patients and providers appeared willing to exchange some degree of quality for satisfaction with TMH. This study did not demonstrate with statistical significance any specific patient populations that would benefit more or less from TMH, suggesting that TMH may be a successful model for diverse patient populations. Our results suggest that providers, payors, and regulators should facilitate hybrid care delivery models that incorporate TMH beyond the pandemic.","Benudis, Abigail, Re'em, Yochai, Kanellopoulos, Dora, Moreno, Andrew, Zonana, Jess","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114496","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114496, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28164,""

Data from the Well-being and Experiences Study (The WE Study) were gathered from November to December 2020 in Manitoba, Canada, among a community sample (n=664;ages 16-21 years). Over half of the sample self-reported increased stress/anxiety (57.6%) and depression (54.2%) attributed to the pandemic. Increased alcohol consumption was reported by 18.2% of alcohol-users. Among cannabis-users, 35.1% reported increased use. Conflict with parents, siblings, and an intimate partner increased for 19.9%, 15.2%, and 24.0% of respondents, respectively. Females reported greater financial burden, mental health burden, and conflict with parents than males. Young adults reported greater financial and mental health burden than older adolescents. Higher household income was protective of some experiences. The current study adds to growing evidence that young people were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased access to virtual support resources is needed and should continue following the pandemic. Evidence-based interventions may need to be tailored to females and young adults.","Salmon, Samantha, Taillieu, Tamara L.; Fortier, Janique, Stewart-Tufescu, Ashley, Afifi, Tracie O.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114495","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114495, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28165,""
"Barriers and Poor Telephone Counseling Experiences among Patients Receiving Medication for Opioid Use Disorders","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the relaxation of regulations surrounding Medication for Opioid Use Disorders (MOUD) treatment, including a shift from in-person to telehealth counseling services adjunct to MOUD treatment. We examine how patient-level barriers impact their counseling experiences. Methods We examine data from n=264 participants who completed a cross-sectional survey regarding their experiences with telephone counseling adjunct to MOUD between July to November 2020. Variables examined include: convenience and satisfaction with telephone counseling, comfort and change in relationship with counselor, and how telephone counseling helped with anxiety, depression, anger, substance use, and recovery. Participants also listed the barriers they faced when using telephone counseling. Results Thirty-one percent of the sample (n=81) reported experiencing one or more barriers to telephone counseling. Satisfaction with counseling, perceived convenience, comfort, and beneficial effects of counseling on substance use were associated with increased odds of reporting no barriers (range of p.038 to &lt;.001). Conclusions Many participants reported barriers to telehealth counseling, and these barriers were in turn associated with poorer counseling experiences. Practice Implications Many treatment providers plan to integrate telehealth service provision in their healthcare delivery model, but more research on patient-level barriers and its impact on treatment is needed.","Kang, Augustine W.; DeBrtiz, Audrey A.; Hoadley, Ariel, DelaCuesta, Courtney, Walton, Mary, Hurley, Linda, Martin, Rosemarie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2022.03.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Patient Education and Counseling;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28166,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporal patterns of mental health and substance abuse related mortality in Michigan: An interrupted time series analysis","Summary Background The emergence of SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) had wide impacts to health and mortality and prompted unprecedented containment efforts. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting responses on mental health and substance abuse related mortality are unknown. Methods We obtained records for deaths from suicide, alcohol related liver failure, and overdose from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) for 2006 to 2020. We compared mortality within sex, age, marital, racial and urban/rural groups using basic statistical methods. We compared standardized mean daily mortality incidence before and after the onset of the pandemic using t-tests. We used an interrupted time series approach, using generalized additive Poisson regression models with smoothed components for time to assess differences in mortality trends before and after the onset of the pandemic within demographic groups. Findings There were 19,365 suicides, 8,790 deaths from alcohol related liver failure, and 21,778 fatal drug overdoses. Compared with 2019, suicides in 2020 declined by 17.6%, overdose mortality declined by 22.5%â€”while alcohol deaths increased by 12.4%. Crude comparisons suggested that there were significant declines in suicides for white people, people 18 to 65 and increases for rural decedents, overdoses increased for Black people, females and married/widowed people, and alcohol mortality increased for nearly all groups. ITS models, however, suggested increased suicide mortality for rural residents, significantly increased alcohol related mortality for people =65 and increased overdose mortality in men. Interpretation The onset of the pandemic was associated with mixed patterns of mortality between suicide, alcohol and overdose deaths. Patterns varied within demographic groups, suggesting that impacts varied among different groups, particularly racial and marital groups.

"Advancing Global Palliative Care over Two Decades: Health System Integration, Access to Essential Medicines, and Pediatrics","Introduction : Between 2000 and 2020 Open Society Foundations was one of very few funders that supported global palliative care development and advocacy. Objective : To describe progress made in three priority areasâ€”the integration of palliative care into public health systems, access to controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative careâ€”during those 20 years. Methods : Activities and developments between 2000 and 2020 on global integration of palliative care into health systems, access to and availability of controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care are described and analyzed. Results : Major progress has been made in each area. Whereas in 2000, integration of palliative care into public healthcare systems was on the agenda in just a few pioneering countries, by 2020 a global consensus had emerged that palliative care should be integral to all health systems including in universal health coverage and countries were increasingly taking steps to integrate it into national health systems. While limited availability of these medicines was barely recognized as a public health or drug control issue in 2000, it had become an important priority in global drug policy debates by 2020 and numerous countries had taken steps to improve access to these medicines. Pediatric palliative care, available mostly in a small number of wealthy countries in the 1990s, has seen rapid growth, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and now has a solid foothold in all world regions. Discussion : Despite this progress, significant challenges remain as funding for palliative care advocacy is limited, the overdose crisis in the US has recently had a chilling effect on efforts to improve availability of opioid analgesics, and economic crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic create uncertainty over the future of universal health coverage. Keymessages : This article describes progress made in the last twenty years in three areas that were global funding priorities for the Open Society Foundations. It describes developments between 2000 and 2020 on global integration of palliative care into health systems, access to and availability of controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care.","Lohman, Diederik, Cleary, James, Connor, Stephen, De Lima, Liliana, Downing, Julia, Marston, Joan, Morris, Claire, Pardy, Sara, Pettus, Katherine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.03.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pain and Symptom Management;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28168,""
"Transition to virtual asthma care during the COVID pandemic:An observational study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic increased reliance on virtual care for patients with persistent asthma. Objective This retrospective cohort study assessed changes from in-person to virtual care during the pandemic in patients with persistent asthma compared the same time period prior to the pandemic. Methods Kaiser Permanente Colorado members aged 18-99 with persistent asthma, were evaluated during two time periods (March to October 2019 and March to October 2020). Comparison of asthma exacerbations (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, courses of oral prednisone) and asthma medication metrics were evaluated between the two time periods and by type of care received during the pandemic (no care, virtual care only, in-person care only or a mix of virtual and in-person care). Population characteristics by type of care received during the pandemic were also evaluated. Results Among 7,805 adults with persistent asthma, those who used more virtual care or sought no care during the pandemic were younger, had fewer co-morbidities, mental health diagnoses, or financial barriers. Exacerbations decreased (0.264 to 0.214, p &lt;.001) as did courses of prednisone (0.213 to 0.169), asthma medication adherence (0.53 to 0.54, p &lt;.001) and the Asthma Medication Ratio, a quality-of-care metric, (0.755 to 0.762, p &lt;.001) increased slightly. Patients receiving a mix of in-person and virtual care had the highest rate of exacerbations (0.83) and lower AMR (0.74) despite having the highest adherence. Conclusions Despite an increase in virtual care, asthma exacerbations decreased except among individuals who received both in-person and virtual care, likely because they had more severe disease.","Cvietusa, Peter J.; Goodrich, Glenn K.; Steiner, John F.; Shoup, Jo Ann, King, Diane K.; Ritzwoller, Debra P.; Shetterly, Susan M.; Bender, Bruce G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2022.02.027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28169,""

"Healthcare inequalities in antenatal care in the european region: EBCOG scientific review","It is now well recognized that unacceptable inequalities in maternity care that exist due to a womanâ€™s ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation , age, residential social status within a country can have adverse effects on the outcomes of their pregnancies. Perceived attitudes can lead to dismissal of concerns, breakdown of trust and can affect interactions with maternity services. Women from black and Asian ethnicity are at 2-4 times higher risk of maternal mortality. Similarly women with underlying mental health issues and those with undocumented status are also at higher risk of adverse outcomes during pregnancy and within the first postnatal year. There is need for research, to understand why these different practices exist and how we can more effectively understand and overcome the barriers and factors which can lead to inequality in access to uniform standard of care. Covid-19 pandemic created challenges for the provision of maternity services. Each country responded by their own creative and pragmatic solutions. It is important that individualized care based on a womanâ€™s individual social and medical needs must remain a priority to improve maternity care It is proposed that EU funding should be made available to set up large scale European wide research to inform future policies.","Mukhopadhyay, Sambit, Mahmood, Tahir","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2022.03.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28171,""
"COVID-19 induced PTSD: Stressors for trauma and acute care surgeons","Background At the peak of the pandemic, acute care surgeons at many hospitals were reassigned to treat COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of the pandemic on this population who are well versed in stressful practice has not been fully explored. Methods A web-based survey was distributed to the members of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST). PTSD and the personal and professional impact of the pandemic were assessed. A positive screen was defined as a severity score of =14 or a symptomatic response to at least 5 of the 6 questions on the screen. Results A total of 393 (17.8%) participants responded to the survey. The median age was 43 (IQR: 38, 52) and 238 (60.6%) were male. The majority of participants were surgeons (351, 89.3%), specializing in general surgery/trauma (379, 96.4%). The main practice type and setting were hospital-based (350, 89%) and university hospital (238, 60.6%), respectively. The incidence of PTSD was 16.3% when a threshold severity score of =14 was used and 5.6% when symptomatic responses were assessed. Risk factors for a positive PTSD screen included being single/unmarried (pÂ =Â 0.02), having others close to you contract COVID-19 (pÂ =Â 0.02), having family issues due to COVID-19 (pÂ =Â 0.0004), rural (pÂ =Â 0.005) and suburban (pÂ =Â 0.047) practice settings, a fear of going to work (pÂ =Â 0.001), and not having mental health resources provided at work (pÂ =Â 0.03). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic had a psychological impact on surgeons. Although acute care surgeons are well versed in stressful practice, the pandemic nevertheless induced PTSD symptoms in this population, suggesting the need for mental health resources.","James, Melissa K.; Robitsek, R.

"Forced to stay at homeâ€”impact of curfews on mood during aÂ pandemic for individuals with exercise dependence","The effects of COVID-19-related lockdowns on deterioration of mental health and use of exercise to remediate such effects has been well documented in numerous populations. However, it remains unknown how lockdown restrictions impacted individuals differently and who was more likely to change their exercise behavior and experience negative well-being. The current study examined exercise dependence as aÂ risk factor and its impact on exercise behavior and mood during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns on aÂ global scale in 11,898 participants from 17Â countries. Mixed effects models revealed that reducing exercise behavior was associated with aÂ stronger decrease in mood for individuals at risk of exercise dependence compared to individuals at low risk of exercise dependence. Participants at high risk and exercising more prior to the pandemic reported the most exercise during lockdown. Effects of lowered mood were most pronounced in participants with high risk of exercise dependence who reported greater reduction in exercise frequency during lockdown. These results support recent etiological evidence for exercise dependence and add to aÂ growing body of literature documenting mental health effects related to COVID-19.","Timme, Sinika, Cook, Brian, Schipfer, Melanie, Stoll, Oliver","https://doi.org/10.1007/S12662-022-00800-7","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28174,""
"Switch from Olanzapine Long-Acting Injectable to its Oral Equivalent during COVID-19 Pandemic: a Real World Observational Study","Schizophrenia is a psychiatric condition with chronic evolution, one of the most disabling diseases. The main cause for the diseaseâ€™s progression is considered to be the lack of compliance with the treatment. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are an important treatment option for patients with schizophrenia. Olanzapine long-acting injection (OLZ-LAI) is a pamoate monohydrate salt of olanzapine that is administered by deep intramuscular gluteal injection. The aim of this paper is to report the effects of a sudden and unplanned switch from olanzapine long-acting injectable to oral olanzapine in remitted patients with schizophrenia due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. An observational study conducted in the Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology of Brasov, Romania between April 2020 and March 2021. 27 patients with OLZ-LAI were entered into the study. Of 27 cases, 21 patients preferred to be switched to oral olanzapine (77.77%). Only 6 patients continued with the long-acting formulation. The main reason for the initiation of olanzapine pamoate in all the patients was non-adherence to oral medication (80.95%), and the mean age of starting LAI olanzapine was 36.42Â years (SD Â± 10.09). Within the following 12Â months after switching from olanzapine LAI to OA, 15 patients (71.42%) relapsed, and 12 were admitted to the emergency psychiatric unit. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought multiple disservices to current medical practice. Sudden and unplanned switch from olanzapine long-acting formulation to oral olanzapine was followed by the high rate of relapse in remitted schizophrenia.","Miron, Ana-Aliana, Teodorescu, Andreea, Ifteni, Petru, Irimie, Claudia Alexandrina, Dima, Lorena, Petric, Paula-Simina","https://doi.org/10.1007/S11126-021-09924-9","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatric Quarterly;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28175,""
"Psychological intervention in women with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome after artificial vaginoplasty: a prospective study","Introduction and hypothesisThe negative psychological impact on women with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is long-lasting, resulting from not only the disease itself, but also the cumbersome and painful treatment process. However, little is known about the postoperative psychological status of these patients and related interventions to improve mental health. Here, in our study, we postulated that mental disorders exist in MRKH patients with a surgical neovagina and that psychological intervention will be helpful.MethodsThirty MRKH women who had undergone vaginoplasty were enrolled. All patients had received psychological interventions since February 2020. Depression and anxiety questionnaires prior to and 2 weeks after the final intervention were recorded.ResultsBefore intervention, among 30 MRKH patients after artificial vaginoplasty, the median depression score was 6.00 (25th/75th percentile, 0.00/7.00), and the median anxiety score was 4.00 (25th/75th percentile, 1.00/7.00). After intervention, womenâ€™s depression (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001) scores significantly decreased. The median depression score was 0.00 (25th/75th percentile, 0.00/3.00), and the median anxiety score was 1.00 (25th/75th percentile, 0.00/3.25). Furthermore, stratified analysis found that the depression (p = 0.029) and anxiety (p = 0.019) scores both improved when intervention was performed within 12Â months postoperatively.ConclusionsMRKH patients are at a great risk of depression and anxiety problems after artificial vaginoplasty. Early psychological intervention can alleviate these symptoms. Ongoing psychological support was needed to eliminate emotional burden during MRKH treatment, and further study is sorely needed to identify its appropriate timing and method.","Shao, Shuyi, Wang, Xiao, Lei, Xiaohong, Hua, Keqin, Zhang, Ying","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-022-05075-y","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Urogynecology Journal; 33(3):723-729, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28176,""

"The effect of spiritual fortitude on mental health symptoms amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global traumatic stressor affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Traumatic events often cause significant resource loss and negatively affect mental health and emotional well-being. In the wake of trauma, many people draw on religious or spiritual faith to cope with adversity and suffering. One construct that has received increased attention within the field of religious/spiritual coping is spiritual fortitude (SF), which is one's ability to consistently draw on spiritual and religious resources to cope with negative emotions in the face of stressors (Van Tongeren et al., 2018). In this paper, we present data from 255 participants who completed measures of resource loss related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, SF, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. SF buffered the deleterious relationship between resource loss and mental health symptoms. Specifically, for individuals high in SF, the relationship between resource loss and mental health symptoms was weaker than for individuals low in SF. We conclude by discussing limitations of the current study, areas for future research, and implications for practice.

"Hungry and hesitant: An exploration of the experience of stigma among on-campus food pantry users","Food insecurity on college campuses has been a mainstay with the research community over the past decade. Studies indicate that between 20-59% of college students struggle to access affordable, quality, and nutritious food, leading to numerous negative academic and mental health outcomes. Students who are hungry report lower academic performance and campus engagement, while also reporting higher levels of anxiety and depression. To address this issue, campuses across the country have established on-campus food pantries meant to serve students, staff, and faculty. Unfortunately, a number of barriers have been identified, with stigma being the leading reason that individuals do not visit the pantry. The current phenomenological study seeks to understand the lived experience of stigma as a result of using an on-campus food pantry at public institutions using semi-structured interviews with ten students. These findings help to fill in critical gaps in the research while also helping policymakers and administrators as they develop strategies and practices that promote service utilization and inclusion, while providing food pantry staff and volunteers with critical data useful for enhancing customer service and informing best practices.

"COVID19 Pandemic and the use telepsychiatry in child mental health practices","The article briefs about the importance of telepsychiatry in child mental health practices. The COVID 19 pandemic which started at the end of 2019 has affected the whole world. Children with mental problems and their families have had difficulty in accessing hospitals and psychiatric clinics due to the concern with being infected with the virus. As a solution to this difficult situation one of the methods most frequently applied by the professionals working in the field of child mental health is telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry, which means providing psychiatric support to people outside a clinic, office or hospital through videoconferencing or other tecnologies, has been used more commonly during the pandemic period. The pandemic has provided an opportunity to introduce innovation into mental health care. This and open up new possibilities for care. Studies, especially on the field of child's mental health, will expand our horizons and provide needed guidance for responsible care.

"Perception of life satisfaction in older adults and its relation to resilience, meaning, and depression during covid-19 pandemic: A pilot study","This study set to explore why some older adults age well and perceive living their life successfully, while others perceive living it poorly or unsuccessfully. Successful aging is synonymous of life satisfaction, and it can be defined as: (a) avoidance of disease and disability, (b) maintenance of high physical and cognitive function, and (c) sustained engagement in social and productive activities (Rowe & Khan, 1978). Based on a review of the older adulthood literature, this study focused on factors related to the perception of life satisfaction (Farquhar, 1995;Lou, 2012) and quality of life (Calvo, Carr, & Matz-Costa, 2017);having purpose and meaning in life (Hill & Turiano, 2015);functional activities (Hamer, 2014);depression (Lin et al., 2014);and resilience (Alex 2010;Windle, 2011);hypothesizing that: a) depression would be negatively associated to perceived life satisfaction and actual life satisfaction;b) perceived life satisfaction would be positively associated with actual life satisfaction;c) resilience would be positively associated to perceived life satisfaction and actual life satisfaction;d)functional activities would be positively associated to perceived life satisfaction and actual life satisfaction;e) meaning in life would be positively associated to perceived life satisfaction and actual life satisfaction;f) the COVID-19 social distancing measures would be negatively associated to perceived life satisfaction and actual life satisfaction;and e) high education would be positively associated to perception of life satisfaction and actual life satisfaction. Reliable and valid measures were selected to test the study's hypotheses. These instruments comprised the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL;Diener et al., 1985), the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ;Steger & Frazier, 2015);the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ;Pfeffer, 1982), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS;Yesavage et al., 1983), and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS;Smith et al., 2008). The recruitment strategy aimed at administering a demographic questionnaire and these instruments to a sample of 200 older adults;however, the COVID-19 pandemic interfered with this approach. Instead, a new questionnaire was constructed, extracting four items from each instrument, i.e., the SWL, MLQ, FAQ, GDS, and BRS to construct a general measure of functioning. These items covered areas of life satisfaction, meaning in life, functional activities, depression and resilience. The final sample included 52 older adults, aged 65 to 85 years, living in the South Florida counties of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, during the COVID-19 pandemic. After receiving BRANY IRB approval, the co-investigator contacted the participants who consented to participate and completed two questionnaires: a) general demographics, with four added questions on reactions to COVID-19 and to social distancing measures;and b) a 20-question instrument covering questions on life satisfaction, meaning or purpose in life, functional activities, depression and resilience. Descriptive and inferential statistics showed that the majority of participants reported aging well (n = 31 or 58.5%), average (n = 18 or 34.0%) or poorly (n = 3 or 5.7%), supporting previous findings on the reported life satisfaction of older adults (Strawbridge, Wallhagen, & Cohen, 2002). Most participants (n = 28 or 52.8%) indicated that COVID-19 had affected them, or were unsure of how it affected them (n = 12 or 22.6%). Thirty-five (67.3%) participants were between the ages of 65 and 74, and 17 (32.7%) between 75 and 85 years of age, but no significant differences were found between these age groups.

"Predicting suicide risk in older homebound adults during COVID-19: The role of religious coping","Emerging evidence suggests that suicidal cognition and behavior has increased among homebound older adults over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although prior studies have documented the protective role that church attendance and religious coping may play in mitigating suicide risk, it is unclear how these process may operate in the current context given the need to move many religious to an online or socially-distanced format. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which church attendance and positive religious coping predict suicide risk after controlling for the known risk factors of gender and symptoms of depression. In a sample of 310 homebound, older adults, we ran a series of stepwise, binary logistic regressions. In general, increased symptoms of depression and identifying as male made individuals more likely to fall into the high suicide risk category. Furthermore, positive religious coping, but not church attendance, improved the ability of our models to correctly classify individuals who were at low risk versus high risk for suicide. The more positive religious coping individuals used, the less likely they were to fall into the high suicide risk category.

"How do we learn to hope? The development of the parent report of child hope","Hope has been shown to be an important protective factor, with hypothesized origins in early childhood (Snyder, 2002). However, despite the established importance of hope, little research to date has examined its developmental origins. Specifically, a lack of appropriate instrumentation represents a significant barrier to detecting hope in children under the age of eight years old. The current study meets this need by examining the reliability and validity of a novel parent-report measure of hope in early childhood, titled the Parent Report of Child Hope (PRCH). The PRCH represents an initial step towards understanding individual differences in early childhood hope. The present study also sought to provide an understanding of the developmental influences on hope in early childhood using the PRCH. The PRCH was hypothesized to be a reliable and valid measure of hope in children younger than 8 years old. Specific Aims of the current study included, Aim 1: To provide evidence of the construct validity of the PRCH as an assessment of hope in young children, Aim 2: To provide evidence of the reliability and criterion-related validity of the Parent PRCH as an assessment of hope in young children, and Aim 3: To understand whether factors hypothesized to either contribute to or undermine hope development are predictors of hope, as well as agency and pathways thinking individually, in young children in order to provide a foundational understanding of hope development.Participants included 263 caregivers of children between the ages of 60 and 82 months. Parents completed online surveys containing the PRCH, an adapted, parent-report version of the Children's Hope Scale, and measures assessing child behaviors, social understanding, school readiness, and ego resilience. Parents also reported on the quality of their relationship with their child, their own level of depression, and the impact that COVID-19 has had on their family structure. The overall findings of the present study support the PRCH as a reliable and valid measure of hope in early childhood. The PRCH sufficiently captured individual differences in hope among young children and followed the expected two factor structure, confirming construct validity. The PRCH demonstrated good internal consistency and criterion-related validity. Child social understanding, parent-child closeness, and school readiness positively predicted PRCH scores. Parent-child conflict negatively predicted PRCH scores. Scores on the PRCH predicted ego resilience and prosocial behaviors in children. These findings are consistent with hope theory, which suggested that the developmental origins of hope could be measured in early childhood (Snyder, 2000).

"Resource loss, religious coping, and suicide predictors/outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective study of US racially diverse older adults","Racially diverse older adults are the hardest hit demographic by the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicide desire, which involves thwarted belongingness (TB;chronic loneliness and lack of reciprocal care) and perceived burdensomeness (PB;belief that one is a burden to others and society) has been argued to be exacerbated by this disaster. Conservation of resources (COR) theory posits that disasters, such as a pandemic, may cause individuals and communities to lose resources, leading to psychological distress, including suicide desire. When individuals lose resources, they often turn to their faith to cope (i.e., religious and spiritual (R/S) coping). This study invesitaged resource loss, TB, PB, and religious coping in older adults. Our participants (ages 62-107) varied in suicide desire pre-pandemic to pandemic, delineated by the following four groups: (1) those who never developed suicide desire, (2) those who developed suicide desire during COVID-19, (3) those whose suicide desire decreased during COVID- 19, and (4) those who previously desired suicide and stayed at heightened risk during COVID-19. Resource loss is affiliated with group membership, and particular types of resource loss emerged as more salient. As older adult participants' negative religious coping increased, so did their suicide desire. Implications for treatment are provided, particularly the importance of fostering belongingness and buffering perceived burdensomeness with older adults, addressing specific resource losses and negative religious coping, along with suggestions for future research.

"Actions for a healthy university: Impact on mental and physical health in young people","University students frequently show high levels of physical inactivity as well as a sedentary lifestyle. This fact has been increased after the recent health crisis caused by the COVID-19. Physical exercise, as part of the programs of the Healthy Universities, could be a strategy to face this problem. The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze the effects of an exercise program on the level of physical activity, mental health, and body composition in sedentary university students. A longitudinal study with repeated measures was designed. 14 students were evaluated at three different moments: at the beginning of the exercise program, after program completion, and two weeks after the end of the program. The followings instruments were used: International Physical Activity Questionnaire (level of physical activity), DASS-21 questionnaire (level of stress, depression, and anxiety), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (quality of sleep), a body tape measure (perimeters), and a body composition monitor (weight, BMI, % fat mass and % muscle mass). After five weeks of intervention and two weeks post intervention, the levels of physical activity, mental health and quality of sleep were improved (p &lt; .05). Regarding body composition, muscle mass was the only variable that improved after five weeks of exercise program (p = .04). The results of the present study showed that the actions of universities based on healthy training programs improve the level of physical mental health, and of students.","Sanchis-Soler, G.; Garcia-Jaen, M.; Sebastia-Amat, S.; Diana-Sotos, C.; Tortosa-Martinez, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Actions+for+a+healthy+university:+Impact+on+mental+and+physical+health+in+young+people","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Retos-Nuevas Tendencias En Educacion Fisica Deporte Y Recreacion; - (44):1045-1052, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28188,""
"An exploratory study of knowledge, attitude and practices of rural adolescent girls and life challenges faced amid COVID-19","From a psychopathological viewpoint, COVID-19 is a relatively new form of stressor. COVID-19 and its related containment measures namely lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation are leading to increased loneliness and reduced social interactions having detrimental impact on psychosocial and mental health of general population especially adolescents. Spreading a large amount of uncontrolled news very rapidly with the risk of fake news running faster than the virus itself, and created uncertainties, worries and serious toll on the mental health of adolescents especially rural girls due to the limited access to reliable information in villages and lack of formal professional help groups for resolving their other general crisis amid COVID-19. Hence, an empirical research was undertaken to analyze the existing knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of rural adolescent girls pertaining to COVID-19 and their other life concerns amid COVID. A total of 187 adolescent girls with access to smartphone were purposively selected from seven villages of Distt. U.S. Nagar and Nainital in Uttarakhand. Self structured questionnaire was developed to assess KAP pertaining to COVID-19 and informal talks were carried out to discuss their personal/familial/school issues amid COVID through telephonic call. Majority of rural girls were found to have moderate level of knowledge and were reported to have a neutral attitude towards health seeking and preventive behaviour. Nearly half of the respondents were reported to be following inappropriate practices and had few personal/familial/school related issues which needed immediate attention and help. Telecounseling came as a boon for rural girls amid COVID-19. Post telecounseling, girls' depicted notable improvement in KAP on COVID-19 and better mental health due to getting an authentic and reliable ear for hearing and assistance in finding solutions to their personal/familial or school related issues.","Ritu, Singh, Manisha, Mehra, Niharika, Bisht","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+exploratory+study+of+knowledge,+attitude+and+practices+of+rural+adolescent+girls+and+life+challenges+faced+amid+COVID-19","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Extension Education; 57(2):86-92, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28189,""

"Coaching psychology for mental health: Borderline personality disorder and personal psychological recovery","Traditionally, coaching psychologists have worked with people who aren't experiencing significant mental distress or have diagnosed mental illness. This book describes an innovative and challenging project of bringing coaching psychology to the lived experience of individuals with a diagnosed mental illness, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The authors present a case for why coaching psychology needs to be constructively challenged to broaden its base and be more inclusive and of service to people experiencing BPD in particular. The book describes a coaching interaction involving coaching psychologists and a number of individuals with BPD who had completed a behavioural skills programme (Dialectical Behaviour Therapy;DBT). It explores the epistemological and practice tensions involving the dominance of clinical recovery (elimination of symptoms) in mental health services and personal or psychological recovery (originating in the narratives of people with a diagnosis of mental illness who yearn to live a life worth living). This book, written amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, makes a compelling case for coaching psychologists to engage with the philosophy and practice implications of personal recovery, at both professional and personal levels. It will be vital reading for those engaged in coaching psychology and for the education, training and continuous professional development of coaches, and coaching psychologists.

"'Left Adrift and Wondering What the Future Holds' Learning from Students whose Futures are Drastically Altered by the COVID-19 Pandemic","This qualitative study explores the experiences of students whose education was disrupted by school closures during the COVID-19 global pandemic. With a focus on mental health concerns, the article presents the reflections, thoughts and feelings of students whose public examinations were cancelled and who experienced both the abrupt termination of a phase of their formal education and the loss of traditional ways of marking that ending. Findings show that feelings of loss and illegitimacy augment the stress and anxiety surrounding high-stakes tests and their cancellation. There are several implications for policy and practice, if student mental health is to be foregrounded and taken seriously. Communication, dialogue, and possibilities for taking back agency and critical hope may all go some way towards mitigating these mental health concerns. The validity of using re-purposed components to allocate grades is called into question, as are the role and place of high-stakes testing per se.","Lucy, W.; Lee, C.

"AUTOFICÃ‡ÃƒO DO PRESENTE: CENAS DA PANDEMIA NA UNIVERSIDADE","In this paper, I analyze the student production based on artistic works developed in the classroom, in discipline and research, during the pandemic and exhibited on the Internet. For this, I develop the concept of autofiction of the present, defending that a large part of the scenic production in that pandemic moment reflects the experience of the traumatic present, given the elaboration of the collective trauma of almost 500 thousand Brazilians victimized by covid-19. The tragic political situation in Brazil, with denial, the absence of sanitary policy and other public policies, whether for the cultural and/or educational sector, corroborate to increase the feeling of helplessness (BIRMAN, 2020), causing emergence of investigations anchored in autofictional experiences that do not refer to past experiences, but to the present, constituting the testimony of traumatic memory through artistic elaboration in this experience.Alternate :Neste artigo, analiso a produÃ§Ã¢o discente a partir de trabalhos artÃ­sticos desenvolvidos em sala de aula na pandemia e exibidos na Internet, orientados por mim em disciplina de graduaÃ§Ã¢o.

"Unmotivated, Depressed, Anxious: Impact of the COVID-19 Emergency Transition to Remote Learning on Undergraduates' Math Anxiety","In summer 2020, we invited the 6761 undergraduate students who took a Spring 2020 math course at the University of Arizona to participate in a survey, with 13% responding. We asked about their experience with the emergency transition to remote learning and measured their math anxiety before and after the transition using the well-established Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS). ""Unmotivated, depressed, anxious"" are the words one undergraduate used to describe their emergency transition to remote learning. Our results indicate that limited access to quality technology and inadequate communication with an instructor were the two greatest predictors for an increase in math anxiety after the emergency transition to remote learning.

"Mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults","Problem: Significant psychological effects such as anxiety, depression, stress, and loneliness are shown to affect the older adult population, aged 65 years and older. The social isolation and disconnectedness related to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially worsens anxious and depressive feelings, increasing the risk for adverse outcomes in the high-risk older adult population. This project aimed to identify older adults at risk for acute, situational mental health issues associated with the pandemic.Methods: A descriptive study design was used. Telephone interviews were conducted to explore effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health responses in older adults. A convenience sample of eight older adult patients and a purposive sample of one key informant were interviewed using open-ended, literature-based questions. Results: Data were analyzed and coded into seven main themes: family, socialization, anxiety, loneliness, concern for others, the future, and benefits of the pandemic. Overall, the sample population of older adults did not experience any clinically relevant mental health effects (i.e., isolation, loneliness, depression, or anxiety) as a result of the pandemic. No notable challenges were voiced. Implications: Older adults in this project did not experience disruptive life changes as a result of the pandemic restrictions. Rather, mental health protective factors (i.e., financial stability, good health, adequate social support, and health insurance coverage with routine medical care) potentially shielded patients from pandemic-related adverse mental health outcomes. Further refinement of these factors in a larger population is warranted to guide providers in strategies to assess possible mental health issues in the older adult population.

"Exploring mental health professionals described experiences of burnout and coping strategy uses","Prior to this study it was not known how mental health professionals, who treat trauma, in the U.S., described their experiences of burnout and their use of coping strategies. The purpose was to explore MHPs described experiences of burnout and their use of coping strategies. There were two research questions: How do MHPs, who treat trauma, in the U.S., describe their experience of burnout? And how do MHPs, who treat trauma, in the U.S., describe their use of coping strategies? The job demands-resource model provided the theoretical foundation. Purposeful sampling helped select 18 mental health professionals for participation in the study. Data were gathered through self-report questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was utilized to analyze data collected in this study. Eight themes arose from the data regarding descriptions of burnout experiences and uses of coping strategies: (1) conditions as described by MHPs that resulted in burnout, (2) burnout as described by MHPs that was induced by COVID, (3) characteristics of burnout as described by MHPs, (4) Staying motivated in the face of burnout as described by MHPs, (5) strategies and tools utilized for coping as described by MHPs, (6) beneficial types of support systems utilized for coping as described by MHPs, (7) utilizing open communication to cope with burnout as described by MHPs, and (8) utilizing education and preparation for coping with burnout as described by MHPs. Results indicated that MHPs face the risk of burnout, through strategies such as education, communication, and self-care plans, this risk could be addressed.

"Mental health concerns of frontline registered nurses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic","Problem: COVID-19 caused local healthcare facilities to admit patients with COVID-19 at increasing rates, critically overloading healthcare system resources. Caregiver-related stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic placed frontline registered nurses (RNs) at risk for mental health consequences (Havlioglu & Demir, 2020;Shechter et al., 2020). Methods: This quality improvement project used a descriptive design to administer a collection of validated instruments assessing anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and demographics. A purposive sample of RNs were recruited from the COVID-19 units in a local hospital, and the survey was distributed via email. Results: During the implementation period (April 4, 2021-May 15, 2021), 56 RNs began the survey with 47 fully completing and nine partially completing the survey. Participants self-reported symptoms consistent anxiety (n =19/56, 33.9%) and depression (n =21/56, 37.5%). PTSD was marked as a concern for RNs scoring greater than 33 on the IES-R (McCabe, 2019;Nie et al., 2020);25% of RNs (n=14/56) met this criterion. Of all participants, 53.5% (n=30/56) self-reported substance use to cope with the stress related to the pandemic. Some RNs admitted to thoughts of self-harm (n = 5/56, 8.9%). Implications for Practice: This project revealed frontline RNs are at risk for mental health issues with inadequate resources to manage potential issues. Expansion of employee assistance programs are essential to follow up on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] recommendations and data uncovered in this project.

"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological stress and usage behavior for users of a VR App with dynamic, interactive content","A global pandemic such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) sets the stage for an ongoing mental health crisis with high stress, uncertainty, and increased isolation similar to that which may be experienced by patients in healthcare environments. It is well-known that elements within the environment can impact a patient's cognitive, affective, and physiological state. Virtual reality (VR) apps have been shown to distract users from stressors in the environment but there is little known about consumer users during COVID-19. The present study explores how COVID-19 affected usage behavior and mood for consumer users of a VR app with dynamic, interactive, nature-based content before and after the pandemic started. Study findings showed that users created more accounts and used the content more often during the pandemic than before. The COVID-19 pandemic also predicted increased negative mood states for users of the VR app, while users experienced a greater positive mood change after using the content during this time as well. Additionally, content with a more passive, lower level of interactivity resulted in a greater positive mood state post-COVID-19.

"Preparation for and implementation of a Physical Activity Education Program (PEP) in a primary care setting","Background: Physical activity is one of the most important behaviors that humans can engage in to improve their health, yet population rates of physical activity remain considerably low. Additional research on physical activity interventions is necessary, specifically group-based interventions in primary care. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to design and provide an illustration of a group-based physical activity intervention in primary care, called the Physical Activity Education Program (PEP). The aim of Phase 1 was to gather qualitative information from primary care physicians (PCPs) and patients to assist in designing PEP. The aim of Phase 2 was to implement a pilot PEP program and assess its acceptability, feasibility, and impact on physical activity and health outcomes. Methods: PCPs and patients from a family medicine practice (FMMS) were recruited to participate in Phase 1 key informant interviews. The four-week PEP program was implemented in Phase 2. Four patients from FMMS were recruited over the span of a month to participate. The first PEP session occurred in-person, after which the program continued virtually in response to social distancing measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Case descriptions for each participant were used to illustrate the feasibility, acceptability and impact of PEP. Results: Phase 1 key informant interviews helped design the PEP program. Of the four PEP participants, two (50%) completed the program. The PEP program was found to be very satisfactory by completers;satisfaction was slightly lower among non-completers. Physical activity engagement was shown to increase among completers by the end of PEP;at follow-up, physical activity remained at similar levels or higher. Depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms decreased among all participants by the end of PEP;one completer exhibited an increase in symptoms at follow-up. Conclusions: This study indicated that implementing a multi-disciplinary, group-based physical activity intervention in primary care is possible. Although the sample size was very small, the impact that the PEP program has on physical activity and health outcomes is promising. Future research is necessary to better understand the feasibility and acceptability of in-person and virtual group-based physical activity interventions in primary care.

"The impact of self-reported depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and utilization of immature defense mechanisms on bariatric surgery outcomes","This study investigated the contribution of self-reported depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and utilization of immature defense mechanisms on bariatric surgery outcomes at 18-month follow-up. There were two research questions: 1. Does the presence of self-reported psychopathology impact percentage weight loss and quality of life after bariatric surgery, at long-term follow-up, when controlling for a patient's having received individual or group psychotherapy, and time elapsed since surgery? 2. Does the use of immature defense impact the outcomes of bariatric surgery at long-term follow-up, when controlling for a patient's having received individual or group psychotherapy, and time elapsed since surgery? In a sample of 117 participants, Pearson correlations (r) revealed no significant relationship between self-reported psychopathology and percentage weight loss after bariatric surgery. For the quality of life outcome, repeated measures mixed model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run, which included the repeated measures factor time of measurement (pre- vs. post-operation score), and the between-subjects pre-operation psychopathology level (clinically significant vs. non-clinically significant elevations). These analyses were followed up by paired-samples t-tests to determine the direction and significance of change in these measures from pre- to post-operation in the two groups separately. Results for the participants with clinically significant psychopathology were non-significant. For the participants with non-clinically significant elevations, quality of life worsened from pre-operation to post-operation follow-up. Pearson's r correlations revealed a marginally significant negative relationship between immature defense mechanism usage and percentage weight loss. Answers to the open-ended question, ""Besides weight loss, how has the surgery impacted your life?"", were thematically coded to yield 12 different thematic codes. Nine of the codes appeared to place the surgery experience in a positive light, while only three placed the surgery in a negative light. The fact that this follow-up was conducted during a COVID-19 pandemic year may have decreased the quality of life scores. This study could also have been improved by measuring immature defense mechanisms scores before surgery rather than just at post-operation follow-up. Finally, the small number of patients who obtained clinically significant elevations on psychopathology scores was another study limitation.

"Essays in law & economics and behavioral economics","This dissertation consists of three papers. One law & economics paper that investigates civilian complaints and prosecutor's upcharging behavior (Chapter 1) and two behavioral economics papers that investigate the link between attitudes and protective behavior (Chapter 2) and the lying behavior (Chapter 3). Though these papers may seem unrelated, they are tied together as the violation of law can be frequently explained by using behavioral analysis.Chapter 1 addresses the issue between civilian complaints and prosecutor's upcharging behavior. Civilian complaints may perform a socially beneficial role by uncovering illegal behavior, but at the same time, they may result in reputational and financial losses for the targeted institutions. This chapter empirically investigates one way in which criminal justice institutions respond to civilian complaints. Namely, criminal prosecutors can upcharge a defendant who files a civil complaint against law enforcement to make police use of force appear justified. Using data on citizen complaints and criminal charge outcomes from Cook County (Illinois), this paper finds a causal link between a citizen filing a complaint and the total number of charges filed. Moreover, citizen complaints also have significant consequences on a battery of other legal outcomes associated with a criminal case.In Chapter 2, we aim to measure people's attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and how these attitudes affect protective behaviors such as wearing a mask. In this paper, first we investigate the dominant themes of hopes and fears related to the COVID-19 pandemic from people's narratives. Second, we examine some of the possible determinants affecting negative (i.e., concern) and positive (i.e., confidence) attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic as well as people's perspectives on the future after the pandemic (i.e., new-normal and economic conditions). And third, we investigate the relationship between attitudes and mask-wearing behavior. For this study, we conducted an online survey (N=301) in July 2020. Using information from the survey, we find that the pandemic and economic conditions represent the most salient fears among participants, while their dominant hopes are the restoration of overall society and their particular lifestyles. We also find that factors related to health (i.e., physical & mental health and well-being), information (i.e., browsing and posting news), and trust (i.e., trust in the WHO and the CDC) incrementally affect people's attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and how they perceive the world after the pandemic. Last, using instrumental variable approach, we find that having concern about the COVID-19 pandemic reduces the reluctance of wearing a mask.Chapter 3 studies the effect of clothes on the behavior of the wearer by influencing the person's identity. We test this hypothesis by recruiting trick-or-treaters during Halloween, a time of year when people wear salient and extreme clothing. Because the tradition of costume wear for Halloween evolved, in part, to hide one's identity during ""tricks"" (i.e. norm violations), we measure the effect of Halloween costumes on ethical behavior. We use the lying game of Fischbacher and Follmi-Heusi as our experimental paradigm with 2 x 3 x 2 conditions. First, we vary the stakes to price lying behavior. Second, we run three conditions with different beneficiaries of the report (self, other, and both) to test whether lying for others is perceived to be normative. Third, we manipulate the salience of one's costume to test the effect of costume and identity on ethical behavior. Surprisingly, we find that costume salience caused ""good guys"" to lie more and ""bad guys"" to lie less. We interpret this either as a moral licensing effect or as stemming from a perception of being monitored.

"Immediate psychological response during the very early stage of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) in a Spanish community sample","Introduction: The World Health Organization declared a pandemic due to COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 and remarked on the relevance of studying its consequences on mental health. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the immediate psychological response to the pandemic and quarantine in Spain. Methods: From March 23 to 28, an online survey was conducted in a Spanish community sample. Sociodemographic, health and behavioral variables were surveyed. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), posttraumatic symptoms by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and self-care patterns by the Self-Care Scale (SCS). Results: 3524 respondents were included, 24.1% showed moderate or severe psychological impact, 21.9% reported moderate, severe or extremely severe depression and 32% moderate, severe or extremely severe anxiety. Female gender, younger age, low education, psychiatric diagnosis, worse physical health, contact history, lack of routines, and some psychological symptoms were related to worse psychological responses. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for a negative mental health impact of the pandemic in the Spanish community that started at the early stages and identifies some variables linked to worse psychological response.

"The effects of a college wellness course on student's stress, anxiety and physical activity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, college students' mental health issues, including stress and anxiety, were increasing. Students were also not achieving recommended amounts of physical activity despite the health benefits physical activity provides. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated health behavior issues in this population. College wellness courses have revealed promise in decreasing students' stress and anxiety while positively influencing physical activity participation. However, little research exists on the impact of wellness courses on student health behaviors following the onset of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of participating in a college wellness course on students' stress, anxiety, and physical activity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was grounded in the theory of planned behavior to better understand if an educational wellness course intervention affects students' health. Students participating in a personal wellness course with a physical activity component were compared to students not enrolled regarding levels of stress, anxiety, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive survey, post-test research design was utilized. Data analysis included Chi-square analysis comparing students' stress, anxiety, and physical activity levels between groups. Independent t-tests were used to compare the impact of COVID-19 on stress, anxiety, and physical activity between groups. A series of one-way ANOVAs helped examine demographic differences, and a MANOVA assisted with analyzing interactions between variables. Results indicated that a college wellness course may be an effective intervention to improve students' stress and anxiety-related symptoms and improve physical activity levels.

"The impact of the COVID-19 on the healthcare professionals' daily practice","The World Health Organization has designated 2020 the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife and 2021 - the year of Health and Care Workers, but at the same time the world is facing a pandemic from a virus called COVID-19. In the beginning the governments and health systems have faced difficult problems to solve, but the challenges facing healthcare professionals tested their professionalism and sense of debt to the society. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the daily practice of healthcare professionals through an anonymous online survey. Half of the respondents experienced the strongest feelings of helplessness, followed by fear and confusion. The fear of infecting loved ones is the factor with the strongest negative impact on their mental health. A sense of professional and moral duty and job satisfaction are the main motivation factors for continuing to work during the pandemic.","Draganova, M.; Saleva, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+the+COVID-19+on+the+healthcare+professionals'+daily+practice","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sestrinsko delo / Information for Nursing Staff; 53(3):45-50, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28212,""
"A 360degree view of psychiatric boarding in the emergency department","This dissertation utilizes a three article approach to examine the current status of psychiatric boarding in the emergency department (ED). The number of ED visits for mental health concerns in the United States has been increasing for the past several decades as the number of inpatient psychiatric beds has decreased. This has created a psychiatric boarding crisis where patients are waiting in ED for extended periods of time across the country. This dissertation provides a 360degree view of psychiatric boarding in the ED by critically examining the literature surrounding the effects of psychiatric boarding, analyzing the characteristics of patients undergoing psychiatric boarding through a large national dataset, and by analyzing mixed methods data from ED nurses who care for these patients.The first article presents a systematic review of the status of psychiatric boarding while also addressing the involvement of civil commitment during a psychiatric boarding stay in the ED. Boarding times in the selected 31 articles varied greatly and patients were rarely started on new psychiatric drugs while in the ED. Common diagnoses for patients included suicidal ideations or suicidal behaviors.The second article presents an analysis of the 2016-2017 combined Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Patients that had a psychiatric evaluation in the ED were considered at risk for psychiatric boarding. Patients that boarded for longer than one calendar day and had a psychiatric evaluation were compared to patients that had a psychiatric evaluation but it not ultimately board. Patients that boarded had a greater number of billable procedures performed compared to patients that did not board. The two most common diagnoses of patients undergoing psychiatric boarding for greater than one calendar day were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with major complication or comorbidity and diabetes.The final article utilizes data gathered from ED nurses about their experience with psychiatric boarding at their hospital. Nurses that had greater positive attitudes toward patients undergoing psychiatric boarding were associated with greater perceived competency for providing care for persons with mental illness, and fewer stigmatizing attitudes of patients with mental illness. Through a mixed method approach, this study found that nurses perceptions of psychiatric boarding as a problem varied greatly as well as the different practices that can occur during a psychiatric boarding stay. Suggestions for improvement centered on improving the physical environment because of the high pressure and chaotic nature of the ED.Overall, the details about what occurs during psychiatric boarding in the ED are still poorly described. The lack of research on the short-term and long-term effects of spending extended periods of time in the ED is also concerning, given that this dissertation found that 54.55% of nurses believe that psychiatric boarding is currently a problem at their hospital. Future research that focuses on creating a best practices protocol for patients spending more than 24 hours in the ED is greatly needed to improve the experience and safety of psychiatric boarding for both patients and ED staff members.

"The need for mental health resources in schools: A survey of needs conducted with school principals","Mental health in children has been defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as reaching developmental and emotional milestones, learning healthy social skills and learning how to cope when there are problems (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Mental health in children is a crucial component of overall health and an important predictor of their ability to thrive and succeed in school and to lead productive lives as adults later. Children and adolescents spend most of their days in school and schools often serve as primary locations for the delivery of mental health services for them (Adelman & Taylor, 2010). While current literature documents several school based services that are in place to address the mental health needs in children, there are gaps that lie between the student mental health needs evinced the services in place and the need for better and more comprehensive measures to address them. The current Covid-19 pandemic has served to complicate matters further and has served to render the topic of mental health awareness and access to mental health services in schools more salient. The principle investigator utilized a qualitative method guided by a Grounded Theory approach to explore school principal perspectives on the need for and access to mental health resources within schools. The PI interviewed a total of 20 school administrators using a semi structured interview protocol consisting of 26 questions. Data analysis involved coding interview content guided by open coding, axial coding and selective coding processes outlined by Strauss and Corbin's (1990) qualitative approach. Interview data explored school administrator perceptions across the following areas: The perception of violence in schools, factors involved, Mental health in schools, Principal training and experience, Principal role in schools, Staffing in schools and staff training, Funding for mental health in schools, Barriers that prevent optimal access to mental health in schools, Impact of Covid-19 on schools, Principal aspirations for growth in the field of mental health in future. These data offer preliminary evaluation of current perspectives and practices involving access to mental health in schools and may provide implications for consideration in future.

"Clinical fortitude in the time of COVID-19: Therapeutic challenges and creative possibilities amidst collective trauma and grief","The COVID-19 pandemic has upended daily life, resulting in the collective experience of uncertainty, isolation, and grief. Drawing on clinical practice, as well as the attachment, social neuroscience, and disaster mental health literatures, this paper considers the unique strains and stressors of the public health crisis on the self of the therapist, with attention to the development of clinical fortitude, intentional practices of self-care, and personal spirituality as protective factors against vicarious traumatization and burnout. A relational mentalization-focused framework for treatment is presented, offering guideposts for adapting psychotherapy amidst pandemic conditions to each patient's unique needs and intersectional contexts. Case examples detail the necessity of ""rolling with"" the relational challenges and possibilities of telehealth, which call for greater flexibility, collaboration, and creativity in the clinical encounter than ever before. Finally, future directions highlight the need for psychotherapy research explicating emergent models and adaptations of clinical care that promote emotional and spiritual wellbeing during the pandemic.

"Be Pouya! (metaphor for Iranian clients during pandemic COVID-19)","The results of several studies in general show that metaphors may play an important role in facilitating the processes of treatment in counseling and psychotherapy. In system theory, there is a link between the belief that depressed mood selectively increases the possibility of access to negative concepts and interpretive structures, that is, depressed mood prepares the trigger for these negative structures so that they can be used for interpretation and experiences. Useful metaphors such as 'Pouya' play an important role in facilitating the processes of change in counseling and psychotherapy. When they checked the background logic of using this word, I realized due to meaning of 'Pouya' in Persian (means active and ongoing) it was used as his imaginary role to stimulate positive emotion for doing his goal. During online treatment in pandemic period, the clients use many metaphors to better understand the concept and process of it. In clinical psychology, interest in metaphor focuses on its role in communication processes and cognitive flexibility in psychotherapy. it's important to be aware of their metaphor and its role in successful treatment. He imagines a person named 'Pouya' play an important role in accompanying him in this way. In their view, metaphor is not a decorative thing or specific to literature, but flows in the daily thought and action of human beings and shows the structure of individual thought. The central identity of creative arts therapies lies in the commitment to create and manipulate metaphor as a mediator in treatment. They also reveal that metaphor therapy is a creative method that uses its imaginative power to achieve the goal easier. He plays an important role in behavior activation and coping with misbehavior such as social isolation. After that word called' Pouya"" was one metaphor that usually is used in therapy. In the pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), where social isolation has increased, depressed mood is obvious. One of my clients named it ""Pouya steps"" as a metaphor. He is actual man and virtual (my husband) that his name is also a metaphor for me when I feel sad, helplessness, hopelessness and frustration. Metaphor helps them to understand something unknown from the perspective of something familiar. Pouya is not imagery role for me. Depression that affects by COVID-19 is an emotional response that is because of emotion dysregulation and negative social behaviors. Social distancing causes loneliness that is related to maladaptive behaviors and poor quality of life. One of these methods is to use metaphor. According to Lakoff, people mostly use metaphors when talking about  concepts. The seed of a new idea is created in the mind and helps to flourish the latent ideas. This key topic provides new possibilities for ""insight"" and therapy. One of the steps in treatment is sequencing goals. In summary, they just give one example but there are so many that could not be rejected. Flexible and active thinking will help the process of changing. Humans talk to each other in different ways about their experiences, feelings and thoughts.","Bozorg, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Be+Pouya!+(metaphor+for+Iranian+clients+during+pandemic+COVID-19)","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Behavior Research & Health; 5(1):583-584, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28216,""
"Counselors perception on quality, change, and industry impact of telecounseling","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently ongoing and has social and health consequences for everyone (Sheridan et al., 2021). More than 90% of the United States population was under stay-at-home orders during spring 2020-telepsychology quickly grew to become the primary option for Americans in need of mental healthcare (Greenbaum, 2020). The United States Government demonstrated a commitment to developing, promoting, and integrating technology-assisted care in the United States by awarding $15 million to support telehealth providers during the COVID-19 pandemic (Health and Human Services, 2020). The specific problem to be addressed in this study is counselors' lack of skills and knowledge in virtual counseling settings (Bernacchio & Wilson, 2018). The purpose of this phenomenological study is to gain knowledge of the experienced clinical mental health counselors' perception of preparation experience for teletherapy with the intent of providing recommendations for professional organizations and counselor education programs regarding virtual counseling. The phenomenological research design and a qualitative research method were chosen because of the uniqueness of exploring the experiences of clinical mental health professionals who engage in distance counseling to understand how a lack of training and resources affects clinical mental health counselors' virtual counseling sessions with clients. Findings showed that counselors who were in the laggard category had difficulty adapting to change in the mental health industry, while the innovators, early adopters, and late majority excelled in virtual counseling. Recommendations included contingency planning to prepare for disruptive events, incorporation of technology training in counseling education programs, organizations should view adopter categories of employees to determine what materials are needed for them to accept the change, and the final recommendation is counselors should prepare for technical shortcomings ahead of time.

"Effects of attribution and appraisal of control on emergency department nurse stress when treating patients with severe mental illness","As the prevalence of severe mental illness continues to rise and access to mental health care is scarce, an increasing number of U.S. adults seek treatment in emergency departments. Nurses who triage the severity of a medical emergency may appraise the situation both through the lens of mental illness stigma and the degree of confidence they have to control the outcome. However, the research community knows little about the extent to which attribution and appraisal of control affect nurses' appraisal of stress. The purpose of this quantitative nonexperimental, canonical correlational study was to examine the extent to which various combinations of attribution and control predicted different types of appraisals of stress among emergency department nurses treating patients with severe mental illness. Grounded in attribution theory and the cognitive-relational theory of stress and coping, the research was focused on revealing the effect conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings have on anticipatory stress and resulting behavior. The sample included 133 nurses from a large nonprofit Catholic health system in the U.S. Midwest. A canonical correlation analysis examined the multivariate relationships of nurses' appraisal of control and attribution in predicting primary appraisal of stress. The overall canonical correlation was statistically significant, Wilks's LAMBDA = .19, F(33.0, 351.3) = 8.03, p &lt; .001;therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. By developing literacy of mental illness to diminish stigma and equipping clinicians with the tools to confidently and competently feel in control, there is an opportunity for positive social change by minimizing the negative appraisal of threat, thus reducing occupational stress and improving quality of care.

In the weeks leading up to this declaration fear and uncertainty would crescendo. This period was followed by the intense emotional reactions of the impact phase-that period of frenzied grocery trips, hand sanitizer shortages, and fights in stores over toilet paper. Over the next several months, altruistic acts moved to the forefront. Healthcare workers became our new heroes and public support swelled for frontline and other essential workers. This was then followed by a sense of optimism, that COVID-19 would pass quickly as people began to quarantine. However, with time the reality that this pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint, started to take a toll on people's emotional and spiritual wellbeing. For example, more than half of adults reporting a decline in mental health due to worry and stress this year.

"Severe social withdrawal: General considerations and interventions by Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Services","Social withdrawal in adolescence presents itself as a spectrum of phenomena ranging from the variant of the norm to severe psychopathology. According to recent data, this condition involves almost 100.00 youths, mostly male. This work summarizes the clinical characteristics of Serious Social Withdrawal (RSG), the possible paths of diagnosis and management, and its correlation with the phenomena induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aspects of this phenomenon are self-reclusion at home for 6 months, with rare exits and early school leaving, reduction of direct communication with family members and external relations, partly substituted from virtual relationships via web. The typical onset is in pre-adolescence, with a second peak at the threshold of adulthood, occasionally associated with frustration, bullying or exposure to narcissistic traps. The family systemic function could be displaced by the social withdrawal. Primary and secondary social withdrawal differential diagnosis represents a complex and discussed topic also due to the potentially pathogenic role of social withdrawal itself. RSG does not appear in diagnostic manuals as a nosological entity ""per se"", but as a symptom of other pathologies (anxiety disorders, mood disorders, etc.) but it is placed in the intersection of individual, developmental, family and social trajectories. On one side the ""evolutionary"" role of RS can be linked to a temporary narcissistic reorganization in adolescence or could represents the onset of a structured disorder of affective and emotional functioning. Services and Mental Health Specialists may have difficulties to reach less severe patients or with lower efficient family networks. The difficulties of reorganizing the NPIA Services in the COVID-19 are discussed maintaining flexible and multidimensional interventions. The standard situation of the Services forces to structure the interventions based on the available resources, and not only based on clinical needs;earliness and integration of the interventions are related to a more favorable prognosis. In a second section, we discuss the specific characteristics of the reception, diagnosis and care pathways of patients with RSG in an out-patient and semi-residential setting, and in a hospital setting (from the A&E to admission to the Day Hospital). Italian Care Services organizational characteristics are heterogeneous, with diversified protocols, structures and paths. The prevention and an early and synergistic care and stable and formal collaboration agreements between health, social and educational skills are fundamental. The available diagnostic tools are discussed, as well as the criteria for the direct care project, based on necessity, coherence, feasibility, both to the minor and to the family and its environment, and their possible use by a mobile and competent team. The general and practical theoretical aspects of home and semi-residential interventions are outlined. The path and effectiveness indicators and their modification from the beginning of 2020, still in progress due to the distortions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, are discussed. We focus on changes in the very concept of ""school"" and ""presence"", and to their meaning for narcissistically fragile, anxious or depressed subjects. Possible semi-residential, therapeutic, rehabilitative, intensive, complex and coordinated interventions are discussed in detail, with particular regard to their transitional role between acute and hospitalization, as an ""enlarged psychic space"". Finally, the existing experiences in the hospital, ward and A&E setting are mentioned.

"Music in times of COVID-19","In March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the first global pandemic officially caused by a coronavirus. Public health measures (e.g., increased handwashing, reducing social contacts) were introduced to reduce the rate of transmission, including the closure of spaces and events that would encourage high levels of social interaction along with â€˜lockdowns' confining people to the vicinity of their homes. The scale of the disruption caused by the considerable number of cases, and the implementation of lockdowns led to widespread social and emotional disruption. Uncertainty, and financial insecurity arising from these measures cascaded into widespread increases in stress, fear, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, anger, and sleep disorders. This created a unique situation where music-related behaviours and music therapy played an important role. The current chapter reviews how music was used in a range of contexts and settings to support the social, emotional, and physical needs that developed because of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns. We aim to highlight the rapid changes that occurred in relation to music use in the general population and music therapy practices as the world adjusted to the new challenges posed by the unprecedented circumstances.","Claire Howlin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00AE-AC5-68F","20220310","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Music; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; rehabilitation; telehealth; covid-19; music psychology; mental health; music therapy; music in everyday life; coping; music","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","",28227,""
"Optimizing Outcomes in Psychotherapy for Anxiety Disorders (OPTIMAX) Protocolâ€“ A Randomized Controlled Trial on Efficacy and Response Prediction in a Transdiagnostic Psychotherapy Treatment for Anxiety Disorders","Background: This paper describes the study protocol for our clinical trial â€œOptimizing Outcomes in Psychotherapy for Anxiety Disorders (OPTIMAX)â€ funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (10001C_169827). The study aims to establish predictive features for forecasting response to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and to investigate mechanisms underlying treatment response. Methods: OPTIMAX comprises a monocentric, randomized-controlled clinical trial. We employ the Unified Treatment Protocol (UP, Barlow, 2017), an established transdiagnostic CBT protocol for treating emotional disorders, to treat patients with anxiety disorders. We use psychological questionnaires, experimental tasks, biological samples, ecological momentary assessments, activity tracking, and smartphone-based passive sensing data in order to derive a multimodal feature set for predictive modeling. We obtain assessments at different time points including baseline, mid-, and post- treatment as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment completion. Anxiety and depression symptom severity are indexed weekly during treatment. We aim to include 150 patients, randomized to CBT versus WAIT group in a 3:1 ratio. Machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, random forest) and linear regression modeling will be employed to establish predictive accuracy in forecasting treatment response. In addition to predictive modelling, we test mechanistic hypotheses, e.g., on the association between self-efficacy, dynamic symptom changes and treatment response, to elucidate mechanisms underlying treatment response. Discussion: The aim of the current trial is to improve current CBT treatment, such as the transdiagnostic unified treatment protocol employed here, by precise forecasting of treatment response and by understanding and, in the future, augmenting underpinning mechanisms and personalizing treatment.
