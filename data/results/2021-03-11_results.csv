"Worry and perceived risk of contagion during the COVID-19 quarantine in the Jalisco population: Preliminary Study","Introduction  Preventive measures taken during periods of health crisis, specifically in pandemics, have consistently been associated with detrimental effects on mental health  Isolation and loneliness are indirect effects of these preventive measures  Given these premises, monitoring the behavior of the population in the face of these eventualities becomes important  Worry as an indirect measure of anxiety and stress enables one to recognize subjects who are vulnerable to phenomena of high uncertainty, since measures taken to avoid excessive contagion can have high costs for this population  This phenomenon has been consistently observed in other pandemics such as H1/N1 influenza  Objective  To determine the prevalence of worry and perceived risk of contagion in the Guadalajara population during the COVID-19 quarantine and to identify differentiating effects  Method  A total of 255 people from western Mexico (Guadalajara, Jalisco) voluntarily participated by answering the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) adapted to Mexican population  The average age of the respondents, aged between 18 and 70 years, was 31 71 (+/- 5 19)  A total of 170 women and 85 men participated in the study  Results  40 12% of the population scored high levels of worry, making them vulnerable to mental health conditions  Subjects favored the prevention of a contagion regardless of whether they were self-isolated  The only variable that had a differential effect was sex (p &lt;  05), and there were no differences in educational attainment, occupational demandingness, and isolation between the groups  Discussion and conclusion  A preventive attitude was observed among the participants, and so it is important to implement strategies that will prevent mental health costs in those who express excessive worry to avoid saturating mental health services","Guzman-Gonzalez, J.

"Well-being status and post-traumatic stress symptoms in health workers attending mindfulness sessions during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico","Introduction  In Mexico, a National Mental Health Strategy was implemented to identify and attend the mental health repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic  It included the creation of five virtual clinics for health workers, being the Burnout, Post-traumatic Stress and Compassion Fatigue clinic one of them  Objective  To describe the basal sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of health workers attending online mindfulness sessions as part of the treatment of the aforementioned clinic  Method  This is a cross-sectional report part of a major nationwide and longitudinal project  All attendants responded to digital sociodemographics and COVID-19 questionnaires, the Extended Physician Well-Being Index (EP-WBI), and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) TOP-8 index  Results  Of the 507 health workers that participated, 70 02% of them were at risk of burnout according to the Extended Well-Being Index and 57 31, 7 91 and 2 77% had a mild, moderate, and severe risk of PTSD, respectively  The most affected were the female health workers, from metropolitan or central areas of the country, and those diagnosed with COVID-19 or exposed to a person with the diagnosis  Discussion and conclusion  Mexican health workers attending mindfulness sessions presented high frequencies of PTSD symptoms and burnout  Female workers at urban hospitals could be at a special risk for developing PTSD or Well-ness alterations, and thus, they must be cared for closely, particularly those having direct contact with COVID 19 positive persons  The early participation in mental health strategies might lessen the immediate and long-term pandemic effects","Real-Ramirez, J.; Garcia-Bello, L.

"Socioeconomic inequality in child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: First evidence from China","Background There are increasing concerns that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic will disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged children  However, there lacks empirical evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in child mental health and associated factors  Methods We conducted a population-based online survey in 21,526 children in China, when children were confined at home for nearly two months during the pandemic  We assessed child mental health problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)  Parental education level and provincial gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were treated as proxies for individual- and population-level socioeconomic status (SES), respectively  Lifestyle and family environment factors included sleep disturbances, physical activity, screen time, primary caregiver, parental mental health, and harsh parenting  Results Of the children, 32 31% demonstrated mental health problems  Parental education from the highest (undergraduate and above) to the lowest (middle school and below) increased the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for child mental health problems by 42% (aOR, 1 42;95% CI, 1 29-1 57);provincial GDP per capita (RMB) from the highest (&gt;Â¥100K) to the lowest (=Â¥70K) increased aOR by 41% (aOR, 1 41;95% CI%, 1 28-1 55)  Sleep disturbances, physical activity &lt;1 h/day, media exposure =2 h/day, non-parental care, poor parental mental health, and harsh parenting were independently associated with increased child mental health problems, regardless of SES  Limitations The potential sampling bias, subjective measures, and the cross-sectional design are the main limitations  Conclusion The first evidence from China suggests socioeconomic inequality in child mental health during the pandemic  As unhealthy lifestyle and unfavorable family environment are contributory factors, prioritized interventions are needed to reduce socioeconomic inequality in child mental health problems","Li, Wen, Wang, Zijing, Wang, Guanghai, Ip, Patrick, Sun, Xiaoning, Jiang, Yanrui, Jiang, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.009","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11707,""

"Bupropion for postpartum smoking relapse: A remote protocol for a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial","Cigarette smoking among postpartum women remains a significant public health problem despite known health risks to women and their newborns  It is estimated that over 50% of women quit smoking during pregnancy but 90% relapse by one year  Safe and effective postpartum relapse prevention strategies are urgently needed  In an attempt to address this deficit, we will investigate the efficacy of bupropion vs  placebo as a smoking relapse prevention aid in postpartum women  The objective of this paper is to detail an approach to investigate bupropion's efficacy for preventing postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy  Specifically, we designed a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial testing the efficacy of bupropion vs  placebo as a relapse prevention tool  Mothers of healthy infants who quit smoking while pregnant will be stratified based on current or past history of major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and randomized to receive either active (bupropion XL 300Â mg/day) or placebo medication for 12Â weeks  To respond to safety concerns associated with participant and staff exposure to COVID-19, we revised our original protocol and present procedures which allow our trial to be conducted entirely remotely  Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 post-randomization  The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24Â weeks  Results of this work have the potential to positively impact women and their children by promoting lifelong cessation, eliminating secondhand smoke exposure, and modelling of abstinence to children","Allen, Sharon, Thomas, Janet, Harrison, Katherine, Emery, Rebecca L.; Petersen, Ashley, Winickoff, Jonathan P.; Japuntich, Sandra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106352","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Contemporary Clinical Trials;: 106352, 2021.; Publication details: Contemporary Clinical Trials;: 106352, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11723,""

"Sports Medicine Physician Decision-Making, Practice Changes, and Mental Health During the Early Phase of the SARS-CoV-2 Global Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a profound effect on the healthcare system. This study aimed to identify its effects on sports medicine physicians during the early phase of this pandemic. DESIGN: Survey study. SETTING: Sports medicine providers. PARTICIPANTS: Physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine were surveyed between March 25 and April 4, 2020. A total of 810 responses were obtained from 2437 physicians who viewed the survey. INTERVENTIONS: The survey consisted of questions examining demographics, prepandemic practice patterns, anxiety and depression screening, and new beliefs and behaviors following government-based medical policy changes resulting from the pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in clinical volume and treatment practices, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS: The mean in-person clinic visits reduced to 17.9%, telephone visits to 24.4%, telemedicine (video) visits to 21.8%, and procedural visits to 13.8% of prepandemic practice volume. The mean PHQ-4 scores for physicians were 2.38 Â± 2.40. Clinic and procedural volumes were reduced less by male physicians, as well as more experienced physicians, nonphysical medicine and rehabilitation training background, in government or private practice, and in the Southern region of the United States (P < 0.05). Physicians were more likely to reduce their anti-inflammatory (37.8% decreasing vs 6.8% increasing, P < 0.001) and opioid (10.5% vs 6.8%, P = 0.003) prescriptions rather than increase. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic sports medicine physicians reported reducing in-person evaluation, management, and procedure volume by over 80%. Multiple demographic and geographic factors were associated with practice volume changes.","Cushman, Daniel M; Teramoto, Masaru; Babu, Ashwin; Olafsen, Nathan; Onishi, Kentaro; Asay, Alexandra; McCormick, Zachary L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000000905","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Clin J Sport Med;2021 Mar 04.; Publication details: Clin J Sport Med;2021 Mar 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11733,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Dental Care Providers on the Front Lines in China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that emerged at the end of 2019. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a pandemic. To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with 4 widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers. As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than 1 symptom (66.3%). The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66.2%, nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯641), and anxiety the least (7.1%, nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯69). After adjustment for confounders, it was found that dental practitioners with preexisting physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.972; 95% CI, 1.128-3.448; PÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯.017), and perceived stress (odds ratio, 2.397 95% CI, 1.283-4.478; PÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯.006). Additionally, feelings of fear, helplessness, or terror resulting from the possibility of contracting COVID-19 were significantly associated with the prevalence of all the 4 psychological symptoms observed (P < .05). In the present study, we found that dental care providers suffered psychological depression, stress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during COVID-19, which indicates the importance of psychological support at times of major epidemic outbreaks.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the ""psychodemia"".

"COVID-19 Testing and The Impact of The Pandemic on The Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) Cohort","BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic disadvantages and potential immunocompromise raise particular concerns for people living with HIV (PLWH) and other marginalized communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we explored COVID-19 testing and the impact of the pandemic among participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) Cohort, predominantly comprised of low-income minorities living with and without HIV. METHODS: Between July-August, 2020, a telephone survey was administered to 299 MASH participants to assess COVID-19 testing, prevention behaviors, and psychosocial stressors. Healthcare utilization, antiretroviral adherence, food insecurity, and substance use during the pandemic were compared to their last cohort visit (7.8Â±2.9 months earlier). RESULTS: Half of surveyed participants had been tested for COVID-19, 8 had tested positive, 2 had been hospitalized. PLWH (n=183) were 42% times less likely than uninfected participants to have been tested. However, after adjustment for age, employment, COVID-19 symptoms, mental healthcare, and substance use, the effect of HIV status was no longer significant. PLWH were more likely to have seen a healthcare provider, use face coverings, and avoid public transportation, and less likely to be food insecure and drink hazardously. There were significant changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic as compared to before. CONCLUSION: PLWH, compared to their HIV-uninfected peers, were more likely to engage in preventive measures and healthcare during the pandemic, potentially reducing their exposure to COVID-19. There were no reported changes in antiretroviral adherence or healthcare utilization, but there were changes in substance use; these need to be monitored as this crisis progresses.","Tamargo, Javier A; Martin, Haley R; Diaz-Martinez, Janet; Trepka, Mary Jo; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan; Johnson, Angelique; Mandler, Raul N; Baum, Marianna K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002680","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr;2021 Feb 24.; Publication details: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr;2021 Feb 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11736,""
"Assessing the Mental Health of Emerging Adults Through a Mental Health App: Protocol for a Prospective Pilot Study","BACKGROUND: Individuals can experience different manifestations of the same psychological disorder. This underscores the need for a personalized model approach in the study of psychopathology. Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase wherein individuals are especially vulnerable to psychopathology. Given their exposure to repeated stressors and disruptions in routine, the emerging adult population is worthy of investigation. OBJECTIVE: In our prospective study, we aim to conduct multimodal assessments to determine the feasibility of an individualized approach for understanding the contextual factors of changes in daily affect, sleep, physiology, and activity. In other words, we aim to use event mining to predict changes in mental health. METHODS: We expect to have a final sample size of 20 participants. Recruited participants will be monitored for a period of time (ie, between 3 and 12 months). Participants will download the Personicle app on their smartphone to track their activities (eg, home events and cycling). They will also be given wearable sensor devices (ie, devices that monitor sleep, physiology, and physical activity), which are to be worn continuously. Participants will be asked to report on their daily moods and provide open-ended text responses on a weekly basis. Participants will be given a battery of questionnaires every 3 months. RESULTS: Our study has been approved by an institutional review board. The study is currently in the data collection phase. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was adjusted to allow for remote data collection and COVID-19-related stress assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will help advance research on individualized approaches to understanding health and well-being through multimodal systems. Our study will also demonstrate the benefit of using individualized approaches to study interrelations among stress, social relationships, technology, and mental health.

"Caregiving burden and depressive symptoms among ultra-orthodox jews: The moderating role of sense of community","Individuals who care for aging parents or relatives often experience caregiving burden, which is associated with various negative psychological outcomes  During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between caring for older relatives and taking the necessary personal precautions against infection may be exacerbated among individuals who belong to social groups, which perceive caring for others as an indispensable cultural construct  Accordingly, the current study examined whether feeling a part of one's community moderates the association between caregiving burden and depressive symptoms among the ultra-orthodox society in Israel  A convenience sample of 358 ultra-orthodox participants was collected (age range 30-70;M = 49 50, SD = 10 24), all of whom completed scales assessing caregiving burden, sense of community, and depressive symptoms  Results demonstrated that high caregiving burden and low sense of community were associated with increased depressive symptoms  Moreover, sense of community moderated the caregiving burden-depressive symptoms link, as the latter positive association was significant only among individuals reporting low levels of sense of community  The discussion highlights the importance of sense of community as a beneficial personal and social factor, which mitigates the negative psychological consequences of caregiving burden among such societies  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Maytles, Ruth, Bergman, Yoav S.; Trachtingot, Itschak","https://doi.org/10.1002/casp.2514","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11754,""
"Curtailing Opioid Overprescribing in Ophthalmology","Although we are in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the opioid epidemic rages on  From 1999 to 2018, approximately 450 000 people died from opioid overdose, with approximately 50 000 deaths in 2018 alone, highlighting the dramatic increases in these alarming trends 1 As a field, ophthalmology has taken an active approach to analyzing and modifying its own opioid prescribing practices  Patel and Sternberg2 analyzed Medicare Part D prescriber data and showed that approximately 90% of ophthalmologists wrote 10 or fewer opioid prescriptions yearly, with an average of 7 prescriptions for a mean of 5 days of drug coverage 2 Shortly after, Kolomeyer et al3 showed that the odds of filling an opioid prescription after any incisional ocular surgery was 3 3 times higher in 2016 than in 2000 to 2001  Together, these studies demonstrated that although the ophthalmic use of opioids was not high across the specialty, similar to the rest of medicine, it had dramatically increased  Recognizing this trend, studies have focused on developing and instituting guidelines aimed at decreasing postoperative opioid prescriptions  Woodward et al4 used updated opioid prescribing guidelines to demonstrate a significant decrease in prescribed opioids after corneal surgery with adequate postoperative patient-reported pain control  Starr et al5 described the effect of standardizing postoperative opioid prescribing guidelines for patients undergoing a variety of ophthalmic surgeries  After implementation, the rate, strength, and total amount of opioid prescribed decreased significantly  Importantly, the proportion of refilled prescriptions also did not change, implying adequate pain control with considerable reduction in potential for opioid misuse","Kolomeyer, Anton M.

"Coronavirus disease 2019, food security and maternal mental health in CearÃ¡, Brazil: a repeated cross-sectional survey","OBJECTIVE: To quantify the change in the risk of food insecurity and maternal mental disorder (MMD) before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between 17 July and 10 September 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 to assess MMD. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: CearÃ¡, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seventy-seven mother-child pairs completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15Â·5 % higher (95 % CI 5Â·9, 25Â·1, P value < 0Â·001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared with November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40Â·2 % higher during the pandemic (95 % CI 32Â·6, 47Â·8, P value < 0Â·001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD.

It is unclear what measures have been taken by authorities in this setting to reduce the risk of infection, minimise stressors for refugees during the pandemic and communicate containment measures. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of measures that have been taken to prevent and contain SARS-CoVÂ­2 in collective accommodation for refugees and identification of support required by authorities. METHODS: Qualitative interview study with 48Â representatives responsible for the reception and accommodation of refugees. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim and evaluated using framework analysis. RESULTS: We found substantial heterogeneity of measures taken to prevent infection, inform refugees, maintain social and health services, test for SARS-CoVÂ­2 and quarantine positive cases. Effective intersectoral cooperation proved to be particularly important for coordination and implementation of measures. Need for support was expressed with regard to the improvement of infrastructure, opportunities to work with language interpreters and stronger involvement of local health experts. CONCLUSION: Amidst multiple actors and the complexity of structures and processes, the admission authorities have been taking on essential responsibilities related to infection control on an ad hoc basis, without being sufficiently positioned to do so.

"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Epidemic and Mental Health Status in the General Adult Population of Serbia: A Cross-Sectional Study","Since its outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world. The Serbian government declared a state of emergency on 15 March 2020, implementing some of Europe's strictest measures to combat the pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the mental health of the general adult Serbian population and to identify associated factors during the state of emergency and lockdown. Data were collected with a snowball sampling method between 23 March and 25 April 2020, by using an online questionnaire. Multiple ordinal regression was performed to establish the associations between socio-demographic characteristics, self-estimated health status, and depression, anxiety, and stress. Out of 1057 participants included in the study, 28.9%, 36.9%, and 38.1% reported moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Uneasiness related to COVID-19 news, the feeling of helplessness, likeliness of impending death, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores. Current smoking status was associated with a higher risk of depression and stress.

"Results of a Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of Tele-Savvy, an Online Synchronous/Asynchronous Psychoeducation Program for Family Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Family caregivers will grow in number as dementia prevalence increases, underscoring the continued importance of equipping these individuals for their new roles and ameliorating the adverse effects of caregiving. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-armed, waitlist, randomized trial design tested Tele-Savvy, an online adaptation of a successful in-person psychoeducation program, the Savvy Caregiver. Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in seven weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N=261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the three time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with DSMB approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions. RESULTS: Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care-recipients' behaviors and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers' emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period. Next steps entail finding alternate ways to deliver the program to those with connectivity and/or time constraint problems.","Hepburn, Kenneth; Nocera, Joe; Higgins, Melinda; Epps, Fayron; Brewster, Glenna S; Lindauer, Allison; Morhardt, Darby; Shah, Raj; Nash, Rachel; Griffiths, Patricia C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab029","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gerontologist;2021 Feb 26.; Publication details: Gerontologist;2021 Feb 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11764,""
"Physical Exercise as a Resilience Factor to Mitigate COVID-Related Allostatic Overload","The long-lasting threat of COVID-19 makes it necessary to explore strategies to improve coping skills which enable us to master a balanced life in the face of adversity. To unravel the most challenging aspects of COVID-19 in a nonclinical adult population and identify predictors of lost balance and consequent allostatic overload (AO). We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. An online survey was conducted to measure CO-VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale -(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3-5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1-2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29% (n = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (p = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (p = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (p &lt; 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (p &lt; 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) in fPE. Frequent moderate exercise is associated with better mental and physical well-being and a lower prevalence of AO.","EÃƒÂ¶ry, BÃƒÂ©kÃƒÂ©si, EÃƒÂ¶ry, RÃƒÂ³zsa","https://doi.org/10.1159/000514331","20210310","312 meridian exercise; Allostatic overload; Physical exercise; Resilience; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11765,""
"How Much Does the (Social) Environment Matter? Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict COVID-19 Outcomes with Socio-demographic Data","While the coronavirus pandemic has affected all demographic brackets and geographies, certain areas have been more adversely affected than others. This paper focuses on Veterans as a potentially vulnerable group that might be systematically more exposed to infection than others because of their co-morbidities, i.e., greater incidence of physical and mental health challenges. Using data on 122 Veteran Healthcare Systems (HCS), this paper tests three machine learning models for predictive analysis. The combined LASSO and ridge regression with five-fold cross validation performs the best. We find that socio-demographic features are highly predictive of both cases and deaths-even more important than any hospital-specific characteristics. These results suggest that socio-demographic and social capital characteristics are important determinants of public health outcomes, especially for vulnerable groups, like Veterans, and they should be investigated further.","Makridis, Mudide, Alterovitz","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+Much+Does+the+(Social)+Environment+Matter?+Using+Artificial+Intelligence+to+Predict+COVID-19+Outcomes+with+Socio-demographic+Data.","20210310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11766,""
"Psychological distress in the academic population and its association with socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: Results from a large multicenter Italian study","Measures implemented in many countries to contain the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a change in lifestyle with unpredictable consequences on physical and mental health. We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before. Socioeconomic insecurity contributes to increase mental problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the measures to contain it. Maintaining or introducing an adequate level of physical activity is likely to mitigate such detrimental effects.

Previous reviews show a high prevalence of mental disorders among health care workers, but these need updating and inclusion of studies written in Chinese. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese. Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies published in both English and Chinese were included. Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%). Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder. Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure. This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate support is urgently needed. The response would benefit from additional research on which interventions are effective at mitigating these risks.","Li, Scherer, Felix, Kuper","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246454","20210310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11768,""
"Evaluation of COVID-19 Disease Awareness and Its Relation to Mental Health, Dietary Habits, and Physical Activity: A Cross-Sectional Study from Pakistan","Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has significantly increased the mortality and morbidity rates worldwide. The present study was conducted to assess the general public's awareness of COVID-19 and its association with mental health, dietary habits, and physical activity. A web-based survey was conducted to gather information about demographics, knowledge about COVID-19, dietary habits, mental health, and anthropometry among the general public of Pakistan. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and multiple logistic regression were used for data analysis. The majority of the participants were suffering from anxiety (71.0%) and depression (52.0%) during the COVID-19 pandemic; 32.4% of participants had poor COVID-19-related knowledge. COVID-19 lockdown reduced the physical activity of 66.9% of participants and increased weight of 38.8% of the survey participants. Demographic variables, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment, family type, and geographical location, were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19 (P &lt; 0.05). Depression was inversely associated with COVID-19 knowledge (P &lt; 0.05). Healthy changes in dietary habits including decreased consumption of fast foods, soft and cola drinks, fruit drinks, cooked meat (outside the home), sugar, and fats, and were associated with increased knowledge of COVID-19. Vitamin C and immunity-boosting supplement consumption were significantly associated with increased knowledge regarding COVID-19 (&lt; 0.05). Inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and the presence of anxiety and depression were found among most of the study participants. There is a need to conduct educational seminars to limit the health consequences resulting from COVID-19 lockdown.","Ali, Sohaib, Iqbal, Hayat, Khan, Rasool","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1451","20210310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11769,""
"Health impacts of the &quot;Stay at Home&quot; order on community dwelling older adults and how technologies may help: A focus group study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 2.58 million deaths worldwide with over 500,000 of those in the US, at the time of this writing. Older adults (65 years of age) and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of death. Since March 2020, preventive measures including lockdowns, social isolation, quarantine and social distancing have been implemented to reduce viral spread. These measures, while effective for risk prevention, may contribute to increased social isolation and loneliness among older adults and negatively impact mental and physical health. Our objective was to identify the impact of the &quot;Stay-at-Home&quot; order on older adults living in a Continued Care Senior Housing Community (CCSHC) in Southern California. Methods: Four 90-minute focus groups were convened using the Zoom communications platform during May 2020 with 21 CCSHC residents participating. Participants were asked to describe how they were managing during the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; mandate that was implemented in March 2020, including impact on their physical and mental health. Transcripts of each focus group were analyzed using qualitative methods. Four themes emerged from the qualitative data including: 1 - Impact of Quarantine on Health and Well-Being; 2 - Communication Innovation and Technology Use; 3 - Effective Ways of Coping with Quarantine; and 4 - Improving Access to Technology and Training. Participants reported a threat to their mental and physical health directly tied to quarantine and exacerbated by social isolation and decreased physical activity. Technology was identified as a lifeline for many who are socially isolated from friends and family. Conclusions: Technology access, connectivity, and literacy are potential game-changers to supporting the mental and physical health of older adults and must be prioritized.","Daly, Depp, Graham, Jeste, Kim, Lee, Nebeker","https://doi.org/10.2196/25779","20210310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11770,""
"Echo Chamber Effect in the Discussions of Rumor Rebuttal about COVID-19 in China: Existence and Impact","The dissemination of rumor rebuttal on social media is vital for rumor control and disease containment during the public health crisis. Previous researches on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination network and users' cognition, decision-making and interaction behaviors. This research aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, deeply dig into the attitude-based echo chamber effect in the users' response towards rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media, in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, and its impact on information characteristics of user interaction content. We called Sina Weibo API to crawl rumor rebuttal related to COVID-19 from 10:00 a.m. on January 23, 2020 to 0:00 a.m. on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was echo chamber effect in individual's attitude shaping when retweeting or commenting on others. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results of user- and community- levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined the users' interaction content from three dimensions of sentimental expression, information seeking/sharing, and civilization to test the impact of echo chamber effect. Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization and the commenting mechanism in consensus building, denied that there might be significant echo chamber effect in community interaction, and verified that compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions significantly contained more negative sentiment, information seeking/sharing and incivility. Besides, we found that online users' information seeking was accompanied by incivility, and information sharing was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. Our findings revealed the existence and degree of echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions (such as topic, interaction mechanism, interaction level) and its impact on interaction content. These findings can provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","Wang, Qian","https://doi.org/10.2196/27009","20210310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11771,""
"Changes in alcohol use since the onset of COVID-19 are associated with psychological distress among sexual and gender minority university students in the US","Sexual and gender minority (SGM) young persons are experiencing compounding effects of COVID-19 due to unique social inequalities and existent mental health and substance use challenges. Given that 41% of all young persons are enrolled in universities, and the increased vulnerabilities faced by SGM young persons during the pandemic, it is imperative to understand the effects of alcohol use on mental health among SGM university students amid COVID-19. This study aims to examine the associations between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress among SGM university students in the U.S., and to explore sex-stratified differences. A nonprobability cross-sectional sample of 509 SGM university students (M<sub>age</sub> = 22.04 years, SD = 3.99) were retrospectively surveyed online between May-August 2020 and asked if their alcohol use had changed since the start of COVID-19. Statistical analyses explored the association between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress. Average psychological distress (M = 27.79, SD = 7.82) was relatively high as per existing research and established clinical cutoff scores. Roughly 32% had increased alcohol use since the start of COVID-19. Subsequently, greater alcohol use (p &lt; .05) since the start of COVID-19 was associated with higher psychological distress among SGM university students, and among females but not males assigned at birth. Higher education, medical, and behavioral health professionals should consider how to adapt their practice to address alcohol use and psychological burdens among SGM university students (especially females) who are facing health inequities during and beyond COVID-19, requiring SGM-affirmative care.","Salerno, Shrader, Algarin, Lee, Fish","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108594","20210310","Alcohol use; COVID-19; College students; LGBTQ; Mental health; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11772,""

To examine the experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and loneliness and use of social media among people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. A cross-country comparative survey of people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. Relevant statistical analyses were used to examine differences between the countries and to explore associations between demographic, mental health and psychosocial variables and use of social media. There were 3810 respondents from four countries, of which 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°74% showed a high level of emotional distress. The Norwegian population reported significantly better mental health, QoL and wellbeing and lower levels of loneliness compared to the other countries. High-frequent use of social media after the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with poorer mental- and psychosocial health. The results suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak took a toll on people's experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and experienced loneliness, and high-frequent use of social media was associated with these factors.","Geirdal, Ruffolo, Leung, Thygesen, Price, Bonsaksen, Schoultz","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1875413","20210310","COVID-19; comparative study; coronavirus; loneliness; mental health; quality of life; social distancing; social media; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11773,""
"Factors Associated with Serious Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a negative impact on mental health of the population, leading to higher suicide rates, in many countries. However, little is known about risk factors associated with worsened mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate the factors associated with serious psychological distress (SPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. A cross-sectional study using a large-scale internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan. Demographics (age, gender, marital status, family composition, and caregiving burden), socio-economic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment), the experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency, fear of COVID-19, and stigma related to COVID-19. Prevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale score Ã¢â€°Â¥13. Among 25,482 individuals included in this study, 2,556 (10%) met the criteria of SPD. Overall, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.59; 95%CI, 1.17-2.16; P=0.003), ages 15-29 (aOR compared with ages 45-59, 2.35; 95%CI, 1.64-3.38; P&lt;0.001), low income (aOR compared with intermediate income, 1.70; 95%CI, 1.16-2.49; P=0.007), providing caregiving to family members (aOR, 5.48; 95%CI, 3.51-8.56; P&lt;0.001), experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI, 3.81-8.59; P&lt;0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55-2.48; P&lt;0.001) were associated with a higher rate of SPD. Among women aged 15-29 years, who experienced the highest rate of SPD, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were associated with a higher rate of SPD; whereas economic situation (income level and employment type) and social isolation (marital status) were not associated with the prevalence of SPD. Economic situation, caregiving burden, DV, and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among young women-who have a higher risk of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan-similar factors, except economic situation, were associated with a higher rate of SPD.

"Survey of Mental Health of Dentists in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK","To assess the impact of work-related changes on the mental health (MH) of dentists during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Dentists involved in certain treatments, for example, high-speed drilling procedures, generate infectious aerosols. These Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGPs) are at the highest risk of transmission of coronavirus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of dentists in the UK were restricted from providing treatments to reduce the risk of viral transmission. Some of the dentists providing urgent dental treatment were involved in AGPs. Significant and sudden changes in the delivery of dental care in the current pandemic may have impacted the MH of dentists. An online survey was conducted, using validated tools to measure the MH symptoms and stress. Pearson's chi-squared test of independence was used for statistical analysis. Overall, 123 dentists participated in the survey. The prevalence of anxiety-related symptoms was 71% (95% CI 0.62-0.78), depression-related symptoms was 60% (95% CI 0.51-0.68), and stress was 92% (95% CI 0.86-0.96). Dentists working in the independent sector had more psychological symptoms compared with those in the public sector (<i>P = 0.014</i>). Working in the public sector appeared to have a protective effect. Almost all the dentists in this survey were experiencing MH symptoms and stress.

"Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in a Patient with COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide spectrum of cardiovascular (CV) manifestations. Primary cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 disease include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocarditis, and arrhythmias. Secondary cardiac involvement is usually due to a systemic inflammatory syndrome and can manifest as acute myocardial injury/biomarker elevation and/or heart failure (congestive heart failure). Elevated cardiac biomarkers indicate an unfavorable prognosis. Health-care systems of the world are rapidly learning more about the manifestations of COVID-19 on the CV system, as well as the strategies for the management of infected patients with CV disease. There is still a paucity of literature on the management of non-ST-segment elevation ACSs in the current literature. Herein, we report the case of a 53-year-old male patient, who presented with severe COVID-19 pneumonia deteriorating into adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation.

In the study, back-translation method was used to prepare the SDS-Turkish version. Confirmatory factor analysis results for the study showed that the single-dimension structure fits very well, as in the original form. Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the scale was calculated as 0.70. In line with the second aim of the study, the data were tested using a structural equation model analysis. Research results showed that depression, anxiety, and stress have a full mediator role in the relationship between social distancing and resilience for Turkish residents.

"Excessive Worrying as the Driving Force of Anxiety During the First COVID-19 Lockdown-Phase in Belgium","Since the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted public health and the economy worldwide. But there are not the only ones to be hit. The COVID-19 pandemic has also substantially altered mental health, with anxiety symptoms being one of the most frequently reported problems. Especially, the number of people reporting anxiety symptoms increased significantly during the first lockdown-phase compared to similar data collected before the pandemic. Yet, most of these studies relied on a unitary approach to anxiety, wherein its different constitutive features (i.e., symptoms) were tallied into one sum-score, thus ignoring any possibility of interactions between them. Therefore, in this study, we seek to map the associations between the core features of anxiety during the first weeks of the first Belgian COVID-19 lockdown-phase (n = 2,829). To do so, we implemented, in a preregistered fashion, two distinct computational network approaches: a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Despite their varying assumptions, constraints, and computational methods to determine nodes (i.e., the variables) and edges (i.e., the relations between them), both GGM and DAG pointed to excessive worrying as a node playing an especially influential role in the network system of the anxiety features. Altogether, our findings offer novel data-driven clues for the ongoing field's larger quest to elucidate, and eventually alleviate, the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alexandre Heeren et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607D-C22-F29","20210311","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; covid-19; gad; pandemic; lockdown; worry; gaussian graphical model; anxiety; directed acyclic graph; network approach to psychopathology; psychopathology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-11","",11780,""
