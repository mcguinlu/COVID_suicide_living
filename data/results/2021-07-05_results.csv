"Facilitators and Barriers to Compliance with COVID-19 Guidelines: A Structural Topic Modelling Analysis of Free-Text Data from 17,500 UK Adults","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has implemented a series of guidelines, rules, and restrictions to change citizens' behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus, such as the promotion of face-masks and the imposition of lockdown stay-at-home orders. The success of these measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance has not been complete. Detailed data is required on the factors aiding or hindering compliance with these measures. Methods: To understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020. Results: The main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to one's self and one's family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved one, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family. Conclusion: The results demonstrate an array of factors contribute to compliance with guidelines. Of particular policy importance, the results suggest that government communications that emphasizes the potential risks of COVID-19 and provides simple, consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours.","Liam Wright; Elise Paul; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259621","20210704","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","",15687,""
"Written benefit finding for improving psychological health during the Covid-19 pandemic first wave lockdown","<b>Objectives.</b> Written benefit finding is known to improve psychological and physical health in a range of patient groups. Here, we tested the efficacy of written benefit finding, delivered online during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, on mood and physical symptoms. We also investigated perseverative thinking as a moderator of these effects. <b>Design.</b> A quantitative longitudinal design was employed. <b>Main Outcome Measures</b>. Participants (n<b>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</b>=<b>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</b>91) completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms at baseline, and two weeks after being randomised to complete three consecutive days of writing about the positive thoughts and feelings they experienced during the pandemic (written benefit finding) or to unemotively describe the events of the previous day (control). State anxiety was measured immediately before and after writing. Perseverative thinking was measured at baseline. <b>Results.</b> Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased between baseline and the two week follow-up, but did not differ significantly between the two conditions. Perseverative thinking was negatively associated with changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, but did not moderate any writing effects. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety in the written benefit finding condition. <b>Conclusions.</b> Written benefit finding may be a useful intervention for short-term improvements in wellbeing.","Hansen, Wetherell, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1936521","20210616","Written benefit finding; anxiety; depression; expressive writing; physical symptoms; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","",15688,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Caribbean Medical Students: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a wide range of challenges to numerous institutions around the world. One of these vital programs being affected is Caribbean medical schools. To continue to train future physicians, Caribbean medical schools have been forced to deliver lectures through video chat, delaying clinical training years as well as exams. Reveal current shortcomings in medical education to improve future learning strategies based on student perspectives. To further explore the impact of COVID-19 on medical training in the Caribbean, a cross sectional designed survey was constructed and made available for completion to numerous 2nd, 3rd and 4th year medical students between the dates of Feb 2nd, 2021, and April 1st, 2021. Students reported being less time efficient and paying less attention during online lectures. Many students reported having their Comp, Step 1, Clinical rotations, and research projects delayed because of the lockdown. Most students ranked 10/10 on anxiety and depression scores during the lockdown. The changes made to the Caribbean Medical school system due to the Pandemic have shown to be less effective than previous methods of instruction. It is crucial for programs to consider this for the future to optimize learning and continue to produce highly trained medical professionals even in the face of adversity.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102515","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","",15690,""
