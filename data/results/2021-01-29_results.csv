"Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Well-Educated, Employed Adults with Low Infection Risks","Levels and distributions of depression symptoms 8-10 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are reported in a population of faculty, staff, and students at Duke University who faced minimal infection and economic disruption due to the pandemic. Almost 5,000 respondents age 18-81 years who completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) battery reported high rates of depression symptoms with more than 40% reporting levels that indicate risk of moderate depression and 25% indicating risk of severe depression. There is a very steep age gradient with the highest levels reported by the youngest respondents of whom over 40% are at risk of severe depression. Symptoms are worse among those who report the demands of work often interfere with family responsibilities but these pressures neither explain the high reported rates nor the steep age gradient. Severe depression risks are highest among students. High levels of depression symptoms during the pandemic appear to be persistent and not confined to those at greatest risk of infection or economic insecurity.","Duncan Thomas; Tyson Brown; Donald H Taylor Jr.; Ralph Lawton; Victoria K Lee; Menna Mburi; Michelle Wong; Rachel Kranton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250558","20210129","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10031,""
"Association of COVID-19 incidence with objectively and subjectively measured mental health proxies in the Austrian Football League: an epidemiological study","Objective We aimed to explore the association of COVID-19 incidence with mental health in 225 team and staff members of five professional Austrian Football clubs captured by objective (location variance) or subjective (self-reported sleep quality, level of recovery, perceived risk of infection) mental health proxies. Methods Data collected during the implementation of a novel monitoring concept to enable safe continuation of professional Football during the COVID-19 pandemic were matched with Austrian COVID-19 incidence data and smartphone collected location data (time-period June 17th to July 31st, 2020). Multivariable linear regression models explored the association of COVID-19 incidence, defined as daily novel or active cases of COVID-19, with the objective and subjective health proxies while adjusting for the occurrence of one COVID-19 case in a staff member in one of the clubs, team status (i.e. player vs staff) and game days. Results Data from 115 participants were analysed. An increasing number of novel COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with deteriorating sleep quality (B 0.48, 95% CI 0.05; 1.00) but with none of the other mental health proxies. An increasing number of active COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with an increase in perceived infection risk (B 0.04, 95% CI 0.00; 0.07) and location variance (B 0.28, 95% CI 0.06; 0.49). Conclusion The adverse association of an increasing COVID-19 incidence with mental health in professional Footballers and staff members became obvious particularly in subjectively measured mental health. During the ongoing pandemic, targeted mental care should be included in the daily routines of this population.","Antje van der Zee-Neuen; Alexander Seymer; Dagmar Schaffler-Schaden; Juergen Herfert; James O Brien; Tim Johansson; Patrick Kutschar; Stephan Ludwig; Thomas Stoeggl; David Keeley; Maria Flamm; Juergen Osterbrink","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.21250527","20210129","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10032,""

"Americans' distress early in the COVID-19 pandemic: Protective resources and coping strategies","The rapid emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States has dramatically altered daily life and taken a toll on Americans' physical, mental, social, and financial well-being. Based on previous widespread disasters, future high prevalence of short- and long-term adverse mental health consequences are anticipated. Studies of COVID-19 outside the United States indicated moderately high levels of distress, but we have little information regarding Americans' distress nor the factors associated with relative distress or adjustment during this unprecedented time. This study represents the first national view of Americans' distress during the massive disruption of COVID-19 and identifies levels of stress exposure, protective psychosocial resources, and coping strategies. Data were collected April 7-9, 2020 from an online platform, using best practices for ensuring high-quality data; 1,015 completed respondents are included ([53.9%] women; average age = 38.9 years; mostly White [82.4%] and non-Hispanic [91.5%]). Respondents' locations ranged across the United States, from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. Fairly high levels of stress exposure and peritraumatic and general distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) were reported. Emotion regulation skills along with active and distraction coping emerged as the strongest predictors of lower distress levels. These results identify potential targets for online mental health interventions-focusing on engaging in adaptive emotion regulation and coping (e.g., through telehealth mental health first aid)-during the pandemic to offset the likely rise in distress over the months ahead.

"[Rheumatology update 2020: the focus was on Covid-19]","In 2020, clinical studies have opened the way for several new treatment options in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis arthritis, spondylarthritis and lupus. However, this year was mainly characterized by the Covid-19 pandemic which had a substantial impact on rheumatology. The initial fear for immune-compromised patients undergoing more severe Covid-19 courses remained without evidence. She same was true for the hype of several rheumatic treatments such as Plaquenil or anti-IL-6 blockade which finally did not show efficacy in prospective trials for Covid-19 pneumonia. On the other side, notably the first confinement had a substantial negative impact on rheumatic patients. Our patients are still struggling with the consequences of prolonged immobilization, lack of physiotherapy, missing consultations and treatment adaption as well as social isolation and depression. Telemedicine and upcoming digital solutions compensated this gap at least partially. The post-Covid syndrome with persisting fibromyalgia-like symptoms potentially will join the spectrum of rheumatic disorders.

"The impact of COVID-19 on surgical training: a systematic review","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused global disruption to health care. Non-urgent elective surgical cases have been cancelled, outpatient clinics have reduced and there has been a reduction in the number of patients presenting as an emergency. These factors will drastically affect the training opportunities of surgical trainees. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training globally. The review was performed in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF). Medline, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. The searches identified 499 articles, 29 of which were included in the review. This contained data from more than 20 countries with 5260 trainees and 339 programme directors. Redeployment to non-surgical roles varied across studies from 6% to 35.1%. According to all of the studies, operative experience has been reduced. Knowledge learning had been switched to online platforms across 17 of the studies and 7 reported trainees had increased time to devote to educational/academic activities. All of the studies reporting on mental health report negative associations with increased stress, ranging from 54.9% to 91.6% of trainees. The impact of COVID-19 on surgical trainees has been experienced globally and across all specialities. Negative effects are not limited to operative and clinical experience, but also the mental health and wellbeing of trainees. Delivery of surgical training will need to move away from traditional models of learning to ensure trainees are competent and well supported.","Hope, Reilly, Griffiths, Lund, Humes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02404-5","20210128","COVID-19; Coronavirus 2019; Medical education; Surgery; Surgical training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10052,""

"Mental health problems experienced by patients with rheumatic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic","Patients with rheumatic diseases are more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression and insomnia. Yet, little is known about mental health status during COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to measure the prevalence of mental health disorders among patients with rheumatic diseases in the era of COVID-19 pandemic and to determine potential risk factors for major symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in participants. Participants with rheumatic diseases were asked to complete a questionnaire using a telephonic interview. Sociodemographic and rheumatic disease characteristics were recorded. Mental health status was assessed by the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7, and insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaires to detect depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, respectively. We included 307 patients in the survey. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent diagnosis (55%). Of all participants, 7.5% had known depression and 5.5% known anxiety. Mental health disorders were insomnia (34.9%), anxiety (33.2%), and depression (24.4%). Major symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression were noted in respectively, 19.9%, 12.4%, and 7.8% of participants. Risk factors for major insomnia were male gender (OR= 4.36, 95% CI 2.06 to 9.25; p&lt;0.0001), low socioeconomic status (OR= 2.64, 95% CI 1.44 - 4.83; p&lt;0.002) and having rheumatoid arthritis (OR= 2.00, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.84; p&lt;0.036). Major anxiety was associated with low monthly income (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.01; p&lt;0.026), and higher Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain (OR=1.795, 95% CI 1.074 to 2.994 ; p&lt;0.026). Major depression was associated with worsening of rheumatic disease (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.26; p&lt;0.03). A high frequency of undiagnosed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was found in rheumatic patients. Rheumatologists should be aware of these comorbidities, especially in the era of COVID-19 pandemic.","Adnine, Nadiri, Soussan, Coulibaly, Berrada, Najdi, Abourazzak","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573397117666210127124544","20210128","Anxiety; COVID-19 ; Depression; Insomnia; Mental health; Rheumatic diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10055,""
"Nursing students, mental health status during COVID-19 quarantine: evidence from three European countries","The SARS-CoV2 pandemic obligated most of the European countries to implement strict measures and lockdowns to minimize the spread of the virus. Universities closed and on-line classes started. However, COVID-19 epidemic has significant impact on mental health of population. To assess depression level of nursing students (undergraduate and master) in Greece, Spain and Albania during COVID-19 pandemic as well as to identify possible determinants of depression level. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020. An on-line questionnaire was used to collect the data. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to evaluate the depression levels of nursing students. Seven hundred and eighty-seven nursing students participated in the study out of which 83.9% were of female gender, 92.9% single and 94.7% lived with others. One third of the nursing student population experienced mild depression, with higher depression levels noted for Spanish students (59.1%) followed by Albanian (34.5%) and Greek (21.8%) students. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified that Spanish students experienced more depression than Greek and Albanian (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Also, decreased age was associated with increased depression. The impact of lockdown and quarantine on nursing students mental health is clear. Provision of university based mental health interventions should be a priority.","Patelarou, Mechili, Galanis, Zografakis-Sfakianakis, Konstantinidis, Saliaj, Bucaj, Alushi, Carmona-Torres, Cobo-Cuenca, Laredo-Aguilera, Patelarou","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1875420","20210128","COVID-19; depression; mental health; nursing students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10056,""
"How Does The COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Population Mental Health? A Network Analysis of COVID Influences On Depression, Anxiety and Traumatic Stress in the UK Population","Background. The COVID-19 emergency has led to numerous attempts to assess the impact of the pandemic on population mental health. Findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. Methods. Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025 recruited March 23rd â€“ March 28th 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406 recontacts, 22 April â€“ 1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalised anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ) and also measures of Covid-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. Results. A mixed graphical model at wave 1 indicated that economic adversity impacted on anxiety symptoms via specific anxiety about the pandemic. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. Conclusions. The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown. Adverse psychiatric outcomes were particularly associated with exposure to the economic consequences of the pandemic.","Orestis Zavlis et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46006-92B-768","20210129","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; covid-19; mental health; economic worries; pandemic; network analysis; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10057,""
"Epidemiology of suicide in Israel and under the British Mandate, 1919-2019","Aims: To provide a descriptive epidemiology of suicide in the Hebrew/Jewish population in Palestine under the British Mandate and in Israel, as a society of immigrants. Method: Information regarding the Israeli population since mid-1948 was collected from records of the Israeli Ministry of Health and the Central Bureau of Statistics. The British Mandate Administration collected and registered statistical data regarding suicide since 1938. Therefore, data for the years 1919-1937 were estimated by the author. Results: The study discerns a picture of decreasing suicide rates, in particular for suicide rates among women. In addition, analysis of suicide rates by gender reveals an uneven distribution, where more men than women died by suicide. Conclusions: The noticeable changes in the suicide rates throughout the years were influenced by the countries of birth from which the immigrants came. Thus, compared with immigrants from Europe, those from Middle Eastern and North African Muslim countries have remarkedly reduced the overall rates in Israel. The study also indicates a substantial connection of wars with the changing trends of suicide rates.","Israel Oron","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612F-9F2-7D3","20210128","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; israel; immigration; suicide rates; british mandate for palestine","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-29","",10058,""
