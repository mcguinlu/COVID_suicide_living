"Twitter Discussions and Emotions About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach","BACKGROUND: It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""quarantine"") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams included ""virus,"" ""lockdown,"" and ""quarantine."" Popular bigrams included ""COVID-19,"" ""stay home,"" ""corona virus,"" ""social distancing,"" and ""new cases."" We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning. Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, Chengda; Su, Yue; Zhu, Tingshao","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20550","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e20550, 2020 11 25.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e20550, 2020 11 25.; /epidemiology; Emotions/physiology; Machine Learning; Social Media; /virology; Data Collection/methods; Humans; /isolation & purification; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9478,""
"Poverty, depression, and anxiety: Causal evidence and mechanisms","Why are people who live in poverty disproportionately affected by mental illness? We review the interdisciplinary evidence of the bidirectional causal relationship between poverty and common mental illnesses-depression and anxiety-and the underlying mechanisms. Research shows that mental illness reduces employment and therefore income, and that psychological interventions generate economic gains. Similarly, negative economic shocks cause mental illness, and antipoverty programs such as cash transfers improve mental health. A crucial step toward the design of effective policies is to better understand the mechanisms underlying these causal effects.","Ridley, Matthew; Rao, Gautam; Schilbach, Frank; Patel, Vikram","https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aay0214","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Science;370(6522)2020 12 11.; Publication details: Science;370(6522)2020 12 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9479,""
"Faculty Perceptions: A Qualitative Study of the Perceived Need, Opportunities, and Challenges of Developing ""One Health-One Medicine"" in the Medical, Veterinary, and Public Health Curricula","INTRODUCTION: The conceptual framework of One Health (OH) provides a strategy for promoting collaboration across the nexus of animal, human, and environmental health, which is essential for tackling emerging disease threats, such as COVID-19. However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula. METHODS: In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students. DISCUSSION: Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.","Roopnarine, Rohini; Regan, Julie-Anne","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000332","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Contin Educ Health Prof;Publish Ahead of Print2021 Jan 08.; Publication details: J Contin Educ Health Prof;Publish Ahead of Print2021 Jan 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9480,""
"Anxiety, depression, and health anxiety in undergraduate students living in initial US outbreak ""hotspot"" during COVID-19 pandemic","Evidence of the psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including depression, anxiety, and health anxiety, has been documented globally. College students are a unique sub-set of the population with consistently elevated psychological distress associated with the pandemic, and well-informed intervention is urgently needed. The current study is the first, to our knowledge, to document the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of undergraduates in a heavily impacted area in the United States. Cross-sectional, self-report data on psychological distress and COVID-19 exposure were collected from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 641 undergraduates between April 7-9 May 2020. Nearly half of the students reported elevated psychological distress, including health anxiety, general anxiety, and depression. Heightened risk of psychological distress was associated with female sex, a COVID-19 case in one's immediate social network, underlying medical vulnerabilities, and recent experience of &#8805;3 viral symptoms. Vigilance to viral symptoms and worry about coronavirus were also factors associated with more severe psychological distress. The current study highlights some of the factors associated with a greater risk of developing psychological distress due to COVID-19 and can be used to inform the dissemination of psychological interventions.","Kibbey, Mindy M; Fedorenko, Erick J; Farris, Samantha G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2020.1853805","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cogn Behav Ther;: 1-13, 2021 Jan 12.; Publication details: Cogn Behav Ther;: 1-13, 2021 Jan 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9481,""
"""Corona-Debriefing"": concept and pilot testing of a 90-minute workshop for undergraduate-education and specialist-training in family medicine","Background: The corona pandemic is changing the framework conditions for medical studies and continuing education as well as the work with patients and within teams. Systematic reflection and communication about experiences and ways of dealing with them forms the basis for successful learning in and out of the crisis. Therefore, we designed a 90-minute workshop ""Corona-Debriefing"" for students and physicians in specialist-training in family medicine (Ã„iW) using three successive moderated interaction phases: Questionnaire survey via tele-dialogue voting (TED) with immediate presentation of results and discussion, moderated experience reports on the categories risk/assessment/support/coping and finally moderated group discussions in small groups to collect ""best practice"" examples of crisis management. Objective: We tested ""Corona-Debriefing"" as a pilot test with 48 participants (TN) in July 2020 (30 present, 14 online) in order to assess mental stress and risk perception of participants plus formative/brief summative evaluation of the workshop. Methods: The PHQ-4 with its subscales GAD-2 (anxiety) and PHQ-2 (depression) was used to assess mental stress; risk assessments were made by means of self-constructed 5-point Likert-scales for the dimensions person/society/health/economy. A formative evaluation was carried out by means of a questionnaire at the end of the event; the brief summative assessment was asked for by means of a school grading scale. Results: 37 complete TED questionnaires and 22 evaluations were obtained. TN showed a low personal risk assessment, but considerable fears about social and economic developments. Needs are seen mainly in improvements regarding organization, protective equipment and technical communication (e.g. official recommendations for action). The workshop was rated ""good"" or ""very good"" in 95% of the evaluations. Criticism was directed at the limited time available, the narrowing of topics by moderators and the desire for (even) more room for the exchange of personal experiences. Conclusion: The workshop ""Corona-Debriefing"" is a relatively easy way to use crisis experiences for learning processes. ""Corona-Debriefing"" can be used by changing the focus of moderation in various courses, years or fields of study, whereby the participants' own personal and clinical crisis experiences remain a prerequisite for a meaningful ""debriefing"".","Klement, Andreas; Ibs, Torben; Longard, Sebastian; Klinkhart, Catarina; Frese, Thomas; Heise, Marcus","https://dx.doi.org/10.3205/zma001388","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: GMS J Med Educ;37(7): Doc95, 2020.; Publication details: GMS J Med Educ;37(7): Doc95, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9482,""
"Dyspnea, Acute Respiratory Failure, Psychological Trauma, and Post-ICU Mental Health: A Caution and a Call for Research","Dyspnea is an uncomfortable sensation with the potential to cause psychological trauma. Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with ARDS. Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS, is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern, and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence. We suggest such efforts will be more successful if they are directed at the known mechanisms of air hunger. Investigation of the antidyspnea effects of sedative and analgesic drugs commonly used in the ICU and their impact on post-ARDS PTSD symptoms is a logical next step. Although in practice we often accept negative consequences of life-saving therapies as unavoidable, we must understand the negative sequelae of our therapies and work to minimize them under our primary directive to ""first, do no harm"" to patients.","Worsham, Christopher M; Banzett, Robert B; Schwartzstein, Richard M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Chest;2020 Oct 01.; Publication details: Chest;2020 Oct 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9483,""

In this article, I argue that COVID-19 is mainly intensifying pre-existing trends, set in motion by the global financial crisis of 2008 and the People?s Republic of China (PRC)?s economic rise  The disruptions to global supply chains wrought by COVID-19 have combined with rising United States?PRC rivalry, growing disaffection with the distributional impacts of global value chains, and automation to catalyze the turn away from globalized production  Meanwhile, amid the economic doom and gloom, financial markets are booming, high on the central banks? liquidity injections to which they have been addicted since the 2008 crisis  As in the decade since the 2008 crisis, booming markets will likely deepen inequality and resentment, fuelling economic nationalism and eroding support for globalization even more  The governments of relatively small and open economies, such as Australia and Canada, will need to guide their economies more purposefully or find themselves at the mercy of the increasingly confrontational, yet domestically fragile, United States and the PRC","","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020702020985325","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal;: 0020702020985325, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal;: 0020702020985325, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9495,""
"Distress and adjustment difficulty due to the covid-19 pandemic in Israel: Mediation effect of sleep quality","Objectives/Introduction: Israel's strategy for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic was to keep the population 1 in home quarantine and to maintain social distancing  The new situation can cause a negative psychological impact as found by previous study during the Equine Influenza epidemic in South America  In addition, as stated in the literature, distress feelings are a precursor to insomnia development  Insomnia can be a risk factor for Adjustment Difficulty (AjD) due to COVID-19 pandemic  The aims were to examine: 1  The differences between 2 groups (with vs  without AjD) in distress and sleep quality (Insomnia)  2  Whether Insomnia is a mediator between distress level and AjD groups  Methods: 439 subjects, mean age of 37 9 (Â± 16 5 yrs), 313 women (71%), from the non-infected community, participated in the study  Tools: Demographic, Adjustment (ADNM-4), Distress (Anxiety, Depression, Stress: DASS21), and Sleep quality (PSQI) questionnaires  Procedure: The data collection took place over two weeks during the home quarantine period, via an anonymous online questionnaire, at the point when the number of COVID-19 patients was at its peak, and prohibitions regarding COVID-19 were at their most severe  Results: Dividing the sample into 2 adjustment groups (a score greater than 8 5 indicative of AjD) revealed that 54% of the participants presented difficulty adjusting to the COVID-19  Significant differences were found between the groups, in level of distress (35 56 Â± 12 38 vs  27 14 Â± 7 32 respectively;p &lt; 0 001) and Insomnia (PSQI-total) (6 82 Â± 2 49 vs  5 98 Â± 2 2 respectively;p &lt; 0 001)  After controlling for age, distress predicted adjustment (OR = 1 11, 95% CI:1 08-1 14)  as well as insomnia (b = 0 11, se = 0 005, t(436) = 11 61, p &lt; 0 001)  In addition, insomnia predicted adjustment after controlling for age (OR = 1 34, 95% CI:1 22-1 46)  The association between distress and AjD groups was partially mediated by insomnia (indirect effect = 0 01, se = 0 0065;95% CI: 0 005, 0 031) as 0 did not fall in the confidence interval, and stress still predicted adjustment (OR = 1 09, 95% CI: 1 05-1 12, p &lt; 0 001)  Conclusions: The strategy adopted in Israel to keep all the population in home quarantine and to maintain social distancing has significant psychological and behavioral effects, which include adjustment difficulties, severe levels of distress mediated by impaired sleep quality (Insomnia)","","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13181","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Sleep Research;29(SUPPL 1), 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Sleep Research;29(SUPPL 1), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9496,""

There are multiple associated psychological disturbances, ranging from isolated symptoms to complex disorders with marked impairment of functionality, such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, it is necessary for mental health services to develop strategies that allow them to react skillfully and provide support to health workers and the affected population so as to reduce the psychological impact as well as the development of psychiatric symptoms. The purpose of this reflection article is to show the possible consequences on the mental health of the population as a result of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.; Resumen La pandemia por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) es una emergencia de salud pÃºblica de preocupaciÃ³n internacional, con impactos sin precedentes en el siglo XXI y hoy representa un gran desafÃ­o a la salud mental.

Los factores asociados con un alto impacto psicolÃ³gico y niveles elevados de estrÃ©s, sÃ­ntomas de ansiedad y depresiÃ³n fueron sexo femenino, ser estudiante, tener sÃ­ntomas fÃ­sicos especÃ­ficos y una percepciÃ³n pobre de la propia salud. Otro estudio en el mismo paÃ­s detectÃ³ un 35% de distrÃ©s psicolÃ³gico en la poblaciÃ³n general, con las mujeres presentando mayores niveles que los varones, al igual que los sub-grupos de 18-30 aÃ±os y los mayores de 60 aÃ±os. La pandemia plantea pues el desafÃ­o de cuidar la salud mental del personal de salud tanto como la de la poblaciÃ³n general. AsÃ­, el uso de instrumentos breves de detecciÃ³n de problemas de salud mental, validados en nuestra poblaciÃ³n, serÃ­a de mucha utilidad para los retos de salud pÃºblica que afronta el paÃ­s.; Summary In the fight against the Coronavirus (COVID-19), health workers may experience mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. In a study in China, anxiety among health workers reached a 23.04%, with higher levels among women than men, and also higher among nurses than doctors. Likewise, in the general Chinese population, there was a moderate to severe psychological impact of 53.8%, with 16.5% of depressive symptoms, 28.8% of anxiety symptoms and 8.1% of stress, all of them between moderate to severe. Factors associated with a high psychological impact and high levels of stress, anxious and depressive symptoms were female sex, being a student, and having specific physical symptoms and a poor perception of their own health. Another study in China detected 35% of psychological distress in the general population, women presenting it more than men as well as the groups of 18-30 and over 60 years of age. The pandemic challenges us to take care of the health workers' mental health as much as of the general population's. Thus, the use of brief screening mental health scales, validated in our population, would be very effective to face the current public health challenges in our country.","Lozano-Vargas, Antonio","http://www.scielo.org.pe/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-85972020000100051","","Country: PE; PERU; PERU; PERU; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Rev. neuropsiquiatr;83(1): 51-56, ene. 2020.; Publication details: Rev. neuropsiquiatr;83(1): 51-56, ene. 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9527,""

Teniendo como trasfondo las dimensiones de experiencia y expectativa de las sociedades, el substrato dialÃ³gico del pensamiento bioÃ©tico es refraseado como una psicoÃ©tica que incorpora una evaluaciÃ³n de las respuestas que manifiesta el pÃºblico, los comunicadores y las autoridades. Se refuerza la necesidad de un situacionismo empÃ­rico en la deliberaciÃ³n moral y la demanda de una axiologÃ­a empÃ­rica en la cual los juicios se hagan despuÃ©s de contrastar continuamente valores, principios y normas con la conducta real de las personas.; Abstract After discussing the scope and implications of the expression ""mental health"" at both the individual and social levels, this paper emphasizes that suffering (a pathic condition) is not always pathological in medical terms, and should be taken into consideration when evaluating the responses to the syndemic (the synergistic outcome of many alterations of the social milieu) caused by Covid19. Against the background of the historical-anthropological dimensions of experience and expectation of societies, the dialogical underpinning of bioethical thinking is rephrased as a psychoethics that incorporates an evaluation of the responses affecting the public, the communicators, and authorities. This reinforces the need for an empirical situationism in moral deliberation and the demand for empirical axiology in which judgments are made after continuous contrasting values, principles, and norms with the actual behavior of people.; Resumo Depois de discutir o Ã¢mbito e as implicaÃ§Ãµes da expressÃ£o ""saÃºde mental"" tanto a nÃ­veis individual e social, esse artigo enfatiza que o sofrimento (uma condiÃ§Ã£o pÃ¡tica) nem sempre Ã© patolÃ³gico em termos mÃ©dicos e deve ser levado em consideraÃ§Ã£o quando se avalia as respostas ao sindÃªmico (o desfecho sinÃ©rgico de muitas alteraÃ§Ãµes do ambiente social) causado pela Covid19.

"COVID-19 and its association with depressive mood symptoms in the Spanish Population; COVID-19 y su asociaciÃ³n con sÃ­ntomas depresivos en poblaciÃ³n espaÃ±ola","RESUMEN  IntroducciÃ³n: la emergencia sanitaria por el COVID-19 ha generado una conmociÃ³n mundial que conlleva una serie de problemÃ¡ticas relacionadas con la salud, los factores psicosociales y la situaciÃ³n econÃ³mica.  Objetivo:  evaluar el efecto del confinamiento en el Ã¡nimo depresivo en poblaciÃ³n residente en EspaÃ±a mayor de 18 aÃ±os durante el estado de alarma provocada por la pandemia de la COVID-19, analizando, ademÃ¡s, la posible incidencia de las variables sexo, edad, tamaÃ±o de la vivienda e ingresos econÃ³micos.  Material y MÃ©todos: diseÃ±o transversal, descriptivo y correlacional con metodologÃ­a de carÃ¡cter cuantitativo. El acceso a la muestra fue no probabilÃ­stico a travÃ©s de la tÃ©cnica bola de nieve. Para evaluar la condiciÃ³n de Ã¡nimo depresivo se utilizÃ³ la escala CES-D. Para recopilar los datos relacionados con el sexo, la edad, el tamaÃ±o de vivienda y la situaciÃ³n econÃ³mica, se crearon preguntas ad hoc en la propia encuesta.  Resultados: las mujeres presentan valores de Ã¡nimo depresivo superiores a los hombres. AdemÃ¡s, los valores de Ã¡nimo depresivo son mayores cuanto menor es la edad. Las personas que residen en viviendas con un tamaÃ±o menor, presentan valores de Ã¡nimo depresivo superiores respecto a las personas que viven en residencias con superficies mayores. A su vez, las personas con peores condiciones econÃ³micas perciben mayores niveles de Ã¡nimo depresivo.  Conclusiones: los resultados indican que los sintomas de Ã¡nimo depresivo y las consecuencias psicosociales en la poblaciÃ³n espaÃ±ola durante el confinamiento, se encuentran condicionadas por el sexo, la edad, el tamaÃ±o de la vivienda y la situaciÃ³n econÃ³mica.; ABSTRACT  Introduction: Health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global commotion, leading to a series of problems related to health, psychosocial factors and economic situation.  Objective:  To evaluate the effect of confinement on depressive mood in Spanish residents who are over 18 years old during the state of emergency which was declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this paper aims to analyze the possible impact of some variables such as sex, age, size of dwelling and income.  Materials and Methods:  Cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational design with quantitative methodology. Access to the sample was based on a non-probabilistic sampling through snowball technique. CES-D scale was used to evaluate the state of depressive mood. In order to collect data related to sex, age, size of dwelling and economic situation, ad hoc questions were included in the survey.  Results:  Women presented higher values of depressive mood than men. Furthermore, depressive mood values are higher in younger individuals. People who live in smaller dwellings showed higher values of depressive mood compared to those who live in larger dwellings. Similarly, individuals with less favorable economic conditions perceive higher levels of depressive mood.  Conclusions:  The results show that depressive mood symptoms and their psychosocial consequences in the Spanish population during confinement are conditioned by sex, age, dwelling size and economic situation.","GonzÃ¡lez Casas, David; Mercado GarcÃ­a, Esther; Corchado Castillo, Ana Isabel; De la Paz Elez, Pedro","http://scielo.sld.cu/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1729-519X2020000600017","","Country: CU; CUBA; CUBA; CUBA; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Rev. habanera cienc. mÃ©d;19(5): e3631, sept.-oct. 2020. tab; Publication details: Rev. habanera cienc. mÃ©d;19(5): e3631, sept.-oct. 2020. tab; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9530,""
"FOCUS ON HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DURING THE SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC - LITERATURE REVIEW; PROFISSIONAIS DE SAÃšDE EM FOCO DURANTE A PANDEMIA DE SARS-COV-2 - REVISÃƒO DE LITERATURA","Introduction: The epidemics claim changes in behavior and often completely change the lives of health professionals. In addition to instituting the need to evaluate old methods of disease prevention. This study aimed to analyze the aspects related to biosafety and the health conditions of health professionals in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: In this narrative review, articles were searched in various databases, organizations, and health entities using keywords compatible with MeSH, including COVID-19, Pandemia, Health professionals, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2, personal protective equipment (PPE), Biosafety. Results and Discussion: The review of articles and manuals published in this area revealed that health professionals are being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and effective prevention measures and the correct use of PPE are needed, in addition to health assessment and monitoring, including mental health, of these professionals. Conclusion: There is a lack of data on which PPE may have the best protective effect against SARS-CoV-2, as well as how to use, remove, disinfect, store and replace it. It is essential to offer support to health professionals, both the provision of PPE, as well as in training and maintenance of mental health to reduce the adverse effects that this pandemic can generate in this population.; IntroduÃ§Ã£o: As epidemias requerem mudanÃ§as de comportamento e muitas vezes mudam completamente a vida dos profissionais de saÃºde, alÃ©m de instituir a necessidade de avaliar mÃ©todos antigos de prevenÃ§Ã£o de doenÃ§as. O objetivo desta revisÃ£o foi analisar os aspectos relacionados a biosseguranÃ§a e as condiÃ§Ãµes de saÃºde dos profissionais de saÃºde no contexto da pandemia por SARS-CoV-2.

Na segunda parte do texto, algumas encruzilhadas da democracia e da saÃºde mental na atualidade sÃ£o explicitadas, a exemplo da propagaÃ§Ã£o de discursos antidemocrÃ¡ticos e do recrudescimento das fragilidades da Rede de AtenÃ§Ã£o Psicossocial.

To this end, it invites the reader, in the first part of the text, to revisit the amazement of the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic by means of a film, whose characters place on the scene distinct subjective positions that carry the power to challenge our place in the necropolitical scenarios of the Brazilian health crisis. In the second part of the text, some of the crossroads of democracy and mental health today are explained, following the example of the propagation of anti-democratic discourses and the recrudescence of the weaknesses of the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS). In the last section, we share an experience of Permanent Health Education in progress with workers of RAPS and Primary Health Care, and the attempt to reposition the goals for ethical-political action in the field of mental health against paralysis and anesthesia, enacted by the capitalist logic of the necroliberal state, which not infrequently engages the affections, bodies, and acts of health workers in daily practices.; Resumen Este artÃ­culo tiene como objetivo abordar la relaciÃ³n entre la democracia, la salud mental y la pandemia.

Reconhece aÃ­ as condiÃ§Ãµes para que estejamos enfrentando uma situaÃ§Ã£o traumÃ¡tica que remete aos recursos da psicanÃ¡lise para encaminhar uma forma de lidar com a situaÃ§Ã£o. Recorre em seguida Ã  conceituaÃ§Ã£o psicanalÃ­tica de luto e morte identificando-os como experiÃªncias coletivas, que deveriam sustentar o pacto social e dar condiÃ§Ãµes para a vida em sociedade, com suas expressÃµes singulares.

Then it recognizes the conditions for us to be facing a traumatic situation that refers to the resources of psychoanalysis to guide a way of dealing with the situation. It then resorts to the psychoanalytic concept of mourning and death, identifying them as collective experiences, which should support the social pact and provide conditions for life in society, with their individual expressions. It examines the attitudes towards death, over the last century, identifying indifference as one of the attitudes that attacks this pact. It goes on to establish the importance of mourning as reverence for death when it is not denied by society or when there is no attitude of indifference towards it. It concludes by returning to the subject's work once he or she faces the trauma arising from the encounter with the real of death. It is now for this subject to take responsibility for the necessary confrontations that will have occurred and have been imposed on him with the pandemic.; Resumen A partir de una breve contextualizaciÃ³n de la precariedad de los servicios de salud en el momento en que Covid-19 golpea el paÃ­s, el artÃ­culo sitÃºa las condiciones de desamparo en las que se encuentra el sujeto para enfrentar la pandemia.

"Perinatal depression in times of COVID-19: the role of social media on the Internet; DepresiÃ³n perinatal en tiempos del COVID-19: rol de las redes sociales en Internet","RESUMEN Las emergencias en salud pÃºblica como la pandemia del COVID-19 podrÃ­an llevar a situaciones de estrÃ©s extremo, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n en mujeres en etapa perinatal. La depresiÃ³n perinatal puede ocasionar a la madre, al reciÃ©n nacido y al entorno familiar mÃºltiples consecuencias negativas. Las redes sociales, bien utilizadas, pueden constituir una herramienta valiosa de apoyo para las mujeres en esta etapa de su vida. Este artÃ­culo describe el rol de las redes sociales en Internet como soporte de las gestantes y madres con depresiÃ³n, particularmente en emergencias de salud pÃºblica a nivel mundial como la pandemia del COVID-19. Las redes sociales pueden contribuir a la salud y al bienestar al facilitar la interacciÃ³n social, construir comunidades, normalizar el comportamiento de bÃºsqueda de ayuda, inspirar cambios saludables en el estilo de vida y ayudar a la investigaciÃ³n mÃ©dica. Es fundamental educar adecuadamente a las mujeres en etapa perinatal en alfabetizaciÃ³n digital en salud que incluya el uso eficiente de las redes en Internet como soporte socioemocional y la evaluaciÃ³n de la calidad de informaciÃ³n que se encuentra en las redes sociales y en Internet para una adecuada toma de decisiones.; ABSTRACT Public health emergencies such as COVID-19 pandemic could lead to situations of extreme stress, anxiety and depression in women in the perinatal period. Perinatal depression may lead to multiple negative consequences for mothers, newborns, and their relatives. Appropriate use of social media may be a valuable supporting tool for women during this stage of their lives. This paper describes the role of social media on the Internet for supporting pregnant women and mothers with depression, particularly in global public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media may contribute to support health and wellness by facilitating social interaction, building communities, normalizing help-seeking behavior, inspiring healthy lifestyle changes, and promoting medical research. It is essential to adequately educate women in the perinatal stage in digital health literacy including the efficient use of social media for socio-emotional support and assuring the quality of the information circulating in social media and in Internet for proper decision-making.","Bermejo-SÃ¡nchez, Fredy R; PeÃ±a-Ayudante, William R; Espinoza-Portilla, Elizabeth","http://www.scielo.org.pe/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1728-59172020000100088","","Country: PE; PERU; PERU; PERU; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Acta mÃ©d. peru;37(1): 88-93, ene.-mar. 2020. tab; Publication details: Acta mÃ©d. peru;37(1): 88-93, ene.-mar. 2020. tab; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9536,""
"COVID-19 information exposure in digital media and implications for employees in the health care sector: findings from an online survey; ExposiÃ§Ã£o Ã s informaÃ§Ãµes sobre COVID-19 em mÃ­dias digitais e suas implicaÃ§Ãµes para funcionÃ¡rios do setor de saÃºde: resultados de uma pesquisa on-line","ABSTRACT  Objective: To estimate coronavirus disease 2019-related information consumption and related implications for health care professionals (medical and nonmedical personnel) during the pandemic.  Methods: A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results: The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, ""sometimes"" corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding ""always"". Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic.  Conclusion: Our survey provides a description of how health professionals consume COVID-19 related information during the pandemic, and suggests that excessive information exposure and high processing demands may impose psychological distress and affect mental health.; RESUMO  Objetivo: Estimar o consumo de informaÃ§Ãµes relacionadas com doenÃ§a do novo coronavÃ­rus e seus efeitos em profissionais do setor da saÃºde durante a pandemia.

Based in two epistemologically different perspectives in psychology, results from objective measurement instruments are articulated with world experiences. It is argued that bodily practices are the means and the ends of health, both because of the predictable beneficial organic effects, according to the state of the art in the sciences of physical activity, and because of the possibility of engagement in the world through self-forgetfulness. Based on the resulting energy expenditure, anxiety control and well-being, adopting regular physical exercises in confinement periods provides the practitioner with a ritual and metabolic criteria to restore time and space parameters in a routine. However, such activities also present some risks depending on how they are carried out, which is a challenge both for those who experience them and for professionals in Sport Psychology, whether in the context of high performance or recreational activities. Understanding the nuances of sports practices and the particularities of these individuals is essential to address appropriate care. It should be noted that this field is not limited to notable sporting activities, but involves the most diverse body, cultural and movement practices.; Resumen Este artÃ­culo tiene como objetivo comprender la relaciÃ³n entre salud mental y deporte, ejercicio y/o actividad fÃ­sica en el perÃ­odo afectado por la pandemia de covid-19, especialmente en Brasil.

"Anxiety levels during a second local COVID-19 pandemic breakout among quarantined people: A cross sectional survey in China","Only a few studies investigated the impact of quarantine on anxiety of general population during a second wave of COVID-19 breakout. We aimed to compare anxiety levels of quarantined and non-quarantined people and investigate factors affecting anxiety during the second COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1837 participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were divided into the quarantined group (QG) and non-quarantined group (Non-QG). The mean STAI-S score in the QG was significantly higher than Non-QG (41.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 11.2 vs 40.01Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 9.9), so was the proportion of severe state anxiety (11.6% vs 5.5%). Males in the QG were significantly more anxious than females evaluated by both STAI-S and STAI-T. High income was independent protective factors while moderate or bad health status and high trait anxiety level were independent risk factors for severe state anxiety. In conclusion, the COVID-19 confinement could significantly increase anxiety of quarantined people. Males were more vulnerable to the quarantine of COVID-19 with significantly increased anxiety level than females. The results suggest that attention should be paid to anxiety during a second round of quarantine due to COVID-19 and are of help in planning psychological interventions.","Chen, Zhao, Razin, Song, Wu, Ma, HuerxidaAji, Wang, Wang, Yan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.067","20210114","Anxiety; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; Mental health; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9541,""
"Pandemic-related attitudes, stressors and work outcomes among medical assistants during the SARS-CoV-2 (&quot;Coronavirus&quot;) pandemic in Germany: A cross-sectional Study","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe since December 2019 creating much uncertainty among medical staff. Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one's financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one's financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08-1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22-1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01-1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55-2.39]). Feeling burdened by thoughts about virus contraction at work was also significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.33 [1.07-1.64]), caring for children (1.33 [1.07-1.66]), depression (1.54 [1.18-2.00]), and anxiety (4.71 [3.71-5.98]). This study provides novel evidence regarding major SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related stressors among medical assistants and suggests need for special support for medical assistants caring for children and working in specialist practices.","Dreher, Pietrowsky, Loerbroks","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245473","20210114","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9542,""

"Predictors of self-perceived health worsening over COVID-19 emergency in ALS","Factors influencing self-perceived health status over Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency in vulnerable populations, such as patients with chronic neurological diseases, are still unknown. In this work, we aimed at testing whether clinical care changes imposed by the quarantine, together with certain demographic and disease-specific features, might have determined a self-perceived worsening of health status in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A brief web-based questionnaire investigating self-perceived anxiety, depression, and motor worsening, as well as clinical care changes over COVID-19 emergency, was administered to ALS patients currently followed at San Martino Hospital. Ordinal and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify significant predictors of health status. Fifty-seven ALS patients completed the questionnaire. A total of 35.08% of cases reported anxiety symptoms, 36.84% depressive symptoms, and 35.08% reported worsening of motor symptoms. Significant predictors of anxiety symptoms severity included female gender, greater motor impairment, more aggressive disease course, and rehabilitation therapy suspension. The only significant predictor of depressive symptoms severity was a more aggressive disease course. Significant predictors of motor worsening were shorter disease duration and exams/visits cancelation. COVID-19 emergency and its management exerted a significant impact on self-perceived health status in patients with ALS, particularly in those cases in the earliest disease phases and with a more aggressive disease course. These findings have potential to improve personalized medicine strategies in the next phase.","Cabona, Ferraro, Meo, Roccatagliata, Schenone, Inglese, Villani, Caponnetto","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04997-z","20210114","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Anxiety; Corona virus disease 2019; Depression; Motor worsening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9544,""

"The impact of lockdown during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia","During Covid-19 pandemic, the Italian government adopted restrictive limitations and declared a national lockdown on March 9, which lasted until May 4 and produced dramatic consequences on people's lives. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of prolonged lockdown on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Between April 30 and June 8, 2020, we interviewed with a telephone-based questionnaire the caregivers of the community-dwelling patients with dementia who had their follow-up visit scheduled from March 9 to May 15 and canceled due to lockdown. Among the information collected, patients' BPSDs were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Non-parametric tests to compare differences between NPI scores over time and logistic regression models to explore the impact of different factors on BPSD worsening were performed. A total of 109 visits were canceled and 94/109 caregivers completed the interview. Apathy, irritability, agitation and aggression, and depression were the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by patients both at baseline and during Covid-19 pandemic. Changes in total NPI and caregiver distress scores between baseline and during lockdown, although statistically significant, were overall modest. The logistic regression model failed to determine predictors of BPSD worsening during lockdown. This is one of the first studies to investigate the presence of BPSD during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and related nationwide lockdown, showing only slight, likely not clinically relevant, differences in BPSD burden, concerning mostly agitation and aggression, anxiety, apathy and indifference, and irritability.","Manini, Brambilla, Maggiore, Pomati, Pantoni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-05035-8","20210114","BPSD; Covid-19; Dementia; Isolation; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9547,""
"Anxiety and Resilience of Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia","The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the physical health and mental health of the community, including healthcare workers. Several studies have shown symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in healthcare workers during this pandemic. However, not many studies have examined the resilience of healthcare workers during this pandemic. Resilience is a person's ability to rise and adapt when times are difficult and is considered to have a protective effect on mental problems. This study aims to determine the correlation between resilience and anxiety in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. This research was a cross-sectional study with observational analytic methods. The respondents were healthcare workers at Dr. Soetomo Hospital as the COVID-19 referral hospital in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. Data were collected from 10 to 16 June 2020 by distributing online questionnaires through the Google form application. There were three questionnaires used: demographic data, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CR-RISC) questionnaire. The 227 respondents had filled out the questionnaire online with 33% had high state anxiety and 26.9% had high trait anxiety. The mean score of the respondents' resilience was 69 Ã‚Â± 15.823. The Spearman correlation test showed a significant relationship between anxiety and resilience (p &lt;0.05), both S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety. A significant correlation was found between the level of resilience and anxiety experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lower the resilience, the higher the anxiety experienced.","Setiawati, Wahyuhadi, Joestandari, Maramis, Atika","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S276655","20210114","mental health; mental illness; state anxiety; trait anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9548,""
"Cutting Edge: Mouse SARS-CoV-2 Epitope Reveals Infection and Vaccine-Elicited CD8 T Cell Responses","The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses correlates inversely with human disease severity, suggesting T cell involvement in primary control. Whereas many COVID-19 vaccines focus on establishing humoral immunity to viral spike protein, vaccine-elicited T cell immunity may bolster durable protection or cross-reactivity with viral variants. To better enable mechanistic and vaccination studies in mice, we identified a dominant CD8 T cell SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein epitope. Infection of human ACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 elicited robust responses to H2-D<sup>b</sup>/N<sub>219-227</sub>, and 40% of HLA-A*02<sup>+</sup> COVID-19 PBMC samples isolated from hospitalized patients responded to this peptide in culture. In mice, i.m. prime-boost nucleoprotein vaccination with heterologous vectors favored systemic CD8 T cell responses, whereas intranasal boosting favored respiratory immunity. In contrast, a single i.v. immunization with recombinant adenovirus established robust CD8 T cell memory both systemically and in the respiratory mucosa.","Joag, Wijeyesinghe, Stolley, Quarnstrom, Dileepan, Soerens, Sangala, O'Flanagan, Gavil, Hong, Bhela, Gangadhara, Weyu, Matchett, Thiede, Krishna, Cheeran, Bold, Amara, Southern, Hart, Schifanella, Vezys, Jenkins, Langlois, Masopust","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001400","20210114","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9549,""

"COVID-19 Pandemic: Influence of Relationship Status on Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Canada","To examine the impact of relationship status on levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify the relationship groups who are at greater risk, thereby facilitating channelling of appropriate support to these individuals. The sample was drawn from individuals who subscribed to the Text4Hope program, a cognitive behavioural therapy inspired text messaging service developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey link was sent to the subscribers to ascertain their relationship status and assess psychopathology using the Perceived Stress Scale-10(PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data analysis was carried out using SPSS-26 for descriptive statistics. Within the first six weeks of the pandemic, 8,267 of 44,992 subscribers responded to the online survey giving a response rate of 19.4%. Mean scores on the PSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 were highest among those who were single and lowest amongst those who were widowed. Overall, mean scores on the PHQ-9 were higher in groups self-identified as separated or divorced in comparison to those with partners including the categories of married or cohabiting. Relationship status during the COVID-19 pandemic has an influence on the mental health of individuals.

"PTSD in the COVID-19 Era","In December 2019, Wuhan City in Hubei Province, China witnessed an outbreak of a novel type of coronavirus (COVID-19), named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The sharp rise in the number of infected cases and the surge spike in fatalities worldwide prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare this rapid outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. The economic, health, and social ramifications of COVID-19 induced fear and anxiety all over the world. The purpose of this review is to discuss how precautionary measures and restrictions imposed by governments, such as quarantines, lockdowns, and social distancing, have not only caused economic losses, but also a rise in mental health problems specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A deep comprehensive analysis review in of the relevant literature regarding the pandemic and its debilitating consequences on the psychological status of the public were was discussed performed. This review illustrates that the COVID-19 pandemic had a traumatic impact on the psychological functioning of the public, particularly COVID-19 survivors, older adults, and healthcare workers, in particularly, due to the difficulties in coping with new realities and uncertainties. In this review, we have discussed the psychological implications of this pandemic and we have provided an extensive background for understanding options regarding PTSD management in healthy individuals and those with preexisting conditions.","Chamaa, Bahmad, Darwish, Kobeissi, Hoballah, Nassif, Ghandour, Saliba, Lawand, Abou-Kheir","https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159X19666210113152954","20210114","COVID-19; PTSD; stigma; SARS-CoV-2; health care workers.; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9552,""
"Strategic vision for improving human health at The Forefront of Genomics","Starting with the launch of the Human Genome Project three decades ago, and continuing after its completion in 2003, genomics has progressively come to have a central and catalytic role in basic and translational research. In addition, studies increasingly demonstrate how genomic information can be effectively used in clinical care. In the future, the anticipated advances in technology development, biological insights, and clinical applications (among others) will lead to more widespread integration of genomics into almost all areas of biomedical research, the adoption of genomics into mainstream medical and public-health practices, and an increasing relevance of genomics for everyday life. On behalf of the research community, the National Human Genome Research Institute recently completed a multi-year process of strategic engagement to identify future research priorities and opportunities in human genomics, with an emphasis on health applications.

"Sexual minority orientation is associated with greater psychological impact due to the COVID-19 crisisâ€”evidence from a longitudinal cohort study of young Swiss men","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic and its countermeasures may have had a significant impact on the psychological well-being of specific population subgroups. The present study investigated whether sexual minority men from an ongoing cohort study of young Swiss men experienced different psychological impacts, levels of substance use and addictive behaviours. Methods An ongoing cohort sample based on the general population of young Swiss men (mean age=29.07 years; SD=1.27) was assessed before and during the COVID-19 crisis for depression, stress, sleep quality, substance use and addictive behaviours. Additionally, during the crisis, we assessed its impact in form of fear, isolation and traumatic experiences. Potential associations between these outcomes and sexual orientation (sexual minority vs heterosexual) were tested using linear regression models. Results Compared to heterosexual men, sexual minority men showed higher levels of psychological trauma (b=0.37 [0.25, 0.49]), fear (b=0.18 [0.06, 0.30]) and isolation (b=0.32 [0.20, 0.44]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher levels of depression (b=0.31 [0.20, 0.41]) and lower sleep quality (b=-0.13 [-0.24, -0.02]) during the crisis. These differences were to a large degree explained by higher pre-crisis levels of mental health problems and the personality dimension of neuroticism-anxiety. Sexual minority men showed higher overall levels of substance use and addictive behaviours, but these differences were already present before the crisis. Conclusion The COVID-19 crisis may have worsened pre-existing vulnerabilities in sexual minority men, leading to its greater psychological impact on them than on heterosexual men. Services offering psychological support to sexual minorities may need to be reinforced during crises.","Simon Marmet et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-5E6-4CE","20210115","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9555,""
"Digital Parent Training RCT Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review","Telehealth interventions have the opportunity to scale evidenced-based therapeutics and increase service access to historically hard to reach populations, including rural, and minority groups. Behavior management parenting interventions are a best-practice intervention to treat a range of disruptive behavior disorders and family dysfunction concerns, which have traditionally occurred in person, but recently been trialed online due to growing demand and a need for remote delivery during COVID-19. There is limited and mixed information to date regarding evidence for online services and minimal research on client and therapeutic factors associated with better outcomes, which is critical for advancing efficacy in the rapidly-growing approach to treating child mental illness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (k = 24, total number of intervention participants = 1469 and control participants = 800) of the impact of digital parent training interventions on parent skill, parent mental health, and child externalizing mental health outcomes from 2000 to 2020, among children 2-12 years old, across four databases. Exclusionary criteria include programs targeted for parents of children with intellectual disabilities, autism, brain injury, nutrition/health/dental needs or primary medical diagnosis. Across outcomes, there was a modest effect size of digital parent training interventions (g =.22-.30), compared to controls using random effect two-level and multi-level models. Study heterogeneity varied across outcomes (IÂ² = 18.6% to 66.3%). Results of publication bias were mixed across tests, but they were suggestive of a slight inflation of the effects sizes across outcomes. We tested several moderators related to child demographics, family socioeconomic status, intervention design, and risk of bias. We found the effects of digital parent training on parent skills and child outcomes were stronger if the intervention used was evidence-based, combined hybrid interactive platforms with a therapist and was compared to an inactive control. Given the limitations from the existing literature assess moderating effects regarding population characteristics (i.e. SES, parent mental health), we call on future studies to provide standardized demographics to aide future knowledge synthesis work and provide templates for shared measurement.

"Deliberate Self-Harm in Adolescents During COVID-19: The Roles of Pandemic-Related Stress, Emotion Regulation Difficulties, and Social Distancing","Objectives: We used data from a large sample of Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic to conduct an ecologically valid test of etiological models of deliberate self-harm (DSH). Specifically, the study objectives were to: (1) investigate the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH, (2) test whether dimensions of emotion regulation (ER) difficulties mediated and moderated this association, including whether these effects differed by age, and (3) examine whether the mediating and moderating effects of ER difficulties were stronger for youth who engaged in more social distancing. Methods: 809 Canadian adolescents aged 12 to 18 were recruited via social media websites and completed online surveys from June 17 to July 31, 2020. Results: COVID-19-related stress was positively associated with recent DSH. Lack of emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotional responses, and limited access to ER strategies mediated the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH. The magnitude of these indirect effects did not differ by age. Although COVID-19-related stress and ER difficulties did not interact to predict DSH, there was a significant three-way interaction between lack of emotional awareness, COVID-19-related stress, and age. Finally, the indirect effect of COVID-19-related stress on DSH through limited access to ER strategies was stronger for youth who engaged in more social distancing. Conclusions: Overall, these findings align with etiological models that propose central roles for stress and ER difficulties in the development of DSH. Findings also underscore a need to support adolescents, particularly those with reduced in-person social contact, in adaptively coping with stress generated by pandemics.","Christina Robillard et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-8E6-4A6","20210115","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; social distancing; covid-19; emotion dysregulation; deliberate self-harm; physical distancing; youth; pandemic; emotion regulation difficulties; adolescents; self-injury","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-15","",9557,""
