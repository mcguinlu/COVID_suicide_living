"Assessment of Post SARS CoV 2 Fatigue among Physicians Working in COVID Designated Hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh","Background: Fatigue has been observed after a number of infectious disease outbreaks around the world. After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 2019, the disease turned into a pandemic very rapidly. Mental health is a key issue associated with such outbreaks. To explore the fatigue level among physicians working in designated public and private hospitals in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study of post-SARS-CoV-2 fatigue. Method: In this study 105 physicians who were diagnosed as COVID-19 infected, got treatment, and declared cured at least 6 weeks before the interview date, were recruited as cases and the same number of age and designation matched healthy physicians as control who are working in the same hospital. Case and control were selected in 1:1 ratio from each of the hospitals. The study population was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent. Data collection was done by a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnosis of COVID--19 infection was done by detection of SARS CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR from reference laboratories in Bangladesh or by HRCT Chest. Result: Around two-thirds of the physicians were male (67.6% versus 32.4%). Most of them aged less than forty years (80.5%). The cases had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those who were negative. The FSS score (mean) was much higher for cases (36.7 with standard deviation of 5.3 versus 19.3 standard deviation of 3.8) than the control group with a statistically significant difference with no significant gender differentiation. Similarly, around 67.7% of the previously COVID positive physicians represented in the highest FSS score tertile compared to the respondents in the control group had a mean score of less than 3. The difference was also highly significant. Conclusion: Physicians, who had a previous history of COVID-19 infection had a higher total and mean FSS score, signifying a more severe level of fatigue than the physicians who had never been COVID-19 positive while working in the same hospital irrespective of their age and sex.","A T M Hasibul Hasan; Muhammad Sougatul Islam; Nushrat Khan; Nazmul Hoque Munna; Wahidur Rahman Choton; Mostofa Kamal Arefin; Mohammad Abdullah Az Zubayer Khan; Mohaimen Mansur; Rashedul Hassan; Numera Siddiqui; Muhammad Shamsul Arefin; Nayema Afroje; Md.

"Impact of school closures on the health and well-being of primary school children in Wales UK; a routine data linkage study using the HAPPEN survey (2018-2020)","IntroductionIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, school closures were implemented across the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the impact of school closures on childrens health by comparing health and wellbeing outcomes collected during school closures (April - June 2020) with data from the same period in 2019 and 2018.

MethodsData were collected online via the  HAPPEN At Home survey, which captured the typical health behaviours of children aged 8 - 11 years between April - June 2020. These data were compared with data in 2018 and 2019 also collected between April-June, from HAPPEN. Free school meal (FSM) status was used as a proxy for socio-economic deprivation. Analyses were repeated stratifying by FSM.

ResultsComparing responses between April - June in 2020 (n=1068), 2019 (n=1150) and 2018 (n=475), there were improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM ate less fruit and vegetables (21% (95%CI (5.7% to 37%)) and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity (13.03% (95%CI: 3.3% to 21.7%) and consumed more takeaways (16.3% (95%CI: 2%-30%)) during school closures.

ConclusionThis study suggests that schools play an important role in reducing inequalities in physical health. The physical health (e.g. physical activity and diet) of children eligible for FSM may be impacted by prolonged school closures.

What is already known on this subject?In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by mid-March 2020, 138 countries had implemented national school closures to reduce the number of social contacts between pupils, therefore interrupting the transmission of COVID-19 as part of pandemic plans. UNESCO warned that the global scale and speed of the educational disruption would be unparalleled. There is an ongoing debate with regard to the effectiveness of schools closures on transmission rates, but the fact schools are closed for a long period of time could have detrimental impacts on pupils physical and mental health.

This study provides evidence of any differences in the health and wellbeing of children prior to and during the COVID-19 enforced lockdown and school closures between March and June 2020. These findings could have a significant impact for the future and support schools to better understand their pupils physical, psychological, emotional and social health. It also contributes to a significant literature gap regarding the impact of school closures on school-aged children.

What this study adds?Improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing were observed in general for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM reported eating less fruit and vegetables and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity and consumed more takeaways during school closures. These trends are not evident among children not on FSM. All children reported improvements in wellbeing during lockdown especially on the happiness with family measure.

Overall, findings suggest schools help to reduce inequalities in physical health for socio-economically deprived children. During school closures children from deprived backgrounds are likely to have poorer physical health (e.g. less time spent doing physical activities and poorer diet) and this is not observed in children who are not in receipt of FSM. This research suggests that school closures will result in widening health inequalities and when schools return measures will need to be in place to readdress the widened gap in physical health.","Michaela James; Emily Marchant; Margaret A Defeyter; Jayne V Woodside; Sinead Brophy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155","20210208","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10522,""

"Semantic regulation of anxiety expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic: Conspiracy trends","Introduction  The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with the spread of conspiracy theories, which are heterogeneous in terms of the structure of their views  The hypothesis is that the substrate for the spread of conspiracy trend is an increased level of anxiety, reduced due to the paralogical (conspiracy) interpretation of events  The purpose of this research was to study the prevalence of conspiracy trends during the preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic in Moscow (before the introduction of strict restrictive measures)  Methods: 320 people, randomly selected from the general population, were asked if they agree or disagree with 9 statements regarding the conspiracy interpretation of events, compared with the level of anxiety/depression (using the HADS scale)  There are 3 trends (COVID-conspiracy, COVID-skepticism, COVID-obscurantism)  Results: 45 7% of respondents were ready to agree with one or the other conspiracy idea  I The level of anxiety in all adherents of conspiracy theory was found to be higher than in the rest of the sample  Differences in sociodemographic characteristics of adherents of different conspiracy tendencies are revealed  Among COVID skeptics, there are significantly fewer students and pensioners, and among COVID conspiracy theorists, the level of education received is lower, with unstable labor and family status  Discussion  Conspiracy trends were universal for all social groups in the background of increased anxiety among the population of Moscow in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic  It is suggested that the mechanism for the development of conspiracy tendencies may be the process of rationalization of an increased level of anxiety as a protective response during a crisis  Â© 2020 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina  All rights reserved","Zakharova, N.

"How anxious did you feel during lockdown? The roles resilience, living environment, and gender play on the level of anxiety state during pandemic isolation","In the unique context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, researchers and clinicians alike drew attention to the risks involved by physical and social isolation for mental health  Factors like resilience, gender, urban/rural environment, or preexisting anxiety can impact anxious states produced by home forced isolation  Based on these, we assumed that: i) there are significant differences in the level of anxiety (state) during the pandemic, depending on the living area of the subjects;ii) gender plays a moderating role in the relationship between resilience and anxiety;and iii) anxiety (trait), experiential avoidance, resilience, and family connectedness, determine the level of anxiety (state)  The MemoryLab team conducted the present study on 495 subjects (n=411 women, age between 18 and 65)  Of these, 350 live in large and medium urban areas, 63 in small urban areas, and 82 in rural areas  As instruments, we used The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 2 0), The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire 2 (AAQ-2), The Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), The Family Connectedness Questionnaire, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-10), as well as the standard division of living areas according to community size  Data collection took place online during the spring peak of the pandemic  According to ANOVA analysis, people living in small urban areas have a higher level of anxiety  The difference is significant compared to those living in large and medium cities and villages  Gender has no moderating role in the relationship between resilience and the anxiety state  Also, experiential avoidance, anxiety (trait), and resilience play a significant role on the level of anxiety (state), measured during social isolation  The results could be an important indicator for understanding psychological mechanisms guiding interventions to support the communities effectively  cial use only  Â© the Author(s), 2020","Rotarescu, V.

Older adults are specifically vulnerable with regard to severe courses of the disease and have been particularly encouraged to self-isolate during the pandemic. Subsequently, expressions of concern have been raised regarding the negative impact of disease risk and quarantine on the mental health of older people. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study follows aÂ qualitative research design. Between May and June 2020 NÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯= 11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully transcribed. AÂ qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting points for older people. CONCLUSION: Older adults appear to be able to preserve their mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relevance of mental resources of older adults for supporting younger generations seems to be unrecognized.","Welzel, Franziska D; Schladitz, Katja; FÃ¶rster, Franziska; LÃ¶bner, Margrit; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03281-5","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Feb 02.; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Feb 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10548,""

"Reducing post-traumatic stress disorder after ICU discharge with the IPREA3 program for discomfort reduction in the ICU: A stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled study, the PTSD-REA study","Introduction: Critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are exposed to stressful conditions and experience discomfort from multiple sources, such as the environment or related to care provided in the ICU, depending on the care organizations and patient health status  This discomfort may have short-term and long-term consequences for ICU survivors, such as various degrees of anxiety and/or depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (1) which may affect patient's quality of life  Reducing discomfort in the ICU has therefore become a major issue  IT has already been demonstrated that the implementation of a tailored multicomponent program for discomfort prevention in adult ICUs (named the IPREA3 program): 1) may decrease the selfperceived discomfort in general adult ICU survivors of at the end of their ICU stay, according the results of the IPREA3 study, a cluster-randomized controlled study (2);2) may reduce substantial PTSD symptoms assessed 1 year after ICU discharge, according the results of the AQVAR study, a prospective cohort study inluding patients who were exposed and unexposed to the IPREA3 program (3)  These promising results justify the need for a confirmatory study using a randomized design, the PTSD-REA study  Methods: The PTSD-REA study is a stepped wedge cluster-randomized interventional study involving 18 French ICUs  The cluster level comprises the ICUs, which are the units of randomization  Patients hospitalized in the ICUs comprise the individual level  The intervention is the implementation of the IPREA3 program, a tailored multicomponent program consisting of assessment of ICUrelated self-perceived discomforts, immediate and monthly feedback to the healthcare team, and site-specific tailored interventions  The whole duration of the inclusion period will be 15 months and patients will be followed-up 1 year after ICU discharge  During the first month of the inclusion period, no ICU is exposed to the IPREA3 program  Every following month, 2 new ICUS of the 18 participating ICUs are randomized to the application of IPREA3 until the end of the inclusion period, leading to 9 steps  We considered 3 periods, a control period, an unvariable 5-month learning period for each ICU, and an interventional period during which the IPREA3 program will be applied during more than 5 months until the end of the inclusion period  Patients will be included only during the control period and the interventional period  For each participating ICU, the durations of the control period and the interventional period range from 1 to 9 months, according the randomization date for crossing over to the IPREA3 program  The eligible patients are patients who survived an ICU stay of at least 3 calendar days with an affiliation to a social security scheme  The exclusion criteria include death prior to the 1-year follow-up after the index ICU hospitalization, patients under trusteeship, patients with cognitive incapacity, and patients who did not understand French sufficiently to complete the questionnaires exploring psychiatric morbidity  All participants provided written informed consent  We planned to include 4500 patients during the study, 2250 patients in each group  The primary outcome measure is the presence of substantial PTSD symptoms at one year after ICU discharge assessed from the posttraumatic stress-disorder checklist (PCL-5) which is a 20-item selfreport measure for PTSD symptoms according the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)  The secondary outcomes are the following : the ICU stay's duration, the number of days with mechanical ventilation, the overall score of discomfort assessed from the IPREA3 questionnaire, the duration of hospital stay after ICU discharge  The other secondary outcomes will be asseseed at 1 year after ICU discharge: the number of symptoms in categories A,B,C, D and E, respectively, assessed from the PCL-5, the scores of the sub-scales A and D, respectively, of the questionnaire HAD-S (Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale), the score obtained from he World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), the number of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and consulations with a psychologist or psychiatrist during the past year since ICU discharge, return to own home, and occupational status  Results: The inclusion period started on November 1, 2020, but was interrupted on March 19, 2020 due to the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the functionning of French ICUs, when 1252 patients had already been included  It is planned to resume the inclusions in the ICUs on September 1, 2020  The provisional date for ending the inclusions without further interruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic is now July 31, 2021  Conclusion: Despite the interruption of the PTSD-REA study due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more than a thousand patients in the control group could be already included  The results of the PTSD-REA study are eagerly expected to confirm that applying the IPREA3 program during the ICU stay may reduce substantial PTSD symptoms at 1 year

Cancer survivors (hereafter referred to as ""survivors"") are particularly prone to behavioral changes and are encouraged to be more vigilant and observe stricter social distancing measures. OBJECTIVE: We explored (1) changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors since the onset of COVID-19, along with changes in mental health status, and (2) alternative strategies to support survivors' physical activity and social health during and after COVID-19, along with the role of digital health in such strategies. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed among survivors participating (currently or previously) in the community-based physical activity program LIVESTRONG at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), from 3 sites outside an urban area in Massachusetts. Questions addressed pre-COVID-19 vs current changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and scores &#8805;3 indicated a clinical diagnosis of anxiety or depression, respectively. Digital health preferences were assessed through closed-ended questions. Open-ended responses addressing other preferences for physical activity programs and social support were analyzed, coded, and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Among 61 participants (mean age 62 [SD 10.4] years; females: 51/61 [83.6%]), 67.2% (n=41) reported decreased physical activity and 67.2% (n=41) reported prolonged sitting times since the onset of COVID-19. Further, 24.6% (n=15) and 26.2% (n=16) met the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 criteria for clinical anxiety and depression, respectively. All participants owned a cellphone; 90% (n=54) owned a smartphone. Preferences for physical activity programs (n=28) included three themes: (1) use of digital or remote platforms (Zoom, other online platforms, and video platforms), (2) specific activities and locations (eg, outdoor activities, walking, gardening, biking, and physical activities at the YMCA and at senior centers), and (3) importance of social support regardless of activity type (eg, time spent with family, friends, peers, or coaches). The survey revealed a mean score of 71.8 (SD 21.4; scale 0-100) for the importance of social support during physical activity programs. Social support preferences (n=15) revealed three themes: (1) support through remote platforms (eg, texting, Zoom, phone calls, emails, and Facebook), (2) tangible in-person support (YMCA and senior centers), and (3) social support with no specific platform (eg, small gatherings and family or friend visits). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity and mental health are critical factors for the quality of life of survivors, and interventions tailored to their activity preferences are necessary. Digital or remote physical activity programs with added social support may help address the ongoing needs of survivors during and after the pandemic.","Faro, Jamie M; Mattocks, Kristin M; Nagawa, Catherine S; Lemon, Stephenie C; Wang, Bo; Cutrona, Sarah L; Sadasivam, Rajani S","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25317","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Cancer;7(1): e25317, 2021 Feb 03.; Publication details: JMIR Cancer;7(1): e25317, 2021 Feb 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10584,""
"Assessing anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among Ebola survivors in Africa: A meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: During health disaster events such as the current devastating havoc being inflicted on countries globally by the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic, mental health problems among survivors and frontline workers are likely concerns. However, during such health disaster events, stakeholders tend to give more precedence to the socio-economic and biomedical health consequences at the expense of mental health. Meanwhile, studies show that regardless of the kind of disaster/antecedent, all traumatic events trigger similar post-traumatic stress symptoms among survivors, families, and frontline workers. Thus, our study investigated the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among survivors of the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease that plagued the West African sub-region. METHODS: We systematically retrieved peer-reviewed articles published between 1970 and 2019 from seven electronic databases, including Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Springer Link, Web of Science on Ebola and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. A comprehensive hand search complemented this literature search. Of the 87 articles retrieved, only 13 met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. RESULTS: After heterogeneity, influence, and publication bias analysis, our meta-analysis pooled proportion effects estimates showed a moderate to a high prevalence of anxiety (14%; 99% CI: 0.05-0.30), depression (15%; 99% CI: 0.11-0.21), and insomnia (22%; 99% CI: 0.13-0.36). Effect estimates ranging from (0.13; 99% CI: 0.05, 0.28) through to (0.11; 99% CI: 0.05-0.22), (0.15; 99% CI: 0.09-0.25) through to (0.13; 99% CI: 0.08-0.21) and (0.23; 99% CI: 0.11-0.41) to (0.23; 99% CI: 0.11-0.41) were respectively reported for anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. These findings suggest a significant amount of EVD survivors are struggling with anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our study provided the first-ever meta-analysis evidence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms among EVD survivors, and suggest that the predominant biomedical health response to regional and global health disasters should be complemented with trauma-related mental health services.","Acharibasam, Jeremiah W; Chireh, Batholomew; Menegesha, Hayelom G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246515","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(2): e0246515, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(2): e0246515, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10585,""
"Pain Symptoms in COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and severe organ damage. When evaluated specifically for pain, the data so far have shown that myalgia, headache, and chest pain can be seen in patients at varying rates; myalgia and headache, especially, are among the initial symptoms. DESIGN: This retrospective chart review followed by a descriptive survey design study was carried out by examining patients afflicted with COVID-19. After discharge, patients were asked about the severity and the body region of their pain, their use of analgesics, their mood and mental health, and their overall quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients with a mean age of 56.24 Â± 16.99 were included in the study. Pain during COVID-19 was found to be higher compared to the pre- and postinfectious states. The most frequent painful areas were reported to be the neck and back before the infection, whereas the head and extremities during the infection. The most frequently used analgesic during infection was paracetamol. There was no relationship between the patients' pain and anxiety and depression; the quality of life was found to be worse in patients with persistent pain. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the head and extremities were the most common painful body regions during COVID-19. It was also found that pain can continue in the post-infection period.","ErÃ§alik, TÃ¼lay; Ayyildiz, Aylin; Gencer-Atalay, Kardelen; AkgÃ¼n, Cem; Ã–zdemir, Haci Mustafa; Kuran, Banu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000001699","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Phys Med Rehabil;2021 Feb 01.; Publication details: Am J Phys Med Rehabil;2021 Feb 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10586,""

"Interleukin 6 and depression in patients affected by Covid-19; RelaciÃ³n entre los niveles de interleucina 6 y depresiÃ³n en pacientes afectados por Covid-19","INTRODUCTION: Rise of central cytokines resulting from infections produces neuronal changes. Covid-19 allows the study of depressive symptoms in sustained stress and its relationship with molecular mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To assess correlation between IL-6, IL-1ÃŸ and TNF-&#945; and depressive symptoms. Characterize the depressive symptoms present. METHODS: Observational study. Patients admitted for Covid-19 older than 60 years with a interleukin determination were included. The Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used, associating each item with a neurotransmitter. RESULTS: 27 patients included. We did not find correlation between IL-6 levels and the GDS scale score (rho=0.204; 95% CI -0.192 to 0.543); with IL-1ÃŸ levels (rho=-0.126; 95% CI -0.490 to 0.276); nor of TNF-&#945; (rho=-0.033; 95% CI -0.416 to 0.360). 3 patients (11.1%) presented score compatible with depressive disorder.

"Depressive Symptoms in Swiss University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Correlates","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 containment measures and the uncertainties associated with the pandemic may have contributed to changes in mental health risks and mental health problems in university students. Due to the high burden of the disease, depression is of particular concern. However, knowledge about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Swiss university students during the pandemic is limited. We therefore assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their change during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Swiss university students. METHODS: We assessed depressive symptoms in two cross-sectional cohorts of university students (n = 3571) in spring and autumn 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared them with a matched sample of the Swiss national population (n = 2328). Binary logistic regression models estimated prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (30.8% (95% CI: 28.6-33.0)) and male students (24.8% (95% CI: 21.7-28.1)) was substantially higher than in the matching female (10.9% (95% CI: 8.9-13.2)) and male (8.5% (6.6-11.0)) pre-pandemic national population. Depressive symptoms in the two consecutive student cohorts did not significantly differ. CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of Swiss university students reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was substantially higher as compared to the matched general population. Universities should introduce measures to support students in such times of crisis and gain an understanding of the factors impacting mental health positively or negatively and related to university structures and procedures.","Volken, Thomas; Zysset, Annina; Amendola, Simone; Klein Swormink, Anthony; Huber, Marion; von Wyl, Agnes; Dratva, Julia","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041458","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(4)2021 Feb 04.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(4)2021 Feb 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10589,""
"[Sleep disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic]","Respiratory complications from COVID-19 can lead to death. For this reason, public health measures to curb the spread of the disease such as quarantine and other confinement strategies have been proposed in several countries, resulting in mental health and sleep disorders. We carried out a narrative review to systematize the most significant findings regarding insomnia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and in healthy persons who have been under confinement as a preventive measure. COVID-19-related conditions have caused insomnia in patients, which can alter the immune system and have a negative effect on health. For healthy people in quarantine, lifestyle changes, fear of becoming infected, young age, female gender, history of mental illness and reduced ability to cope with stress appear to be risk factors for insomnia. As well as the implementation of epidemiological and preventive measures, sleep hygiene should be promoted as a comprehensive coping strategy against the COVID-19 pandemic. Las complicaciones respiratorias por la COVID-19 pueden llevar a la muerte, por lo que, dentro de las polÃƒÂ­ticas de protecciÃƒÂ³n para evitar los contagios masivos, se han sugerido estrategias de cuarentena y confinamiento en muchos paÃƒÂ­ses, que han originado alteraciones en la salud mental y el sueÃƒÂ±o.

Las condiciones propias de la enfermedad han hecho que los pacientes desarrollen insomnio, lo que puede empeorar su estado de salud y alterar su sistema inmunolÃƒÂ³gico. Para las personas sanas en cuarentena los cambios en el estilo de vida, el miedo a contraer la enfermedad, la edad joven, el sexo femenino, los antecedentes de enfermedades mentales y una menor capacidad de afrontamiento al estrÃƒÂ©s parecen ser factores de riesgo para el insomnio. Al igual que la implementaciÃƒÂ³n de medidas epidemiolÃƒÂ³gicas de cuidado y prevenciÃƒÂ³n contra el COVID-19, se debe tener en consideraciÃƒÂ³n promover la higiene del sueÃƒÂ±o como una estrategia de afrontamiento integral contra esta pandemia.","Medina-Ortiz, Araque-Castellanos, Ruiz-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, RiaÃƒÂ±o-GarzÃƒÂ³n, Bermudez","https://doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.374.6360","20210210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10590,""

"Psychological distress among health service providers during COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal","COVID-19 pandemic has provoked a wide variety of psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and panic disorders, especially among health service providers. Due to a greater risk of exposure to the virus, increased working hours, and fear of infecting their families, health service providers are more vulnerable to emotional distress than the general population during this pandemic. This online survey attempts to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 and its associated variables among healthcare workers in Nepal. For data collection purposes, Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) Questionnaire, was used whose content validity was verified by Shanghai mental health center. Data for the survey were collected from 11 to 24 October 2020 which was extracted to Microsoft Excel-13 and analyzed. A total of 254 health care workers from different provinces of the country participated in this study with a mean age of 26.01(Ã‚Â± 4.46) years. A majority 46.9% (n = 119) of the participants were not distressed (score Ã¢â€°Â¤28) while 46.5% (n = 118) were mild to moderately distressed (score &gt;28 to Ã¢â€°Â¤51) and 6.7% (n = 17) were severely distressed (score Ã¢â€°Â¥52) due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Female participants (p = 0.004) and participants who were doctors by profession (p = 0.001) experienced significantly more distress. COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the psychological distress amongst health care service providers. The findings from the present study may highlight the need for constructing and implementing appropriate plans and policies by relevant stakeholders that will help to mitigate the distress among health service providers in the current pandemic so that we can have an efficient frontline health workforce to tackle this worse situation.","Kafle, Shrestha, Baniya, Lamichhane, Shahi, Gurung, Tandan, Ghimire, Budhathoki","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246784","20210210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10594,""

A survey about resilience and tele-mental health was developed and conducted with ForLikeMinds' members and followers. Correlational analysis was used to examine relationships between quantitative variables. A phenomenological approach was used to analyze open questions responses. Sixteen percent of participants were coping well with the pandemic; 50% were coping okay; and 34% said that they were coping poorly. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: accessibility to care; self-care strategies; and community support and relationship. The responses from participants seems to reflect the combination of two main factors-the challenges they were facing in accessing care through tele-mental health plus the mental health consequences from COVID-19.

"The explanatory role of fatigue severity in the relation between COVID-19 perceived stress and depression, anxiety, and panic severity","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on anxiety and depression symptoms and disorders in the United States and worldwide. As such, there is considerable interest in better understanding the relationship between COVID-19 and anxiety and depressive disorders. Although individual differences in perceived stress have shown to be related to anxiety and depression in non-COVID-19 work, research has not examined potential factors underlying this relation in the context of COVID-19. Fatigue severity may be a promising mechanistic construct for perceived stress and anxiety and depression relations, as some work has found that perceived stress may predict elevated fatigue symptoms. As such, the current study sought to examine the potential explanatory role of fatigue severity in the relation between COVID-19 specific perceived stress and depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms among 563 adults (41.9% female, <i>M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â </i>38.26Ã‚Â years, <i>SDÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 12.15). Results suggested that COVID-19 perceived stress, via fatigue severity, significantly predicted depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms. These results provide initial empirical support for the role of fatigue severity in the relation between COVID-19 perceived stress and depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms. Future work would benefit from using longitudinal data to evaluate the current model.","Manning, Zvolensky, Garey, Long, Gallagher","https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1874503","20210210","COVID-19; Pandemic; affect; fatigue; mental Health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10597,""
"COVID-19 psychological factors associated with pain status, pain intensity, and pain-related interference","The 2019 novel SARS-CoV2 disease causing COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the world, and those with pain conditions may be at heightened risk for these negative consequences. Given COVID-19 limitations, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, pain is likely largely going untreated, leading to greater pain and associated consequences. Mental health symptoms, which have been found to be elevated due to COVID-19, may contribute to elevated pain experience, but little work has examined how COVID-19-specific mental health factors may be associated with pain. Therefore, the current study examined (1) how COVID-19-specific psychological factors and general mental health symptoms differ between those with pain and without, and (2) among those with pain, which psychological factors were most strongly associated with pain experience. Results from a national (U.S. based) online sample of 174 adults (42.5% female, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 37.80Ã‚Â years, <i>SD</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 11.30, 88 with pain) collected between April and May 2020 indicated that, compared to those individuals reporting no pain, those with pain reported significantly higher values on all variables. Additionally, COVID-19 fear and sleep problems were associated with pain intensity, and for pain-related interference, fear, sleep problems, and depression were significantly associated.

Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 1 week after the intervention, and assessed AF knowledge, adherence to self-management behaviors, mental health, physical function, and disease-specific quality of life in patients with AF. Secondary outcomes included knowledge of COVID-19, intervention acceptability and satisfaction. Of 68 patients who completed baseline questionnaires, 57 participated in the intervention and were included in the analysis (mean age of 73.4Ã‚Â±10.0 years, 60% male). Adherence to AF self-monitoring behaviors, including monitoring their heart rate (p &lt; 0.001), heart rhythm (p = 0.003), and blood pressure (p = 0.013) were significantly improved at the end of the intervention compared with baseline. Symptom identification (p = 0.007) and management (p &lt; 0.001) also improved. Reductions inÃ‚Â sleepÃ‚Â disturbanceÃ‚Â (p &lt; 0.001),Ã‚Â anxiety (p = 0.014) and depression (p = 0.046) were also observed. Misinformation and inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 were significantly reduced at the end of the intervention compared with baseline. This pilot study suggests that a virtual patient education program could have beneficial effects on adherence to guideline-recommend self-care of AF, emotional wellbeing, physical function and knowledge of COVID-19 in patients with AF. Future randomized studies in larger samples are needed to determine the clinical benefits of the intervention. This article is protected by copyright.

"Impacts of COVID-19 on caregivers of childhood cancer survivors","We sought to assess the impact of disruptions due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on caregivers of childhood cancer survivors. A 13-question survey containing multiple-choice, Likert-type, and free-text questions on experiences, behaviors, and attitudes during the COVID-19 outbreak was sent to childhood cancer caregivers and completed between April 13 and May 17, 2020. Ordered logistic regression was used to investigate relationships between demographics, COVID-related experiences, and caregiver well-being. Caregivers from 321 unique families completed the survey, including 175 with children under active surveillance/follow-up care and 146 with children no longer receiving oncology care. Overall, caregivers expressed exceptional resiliency, highlighting commonalities between caring for a child with cancer and adopting COVID-19 prophylactic measures. However, respondents reported delayed/canceled appointments (50%) and delayed/canceled imaging (19%). Eleven percent of caregivers reported struggling to pay for basic needs, which was associated with greater disruption to daily life, greater feelings of anxiety, poorer sleep, and less access to social support (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Caregivers who were self-isolating reported greater feelings of anxiety and poorer sleep (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Respondents who expressed confidence in the government response to COVID-19 reported less disruption to their daily life, decreased feelings of depression and anxiety, better sleep, and greater hopefulness (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are experiencing changes to medical care, financial disruptions, and emotional distress due to COVID-19. To better serve caregivers and medically at-risk children, clinicians must evaluate financial toxicity and feelings of isolation in families affected by childhood cancer, and work to provide reliable information on how COVID-19 may differentially impact their children.","Wimberly, Towry, Caudill, Johnston, Walsh","https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.28943","20210210","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; access to care; childhood cancer; parental distress; psychological harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10601,""
"Social distancing predicts suicide rates: Analysis of the 1918 flu pandemic in 43 large cities, research note","Social distancing (e.g., school and business closings) has been emphasized in current sociopolitical efforts in controlling COVID-19. Such policies are assumed to increase suicide risk through lowering social integration. While two studies have linked the presence of a pandemic to suicide rates, no study has assessed the degree of social distancing on suicide rates during a pandemic. The present study fills this gap with data on the extent of social distancing during the Spanish flu epidemic in 43 large cities. The results find that increasing social distancing increases suicide rates independent of the influenza mortality rate.","Stack, Rockett","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12729","20210210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10602,""
"[COVID-19 in collective accommodation centres for refugees: assessment of pandemic control measures and priorities from the perspective of authorities]","The containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in collective accommodation centres is crucial to maintain the physical and mental health of refugees. It is unclear what measures have been taken by authorities in this setting to reduce the risk of infection, minimise stressors for refugees during the pandemic and communicate containment measures. Assessment of measures that have been taken to prevent and contain SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 in collective accommodation for refugees and identification of support required by authorities. Qualitative interview study with 48Ã‚Â representatives responsible for the reception and accommodation of refugees. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim and evaluated using framework analysis. We found substantial heterogeneity of measures taken to prevent infection, inform refugees, maintain social and health services, test for SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 and quarantine positive cases. Effective intersectoral cooperation proved to be particularly important for coordination and implementation of measures. Need for support was expressed with regard to the improvement of infrastructure, opportunities to work with language interpreters and stronger involvement of local health experts. Amidst multiple actors and the complexity of structures and processes, the admission authorities have been taking on essential responsibilities related to infection control on an ad hoc basis, without being sufficiently positioned to do so. In order to further contain the pandemic, aÃ‚Â strengthening of centralised, setting-specific recommendations and information as well as their translation through the pro-active involvement of the public health authorities at the local level are essential.

"Uncovering Survivorship Bias in Longitudinal Mental Health Surveys During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Markedly elevated adverse mental health symptoms were widely observed early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Unlike the U.S., where cross-sectional data indicate anxiety and depression symptoms have remained elevated, such symptoms reportedly declined in the U.K., according to analysis of repeated measures from a largescale longitudinal study. However, nearly 40% of U.K. respondents (those who did not complete multiple follow-up surveys) were excluded from analysis, suggesting that survivorship bias might partially explain this discrepancy. We therefore assessed survivorship bias among U.S. respondents invited to complete multiple mental health surveys during the pandemic. Survivorship bias was assessed for (1) demographic differences in follow-up survey participation, (2) differences in adjusted initial adverse mental health symptom prevalences, and (3) differences in follow-up survey participation based on mental health experiences. Adjusting for demographics, individuals who completed only one or two out of four surveys had higher prevalences of anxiety and depression symptoms in April 2020 (e.g., one-survey <i>versus</i> four-survey, anxiety symptoms, adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.55, <i>P</i> =0.0045; depression symptoms, aPR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.75, <i>P</i> =0.00052). Moreover, individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms had higher odds of not completing follow-up surveys (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.49-2.48, <i>P</i> =0.0015, aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15-2.12, <i>P</i> =0.0046, respectively). Survivorship bias among longitudinal mental health survey respondents may lead to overly optimistic interpretations of mental health trends. Cross-sectional surveys may therefore provide more accurate estimates of population-level adverse mental health symptom prevalences. Assessment of survivorship bias among 4,039 mental health survey respondents revealed that individuals who participated in fewer surveys had higher prevalences of anxiety and depression symptoms at the first timepoint and worse mental health trajectories over time. Individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms in May 2020 after not having experienced these symptoms in April 2020 had higher odds of not completing subsequent follow-up surveys compared with those who did not experience these symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.49-2.48, <i>P</i> =0.0015, aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15-2.12, <i>P</i> =0.0046, respectively). Restricting analytic samples to only respondents who provide repeated assessments in longitudinal survey studies may introduce survivorship bias, which could lead to overly optimistic interpretations of mental health trends over time.Cross-sectional or planned missing data designs may provide more accurate estimates of adverse mental health symptom prevalences than longitudinal surveys.","Czeisler, Wiley, Czeisler, Rajaratnam, Howard","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.28.21250694","20210210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10604,""
"RISK FACTORS FOR INFECTION AND HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN PEOPLE WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES","People with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences. Assess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care. Longitudinal registry study. 4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins. Periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare. A total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption. Results may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Information was self-reported. Exposure to glucocorticoids may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.","Fitzgerald, Mecoli, Douglas, Harris, Aravidis, Albayda, Sotirchos, Hoke, Orbai, Petri, Christopher-Stine, Baer, Paik, Adler, Tiniakou, Timlin, Bhargava, Newsome, Venkatesan, Chaudhry, Lloyd, Pardo, Stern, Lazarev, Truta, Saidha, Chen, Sharp, Gilotra, Kasper, Gelber, Bingham, Shah, Mowry","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251069","20210210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10605,""

"The Mediating Effects of Fear of COVID-19 and Depression on the Association Between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Emotional Eating During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the mental health of individuals due to severe changes in their normal life routines. These changes might give rise to stress-induced factors and result in developing maladaptive behaviors. Therefore, the present study tested an explorative sequential mediation model regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as a global natural experiment and hypothesized that fear and depression would be serial mediators of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and emotional eating. An online cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was adopted. A total of 362 participants were recruited from Turkey, and each completed a battery of demographic questions and psychometric scales. The standardized instruments used to test the model's constructs were the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21. The model was tested using a bootstrapping method utilizing IBM AMOS 24 software. Results showed that emotional eating was positively associated with intolerance of uncertainty, fear of COVID-19, and depression. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 had positive correlation with intolerance of uncertainty and depression. Significant negative association was also found between age and intolerance of uncertainty. In addition, females significantly reported higher levels of emotional eating and fear of COVID-19 than males. The study's hypothesized sequential mediation model was further supported. It is concluded that depression most likely developed by fear was triggered by intolerance of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic and leading to emotional eating. The study is significant because it advances theories of emotional eating with an investigation examining some of its underlying mechanisms. Also, it is one of a few research studies highlighting to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic-related cognitions and emotions are associated with maladaptive behaviors in the case of emotional eating.","Pak, SÃƒÂ¼sen, Denizci NazlÃ„Â±gÃƒÂ¼l, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00489-z","20210210","COVID-19; Depression; Emotional eating; Fear of COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10607,""
"Practice of COVID-19 Prevention Measures and Associated Factors Among Residents of Dire Dawa City, Eastern Ethiopia: Community-Based Study","COVID-19 is a current health concern in the world. People applying the prevention methods of COVID-19 are vital determinants of curbing the spread of the coronavirus. This study aimed to assess the practices and associated factors of the COVID-19 preventive measures among Dire Dawa residents. A community-based, cross-sectional mixed method was used. We conducted the study between June 15th and July 15th, 2020. The subjects of the study were selected by using systematic random sampling. We collected data through face-to-face and in-depth interviews. Both bivariate and multiple logistic regression were employed to determine the predictor variables with the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. Thematic content analysis analyzed qualitative data. The practice of COVID-19 preventive measures was 40.7% (95% CI: 37-44.4%).

The qualitative result revealed the communities are not willingly practicing prevention measures because of carelessness and ignorant of the consequences of COVID-19, and some communities believed that COVID-19 is not a real pandemic rather government uses it merely to gain political profit. The proportion of practice of COVID-19 preventive measures was low. Sex, marital status, income, history of chronic disease, history of khat chewing, knowledge, and attitude about COVID-19 were associated factors with COVID-19 preventive practices.

"Treating Social Anxiety in an Era of Social Distancing: Adapting Exposure Therapy for Youth During COVID-19","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread disruption to our traditional way of life and mental health therapy has not been spared. A combination of increased anxiety, diminished social opportunities, and the shift to telehealth service provision presents particular challenges for the treatment of social anxiety in youth, which relies heavily on exposures to social situations with peers, adults, or other feared social stimuli. The objective of this commentary is to provide guidance to clinicians working with youth with social anxiety on how to maintain ethical, evidence-informed provision of exposure therapy in light of these unusual circumstances. We first present an overview of how COVID-19 may uniquely impact youth with social anxiety and highlight the importance of continuing to provide exposure-based treatments during this time. We then discuss guiding principles for delivering exposure therapy during COVID-19. We focus on providing practical examples of how common social anxiety exposures can be adapted and delivered successfully through telehealth while abiding by COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. Finally, we discuss key recommendations to assist clinicians in moving treatment forward while considering changing safety guidelines pertaining to COVID-19.","Khan, Bilek, Tomlinson, Becker-Haimes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2020.12.002","20210210","COVID-19; exposure; social anxiety; telehealth; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10609,""

"Catastrophic cognitions about coronavirus: the Oxford psychological investigation of coronavirus questionnaire [TOPIC-Q]","Cognitive therapies are developed on the principle that specific cognitive appraisals are key determinants in the development and maintenance of mental health disorders. It is likely that particular appraisals of the coronavirus pandemic will have explanatory power for subsequent mental health outcomes in the general public. To enable testing of this hypothesis we developed a questionnaire assessing coronavirus-related cognitions. 12 285 participants completed online a 46-item pool of cognitions about coronavirus and six measures of different mental health problems. The sample was randomly split into derivation and validation samples. Exploratory factor analyses determined the factor structure, selection of items, and model fit in the derivation sample. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) then tested this model in the validation sample. Associations of the questionnaire with mental health outcomes were examined. The 26-item, seven-factor, Oxford Psychological Investigation of Coronavirus Questionnaire [TOPIC-Q] was developed. CFA demonstrated a good model fit (Ãâ€¡2 = 2108.43, df = 278, p &lt; 0.001, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.950, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.942, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.033, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.038). The factors were: cognitions about (1) safety and vulnerability, (2) negative long-term impact, (3) having the virus, (4) spreading the virus, (5) social judgment, (6) negative self, and (7) being targeted. The questionnaire explained significant variance in depression (45.8%), social anxiety (37.3%), agoraphobia (23.2%), paranoia (27.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (57.1%), and panic disorder (31.4%). Cognitions about negative long-term impact had the greatest explanatory power across disorders.

"Objectively measured digital technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among young adults","Introduction Research indicates that stressors introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted mental health, particularly among young people.1 Time spent on digital technology (e.g., social media, smartphones) has also increased2 as schools, workplaces, and social gathering sites have closed, thus intensifying pre-pandemic concerns regarding the putative effects of digital technology use (DTU) on mental health. Indeed, recent academic and newspaper articles have both directly and indirectly asserted that increased DTU is a source of the heightened psychological distress observed during the pandemic.3â€“5 However, these claims are dubious for two primary reasons. First, these articles rely on self-report measures of DTU, which are inaccurate6 and prone to systematic bias.7 Second, since the pandemic has impacted both mental health and DTU for many, the observed association between the two may be attributable to a shared common cause, rather than causality. Thus, we investigated the longitudinal associations between objectively measured DTU and mental health while accounting for important COVID-19-related effects. Methods This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh and followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines. In this four-wave panel study, participants were recruited from Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/), an online participant-recruitment platform. Waves of data collection were launched on August 14, September 12, October 14, and November 9 of 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. residents, 18-35 years old, iPhone users, and had = 10 previous submissions on Prolific with approval rating =95%. At each wave, participants uploaded screenshots of their â€œScreen Timeâ€ application (which passively tracks device usage) and completed self-reports of mental health (depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation [SI]), COVID-19-related stressors, and perceived COVID-19-related impact on well-being and DTU (Table 1). We extracted three elements from the â€œScreen Timeâ€ screenshots: (1) total screen time, (2) total time spent on social media, and (3) total number of pickups. We estimated separate random-intercept multilevel models for each mental health outcome using Mplus. Predictors were entered hierarchically in blocks (see eTable 3 in Supplement) to assess <U+0394>R2 at the within- and between-person levels. See Supplement for methodological details. Results A total of 384 young adults participated in this study (Mage = 24.5, SDage = 5.1; 57% female; 54% white; 48% Bachelorâ€™s degree education or above). Overall, participants averaged 47.5 hours of Screen Time, 677 pickups, and 15.5 hours of social media over the past week. On average, participants reported experiencing between 4 and 5 pandemic-related stressors per wave. Mean depression and anxiety t-scores were 54.6 and 56.7, respectively, and nearly 29% of participants reported past-week SI at least once. See eTable 1 for summary statistics of sample demographics and primary variables. Results of the multilevel analyses revealed that objectively-measured total screen time and social media use were unrelated to within- or between-person differences in mental health, while between-person difference in pickups was negatively associated with depression (see Figure 1). Together, the objective DTU variables explained, at most, 2.8% of the within- or between-person variance in any of the mental health outcomes (eTable 3 in Supplement). COVID-related impacts on well-being had the largest effects across modelsâ€”accounting for about 45% and 10%, respectively, of the between- and within-person variance in depression and anxiety, and 21%/28% of the between/within variance in SI. Discussion Among a sample of young adults, a population with particularly high rates of DTU8 and COVID-19-related distress,1 we found that objectively-measured DTU did not contribute to increases in depression, anxiety, or SIâ€”refuting the popular notion that increases in DTU may be contributing to young peoplesâ€™ psychological distress during the pandemic. Rather, depression, anxiety, and SI were driven mostly by young peoplesâ€™ reports of the pandemicâ€™s impact on their well-being. The convenience-based sample, retrospective (past week) assessments of mental health outcomes, and single-item measures of COVID-19-related impacts are limitations of the study. Nevertheless, results indicate that current speculations about the direct harms of DTU on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related stressors.","Craig Sewall","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-A44-729","20210211","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; social media; young adults; suicidal ideation; well-being; digital technology; depression; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10616,""
"The effect of change in routine on student mental wellbeing during a nationwide lockdown","Objective: There is limited existing research on the structure of routine and mental wellbeing. During March 2020, the UK entered a national lockdown, causing a sudden change in undergraduate studentsâ€™ routines. This study uses this event to investigate the impact routine change had on studentsâ€™ mental wellbeing; in particular looking at depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating behaviours. Method: Participants reported their daily routine timings (waking, breakfast, lunch, evening meal and bedtime) and activities (e.g. exercise amount, time with friends, time studying, etc) on a typical Monday, Wednesday and Saturday during term time and lockdown. Additionally they completed the PROMIS measures of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and the Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory. Results: Lockdown saw small but significant shifts in routine timing (on average 1.5 hours) However, there was no clear overall pattern of relationships between mental wellbeing and routine structure or magnitude of routine change. There was some evidence of changes in amount of exercise relating to reported anxiety. Discussion: These findings are consistent with the current literature reporting lockdown effects on behaviour. Routine timings shifted but this change was small and there was minimal impact of routine change on mental wellbeing reported by undergraduate students. The change in amount of exercise posed by lockdown did appear to be an important factor in wellbeing, and more research should focus on the wellbeing implications of closing places for exercise.","Jamie Thomas Kiltie et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622C-CB8-F9F","20210211","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; lockdown; routine and structure; stability; covid-19 pandemic; mood; instability; eating behaviour","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-11","",10617,""
