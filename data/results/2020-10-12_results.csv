"Epidemiology of sleep disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic scoping review","Background: A growing burden of mental health problems has become a global concern amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Sleep disorders are major mental health problems associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on the epidemiology of it. In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature. Method: Seven major health databases and additional sources were searched to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions. The Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review were used, and the findings were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Results: A total of 78 articles were retrieved, the prevalence of sleeping disorders ranged from 2.3% to 76.6%. Age, sex, level of education, physical and mental health, COVID-19 related factors, occupation especially being health care workers (HCW) were the main associated factors. Only two intentions were identified to address the issue. Conclusion: The finding of this review indicated a high burden of sleep disorder with limited interventions that necessitate informing policymakers and practitioners to facilitate future research and implementations.","Samia Tasnim; Mariya Rahman; Priyanka Pawar; Xinli Chi; Qian Yu; Liye Zou; Abida Sultana; E.

"Factors associated with mental health outcomes across healthcare settings in Oman during COVID-19: frontline versus non-frontline healthcare workers","This study aims to assess and compare demographic and psychological factors and sleep status of frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in relation to non-frontline HCWs. This cross-sectional study was conducted from 8 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 using an online survey across varied healthcare settings in Oman accruing 1139 HCWs.The primary and secondary outcomes were mental health status and sociodemographic data, respectively. Mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index. Samples were categorised into the frontline and non-frontline groups. Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> and t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic data. The Mantel-Haenszel OR was used to compare groups by mental health outcomes adjusted by all sociodemographic factors. This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. While working during the pandemic period, a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%) and 211 (18.5%) respondents were reported to have depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, respectively. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.5 times more likely to report anxiety (OR=1.557, p=0.004), stress (OR=1.506, p=0.016) and insomnia (OR=1.586, p=0.013) as compared with those in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status were found between the frontline and non-frontline groups (p=0.201). To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs, with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms being highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental healthcare must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","Alshekaili, Hassan, Al Said, Al Sulaimani, Jayapal, Al-Mawali, Chan, Mahadevan, Al-Adawi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042030","20201011","anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; public health; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5938,""

"COVID-19 and mental health in Brazil: Psychiatric symptoms in the general population","Public health interventions at general population level are imperative in order to decrease the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they may contribute to widespread emotional distress and increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. We report on the results of an investigation into the occurrence and determinants of psychiatric symptoms among the Brazilian general population (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1996). We assessed sociodemographic variables and general mental health (DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure), depression (PROMIS depression v.8a), anxiety (PROMIS anxiety v.8a), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. Anxiety (81.9%), depression (68%), anger (64.5%), somatic symptoms (62.6%) and sleep problems (55.3%) were the most common psychiatric symptoms. Younger age, female gender, low income, lower level of education, longer period of social distancing, and self-reported history of previous psychiatric illness were strongly associated with higher severity of symptoms. Our results support the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the Brazilian population. The high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms observed in our sample indicates that the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered a public health problem in Brazil. The health systems and individual clinicians must be prepared to offer and implement specific interventions in order to identify and treat psychiatric issues.","Goularte, Serafim, Colombo, Hogg, Caldieraro, Rosa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.021","20201010","Anxiety; Brazil; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5940,""
"The impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the experiences and feeding practices of new mothers in the UK: Preliminary data from the COVID-19 New Mum Study","The COVID-19 New Mum Study is recording maternal experiences and infant feeding during the UK lockdown. This report from week 1 of the survey describes and compares the delivery and post-natal experiences of women who delivered before (BL) versus during (DL) the lockdown. Women living in the UK aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years with an infant Ã¢â€°Â¤12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey (https://is.gd/covid19newmumstudy). Information/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. From 27.5 to 20-3.6.20, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married/with partner, 66% degree/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered BL and 316 (23%) DL. Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed/mixed fed versus 39% of BL (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). 13% reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient feeding support. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%/9% contacted a mental health professional; 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact/support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby. Lockdown has impacted maternal experiences, resulting in distress for many women. Our findings suggest the need for better infant feeding support, especially 'face-to-face' support for practical issues; and recognising and supporting mothers who are struggling with mental health challenges or other aspects of their health. The effectiveness of online versus face-to-face contact is currently uncertain, and requires further evaluation.","Vazquez-Vazquez, Dib, Rougeaux, Wells, Fewtrell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104985","20201010","Birth; Breastfeeding; Covid-19; Infant feeding; Lockdown; Mental health; Mother; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5941,""
"Depression, Anxiety and Lifestyle Among Essential Workers: A Websurvey From Brazil And Spain During The Covid-19 Pandemic","Essential workers have been show to present higher prevalences of anxiety and depression positive screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals from countries presenting socioeconomic inequalities may be at increased risk to mental health disorders. Herein we aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and their comorbidity among essential workers from Brazil and Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web survey was conducted during April-May, 2020 in both countries. The main outcome was positive screening for depression only, anxiety only and both. Lifestyle was measured using a lifestyle multidimensional scale adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic (SMILE-C). A multinomial logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the factors associated with depression, anxiety, and both. From the 22,786 individuals included in the websurvey, 3745 self-reported to be essential workers. Overall, 8Ã‚Â·3%, 11Ã‚Â·6% and 27Ã‚Â·4% presented positive screenings for depression, anxiety, and both, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, the multinomial model showed that an unhealthy lifestyle increased the likelihood of depression (Adjusted Odds Ratio- AOR 4Ã‚Â·00 (95%CI:2Ã‚Â·72-5Ã‚Â·87), anxiety (AOR 2Ã‚Â·39 (95%CI:1Ã‚Â·80-3Ã‚Â·20), and both anxiety and depression (AOR 8Ã‚Â·30 (95%CI:5Ã‚Â·90-11Ã‚Â·7); while living in Brazil was associated with increased AOR 2Ã‚Â·89 (95%CI:2Ã‚Â·07-4Ã‚Â·06) for depression, anxiety AOR 2Ã‚Â·81 (95%CI:2Ã‚Â·11-3Ã‚Â·74), and both depression and anxiety AOR 5Ã‚Â·99 (95%CI:4Ã‚Â·53-7Ã‚Â·91). Interventions addressing lifestyle may be useful in dealing with symptoms of common mental disorders during the strain imposed among essential workers by the COVID 19 pandemic. Essential workers that live in midle income countries with higher rates of inequality may face additional challenges. Ensuring equitable treatment and support may be an important challenge ahead, considering the possible syndemic effect of social determinants of health.","De Boni, BalanzÃƒÂ¡-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Mota, Cardoso, Ballester, Carbonell, Bastos, Kapczinski","https://doi.org/10.2196/22835","20201010","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5942,""
"Videotherapy and Therapeutic Alliance in the Age of COVID-19","The arrival of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has confronted us with a global and unprecedented challenge of community-wide psychological distress alongside reduced access to therapeutic services in the traditional face-to-face format, due to the need to self-isolate. This previously unimagineable set of circumstances provides a unique opportunity, and indeed an imperative, for videotherapy to fulfil its potential in addressing mental health and wellbeing needs from a distance. Historically, the uptake of videotherapy has been hindered by psychotherapist expectations of inferior therapeutic alliance and outcomes, in spite of considerable research evidence to the contrary. Research suggests that videotherapy provides a powerful pathway for clients to experience enhanced opportunities for self-expression, connection and intimacy. This more neutral therapeutic 'space' provides clients with multifarious opportunities for self-awareness, creative experience and collaboration, with potentially a greater sense of agency over their own experience. This paper explores ways in which videotherapy can lead to a re-vitalisation of the concept of the therapeutic relationship, in order to meet the challenges associated with COVID-19. A number of specific considerations for videotherapy adaptations and etiquette in the midst of COVID-19 are described.","Simpson, Richardson, Pietrabissa, Castelnuovo, Reid","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2521","20201010","COVID19; telemental health; telepsychology; therapeutic alliance; videotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5943,""
"Mental distress among US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aims to document the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We compared a nationally representative online sample of 2,032 U.S. adults in late April 2020 to 19,330 U.S. adult internet users who participated in the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) using the Kessler-6 scale of mental distress in the last 30 days. Compared to the 2018 NHIS sample, U.S. adults in April 2020 were eight times more likely to fit criteria for serious mental distress (27.7% vs. 3.4%) and three times more likely to fit criteria for moderate or serious mental distress (70.4% vs. 22.0%). Differences between the 2018 and 2020 samples appeared across all demographic groups, with larger differences among younger adults and those with children in the household. These considerable levels of mental distress may portend substantial increases in diagnosed mental disorders and in their associated morbidity and mortality.","Twenge, Joiner","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23064","20201010","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental distress; social isolation; unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5944,""
"Risk factors for adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparison between Wuhan and other urban areas in China","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease is causing considerable acute risk to public health and might also have an unanticipated impact on the mental health of children and adolescents in the long run. This study collected data during the national lockdown period in China and aims to understand whether there is a clinically significant difference in anxiety, depression, and parental rearing style when comparing adolescents from Wuhan and other cities in China. This study also intends to examine whether gender, grade in school, single child status, online learning participation, parents' involvement in COVID-19 related work, and parents being quarantined or infected due to the disease would lead to clinically significant differences in anxiety and depression. Beyond that, this study explored the pathways among the different variables in order to better understand how these factors play a part in impacting adolescents' mental health condition. Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in anxiety symptoms between participants who were from Wuhan compared to other urban areas, but not in depressive symptoms. In addition, participants' grade level, gender, relative being infected, and study online have direct positive predictive value for depressive and anxiety symptoms, whereas location and sibling status have indirect predictive value. Having relatives who participated in COVID-19 related work only had positive direct predictive value toward depression, but not anxiety. This study discovered several risk factors for adolescents' depression and anxiety during the pandemic. It also called for a greater awareness of Wuhan parents' mental wellbeing and recommended a systematic approach for mental health prevention and intervention.","Chen, Cheng, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00627-7","20201010","Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5945,""

"Barriers and facilitators to mood and confidence in pregnancy and early parenthood during COVID-19 in the UK: A mixed-methods synthesis survey","Background: Parentsâ€™ well-being during pregnancy and early parenthood is critical for childrenâ€™s development. Environmental stressors can significantly challenge parentsâ€™ well-being. Aims: To investigate how COVID-19 and associated restrictions influence mood and parenting confidence of expectant parents and those in early parenthood, identifying barriers and facilitators. Methods: We used a cross-sectional online survey to collect data from 590 expectant parents and parents of infants (564 females) during the most restrictive phase of the lockdown in the UK. Survey included a mixture of forced-choice and open-ended questions pertaining to mood, perceived social support, media use, online interactions, and parenting expectations. Quantitative data were analysed using multiple linear regression and proportional odds models, while an inductive thematic analysis was employed for qualitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data were qualitatively synthesised. Results: A decrease in mood and parenting confidence were found. Barriers included practical difficulties (finding essentials, reliable health information), social difficulties (loss of physical contact, decreased support), and uncertainty during pregnancy. Facilitators included support from others and for first-time parents, loss of childcare resulting in greater parenting confidence. While online resources and communication were not preferable to face-to-face interactions, technology was a helpful tool for communicating, getting support, and finding essentials and information during lockdown. Conclusion: By mid-May 2020, mood and parenting confidence among expectant and parents of newborns in the UK were significantly reduced. Consideration of barriers and facilitators in healthcare and psychological support provided is likely to play an important part in promoting parental mental health and healthy parent-child relationships.","Alejandra Perez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-20E-4D8","20201011","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Prenatal Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; covid-19; parental well-being; pandemic; pregnancy; infancy; parenting","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-12","",5947,""
