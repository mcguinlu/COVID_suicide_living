"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with epilepsy: A systematic review and meta-analysis","To investigate psychological comorbidities in patients with epilepsy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A systematic review and meta-analysis approach was used to comprehensively search MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for relevant studies. Studies that reported psychological stress in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Psychological comorbidities were defined as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Pooled proportions of psychological comorbidities with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using a random-effects model. The quality of assessment for each study, heterogeneity between the studies, and publication bias were also evaluated. A total of 28 studies with 7959 patients/caregivers were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled proportions of anxiety/worry, depression/bad mood, and sleep disturbance were 38.9% (95% CI: 31.3-46.7); I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯97%; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01, 30.9% (95% CI: 23.3-38.9), I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯97%; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01, and 36.5% (95% CI: 28.3-45.1), I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯97%, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01, respectively. Although the heterogeneity was high, our results showed a relatively high incidence of psychological comorbidities. Therefore, clinicians need to intervene early in the stress of patients with epilepsy to prevent worsening of stress, which can result in seizure worsening.","Kuroda, Kubota","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108340","20211002","COVID-19; Depression; Epilepsy; Mental health; Novel coronavirus disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18538,""
"The early impact of COVID-19 on the incidence, prevalence, and severity of alcohol use and other drugs: A systematic review","The aim of this paper was to examine the early impact of COVID-19 on substance use to assess implications for planning substance use treatment and support systems. A systematic review of literature published up to March 2021 was conducted to summarize changes in prevalence, incidence, and severity of substance use associated with COVID-19 and the accompanying public health measures, including lockdown, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing. We identified 53 papers describing changes to substance use at the population level. The majority of papers described changes related to alcohol use and most relied on self-reported measures of consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic use. There was less evidence to support changes in non-alcohol substance use. In general, risky pre-pandemic alcohol use, caregiving responsibilities, stress, depression, anxiety, and current treatment for a mental disorder were found to be associated with increased substance use. This review provides preliminary data on changes in substance use, indicating that certain segments of the population increased their alcohol use early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and may be at greater risk of harm and in need of additional services. There is a need for additional population-level information on substance use to inform evidence-based rapid responses from a treatment system perspective.","Schmidt, Genois, Jin, Vigo, Rehm, Rush","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109065","20211002","COVID-19; Health services needs and demand; Pandemics; Prevalence; Substance-related disorders; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18539,""
"Antibody response induced by the boost overdose during COVID-19 heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy","Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD Ig G antibody response is very important to define the dynamics of immunization in vaccine COVID-19 recipients. Sera from four BNT162b2 vaccine recipients who erroneously received vaccine overdose were analyzed at different time-points. At 6 days the serum increase of antibodies was analogous for the three SARS-CoV-2 naÃƒÂ¯ve recipients. At 14 days the antibody level increased and reached a peak, though showing a different pattern among the three recipients. At 21 days the serum antibody level started to decrease from its maximum value. The data for the previously infected recipient were in agreement with values found in COVID-19 positive receivers. Thus, after the single prime-dose of vaccine, the elicited antibody response was similar to prime-boost vaccination in naÃƒÂ¯ve recipients. In spite of the overdosage, this study confirms the efficiency of the BNT162b vaccine in eliciting a sustained antibody response as heterologous boost-vaccine in previously Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccinated recipients, as well as, prime-vaccine in COVID-19 infected receivers. Importantly, the humoral immune response of recipients was not proportional to the vaccine overdose. Nonetheless, we cannot portray a univocal effect of vaccine overdose concerning anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response because the values found were highly heterogeneous.","Raposo, Lippi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.09.022","20211002","Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD Ig G antibody; Antibody response monitoring; BNT162b2 vaccine; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccine overdose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18540,""
"Changes in neonatal admissions, care processes and outcomes in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic: a whole population cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic instigated multiple societal and healthcare interventions with potential to affect perinatal practice. We evaluated population-level changes in preterm and full-term admissions to neonatal units, care processes and outcomes. Observational cohort study using the UK National Neonatal Research Database. England and Wales. Admissions to National Health Service neonatal units from 2012 to 2020. Admissions by gestational age, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation, and key care processes and outcomes. We calculated differences in numbers and rates between April and June 2020 (spring), the first 3 months of national lockdown (COVID-19 period), and December 2019-February 2020 (winter), prior to introduction of mitigation measures, and compared them with the corresponding differences in the previous 7 years. We considered the COVID-19 period highly unusual if the spring-winter difference was smaller or larger than all previous corresponding differences, and calculated the level of confidence in this conclusion. Marked fluctuations occurred in all measures over the 8 years with several highly unusual changes during the COVID-19 period. Total admissions fell, having risen over all previous years (COVID-19 difference: -1492; previous 7-year difference range: +100, +1617; p&lt;0.001); full-term black admissions rose (+66; -64, +35; p&lt;0.001) whereas Asian (-137; -14, +101; p&lt;0.001) and white (-319; -235, +643: p&lt;0.001) admissions fell. Transfers to higher and lower designation neonatal units increased (+129; -4, +88; p&lt;0.001) and decreased (-47; -25, +12; p&lt;0.001), respectively. Total preterm admissions decreased (-350; -26, +479; p&lt;0.001). The fall in extremely preterm admissions was most marked in the two lowest socioeconomic quintiles. Our findings indicate substantial changes occurred in care pathways and clinical thresholds, with disproportionate effects on black ethnic groups, during the immediate COVID-19 period, and raise the intriguing possibility that non-healthcare interventions may reduce extremely preterm births.","Greenbury, Longford, Ougham, Angelini, Battersby, Uthaya, Modi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054410","20211002","neonatal intensive &amp; critical care; neonatology; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18541,""
"Critical care health professionals' self-reported needs for wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: A thematic analysis of survey responses","Critical care healthcare professionals are a key part of any pandemic response and are at an increased risk for physical and psychological harm, yet their self-reported suggestions to ameliorate the negative effects of pandemics on their wellbeing have rarely been sought. The objective of this study was to explore and interpret themes of critical care healthcare professionals' responses to the question 'What do you think could assist your wellbeing during the COVID-19 crisis?' A descriptive study using an online survey, performed in April 2020, investigating pandemic preparedness and psychological burden during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic among critical care professionals was carried out. Informal snowball sampling was used. Thematic analysis of qualitative data from an open-ended survey item was informed by Braun and Clark. Eighty percent (2387/3770) of respondents completed the open-ended survey. Three themes were generated from the synthesis: adequate resourcing for the role; consistent, clear information, and prioritised communications; and the need for genuine kindness and provision of support for healthcare professional wellbeing. There is merit for considering the perceptions, concerns, and suggestions of critical care clinicians during a pandemic. Suggestions included simple measures to maintain physical and mental health, clear messaging, consistent information, trust in health and political leaders, supportive working environments, specific training, and allowances for personal circumstances. This information is important for health and political leaders and policy makers to implement strategies to reduce the burden associated with delivering care in the context of a pandemic.","Elliott, Crowe, Abbenbroek, Grattan, Hammond","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2021.08.007","20211002","COVID-19; Critical care; Healthcare workers; Thematic analysis; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18542,""
"COVID-19: Factors associated with psychological distress, fear, and coping strategies among community members across 17 countries","The current pandemic of COVID-19 impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations globally. We aimed to examine the extent and identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear of COVID-19 and coping. We conducted a cross-sectional study across 17 countries during Jun-2020 to Jan-2021. Levels of psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), fear of COVID-19 (Fear of COVID-19 Scale), and coping (Brief Resilient Coping Scale) were assessed. A total of 8,559 people participated; mean age (Ã‚Â±SD) was 33(Ã‚Â±13) years, 64% were females and 40% self-identified as frontline workers. More than two-thirds (69%) experienced moderate-to-very high levels of psychological distress, which was 46% in Thailand and 91% in Egypt. A quarter (24%) had high levels of fear of COVID-19, which was as low as 9% in Libya and as high as 38% in Bangladesh. More than half (57%) exhibited medium to high resilient coping; the lowest prevalence (3%) was reported in Australia and the highest (72%) in Syria. Being female (AOR 1.31 [95% CIs 1.09-1.57]), perceived distress due to change of employment status (1.56 [1.29-1.90]), comorbidity with mental health conditions (3.02 [1.20-7.60]) were associated with higher levels of psychological distress and fear. Doctors had higher psychological distress (1.43 [1.04-1.97]), but low levels of fear of COVID-19 (0.55 [0.41-0.76]); nurses had medium to high resilient coping (1.30 [1.03-1.65]). The extent of psychological distress, fear of COVID-19 and coping varied by country; however, we identified few higher risk groups who were more vulnerable than others. There is an urgent need to prioritise health and well-being of those people through well-designed intervention that may need to be tailored to meet country specific requirements.","Rahman, Islam, Tungpunkom, Sultana, Alif, Banik, Salehin, Joseph, Lam, Watts, Khan, Ghozy, Chair, Chien, SchÃƒÂ¶nfeldt-Lecuona, El-Khazragy, Mahmud, Al Mawali, Al Maskari, Alharbi, Hamza, Keblawi, Hammoud, Elaidy, Susanto, Bahar Moni, AlQurashi, Ali, Wazib, Sanluang, Elsori, Yasmin, Taufik, Al Kloub, Ruiz, Elsayed, Eltewacy, Al Laham, Oli, Abdelnaby, Dweik, Thongyu, Almustanyir, Rahman, Nitayawan, Al-Madhoun, Inthong, Alharbi, Bahar, Ginting, Cross","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00768-3","20211002","COVID-19; coping; coronavirus; fear; mental health; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18543,""
"Six-Month Efficacy and Toxicity Profile of BNT162b2 Vaccine in Cancer Patients with Solid Tumors","We had previously reported short-term efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine among cancer patients with solid tumors. We aimed to evaluate these outcomes at six months postvaccination. The study cohort comprised patients who were on treatment during vaccination and throughout six months postvaccination. Serologic tests were performed after second vaccination and six months afterward. An age-matched cohort of health care workers served as controls. Documentation of COVID-19 infection, blood tests, and imaging studies during the study period was reviewed. Participants included 154 patients and 135 controls. Six months postvaccination, 122 (79%) patients were seropositive compared with 114 (84%) controls (<i>P</i> = 0.32). Serology titer dramatically decreased in a similar manner in both cohorts. No COVID-19 cases were documented in controls, and one case occurred in patient cohort. All previously reported adverse effects resolved. Taken together, the pattern of immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of BNT162b2 in patients with cancer with solid tumors at six months postvaccination resembles that of the general population. SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence regarding efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer indicate a favorable short-term profile. Immunomodulation due to anticancer treatments may affect immunity and immunogenicity of patients with cancer to the BNT162b2 vaccine over time. Our study sheds light on these long-term outcomes and portrays a trend that resembles the general population.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2355</i>.","Waldhorn, Holland, Goshen-Lago, Shirman, Szwarcwort-Cohen, Reiner-Benaim, Shachor-Meyouhas, Hussein, Fahoum, Peer, Almog, Shaked, Halberthal, Ben-Aharon","https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-1072","20211002","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","",18544,""
