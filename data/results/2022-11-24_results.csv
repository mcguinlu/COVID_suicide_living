"POSTNATAL WELLBEING - WHY IT MATTERS?","Postnatal care has been regarded as the Cinderella service within maternity care, with the COVID-19 pandemic exasperating existing problems. However, evidence suggests postnatal wellbeing is pivotal to enhancing overall health and transition to parenthood and should not be overlooked.2 While services continue to be stretched, midwives need to be innovative and effective in signposting families to strategies which can promote health and wellbeing. Enhancing wellness during the postnatal period is requisite of midwifery care.3 It can be helpful to centre this within the wider remit of health and wellbeing for the whole family. Encouraging empowerment and autonomy in parenting has been shown to increase positivity whilst strengthening adaptation to parenthood.2 While all families will have unique needs;community support can be vital. Midwives, working in partnership with local organisations, can suggest group attendance for families to find solace with other new parents. The NICE guidelines on postnatal care4 have an in-depth guide to the immediate health checks required for mothers and babies. However other principles of wellness such as the NHS5 Steps to wellbeing5 are a useful guide. For all women, regardless of parity, birth outcomes and community setting, fundamental health principles will promote wellbeing now and in the future.","Stringer, Kate","https://doi.org/10.55975/MEGF1861","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Practising Midwife; JOUR(9):19-19, 25.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41492,""
"SALIVARY CHROMOGRANIN AS A STRESS BIOMARKER AND SECRETORY IgA AMONG COVID-19 PATIENTS","COVID-19 epidemic had a significant impact on many aspects of people lives, when these people urged to quarantine and lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading which had a major effect on people's mental health, depression and stress. Many internal and environmental causes contribute to this stress, which has a detrimental impact on the body's homeostasis. As a result, stress may have an impact on the body's ability to conflict pathogens using its energy. Many recent studies have revealed strong associations between human mental stress and secretion of hormones, prohormones and/or immunological substances, part of these studies have confirmed the correlation between stress and the salivary CgA level, also Secretory IgA (sIgA) plays an important role in immunity by binding the surface molecules of pathogenic microorganisms and preventing adhesion and colonization. The aim of this study is to measure salivary chromogranin A as a stress biomarker as well as Secretory IgA levels among COVID-19 patients. 84 samples were collected from adults who have been divided into two groups: COVID-19 group consists of 42 patients and COVID-19 free group which consists of 42 subjects. All subjects undergo PCR test to confirm their healthy status, collection of unstimulated saliva was done and laboratory investigations was carried out to measure the salivary chromogranin A and Salivary IgA levels by the use of chromogranin A kit (human CGA ELISA kit) by alshakirate establishment for medical supply and SIgA kit (IgA saliva ELISA) by LDN company. SPSS version 21 was used for statistical analysis. Salivary chromogranin A was substantially greater in the COVID-19 group than in the COVID-19 free group, whereas secretory IgA was lower in the COVID-19 group, according to the statistical analysis. In conclusion a significant negative association was found between salivary chromogranin A and secretory IgA (p = 0.001).so, when the concentration of salivary chromogranin A elevated in the COVID-19 group, the level of secretory IgA reduced.

"Impact of Flexible Working Arrangements on Millennials' Mental Health, Well-Being and Productivity during COVID-19","Malaysian millennials are reported to be struggling with stress and well-being issues at the workplace during the last decade. Drawing from the Self-Determination Theory, this study examines whether flexible working arrangements (FWAs) could impact millennials' mental health, well-being and productivity at the workplace. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 400 millennials in the services sector during the COVID-19 period. Findings revealed that FWAs influenced millennials' mental health, well-being, and productivity as millennials value job autonomy and a friendly work ecosystem as an ideal workplace. This sees a compelling case for Malaysian businesses to adopt FWAs in a more structured way in line with Sustainable Development Goal-3.","Subramaniam, G.; Rozlan, N. Z.

"Prevalence of psychological disorders in patients with COVID-19 syndrome","The coronavirus 2019 first broke out on December 17, 2019 in Wuhan, China, and on March 11, 2020, it was announced as a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite nutritious diets and promising vaccines, health tips such as wearing a mask, social distancing, home quarantine, and not traveling are still the best ways to control the spread of COVID-19. While the widespread prevalence of COVID-19, severe restrictions, lack of definitive treatment, and the high infection and mortality rates have led to cognitive psychological disorders among the general population of the world. One of the epidemic consequences of COVID-19 syndrome in people who have defeated the coronavirus was psychological disorders. Considering the role of mental health in boosting the immune system, improving the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine and accelerating the treatment process of patients, it is suggested that in the post-COVID era, more attention be paid to the psychological health of the community.","Sheykhangafshe, F.

"COVID-19 pandemic as a media event: The specifics of construction in social media","2020 went down in history as the year of the pandemic and lockdowns. In the context of self-isolation, the construction of a global media event, the COVID-19 pandemic, plays a key role in the audience's perception of information and their further actions. The research focuses on the timeline of the ""first wave"" of the spread of the virus (the initial stage, the implementing of compulsory universal self-isolation, the lifting of restrictive measures). Six social and political Telegram channels with a large outreach, which often served as a key source of information about the pandemic for the public, were chosen for the analysis. In total, 825 posts were analysed. The main sources of information about the coronavirus were identified: the media, official data from organizations that keep statistics on people who got infected/recovered, statements by officials on the situation in a country and the world, and the Telegram channels' own information. During the pandemic, popular Telegram channels adhered to a common agenda alongside with the media, thus, in fact, not offering a large percentage of original materials. Based on the content analysis, a conclusion is made about the transformation of the construction of a media event. In terms of visualization, posts containing photos or emojis predominated. By the end of the first wave, the number of posts containing videos dropped. Short clips (up to 20-30 seconds), in fact, served as photo illustrations. The increase in the number of posts containing memes is explained by the need for a mass audience to understand and reflect on the events that are taking place. During the ""first wave"", the priority areas in the topics of the posts were statistics on the number of infected/recovered people;initiatives of the authorities;and social, cultural, and entertainment subject matters. However, from the initial period to the moment when self-isolation was lifted, the topics of the posts changed: the number of articles on morbidity and mortality significantly decreased, the second period recorded the largest number of articles about lifestyle, while social topics were among the leading ones in the third period. The study revealed a miniscule number of fake news - 1%, which can be explained by the tightening of criminal legislation regarding the dissemination of knowingly false information. Regarding the theory of strategies for deproblematization of situations, the Telegram channels used the following strategies: the strategy of declaring powerlessness, the strategy of perspectivization, and the strategy of criticizing tactics.","Zuykina, K.

"A Feasibility Study of LORETA Z-Score Neurofeedback Training in Adults with Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorder Experiencing Treatment-Resistant Auditory Verbal Hallucinations","Introduction: The incomplete effectiveness of interventions demands new ways to help people diagnosed with schizophrenia who experience auditory verbal hallucinations (SZ-AVH). We aimed to perform a feasibility study of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA) neurofeedback with people exhibiting treatment-resistant SZ-AVH. Methods: We examined changes in resting-state quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) in four people with SZ-AVH (three male, one female) after LORETA Z-score neurofeedback training. Results: The study design had to be amended due to a national COVID-19 lockdown. Neurofeedback was well tolerated and no participants dropped out. Recruitment was the main feasibility issue. Barriers included a lack of knowledge of neurofeedback by patients and mental health teams, as well as the travel and time commitment involved. For the only patient who completed all 20 sessions, elevated frontal, central, and temporal theta absolute power measured at baseline normalized after treatment, but decreased temporal delta and an increase in coherence for all frequency bands were also found. Conclusions: Two key lessons were drawn for the feasibility of trials of EEG neurofeedback in this population. First, significant effort is needed to educate mental health professionals and patients about neurofeedback. Second, the equipment employed for neurofeedback training needs to be physically based at a site where patients routinely attend.","Amico, Francesco, Keane, Michael, Lee, Meredith, McCarthy-Jones, Simon","https://doi.org/10.15540/nr.9.3.135","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: NeuroRegulation; JOUR(3):135, 9.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41498,""

"More Relaxed but Less Helpful: The Relationship between Stress, Age, and Self-Reported Prosocial Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has collectively increased stress levels, with individuals making difficult choices between protecting themselves and helping others. Previous research has shown that people engage in more prosocial, or helping, behavior as they age and in moments of acute stress, but it is unclear how c stress has influenced perceived changes in prosocial behavior in the later stages of the pandemic and whether this varies across the lifespan. (2) Methods: The current study explored how perceived stress, age, and gender impact participants' reports of perceived changes in their prosocial behavior due to the pandemic using survey questions administered through an online subject pool (n = 201). (3) Results: Hierarchical linear regression results revealed results indicated a significant main effect of perceived stress (&beta;= &minus;0.166, p = 0.021) and age (&beta;= &minus;0.217, p = 0.003) but not gender (&beta;= &minus;0.062, p = 0.370) on perceptions of how one's prosocial behavior was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. (4) Conclusions: Study findings showed that older adults and individuals with higher levels of perceived stress reported a decrease in their prosocial behavior, which supported our hypotheses. These findings provide unique insight into the influence of a long-term health crisis on different groups of people's participation in prosocial behavior, with implications for mental health and community engagement during a pandemic.","Harris, Maggie W.; Byrne, Kaileigh A.; Pury, Cynthia L.

"""We are pests, we have no future"": The prediction of anxiety by perceived discrimination in patients with coronavirus: Mediating role of psychological resilience","In a short amount of time, the COVID-19 pandemic has played havoc on social security, and people infected with coronavirus may have suffered from both physical and mental health issues requiring treatment. The purpose of our study was to examine the effect of perceived discrimination on anxiety in patients with coronavirus and to observe the role of psychological resilience as a mediator in this process. 376 patients with coronavirus were given a questionnaire, and 26 of them participated in in-depth interviews. Our results demonstrated that perceived discrimination in patients with coronavirus was predictive of anxiety and that strong perceptions of discrimination reduced patients' psychological resilience levels, thereby triggering severe anxiety. Furthermore, psychological resilience was demonstrated to be a significant predictor of anxiety severity. Psychological resilience has been shown to act as a mediator between perceived discrimination and anxiety. As a response to COVID-19, the government, the media, and the general public should treat patients with coronavirus scientifically and rationally, minimize the secondary psychological damage caused by the perception of discrimination to the special groups of society represented by patients with coronavirus during the pandemic, correct the erroneous stigma generated by the traditional communication process, and prevent the spread of the psychosocial virus.","Li, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.979186","20221124","COVID-19; anxiety; patients with coronavirus; perceived discrimination; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41506,""

The total sample of 5,155 participants from Germany consisted of 65% women and 34% men, with a mean age of 45.0 &#xb1; 14.0 years. Directly after the first lockdown, <i>Nature/Silence</i> and Awe/Gratitude scores were high and decreased along with wellbeing with the onset of the second lockdown in winter 2020, while perceived burden constantly increased. <i>Nature/Silence</i> was rated lowest by people with reduced wellbeing (eta<sup>2</sup> = 0.058) and feeling lonely or socially isolated (eta<sup>2</sup> = 0.042). Predictor analyses revealed that wellbeing as a dependent variable was predicted best by corona-related perception of burden, Awe/Gratitude, reflection of life, and <i>Nature/Silence</i> and further by perceived changes in terms of relationships and spirituality (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.55). In mediation analyses, Awe/Gratitude proved to be a significant predictor for <i>Nature/Silence</i> (&#x3b2; = 0.55, p&lt; 0.0001) and wellbeing (&#x3b2; = 0.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The mediation analysis explained 37% of the variability in the data. The direct influence of Awe/Gratitude on wellbeing was estimated as &#x3b2; = 0.09 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and the mediation effect of <i>Nature/Silence</i> on the link between Awe/Gratitude and wellbeing was significant, too (&#x3b2; = 0.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), explaining 25% of the total effect. <i>Nature/Silence</i> and Awe/Gratitude were used as relevant resources during the pandemic, although they cannot fully buffer the negative effects of the social restrictions that resulted in decreases in wellbeing and increases in perceived burden. Perception of nature as a sensitizer of positive experiences particularly during difficult phases of life could be trained to stabilize wellbeing and thus to contribute to public health.","B&#xfc;ssing, Recchia, Baumann","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1020053","20221124","COVID-19 pandemic; coping; perception of nature; times of silence; wellbeing; wondering awe","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41507,""
"Psychological and sleep disturbances among first-line, second-line, and at home medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China","Medical workers are prone to psychological and sleep disturbances during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Little is known about the varying degrees of influence among vaccinated medical staff working in different positions. The current study is aimed to evaluate and compare depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances among first-line, second-line and at home vaccinated medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2022. In addition to demographic data, levels of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and insomnia were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). A total of 236 vaccinated medical workers completed the questionnaires, including 85 first-line medical staff (FMS), 82 second-line medical staff (SMS) and 69 at home medical staff (HMS). The proportions of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, poor sleep quality, and insomnia were 52.1, 44.1, 55.9, and 49.2%, respectively. Compared with HMS, medical staff at work (FMS and SMS) got significantly higher frequency of poor sleep quality (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), insomnia (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), depressive (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.003, respectively) and anxiety symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.002, respectively). Compared with SMS, FMS were more likely to have poor sleep quality (<i>p</i> = 0.020). Besides, nurses got significantly higher percentage of poor sleep quality (OR = 1.352, <i>p</i> = 0.016) and insomnia (OR = 1.243, <i>p</i> = 0.041) than doctors. Whereas, the proportion of anxiety symptoms was increased in females than in males (OR = 2.772, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Psychological and sleep disturbances are common among medical staff at work during the COVID-19 pandemic. More psychological intervention should be administrated for FMS, especially for nurses.","Wang, Shen, Jiang, Wu, Shen, Nie, Chen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1006610","20221124","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; medical staff; sleep disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41508,""
"Research on the paths and strategies of the integrated development of culture and tourism industry in urban historical blocks","COVID-19 has brought about great impact on the global economy. Various countries have adopted different levels of spatial isolation measures to curb the spread of the epidemic. These measures not only limit the spatial flow of people and property, but also cause global anxiety and public mental health problems. Corresponding to this process, cultural demands are growing stronger and the humanistic shift in today's urban economic development also puts forward higher requirements for local culture. Historic districts are an important symbolic historical and cultural landscape of a city, and many cities regard them as important starting points for the shaping of urban characteristics and competitiveness. Taking Qingming Bridge Historical and Cultural Block in Wuxi City as an example, combined with the public's mental health needs in the context of COVID-19 and the current background of the return of humanism in urban development, and construct a more sustainable framework for the renewal and development of urban historical blocks, focusing on the integration and development of the cultural landscape and tourism in the historical block. A comprehensive analysis shows that the development of Qingming Bridge Historical and Cultural Block must be based on the comprehensive investment of ""four types of resources,"" such as culture, land, capital, and labor, and must rely on the cooperation of the ""two sectors"" of culture and tourism. By earnestly respecting the above, as well as the ""triple bottom line"" of regional ecology, economy, and society, sustainable development can be achieved.","Liang, Pan, Gu, Liu, Lei","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1016801","20221124","Qingming Bridge; cultural heritage; historic and cultural blocks; integrated development of culture and tourism; theoretical framework","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41509,""
"Pre-existing mental health disorders and fear of COVID-19 pandemic: Data from a phone survey in community-dwelling older adults recruited in the NutBrain study","COVID-19 has caused a parallel epidemic of fear, anxiety, depression, stress, and frustration, particularly among the most fragile and vulnerable individuals, such as older people and those with previous mental health disorders. The present study aims to investigate the association between pre-existing mental health disorders, particularly depressive symptoms and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and the fear of COVID-19 and to explore which cognitive domains were involved in coping with fear in older people. In April 2020, we conducted a phone-interview questionnaire on community-dwelling older adults living in Lombardy Region (Italy) who participated in the NutBrain study. At baseline, socio-demographic characteristics along with lifestyles, and medical history were recorded. Participants underwent a neuropsychological battery exploring the global cognitive function and specific cognitive domains, to detect cases of MCI. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was used for screening depressive symptoms. During the phone survey, respondents were assessed using a structured questionnaire querying about fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed multivariate logistic regression models to study the association between MCI and depressive symptomatology and fear. We also explored which cognitive domains were associated with fear. Odds Ratios (OR) with Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were estimated adjusting for potential confounders. Out of the 351 respondents (mean age 73.5 &#xb1; 6.1 years, 59.8% women, 49.1% high education), at baseline, 22.9% had MCI and 18.8% had depressive symptoms. In the multivariate analyses gender, age, and body mass index were significantly associated with the fear score. Considering different domains of fear, MCI was associated with fear of being infected themselves (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.39-4.70) while depressive symptoms were associated with fear of contagion for family members (OR 2.38, 95%CI 1.25-4.52). Impaired executive cognitive function was positively associated with the highest tertile of the fear score (OR 3.28, 95%CI 1.37-7.74) and with fear of contagion for themselves (OR 3.39, 95%CI 1.61-7.17). Older adults experienced different fear reactions, particularly when suffering from neurocognitive disorders and depressive symptoms; executive dysfunction was associated with increased fear. These results highlighted the need to pay attention to the psychological effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 to target intervention, especially among vulnerable subgroups of individuals.

"Job stress and depression among Malaysian anti-drug professionals: The moderating role of job-related coping strategies","Depression can cause negative consequences to workers' health and social functioning, such as poor work productivity, mental disorders, and suicide. Existing studies have argued that job stress is closely related to depression in many professions. Yet, information on how coping strategies play a significant role in the relationships among Malaysian anti-drug professionals is still scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine to what extent coping strategies moderate the relationship between job stress and depression among Malaysian anti-drug professionals. A total of 3,356 National Antidrug Agency (NADA) officers aged between 21 and 59 years completed online self-report measures of depression, job stress, and job-related control coping and avoidant coping behaviors. The results showed that job stress was strongly correlated with depression, and both coping strategies were found to significantly moderate the correlations. The correlations between stress and depression were stronger among participants who had higher levels of avoidant coping or those who had lower levels of control coping. To conclude, this study highlights the importance of considering job stress and coping behaviors to understand anti-drug professionals' mental health during this challenging COVID-19 pandemic.","Nordin, Dahamat Azam, Rosnon, Abu Talib","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1020947","20221124","Malaysia; avoidant coping; control coping; depression; mental health problem","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41511,""
"Behavioural and Emotional difficulties in School children during COVID 19 pandemic using narrowband dimensions of SDQ: Online survey from North? East India","Containment strategies such as lockdown during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have forced home confinement of many children. Data on psychological difficulties in children during lockdown are scarce from this part of the country. The aim of the study is to describe the burden and pattern of behavioral and emotional problems of schoolchildren during COVID-19 lockdown in a small town from Northeastern India. Caregivers of children (4-17 years old) attending English medium schools of the town were invited to participate in the study. A descriptive cross-sectional online survey using purposive nonprobability sampling was conducted between August and September 2020. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to measure behavioral and emotional difficulties of children. Responses were based on child's behaviors over the last 6 months which coincided with the ongoing lockdown period in the region. A total of 304 responses were received, among which 242 were considered for analysis. The parent-reported SDQ showed 23.1% of children having emotional or behavioral problems during the COVID-19 lockdown. Peer problems (43.4%) were the most common, followed by conduct problems (25.6%), emotional problems (23.1%), and hyperactivity (11.1%).

"Postpandemic Stress Disorder among Health Care Personnel: A Cross-Sectional Study (Silesia, Poland)","Postpandemic stress disorder (PPSD) is an unofficial term that refers to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental disorder resulting from increased stress, anxiety, and trauma associated with unpleasant life experiences. Many scientific studies indicate that symptoms of increased stress, job burnout, anxiety, and depressive disorders are associated with medical personnel performing their professional duties around COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of symptoms that may indicate the presence of PPSD symptoms-depression, anxiety, and stress-in medical personnel. <i>Material and Methods</i>. The survey included 300 people, representatives of medical personnel. The group was divided into two sections. The first section numbered 150 and consisted of personnel in direct contact with COVID-19 patients (FR); the second group also consisted of 150 medical professionals, who but no longer directly involved in helping with COVID-19 cases (SR). The survey was conducted by indirect survey method using CAWI (computer-assisted web interview). The survey used a questionnaire technique. A proprietary tool enriched with standardized psychometric scales: BDI, GAD-7, FCV-19S, and PSS-10 was used. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> statistical tests were used in the statistical processing of the data. The probability level was 0.05. Statistical inference made it clear that mental health problems that may indicate trauma are mainly present in the FR group. These symptoms decreased slightly in comparison between periods 2020 and 2021 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among first responders.

"The Role of Anti-Racist Community-Partnered Praxis in Implementing Restorative Circles Within Marginalized Communities in Southern California During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the adverse influence of structural racism and discrimination experienced by historically marginalized communities (e.g., Black, Latino/a/x, Indigenous, and transgender people). Structural racism contributes to trauma-induced health behaviors, increasing exposure to COVID-19 and restricting access to testing and vaccination. This intersection of multiple disadvantages has a negative impact on the mental health of these communities, and interventions addressing collective healing are needed in general and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The <u>S</u>hare, <u>T</u>rust, <u>O</u>rganize, and <u>P</u>artner COVID-19 California Alliance (STOP COVID-19 CA), a statewide collaborative of 11 universities and 75 community partners, includes several workgroups to address gaps in COVID-19 information, vaccine trial participation, and access. One of these workgroups, the Vaccine Hesitancy Workgroup, adopted an anti-racist community-partnered praxis to implement restorative circles in historically marginalized communities to facilitate collective healing due to structural racism and the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resulted in the development of a multilevel pre-intervention restorative process to build or strengthen community-institutional partnerships when procurement of funds has been sought prior to community partnership. This article discusses this workgroup's role in advancing health justice by providing a community-based mental health intervention to marginalized communities in Southern California while using an antiracist praxis tool to develop a successful community-institutional partnership and to live up to the vision of community-based participatory research.","Adkins-Jackson, V&#xe1;zquez, Henry-Ala, Ison, Cheney, Akingbulu, Starks, Slay, Dorsey, Marmolejo, Stafford, Wen, McCauley, Summers, Bermudez, Cruz-Roman, Castillo, Kipke, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399221132581","20221124","CBPR; antiracism; community-based; community&#x2013;academic partnerships; intervention planning; mental health; partnerships; restorative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41514,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache-related disability among young adults with migraine","The present study aimed to explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and headache-related disability among a sample of young adults with migraine. Comorbid psychological symptoms compound migraine-related disability. Due to COVID-19 pandemic procedures, many students experienced institutional closures and corresponding increases in depression, stress, and anxiety. The present study sought to examine changes in headache-related disability before (Spring and Fall of 2019) and during (Fall of 2020 and Spring 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic and whether psychological symptoms mediated such changes. A cross-sectional study at a southern U.S. university assessed 365 individuals with migraine on headache and psychological variables, comparing those surveyed before COVID-19 with another group surveyed during the pandemic. The direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 status (pre- versus during COVID-19) on headache-related disability through depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were assessed. Statistically higher levels of depression, (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;13.9 [SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.2] vs. M&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.7 [SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.7], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), anxiety (12.3 [10.0] vs. 9.7 [8.2], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01), and stress symptoms (17.6 [10.2] vs. 13.2 [7.9], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were endorsed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Only depression symptoms remained a significant mediator after controlling for headache frequency (b&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.7 [95% CI: 0.09, 1.4]). Increased depression and anxiety symptoms attenuated the improvements in disability associated with the pandemic.

Across all waves, personal care was reported most frequently followed by social activities, religious activities, and traditional/subsistence activities. Substance use combined (alcohol, nicotine, marijuana) and seeking counselling were less frequently reported, with significant differences across gender and age categories. Less than 10% of individuals reported physical violence towards children and/or other adults within the household.

"Changes in health-related quality of life scores among low-income patients on social welfare programs in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single-center repeated cross-sectional study","Low-income is one of the well-established determinants of people's health and health-related behavior, including susceptibility to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Two social welfare services are available in Japan to support financial and medical care among low-income patients: Public Assistance (PA), which provide both minimum income and medical costs; and Free/Low-Cost Medical Care (FLCMC), wherein only medical costs were covered. In this study, changes in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scores of low-income patients on PA and FLCMC, before and after COVID-19 pandemic, were described and compared against those that are not utilizing the said services (comparison group) to evaluate the contribution of social welfare services in protecting the HRQOL of the beneficiaries during the pandemic. We used repeated cross-sectional data of adult beneficiaries of FLCMC and PA, as well as those without social welfare services, who regularly visit the Kamigyo clinic in Kyoto, Japan. We collected the data from 2018 and 2021 using a questionnaire on patients' socioeconomic attributes and the Japanese version of Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The Japanese version of SF-12 can calculate the three components scores: physical health component summary (PCS), the mental health component summary (MCS), and the role-social component summary (RCS), which can be transformed to a 0-100 range scale with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Data of 200 and 174 beneficiaries in 2018 and 2021, respectively, were analyzed. Low-income patients on social welfare services had lower PCS, and RCS than the comparison group in both years. Multiple linear regression analyses with cluster-adjusted&#xa0;standard error&#xa0;estimator showed that the decline in MCS was significantly higher among FLCMC beneficiaries than in those without welfare services (Beta: -4.71, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -5.79 to -3.63, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), and a decline in MCS among PA recipients was also observed (Beta: -4.27, 95% CI: -6.67 to -1.87 p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Low-income beneficiaries of social welfare may have experienced mental health deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Do we cope similarly with different adversities? COVID-19 versus armed conflict","Varied populations may react differently to similar crises, depending on their social, cultural, and personal backgrounds; conversely, the same populations may respond differently to varied adversities. The current study aimed to examine three types of resilience (individual, community, and societal resilience) predicting six coping mechanisms (sense of danger, anxiety and depressive symptoms, well-being, hope, and morale) among the same sample of people that faced across two different adversities-COVID-19 and an armed conflict. Two repeated measurements of the same Israeli sample (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;593) were employed, through an internet panel. The research variables were examined through a structured, quantitative questionnaire that consisted of nine scales, based on validated and reliable questionnaires. Results indicated that: (a) respondents reported more difficulties in coping with the COVID-19 crisis, compared to the armed conflict, in all variables but morale. (b) similar patterns of correlations among the study variables were found in both measurements. (c) path's analysis indicated similar patterns of prediction of distress and well-being by individual and societal resilience. Use of the coping mechanism varied depending on the perception of the threat: COVID -19 is perceived as a less familiar and predictable adversity, which is harder to cope with, compared with the more familiar risk - an armed conflict, which is a recurrent threat in Israel. The correlations between the investigated psychological responses and the impacts of resilience on the coping and distress mechanism were similar in both adversities. The results indicate that respondents tend to react in a similar pattern of associations among resilience, distress, and well-being across different adversities, such as COVID and armed conflict. However, individuals tend to regard unfamiliar, less predictable adversities as more complex to cope with, compared to better-known crises. Furthermore, respondents tend to underestimate the risks of potential familiar adversities. Healthcare professionals must be aware of and understand the coping mechanisms of individuals during adversities, to appropriately design policies for the provision of medical and psychological care during varied emergencies.","Kimhi, Marciano, Eshel, Adini","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14572-0","20221124","Armed conflict; COVID-19; Distress; Resilience; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41518,""
"Learning from a crisis: a qualitative study of the impact on mothers' emotional wellbeing of changes to maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, using the National Maternity Survey 2020","Pregnancy and the postnatal period can be times of psychosocial stress and insecurity, but high quality maternity care and social support can help mothers cope with stress and feel more secure. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social and economic disruption increased rates of antenatal and postnatal stress, anxiety and depression, and also had profound impacts on the organisation of maternity services in England. This was a qualitative descriptive study of the impact of pandemic-related changes to maternity care on mothers' emotional wellbeing, using inductive thematic analysis of open text responses to the National Maternity Survey (NMS) 2020 in England. A random sample of 16,050 mothers who gave birth 11-24<sup>th</sup> May 2020 were invited to take part in the survey, and 4,611 responded, with 4,384 answering at least one open text question. There were three themes: 'Chaos: impact of uncertainty', 'Abandoned: impact of reduction in care', and 'Alone: impact of loss of social support'. Mothers valued maternity care and many experienced additional stress from chaotic changes and reduction in care during the pandemic; from health professionals' own uncertainty and anxiety; and from restrictions on essential social support during pregnancy, labour and birth. Others felt that health professionals had communicated and cared for them well despite the changes and restrictions, and these mothers felt psychologically safe. Planning for future crises should include considering how necessary adaptations to care can be implemented and communicated to minimise distress; ensuring that mothers are not deprived of social support at the time when they are at their most vulnerable; and supporting the psychological welfare of staff at a time of enormous pressure. There are also lessons for maternity care in 'normal' times: that care is highly valued, but trust is easily lost; that some mothers come into the maternity system with vulnerabilities that can be ameliorated or intensified by the attitudes of staff; that every effort should be made to welcome a mother's partner or chosen companion into maternity care; and that high quality postnatal care can make a real difference to mothers' wellbeing.","McLeish, Harrison, Quigley, Alderdice","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05208-7","20221124","COVID-19; Emotional wellbeing; Maternity care; Mothers' experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41519,""
"Exploring the impact of shielding advice on the wellbeing of individuals identified as clinically extremely vulnerable amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods evaluation","The national shielding programme was introduced by UK Government at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with individuals identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) offered advice and support to stay at home and avoid all non-essential contact. This study aimed to explore the impact and responses of ""shielding"" on the health and wellbeing of CEV individuals in Southwest England during the first COVID-19 lockdown. A two-stage mixed methods study, including a structured survey (7 August-23 October 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (26 August-30 September 2020) with a sample of individuals who had been identified as CEV and advised to ""shield"" by Bristol, North Somerset &amp; South Gloucestershire (BNSSG) Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). The survey was completed by 203 people (57% female, 54%&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;69&#xa0;years, 94% White British, 64% retired) in Southwest England identified as CEV by BNSSG CCG. Thirteen survey respondents participated in follow-up interviews (53% female, 40%&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;69&#xa0;years, 100% White British, 61% retired). Receipt of 'official' communication from NHS England or General Practitioner (GP) was considered by participants as the legitimate start of shielding. 80% of survey responders felt they received all relevant advice needed to shield, yet interviewees criticised the timing of advice and often sought supplementary information. Shielding behaviours were nuanced, adapted to suit personal circumstances, and waned over time. Few interviewees received community support, although food boxes and informal social support were obtained by some. Worrying about COVID-19 was common for survey responders (90%). Since shielding had begun, physical and mental health reportedly worsened for 35% and 42% of survey responders respectively. 21% of survey responders scored&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;10 on the PHQ-9 questionnaire indicating possible depression and 15% scored&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;10 on the GAD-7 questionnaire indicating possible anxiety. This research highlights the difficulties in providing generic messaging that is applicable and appropriate given the diversity of individuals identified as CEV and the importance of sharing tailored and timely advice to inform shielding decisions. Providing messages that reinforce self-determined action and assistance from support services could reduce the negative impact of shielding on mental health and feelings of social isolation.","Lasseter, Compston, Robin, Lambert, Hickman, Denford, Reynolds, Zhang, Cai, Zhang, Smith, Rubin, Yardley, Aml&#xf4;t, Oliver","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14368-2","20221124","COVID-19; Health policy; Infection control; Public health; Shielding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41520,""
"Parental concern for clinically vulnerable child during first 18 months of the COVID pandemic","The uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have been associated with increased parental concern. The aim of this study is to explore if this increased level of concern is associated with certain individual/household characteristics or if parents adapted to the ever-changing realities of the COVID-19 pandemic over time. This prospective study explored COVID-19 concern trajectories and associated family characteristics of 765 UK parents caring for an immunosuppressed child during the first 18 months of the pandemic using growth mixture modelling. Qualitative analysis was performed to examine in more detail the source of concern. Four different trajectories of parental COVID-19 concern were identified. Ongoing very high concern was associated with caring for children with nephrotic or respiratory disease; having a child on an organ transplant waiting list; residency in the North of England; or parental vocational inactivity. Explicit concerns voiced by the parents generally followed national trends, but vulnerable status specific concerns were also reported. Diagnosis and prescribed medication of the immunosuppressed child, geographical location, household composition, and employment status of parent were associated with the different concern trajectories. This information can be helpful in targeting psychological family care where it is most needed. Many British parents caring for a clinically vulnerable child during the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic showed high levels of concern with little sign of psychological adaptation. Consistent with findings from non-vulnerable populations, parents mentioned the impact of shielding and repeated isolation on their child's education, social life, and mental health. Unique to the clinically vulnerable population, parents were worried about child's health status, impact of delayed healthcare, and were confused by the contradictory information received from government, doctors, and media. Psychological family care can be targeted to those parents at greater risk for high levels of concern.","Driessens, Mills, Culliford, Patel, Lee, Gbesemete, Chappell, Shaunak, Faust, de Graaf","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-022-02371-7","20221123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41521,""
"Perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a qualitative study of community members and health workers in Zambia","Since introduction of the programme in April 2021, COVID-19 vaccine uptake has been low at less than 20%. This study explored community members' and health workers' perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine uptake and its influencing factors in Zambia. A qualitative study employing focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs). Sixteen primary healthcare facilities selected from Lusaka, Copperbelt, Central and Southern provinces. A total of 32 FGDs comprising local community members and 30 IDIs including health workers, traditional, religious and civic leaders (n=272). FGDs were separated based on age (youth and adults), sex (male and female) and place of residence (urban and rural). Both FGD and IDI participants agreed that vaccine uptake was low. Limited knowledge, access to information, myths and misconceptions, negative attitude, low-risk perception and supply in remote areas affected vaccine uptake. Overall, FGD participants expressed limited knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine compared with health workers. Further, FGD participants from urban sites were more aware about the vaccine than those from rural areas. Health workers perceived the vaccine to be beneficial; the benefits included prevention of infection and limiting the severity of the disease. Moreover, FGD participants from urban sites expressed a negative attitude towards the vaccine. They believed the vaccine conferred no benefits. By contrast, participants from rural communities had mixed views; they needed more information about the vaccine benefits. Participants' attitude seems to have been influenced by personal or family experience with the COVID-19 disease or vaccination; those who had experienced the disease had a more positive attitude. In contrast, most young people believed they were not at risk of the COVID-19 disease. Misinformation from social media influenced their attitude. These results provide starting points for future policies and interventions for increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","Sialubanje, Mukumbuta, Ng'andu, Sumani, Nkonkomalimba, Lyatumba, Mwale, Mpiana, Zulu, Mweempwa, Endres, Mbolela, Namumba, Peters","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058028","20221123","COVID-19; primary care; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41522,""
"Practical resiliency training for healthcare workers during COVID-19: results from a randomised controlled trial testing the Community Resiliency Model for well-being support","To introduce the Community Resiliency Model (CRM) as mental well-being support for healthcare workers working through the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Randomised controlled trial with a no treatment control group. Two large urban health systems in the Southern United States between October 2020 and June 2021. Eligible participants were currently employed as healthcare workers within the participating healthcare systems. 275 employees registered and consented electronically in response to email invitations. 253 participants completed the baseline survey necessary to be randomised and included in analyses. Participants were assigned 1:1 to the control or intervention group at the time of registration. Intervention participants were then invited to 1-hour virtual CRM class teaching skills to increase somatic awareness in the context of self and other care. Self-reported data were collected rating somatic awareness, well-being, symptoms of stress, work engagement and interprofessional teamwork. Baseline data on the total sample of 275 (53% nurses) revealed higher symptoms of stress and lower well-being than the general population. The intervention participants who attended a CRM class (56) provided follow-up survey data at 1 week (44) and 3 months (36). Significant improvement for the intervention group at 3 months was reported for the well-being measures (WHO-5, p&lt;0.0087, d=0.66; Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, p&lt;0.0004, d=0.66), teamwork measure (p&#x2264;0.0002, d=0.41) and stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, p=0.0058, d=46). Baseline results indicate mental health is a concern for healthcare workers. Post intervention findings suggest that CRM is a practical approach to support well-being for healthcare workers during a crisis such as this pandemic. The simple tools that comprise the model can serve as a starting point for or complement self-care strategies to enhance individual resilience and buffer the effects of working in an increasingly stressful work environment.","Duva, Higgins, Baird, Lawson, Murphy, Grabbe","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2022-002011","20221123","Mental health; Patient safety; Quality improvement; Safety culture; Teamwork","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41523,""
"Underfunding of Psychiatric Services for the Civilly and Criminally Committed","As illustrated by the State of Oregon, a lack of inpatient psychiatric resources for civil commitment and restoration of competency to stand trial has become an increasing problem. In California, the government of Los Angeles County has studied this problem and identified potential solutions. The proposed solutions not surprisingly involve increased resources, including additional inpatient psychiatric beds. Despite recognition of a potential solution, however, sufficient resources have not yet appeared in Los Angeles County. The study of the civil and criminal commitment systems for individuals with mental illness in Oregon and Los Angeles County reveals considerable overlap between these systems and suggests that the two systems be considered as a part of a single mental health system adversely affected by a variety of factors such as homelessness, substance use, and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Leong","https://doi.org/10.29158/JAAPL.220063-22","20221123","civil commitment; competence to stand trial; psychiatric inpatient beds","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41524,""
"Financial challenges and hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic and tobacco expenditure minimizing strategies among US adult commercial tobacco users","Commercial tobacco (CT) users employ tobacco expenditure minimizing strategies (TEMS) to manage their CT expenditures. We examined how financial challenges and hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic relate to increases in TEMS use. Data from a nationally representative sample of 1,700 U.S. adult recent former and current CT users were collected from an online panel during January-February 2021. Participants reported if they had increased use of eight TEMS to save money on CT since the pandemic, and experienced financial challenges (e.g., losing a job) and hardships (e.g., not having enough money to pay for food). The number of financial hardships experienced was counted (range: 0-6). Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between financial challenges and hardships and increased TEMS use, adjusting for demographics. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, three TEMS showed the largest increase in use by U.S. adult current and recent former CT users: cutting back (22.4%), finding less expensive places to purchase (15.6%), and buying by bulk (15.5%). Many financial challenges and hardships were consistently associated with increased uses of TEMS. Furthermore, every additional count of financial hardships was associated with higher odds of increasing use of each TEMS (AORs ranging between 1.12 and 1.23). Many CT users increased TEMS use to manage their CT expenditures when facing financial challenges and hardships during the pandemic. This could hinder CT cessation and promote relapse. Prohibiting certain TEMS (e.g., discount coupon and price promotions) may promote CT cessation among this financially vulnerable group.","Zarei, Hamilton-Moseley, Chen-Sankey, Phan, Ajith, Hacker, Jewett, Choi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107547","20221123","COVID-19; Financial challenges; Hardships; Tobacco expenditure minimizing strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41525,""

"Sentiment Analysis of Insomnia-Related Tweets via Combination of Transformers Using Dempster-Shafer Theory: A Pre-Peri COVID-19 Pandemic Retrospective Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed additional stress on population health that may result in a change of sleeping behavior. In this study, we hypothesized that using natural language processing (NLP) to explore social media would help to assess the mental health condition of people experiencing insomnia after the outbreak of COVID-19. We designed a retrospective study using public social media content from Twitter. We categorized insomnia-related tweets based on time into two intervals: pre-pandemic (01/01/2019 to 01/01/2020) and peri-pandemic (01/01/2020 to 01/01/2021). We performed sentiment analysis using pretrained transformers in conjunction with Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to classify the polarity of emotions into positive, negative, and neutral. We validated the proposed pipeline on 300 annotated tweets. Additionally, we performed temporal analysis to examine the effect of time on the users' insomnia experience, using logistic regression. We extracted 305,321 tweets containing the word insomnia (pre-pandemic, 139,561 and peri-pandemic, 165,760). The best combination of pretrained transformers via DST yielded 84% accuracy. Next, using this pipeline, we found that the odds of negative tweets (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.37-1.41, P&lt;.001) were higher peri-pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. The likelihood of negative tweets after midnight was 21% higher than before midnight (OR, 1.21; 95%CI: 1.19-1.23, P&lt;.001). Peri-pandemic, while the odds of negative tweets were 2% higher after midnight compared to before midnight (OR, 1.02; 95%CI: 1.00-1.07, P = .008), they were 43% higher (OR, 1.43; 95%CI: 1.40-1.46, P&lt;.001) peri-pandemic. The proposed novel sentiment analysis pipeline that combines pretrained transformers by DST is capable of classifying the emotion or sentiment of insomnia-related tweets. Twitter users shared more negative tweets about insomnia peri-pandemic than pre-pandemic. Future studies using a natural language processing framework could assess tweets about other psychological distress, habit changes, weight gain due to inactivity, and the effect of viral infection on sleep.","Maghsoudi, Nowakowski, Agrawal, Sharafkhaneh, Kunik, Naik, Xu, Razjouyan","https://doi.org/10.2196/41517","20221123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41527,""
"Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impacts of disease, social isolation, and financial stressors","Although research shows that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to declines in mental health, the existing research has not identified the pathways through which this decline happens. The current study identifies the distinct pathways through which COVID-induced stressors (i.e., social distancing, disease risk, and financial stressors) trigger mental distress and examines the causal impact of these stressors on mental distress. We combined evidence of objective pandemic-related stressors collected at the county level (e.g., lack of social contact, infection rates, and unemployment rates) with self-reported survey data from over 11.5 million adult respondents in the United States collected daily for eight months. We used mediation analysis to examine the extent to which the objective stressors influenced mental health by influencing individual respondents' behavior and fears. County-level, day-to-day social distancing predicted significantly greater mental distress, both directly and indirectly through its effects on individual social contacts, worries about getting ill, and concerns about finances. Economic hardships were indirectly linked to increased mental distress by elevating people's concerns about their household's finances. Disease threats were both directly linked to mental distress and indirectly through its effects on individual worries about getting ill. Although one might expect that social distancing from people outside the home would have a greater influence on people who live alone, sub-analyses based on household composition do not support this expectation. This research provides evidence consistent with the thesis that the COVID-19 pandemic harmed the mental well-being of adults in the United States and identifies specific stressors associated with the pandemic that are responsible for increasing mental distress.","Kraut, Li, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277562","20221123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41528,""
"A Shift in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant's Entry Pathway Might Explain Different Clinical Outcomes","Globally, SARS CoV-2 omicron variant has led to a notable increase of COVID-19 diagnoses, although with less severe clinical manifestations and decreased hospitalizations. The omicron wave swelled faster than previous waves, completely displacing the delta variant within weeks, and creating worldwide concern about final, successful pandemic control. Some authors contend that symptoms associated to omicron differ from 'traditional' symptoms and more closely resemble those of the common cold. One major COVID-19 symptom frequent with other variants-loss of taste and smell-is rarely present with omicron. This may be of interest, since it has also been suggested that direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the brainstem through the olfactory nerves by transsynaptic pathways could provide one explanation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to treatment. Brainstem infection by SARS-CoV-2 can severely damage the respiratory center, triggering functional deviations that affect involuntary respiration, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to treatment, the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. A shift in the omicron SARS-CoV-2 entry pathway from cell-surface fusion, triggered by TMPRSS2, to cathepsin-dependent fusion within the endosome, may affect transmission, cellular tropism and pathogenesis. Therefore, we can hypothesize that this entrance modification may impact transmission from the olfactory nerve to the brainstem through transsynaptic pathways. A decrement of the virus's direct invasion into the brainstem could diminish respiratory center dysfunction, reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need for mechanical ventilation.","Machado-Curbelo, Guti&#xe9;rrez-Gil, Gonz&#xe1;lez-Quevedo","https://doi.org/10.37757/mr2022.v24.n3-4.10","20221123","COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; ageusia; anosmia; brain stem; cathepsins; endosomes; olfactory nerve; respiratory center; smell; taste","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41529,""
"Families in Grief: Need for Psychological Care and Support for Those Who Lost Loved Ones to COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused notable changes in all areas of our lives. Pandemic-coping strategies include attention and care at various levels, for different people and in various scenarios. Death is one of the most feared consequences of COVID-19 for both patients and their families; for the latter, the grief and adaptation processes to loss require that care for grievers be an important part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grief from losses due to COVID-19 has distinctive features: it is not anticipatory (with virtually no time or progressive stages to facilitate adaptation to loss); closure or goodbyes are not possible (in-person social support decreases due to distancing to minimize risk of infection); it may affect various close relationships (a relevant predictor of complicated grief); it may imply stigmatization by peers, friends and neighbors; it is preceded by a period of absence of fluid and in-person communication between family members and the hospitalized patient; and those who break the news of the death are often professionals in red zones who are stressed and do not always have the skills or the ability to properly communicate bad news. The death of a family member from COVID-19 generally causes an unexpected crisis in the family, which is already affected by the pandemic and its daily consequences. This has prompted an analysis of COVID-19 loss on family life and how best to mitigate its consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, care and monitoring of the grief of family members and those who were close to the deceased require psychological action within a framework of comprehensive care, which demands preparation of healthcare professionals. Experiences described are taken from some actions developed in Cuba.","Grau-Abalo, Infante-Pedreira","https://doi.org/10.37757/mr2022.v24.n3-4.2","20221123","COVID-19; Cuba; Grief; SARS-CoV-2; attitude to death; death; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41530,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-national doctors in Ireland","International doctors make up nearly half of the physicians working in Ireland and are an integral part of the health service. The COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020 led to a global healthcare emergency. Resulting national lockdowns precluded travel at a time of need for family support. We aimed to measure the professional, psychosocial, and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-EEA doctors working in Ireland. An 88-item online survey of demographics, well-being, and financial resilience was circulated nationally between November 2021 and January 2022. The results were analysed using RStudio and Microsoft Excel 365. One hundred thirty-eight responses were received. Sixty-two percent of responders reported wishing to stay in Ireland long-term and 44% had applied for citizenship. Despite 80% of responders working in their desired speciality, only 36% were on a specialist training scheme. Forty-seven percent felt their career was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-three percent of respondents reported missing significant events in their home country. Over 50% reported significant mental health issues personally or in their families; however, only a minority sought professional help. Financial issues were a source of anxiety for 15% of respondents. Financial resilience was poor, 20% of respondents cited a 1-month financial reserve, 10% had a personal pension, and 9% had made a will. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifactorial negative impact on non-national doctors working in Ireland.

A cross-sectional online-based survey was conducted. The study questionnaire was composed of items related to stress during COVID-19. Descriptive analyses were used to describe the study's main outcome measures, and multiple variable regression analysis was conducted to identify the quality of life predictors. Participants' HRQoL mean scores as measured by SF-12 were 69.5 (&#xb1; 19.3) for the physical component and 58.9 (&#xb1; 21.1) for the mental component. Mean scores for depression, anxiety, and stress measured by DASS21 were 10.1, 7.8, and 11.7, respectively. The regression model showed depression (&#x3b2; = -0.76 [95%CI -0.92 to -0.59], p &lt; 0.001), stress (&#x3b2; = -1.74 [95%CI -2.53 to -0.94], p &lt; 0.001), and oral HRQoL (&#x3b2; = -1.25 [95%CI -1.95 to -0.55], p = 0.001) as statistically significant negative predictors for HRQoL. Finally, family income was identified as positive significant predictor for HRQoL (&#x3b2; = 2.51 [95%CI 0.06 to 4.95], p = 0.045). This study found that patients with dental issues had a low quality of life and a high level of mental health symptoms during COVID-19 in Jordan.

Methods The study includes 115 second- and third-generation offspring at high or low risk for depression based on the presence or absence of major depressive disorder in the first generation. Offspring were followed longitudinally using semistructured clinical interviews blinded to their familial risk; putamen structure, neuronal integrity, and functional activation were indexed by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio), and functional MRI activity modulated by valence and arousal components of a mood induction task, respectively. Results After adjusting for covariates, the high-risk individuals had lower putamen volume (standardized betas, ÃŸ-leftÂ =Â -0.17, ÃŸ-rightÂ =Â -0.15, psÂ = .002), N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio (ÃŸ-left=Â -0.40, ÃŸ-right=Â -0.37, ps < .0001), and activation modulated by valence (ÃŸ-leftÂ =Â -0.22, ÃŸ-rightÂ =Â -0.27, ps < .05) than low-risk individuals. Volume differences were greater at younger ages, and N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio differences were greater at older ages. Lower putamen volume also predicted major depressive disorder episodes up to 8 years after the scan (ÃŸ-leftÂ =Â -0.72, pÂ = .013; ÃŸ-rightÂ =Â -0.83, pÂ = .037). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and task functional MRI measures were modestly correlated (0.27 = r = 0.33). Conclusions Findings demonstrate abnormalities in putamen structure and function in individuals at high risk for major depressive disorder. Future studies should focus on this region as a potential biomarker for depressive illness, noting meanwhile that differences attributable to family history may peak at different ages based on which MRI modality is being used to assay them.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.06.035","20221215","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41533,""

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Anxiety and Depression in South Korea and the United States: A Network Analysis","Background. COVID-19 resulted in dramatic increases in anxiety and depression. Using network analysis, we sought to investigate how COVID-19-related factors are associated with internalizing symptoms in South Korea and the United States. Methods. During the COVID-19 lockdown period, 1008 college students (South Korea, n = 660; U.S., n = 348) responded to an online survey. Our model included depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), and COVID-19-related factors (e.g., COVID-19-related traumatic stress, pandemic concerns). Results. A mixed graphical model revealed that COVID-19-related traumatic stress was specifically linked to â€œNegative future anticipationâ€ in the anxiety clusters in both countries. â€œUncontrollable worryâ€ and â€œExcessive worryâ€ symptoms showed the highest centrality and predictability value in both South Korea and the U.S., suggesting that worry-related symptoms were the most influential in maintaining the whole (pandemic to internalizing symptoms) network in both countries. A network comparison test revealed no significant differences in network structure and overall connectivity between the networks of the two countries. Conclusions. These results suggest new insights into the common potential pathway between the pandemic and internalizing symptoms in South Korea and the U.S. In addition, our findings imply that targeting worry-related symptoms could maximize the control of the pandemic-to-symptom network.","Mijeong Park et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01FE-1F7-D09","20221124","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; depression; anxiety disorder; cross-cultural; network analysis; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","",41537,""
"Predictive factors of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students: a cross-cultural study in six Ibero-American countries","Previous studies during the Covid-19 pandemic reported particularly high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students, suggesting that they can be a vulnerable group at greater risk than the general population for developing psychological disorders in situations of confinement. However, the impact varied between countries and individuals, concluding that sociocultural and individual differences could condition this impact. Based on this evidence, the psychological impact of the pandemic on Ibero-American students was investigated. A battery of questionnaires was administered to a large sample of 7601 university students (72% female) from six different Spanish-speaking countries: Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain, Mexico, and Uruguay and were compared with a sample of general population (n = 51211). Descriptive analyses indicated a high prevalence (46.15%) of distress among university students, independent of country and significantly higher than in general population (28.27%). Greater feelings of loneliness and greater neuroticism were significantly associated with anxiety, depression, and somatisation. Likewise, male gender and higher levels of resilience resulted as protective factors, while posttraumatic growth was also higher in men and was associated with higher levels of resilience, perceived competence, and responsibility. The data suggest the need to consider individual risk factors such as being a woman, presenting higher levels of neuroticism and loneliness in understanding the psychological impact of the pandemic in university students. It is concluded that universities should offer specific interventions to address mental health problems, complementary to the health system of each country to manage the added complications of the crisis events on studentsâ€™ mental health.","MarÃ­a P.
