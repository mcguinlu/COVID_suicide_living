"Effects of medical school on mental health and sleep habits","BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVES: This study aims to define changes in anxiety and depression among medical students while evaluating the association of sleep habits and other risk factors, including exercise habits and a diagnosis of chronic disease. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was also evaluated. DESIGN: A cohort of first- and second-year medical students was evaluated longitudinally using survey methods to quantify changes from pre-medical school and summer break to each semester in medical school throughout years one and two. METHODS: Data was analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) on the numeric responses of General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Additional assessments evaluated exercise habits, chronic disease, and impact of COVID-19 Pandemic. RESULTS: Depression, anxiety, and sleep habits displayed a cyclical change that was associated with the academic cycle. The COVID-19 pandemic was never significant. Medical students who had a chronic disease diagnosis had increased severity. Exercise did not play a role. CONCLUSION: The main driver for depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality was the academic cycle, while the COVID-19 pandemic did not have an impact on mental health.","Blake McKinley; Bryan Daines; Mitchell Allen; Kayd Pulsipher; Isain Zapata; Benjamin Wilde","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.13.22269102","20220114","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25536,""
"Socioeconomic position, worry and psychosomatic problems among students in Sweden in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the lives of young people and increased the risks for deteriorated health and widening health gaps. Aim: The aim is to analyse the associations between socioeconomic position and worry triggered by the pandemic and their associations with psychosomatic problems. Methods: From December 2020 to March 2021, 3068 16-17 years old students in Sweden completed a questionnaire about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their schooling and everyday life. The response rate was 32 %, and the data were therefore weighted based on sociodemographic factors to take account of potential bias caused by the non-responses. During the spring semester of 2020, around two-thirds of the students also responded to questions about their psychosomatic health. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to analyse the associations between socioeconomic position (parental education) and worry about different personal and family issues. Binary logistic regression was used to analyse the association between worry and psychosomatic problems. Results: The association between socioeconomic position and worry showed a consistent pattern. Across almost all worry themes, the odds of experiencing worry often or always was higher for students with lower educated parents compared to higher educated parents. The odds for having to worry often/always about family finances was four times higher among students in the former group than the latter, controlling for sex. The magnitude of the association was about the same for worry about parental unemployment. In addition, also worry about personal and parental illness caused by COVID-19 showed strong associations with socioeconomic position. Worry was also clearly associated with students' psychosomatic health. Students who often or always experienced worry were more likely to report psychosomatic problems. Worries for personal and parental illness and family finances showed the highest odds ratios, controlling sex and parental education. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that worry related to COVID-19 about personal and family issues during the pandemic are socially structured. The socioeconomic position is associated with worry in similar ways that are common for health and health-related behaviors. Negative impacts of the pandemic are more common among students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds compared to higher ones. In addition, the significant associations between different worry themes and psychosomatic problems among students are noticeable. While the current study does not allow for conclusions about causality, the results indicate that experiences of worry during the pandemic may increase the risk of deteriorated mental health and inequalities among young people.","Hagquist, C.; Gustafsson, J.

"Validation, Factorial Invariance, and Latent Mean Differences Across Sex of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) in Ecuadorian University Sample","Public Significance Statement The present study validated a Spanish and online version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) among Ecuadorian university students. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in the educational context is high. Consequently, the present study has confirmed the factorial invariance and the nonexistence of statistically significant differences in the latent scores across sex. These findings allow the possibility of measuring the scores of depression, anxiety, and stress without bias in a new reality provoked by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in which paper questionnaires could be replaced by online questionnaires. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression is a topic of concern for general population but also for the educational context. Consequently, due to the great rates of anxiety, depression, and stress problems in undergraduates, the use of a standardized instrument to accurately detect these constructs in the university context is needed. As a result, the present study pretends to examine the psychometric characteristics of the online version of the short Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) in Ecuadorian university sample, including the validation, and the testing of factorial invariance and latent differences analyses based on sex. The total of individuals that formed the sample were 3,060 students (M (age) = 22.7, SD = 2.46) from the Central University of Ecuador, and they participated via the internet, fulfilling the 21 items that formed the DASS-21. Regarding the results, the three-factor structure of the online version of the DASS-21 was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, adequate internal consistency values and factorial invariance based on sex were confirmed, and no statistically significant latent mean differences in the scale across sex were found. In consequence, the results of the current investigation give a reliable, consistent, and online measure of stress, anxiety, and depression, which could help to assess and treat emotional problems originated among the Ecuadorian university population.","Sanmartin, R.; Suria-Martinez, R.; Lopez-Lopez, M.

"Mental Health in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic Current Knowledge and Implications From a European Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most serious health and economic crises of the 21st century. From a psychological point of view, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences can be conceptualized as a multidimensional and potentially toxic stressor for mental health in the general population. This selective literature review provides an overview of longitudinal studies published until June 2021 that have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the European population. Risk and protective factors identified in the studies are summarized. Forty-two studies that met inclusion and search criteria (COVID-19, mental health, longitudinal, and Europe) in PubMed, Psyclnfo, and Web of Science databases indicate differential effects of the pandemic on mental distress, depression, and anxiety, depending on samples and methods used. Age-specific (e.g., young age), social (e.g., female, ethnical minority, Loneliness), as well as physical and mental health-related factors (e.g., pre-pandemic illness) were identified as risk factors for poor mental health. The studies point to several protective factors such as social support, higher cognitive ability, resilience, and self-efficacy. Increasing evidence supports the assumption of the pandemic being a multidimensional stressor on mental health, with some populations appearing more vulnerable than others, although inconsistencies arise. Whether the pandemic will lead to an increase in the prevalence of mental disorders is an open question. Further high-quality longitudinal and multi-national studies and meta-analyses are needed to draw the complete picture of the consequences of the pandemic on mental health.","Wirkner, J.; Christiansen, H.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Luken, U.; Wurm, S.; Schneider, S.; Brakemeier, E.

"The Relationship Between Fear of COVID-19 and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress A Meta-Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant effects on public health. Previous studies showed that the fear of COVID-19 was positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress. This study aims to compile and meta-analyze the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression, anxiety, and stress among the general population. The studies published between March 2020 and June 2021 were scanned from various databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science [ISI], and SCOPUS). Asa result of the literature search, 746 studies were reached, 88 studies were found suitable, and 21 met the inclusion criteria. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA Version 3.0) and metafor package in P were used for analyses. A strong relationship was observed between the fear of COVID-19 and anxiety (r = .55, p &lt; .001);there were moderate relationships between the fear of COVID-19 and depression (r = .34, p &lt; .001) and stress (r = .44, p &lt; .001). All these relationships were significant. The results showed that the relationships between the fear of COVID-19 and depression, anxiety, and stress had a high level of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the average of the sample age was a significant predictor of the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety. However, other covariates (female proportion and culture) were not statistically significant for the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety. None of these covariates was significant predictors of the relationship between fear of COVID-19 with depression and stress. Although the current meta-analysis has some limitations, the results revealed that the fear of COVID-19 is associated with mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress.","Erbicer, E.

"Emotional and Behavioral Responses to COVID-19","This review appraises evidence for the role of personality in COVID-19 related emotions and behaviors. Three key models of personality are considered: the Five-factor Model, HEXACO model, and Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). In tine with personality research, more generally, most studies focus on the Five-Factor model. Key findings are that neuroticism is most associated with poor mental health, and extraversion is associated with a reluctance to socially isolate. Conscientiousness predicts compliance with safety guidelines but also with fewer prosocial behaviors, particularly stockpiling. Research within the HEXACO framework largely confirms these findings, especially for emotionality and mental health. The additional HEXACO Honesty-Humility factor is found to be associated with prosocial views and abstention from panic buying. Studies based on the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality indicate emotional conflict as people wish to stay safe white maintaining a sense of normality. Behavioral compliance is driven by activation in the Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS: fear-related) and the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS;anxiety-related). The Behavioral Approach System (BAS) is implicated in approach-driven behaviors such as avoiding infection. These findings have implications for health communications and post-pandemic support.","Bacon, A. M.; Krupic, D.; Caki, N.; Corr, P.

"Psychological Science Into Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The public health outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has hit all aspects of life as we know it. We found ourselves trying to solve several concurrent crises that have afflicted us. The European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA) launched the Psychologists' Support Hub to share resources among its members and beyond and promote the continuing adoption of psychological science to battle the pandemic. In the greater context of evidence-based practice (EBP), the best available evidence is what we turn to for help in our decision-making on how best to address different challenges. However, there are challenges in implementing EBP when the science is limited, and we are still expected to be effective and efficient as professionals. The article outlines the need for EBP during the pandemic. Three vignettes display how that can be done while identifying obstacles and recommending ways forward in the future. The first one relates to the development of e-mental health services in Belgium following the March 2020 lockdown. The second describes addressing the needs of older adults in Croatia when it was hit by two crises simultaneously - the March 2020 lockdown and a destructive earthquake. The third looks at how targeted community-based interventions in Norway directed at social change can positively impact times of crisis. Overall, the pandemic presents a unique opportunity for professional growth for researchers, trainers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. EFPA can play a pivotal role in EBP adoption.","Karayianni, E.; Van Daele, T.; Despot-Lucanin, J.; Lopizic, J.; Carr, N.","https://doi.org/10.1027/1016-9040/a000458","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: European Psychologist; 26(4):387-396, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25542,""
"The impact of the COVID pandemic on primary care diabetes services in the UK: A cross-sectional national survey of views of health professionals delivering diabetes care","Background Healthcare systems worldwide have been adversely affected by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There has been a substantial decrease in admissions for acute medical conditions with longer delays between the onset of the symptoms and hospital treatment compared to the pre-pandemic period. The impact of the COVID pandemic on primary care services is uncertain. Aim Using an online survey, we examined the impact of the COVID pandemic on primary care diabetes services in the UK. Methods An online survey was developed by the Primary Care Diabetes Society research group and administered to healthcare and allied health professionals delivering diabetes care in the UK from January to May 2021. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results Of the 1070 professionals surveyed, 975 (91.1%) completed the questionnaire. Most respondents were nurses or nurse practitioners (59.7%) and doctors (32.9%). The mean age of respondents was 52 years and 79% were female. The majority of respondents felt overloaded with work (71.2%) or emotionally drained at the end of a working day (79.1%) compared with the pre-pandemic period. Being a doctor and worried about infecting a family member with the Coronavirus were each associated with an increased odds of being substantially overworked or emotionally drained: (OR = 2.52;95% CI, 1.25-5.07) and (OR = 2.05;95% CI, 1.24â€“3.39), respectively. The most common consultation method used to provide diabetes care during the pandemic was telephone consultation (92.0%). Overall 79.1% of respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic had had moderate to significant impact on their practice's ability to provide routine diabetes care;70.6% of respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic had had moderate to significant impact on their practice's ability to provide routine health checks or screening for type 2 diabetes and approximately half of respondents (48.3%) reported encountering mental health concerns in people with diabetes. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impact on the ability of healthcare professionals and their practices to deliver routine diabetes care. Failure to restore primary care provision urgently and safely to at least pre-pandemic levels in a sustainable manner may lead to emotionally drained and overworked workforce in primary care, place additional burden on the already overburdened healthcare system and worse outcomes for patients.","Seidu, Samuel, Hambling, Clare, Holmes, Patrick, Fernando, Kevin, Campbell, Nigel S.; Davies, Sarah, Khunti, Kamlesh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2021.12.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Primary Care Diabetes;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25543,""
"A Deep Learning-Based Comparative Study to Track Mental Depression from EEG Data","Background Modern day's society is engaged in commitment-based and time-bound jobs. This invites tension and mental depression among many people who are not able to cope up with this type of working environment. Cases of mental depression are increasing day by day all over the world. Recently, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has added further fuel to the fire. In many countries, the ratio between patients with mental depression and psychiatrists or psychologists is remarkably poor. Under such a situation, the design, and development of an expert system by exploiting the hidden power of various deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques can solve the problem up to a greater extent. Methodology Each deep learning and machine learning technique has got its advantages and disadvantages to handle different classification problems. In this article four neural network-based deep learning architectures namely MLP, CNN, RNN, RNN with LSTM, and two Supervised Machine Learning Techniques such as SVM and LR are implemented to investigate and compare their suitability to track the mental depression from EEG Data. Result Among Neural Network-Based Deep Learning techniques RNN model has achieved the highest accuracy with 97.50 % in Training Set and 96.50 % in the Testing set respectively. It has been followed with RNN with LSTM model when there were 40% data in the Testing Set. Whereas both the Supervised Machine Learning Models namely SVM and LR have outperformed with 100.00 % accuracies in Training Phase and approximately 97.25 % accuracies in Testing Phase respectively. Conclusion This investigation and comparison-oriented study establish the suitability of RNN, RNN with LSTM, SVM and LR model to track mental depression from EEG data. This type of comparative research using Machine Learning and Deep learning architectures must be framed out on this topic to finalize the design and development of an expert system for the automatic detection of depression from EEG data.","Sarkar, Avik, Singh, Ankita, Chakraborty, Rakhi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuri.2022.100039","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Neuroscience Informatics;: 100039, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25544,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Lifestyle in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease: A Cross-sectional Study","Background Social isolation has been one of the main strategies to prevent the spread of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). However, the impact of social isolation on the lifestyle of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and claudication symptoms remains unclear. Objectives To analyze the perceptions of patients with PAD of the impact of social isolation provoked by COVID-19 pandemic on health lifestyle. Design Cross-sectional. Setting The database of studies developed by our group involving patients with PAD from public hospitals in SÃ£o Paulo. Methods In this cross-sectional survey study, 136 patients with PAD (61% men, 68Â±9 years old, 0.55Â±0.17 ankle-brachial index, 82.4% with a PAD diagnosis =5 years old) were included. Health lifestyle factors were assessed through a telephone interview using a questionnaire containing questions related to: (a) COVID-19 personal care;(b) mental health;(c) health risk habits;(d) eating behavior;(e) lifestyle;(f) physical activity;(g) overall health;and (h) peripheral artery disease health care. Results The majority of patients self-reported spending more time watching TV and sitting during the COVID-19 pandemic and only 28.7% were practicing physical exercise. Anxiety and unhappiness were the most prevalent feelings self-reported among patients and 43.4% reported a decline in walking capacity. Conclusion Most patients with PAD self-reported increased sedentary behavior, lower physical activity level, and worse physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it is necessary to adopt strategies to improve the quality of life of these patients during this period.","Ritti-Dias, Raphael Mendes, Correia, Marilia de Almeida, de Carvalho, Juliana Ferreira, Braghieri, Heloisa Amaral, Wolosker, Nelson, Cucato, Gabriel Grizzo, Kanegusuku, HÃ©lcio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvn.2022.01.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Vascular Nursing;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25545,""
"Intolerance of COVID-19-related uncertainty and depressive and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic: A longitudinal study in Argentina","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a novel, unprecedented situation that has created considerable uncertainty due in part to the unpredictability of the future situation. Intolerance of Uncertainty is the inability to withstand negative uncertain situations, and predisposes people to overestimate threats and to develop psychopathological symptoms. The aim of this study was to longitudinally analyze the relationship between intolerance of COVID-19-related uncertainty and anxiety and depression symptoms. A non-probabilistic online snowball sampling method was used. For the study, 1230 Argentine adults (216 men;1005 women;9 other genders;mean age = 41.62;SD = 13.81) were recruited to complete three open-access surveys at three different time points: (1) between May 6 and June 1, 2020, (2) between August 8 and 13, 2020, and (3) between April 17 and 23, 2021. The results suggest that anxiety and depressive symptoms increase over time, and that intolerance of uncertainty is a predictor of this variability even up to eleven months after the initial assessment. Gender- and age- related effects were also observed (women and young people reported more psychopathological symptoms). The findings suggest the importance of intolerance of uncertainty for mental health and the importance of this type of study for understanding the psychological impact of the pandemic.","Macarena V, del-Valle, HernÃ¡n, LÃ³pez-Morales, MarÃ­a Laura, AndrÃ©s, MatÃ­as, Yerro-Avincetto, Rosario, Gelpi Trudo, SebastiÃ¡n, Urquijo, Lorena, Canet-Juric","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2022.102531","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;: 102531, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25546,""
"Brief, parent-led, transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral teletherapy for youth with emotional problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased stress, anxiety, and depression in children. A six-session, parent-led, transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral teletherapy program was adapted from an established protocol to help youth aged between 5 and 13 years manage emotional problems during the pandemic. Methods One-hundred twenty-nine parents of youth struggling with emotional problems during the COVID-19 pandemic participated in the program. Parents reported on their children's psychosocial functioning before and after treatment using validated assessments. They also reported on treatment satisfaction. Clinician-rated global improvement was assessed at each session to determine clinically significant treatment response. Results Significant improvements in parent proxy-reported anxiety (dÂ =Â .56), depression (dÂ =Â .69), stress (dÂ =Â .61), anger (dÂ =Â .69), family relationships (dÂ =Â .32), and COVID-19-related distress (dÂ =Â 1.08) were found, with 62% of participants who completed the program being classified as treatment responders. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. Limitations This study was limited by use of primarily parent-report assessments and a lack of a control group. Conclusions Brief, parent-led, transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral teletherapy appeared to be an effective way to help youth cope with the pandemic and may be a scalable framework in response to large-scale mental health crises.","Guzick, Andrew G.; Leong, Alicia W.; Dickinson, Emily M.; Schneider, Sophie C.; Zopatti, Katherine, Manis, Jamie, Meinert, Allison C.; Barth, Alexandra M.; Perez, Mayra, Campo, Daphne M.; Weinzimmer, Saira A.; Cepeda, Sandra L.; Mathai, David, Shah, Asim, Goodman, Wayne K.; Salloum, Alison, Kennedy, Sarah, Ehrenreich-May, Jill, Storch, Eric A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.034","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25547,""
"Changing air pollution and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lesson learned and future equity concerns of post-COVID recovery","COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and quarantines have led to significant industrial slowdowns among the worldâ€™s major emitters of air pollutants, with resulting decreases to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in nations such as China, India and US, deemed to be major sources of global CO2 emissions, as well. However, there are major concerns that these decreases in atmospheric pollution can be hampered as economies are reactivated. Historically, countries have weakened environmental legislations following economic slowdown to encourage renewed economic growth. Such a policy response now will likely have disproportionate impacts on global indigenous people and marginalized groups within countries, who have already faced disproportionate impacts from COVID-19 and environmental pollution. Our â€œnew normalâ€ remain nimble enough to allow us to fine-tune our interventions, research tools and solutions-oriented research to quickly enough to stay ahead of the pandemic trajectory in the face of air pollution and climate change. Societal and behavioral changes to reduce these anthropogenic cumulative stressors should be advocated, while prioritizing the public health of marginalized groups around the world, promoting new approaches to champion environmental health along with educational programs addressed to the population. Bold government decisions can restart economies while pre-empting future inequities and committing to environmental protection in an era of COVID-19 and global change.","Alava, Juan JosÃ©, Singh, Gerald G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2022.01.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Environmental Science & Policy;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25548,""

The approach suggested in this paper aims to identify the average mental health effect on the overall population for the first and second waves of the pandemic. Using a linear fixed-effects model specification, we report robust findings that the average mental health in the UK is substantially reduced by the local and global pandemic. The total reduction in the average mental health of the UK population during our sampling period (April - June, 2020) is about 1.5% for the local and 2.4% for the global cases, which sum up to a 3.9% reduction. Extrapolating the total reduction in average mental health during the first wave of the pandemic (February - September, 2020) sums up to 2.8% while the effect is as large as 9.6% for the first and second waves together, which covers roughly a year since the start. An extensive robustness check suggests that the findings are stable with respect to alternative pandemic datasets, measures, estimators, functional forms, and time functions. The characteristics of the most vulnerable individuals (e.g., elderly, chronic illness, and job security concerns) and their household conditions (e.g., living alone and no private space) are explored. The paper discusses on the implications of the results.","Akay, Alpaslan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2021.101095","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Economics & Human Biology;: 101095, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25550,""
"Acceleration of Opioid-Related EMS Runs in the Spring of 2020: The National Emergency Medical Services Information System Data for 2018-2020","Background State- and county-level reports suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the opioid crisis. We examined US national trends of nonfatal opioid overdose in 2020 in comparison to pre-COVID years 2018-2019. Methods We used National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) data to conduct a temporal analysis from 2018-2020. Opioid-related EMS run was defined using five scenarios of naloxone administration. To determine annual patterns and slope inflection points, we used the Prophet model of the time series analysis. Linear slopes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for pre-stay-at-home (pre-SaH) and SaH periods in 2020 and compared to the slopes during the same time in 2018-2019. Three cut-points for SaH start were considered: March 19, 24, and 29. Results We identified 91,065, 144,802, and 242,904 opioid-related EMS runs in 2018-2020, respectively. In 2020, opioid-related runs increased in January-June, with a pronounced acceleration in March, which coincides with the stay-at-home (SaH) orders. In both 2018 and 2019, opioid-related runs increased in January-August without the spring acceleration. In 2020, weekly increases (95% CI) during SaH for all examined cut-points were significantly greater than in pre-SaH: 18.09 (16.03-20.16) vs. 6.44 (3.42-9.47) for March 19, 17.77 (15.57-19.98) vs. 4.85 (2.07-7.64) for March 24, 18.03 (15.68-20.39) vs. 4.97(2.4-7.54) for March 29. No significant difference was found between these periods in 2018-2019. Conclusions The acceleration of opioid-related EMS runs during the SaH period of 2020 suggests that EMS data may serve as an early warning system for local health jurisdictions to deploy harm reduction/prevention resources.","Khare, Akshat, Sidana, Arsh, Mohemmed, Ammar, Allicock, Denisha Markelle, Waterstone, Anna, Zimmer, Matthew Aaron, Ilâ€™yasova, Dora","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109271","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109271, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25551,""
"A first remotely-delivered guided brief intervention to reduce intrusive memories of psychological trauma for healthcare staff working during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","Addressing the mental health needs of healthcare staff exposed to psychologically traumatic events at work during the COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing global priority. We need to swiftly develop interventions to target the psychological consequences (e.g., persistent intrusive memories of trauma). Interventions for healthcare staff must be brief, flexible, fitted around the reality and demands of working life under the pandemic, and repeatable during ongoing/further trauma exposure. Intervention delivery during the pandemic should be remote to mitigate risk of infection;e.g., here using a blend of digitalized self-administered materials (e.g., video instructions) and guided (remote) support from a researcher. This parallel groups, two-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with healthcare staff working during the COVID-19 pandemic is the first evaluation of whether a digitalized form of a brief cognitive task intervention, which is remotely-delivered (guided), reduces intrusive memories. Healthcare staff (target NÂ =Â 130 completers) who experience intrusive memories of work-related traumatic event(s) during the COVID-19 pandemic (=2 in the week before inclusion) will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either the cognitive task intervention or an active (attention placebo) control, and followed up at 1-week, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months post-intervention. The primary outcome will be the number of intrusive memories reported during Week 5;secondary and other outcomes include the number of intrusive memories reported during Week 1, and other intrusive symptoms. Findings will inform further development and dissemination of a brief cognitive task intervention to target intrusive memories.","Singh, Laura, Kanstrup, Marie, Gamble, Beau, Geranmayeh, Anahita, GÃ¶ransson, Katarina E.; Rudman, Ann, Dahl, Oili, LindstrÃ¶m, Veronica, HÃ¶rberg, Anna, Holmes, Emily A.; Moulds, Michelle L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2022.100884","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications;: 100884, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25552,""
"Mental health experiences during a COVID19-tailored weight management programme: A qualitative study","Background: Previous research reports a lack of mental health support in weight management services. Evidence suggests that adults with overweight or obesity are at a greater risk of mental ill-health during the COVID-19 pandemic than those without a pre-existing condition, amplifying the need for mental health support. With usual support services limited due to COVID-restrictions, an acceptance-based programme (SWiM-C: Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19) was developed to remotely support adults with overweight or obesity with weight management and mental health. There is limited evidence showing how effectively acceptance-based weight management programmes support mental health, especially when delivered remotely. We aimed to explore mental health experiences during SWiM-C and looked to identify how SWiM-C could be optimised to better support mental health. Methods: Twenty participants and four providers took part in semi-structured telephone interviews. Participant interviews explored programme acceptability, SWiM-C benefits and disadvantages, and mental health experiences. Provider interviews explored experiences of supporting participants (including supporting mental health), programme acceptability, training and support, and their overall role in SWiM-C. Data for each group were analysed separately and then narratively integrated. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify patterns of meaning across the dataset relevant to mental health experiences. Results: Analysis of the SWiM-C participant dataset resulted in themes exploring pre-existing beliefs about mental health/weight management, factors influencing mental health, how the impacts of mental health were managed, and adaptations to optimise SWiM-C. Analysis of the provider dataset is due to commence shortly, with study completion anticipated by August 2021. Conclusions: We explore the mental health experiences of adults with overweight or obesity participating in the SWiM-C study. Specifically, we study the complexity of factors influencing mental health, the various impacts of mental health, and the degree of support from the SWiM-C programme. Findings may provide direction for health professionals, policymakers, and researchers by identifying how and where steps can be taken to better support mental health.","Jones, R.; Richards, R.; Palat, R.; Vincent, A.; Duschinsky, R.; Ahern, A.","https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23329","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Obesity; 29(SUPPL 2):125, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25553,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on seeking medical care for patients with chronic diseases","Introduction: Patients with many comorbidities and chronic conditions have been severely affected by the outbreak, as their outcomes are the worst. Their routine of seeking medical care during Covid-19 is thought to be changed, in addition to the psychological impact of the pandemic. Research Question or Hypothesis: Patients with chronic conditions may suffered from anxiety, depression, and stress during covid-19, which their pattern of seeking medical care was changed Study Design: cross-secttional study Methods: In March 2021, a cross-sectional, web-based survey of patients with chronic diseases was conducted. 1037 eligible patients were assessed for psychological disorders, primarily depression, stress, and anxiety, using the DASS-21 scale, as well as their pattern of receiving medical care during Covid-19. Results: Diabetes and hypertension accounted for 62.5 percent of patients with chronic diseases, 17.8 percent for hypertension alone, 8.6 percent for diabetes, and 11.6 percent for other chronic diseases. During the pandemic, 52.5 percent of patients with chronic diseases were depressed, 57.9 percent were anxious, and 35.6 percent were stressed. Patients with chronic disease who had moderate to severe depression, moderate to severe anxiety, or moderate to severe stress were significantly more likely to have no follow-up for their chronic conditions (34.9 percent vs. 45.1 percent p=0.001), (43.6 percent vs. 53.8 percent p=0.001), and (14.9 percent vs. 34.8 percent p=0.001), respectively Conclusion: Patients with chronic conditions experienced significant anxiety, depression, and stress during covid-19, which changed their pattern of seeking medical care, and the majority of them receiving no follow-up for their chronic condition.","Salah, H.; Khodary, A.; Shaimaa Ibrahim, A.

"One-year changes in the prevalence and positive psychological correlates of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among medical science students in northeast of Iran","Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a significant psychological burden on many across society especially students studying medical sciences. This study intended to investigate the one-year changes in the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among medical science students. Methods A cross-sectional study in Shahroud, Iran administering a convenience sampling method (January to February 2021). Online self-reported questionnaires included Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Paloutzian-Ellison Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire, Diener's Satisfaction with Life Scale and the University Student Depression Inventory. Data analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (Independent t-test and Multiple Regression Analysis). Results A total of 306 medical science students were investigated in this study. The mean scores 1 year after the outbreak of COVID-19 were for depression (81.25?Â±?26.04), spiritual well-being (80.98?Â±?18.06), self-esteem (26.89?Â±?2.20), and life satisfaction (19.68?Â±?6.81). The results indicated that depression mean score was significantly higher in post outbreak assessment (71.92?Â±?22.94 vs 81.25?Â±?26.04) (P?&lt;?.001). Fifty percentage of changes in depression can be predicted by studied variables. A high score of depression was directly associated with a higher level of self-esteem. Moreover, increased interest in the field, scores of spiritual well-being, and life satisfaction were inversely and significantly associated with depression. Conclusions Iran's education system has been significantly affected, with the addition to the COVID-19 pandemic imposing a psychological burden such as depression, exacerbating this within medical science students compared to a year ago. Spiritual well-being and life satisfaction as positive psychology constructs were recognized as protective factors against depression during the pandemic. Spiritual and social support should be integrated in psychological interventions within university settings for medical science students.","Mirhosseini, Seyedmohammad, Grimwood, Samuel, Dadgari, Ali, Basirinezhad, Mohammad Hasan, Montazeri, Rasoul, Ebrahimi, Hossein","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.490","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Health Science Reports; 5(1):e490, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25555,""

"Emotional distress and coping strategies in COVID-19 anxiety","The present study aims to identify psychological factors affected by the COVID-19 pandemic given the information we have about reactions during previous pandemics, which documented features of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We investigated the relationship between health anxiety, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and coping mechanisms in the general population and among students. The study was conducted on Romanian population (n = 759), aged between 18â€“70Â years old (M = 33.24), general population (n = 485), and students (n = 274). The results showed that the general population is more anxious when confronted with the new virus compared to students (t (757) = 1.902, p &lt; .05, p = .029). Following the analysis of the hierarchical regression, the results revealed that when controlling the health anxiety variable, a high level of anxiety symptoms and stress, and a low level of depression symptoms could predict anxiety for COVID-19 (R2 = .070, Fchange(3, 754) = 16.759, p <U+02C2> .001). Also, we found that maladaptive strategies are the ones which explain the relationship between health anxiety and COVID-19-related anxiety (95% CI = .011 â€“ .057). The results of this study bring extra knowledge and shed new light on the psychological aspects of the current sanitary crisis and contribute to the understanding of the way people relate to this disease.","Vintila, Mona, Tudorel, Otilia Ioana, Stefanut, Adelina, Ivanoff, Alexandra, Bucur, Venera","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emotional+distress+and+coping+strategies+in+COVID-19+anxiety","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Current psychology (New Brunswick, N.J.);: 1-10, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25558,""
"Mental health & maltreatment risk of children with special educational needs during COVID-19","Background Children with special educational needs (SEN) are more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic with risk of poor mental wellbeing and child maltreatment. Objective To examine the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children with SEN and their maltreatment risk. Participants and setting 417 children with SEN studying at special schools and 25,427 children with typical development (TD) studying at mainstream schools completed an online survey in April 2020 in Hong Kong during school closures due to COVID-19. Method Emotional/behavioural difficulties, quality of life and parental stress of children with SEN were compared with typically developed children using mixed effect model. Linear regression analyses were performed to explore factors associated with child emotional/behavioural difficulties and parental stress during the pandemic. Chi-square test was performed to detect the differences in maltreatment risk before and during COVID-19. Results Children with SEN had significantly poorer overall quality of life (68.05 vs 80.65, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). 23.5% of children had at least one episode of severe physical assault and 1.9% experienced very severe physical assault during COVID-19. Rates of physical assault increased significantly (59.8% vs. 71.2% pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) while children with mental disorders had increased risk of severe physical assault comparing to those without mental disorders (RRÂ =Â 1.58, <U+AB53>2Â =Â 5.19 pÂ =Â 0.023). Conclusion Children with SEN had poorer mental health than typically developed children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maltreatment risk for children with SEN is higher in comparison to pre-COVID-19 era. Surveillance of child maltreatment, continuity of medical and rehabilitation care to support children with SEN are essential during a disease pandemic.","Tso, Winnie W.

"What are the long-term outcomes for New Zealand survivors of critical illness?","Evidence is emerging from Australia around the impact critical illness has on disability, mental health, cognitive function and health-related quality of life for patients this side of the world. Even at 12 months post discharge, these poor outcomes persisted for 56% of ICU survivors.6 This collection of adverse health effects is labelled ""post intensive care syndrome"" (PICS).7 Caregivers of patients also experience their own poor health, known as ""PICS-family"" (PICS-f): complicated grief responses, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, sleep disturbances and fatigue are components of this.810 This viewpoint aims to explore the existing literature on PICS, with particular attention on the New Zealand perspective. Long-term outcomes following ICU: international perspective Since PICS was frst conceptualised nearly a decade ago by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, a growing body of evidence and knowledge has developed.7 Early studies highlighted that patients with respiratory failure and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have signifcant persistent morbidity, with poor quality of life, functional, cognitive and mental health issues for up to fve years after discharge from an ICU.11 This likely refects these patients having the highest acuity, which requires long durations of mechanical ventilation and time spent in ICU (over three weeks for half of patients). There are currently only single domain tools to quantify PICS (over 250 tools exist) , with wide variations in outcome measures reported in PICS research.17 Heydon et al18 reported on the health-related quality of life, activities and needs of 50 survivors and their families.","Sutton-Smith, Lynsey, Weatherall, Mark, Bell, Elliot B.; Every-Palmer, Susanna, Skirrow, Paul","https://www.google.com/search?q=What+are+the+long-term+outcomes+for+New+Zealand+survivors+of+critical+illness?","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The New Zealand Medical Journal (Online); 134(1547):121-126, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25560,""
"Relations Among Locus of Control, Religiosity, and Resiliency in Collegiate Football Players","Resiliency in athletes is related to effective coping strategies. Expectedly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this attribute was highlighted in collegiate football players. To date, the relations among locus of control (LOC), strength of religious beliefs (i.e., religiosity), and resiliency in collegiate football players have not been explored in the literature. Exploring the relation of LOC and religious beliefs to resiliency may shed light on avenues to foster resiliency in football players, which in turn can determine playersâ€™ behaviors, performance, and actions during adverse times. The purpose of this study was to gain a more in-depth understanding of the relations among LOC, religiosity, and resiliency in NCAA Division II football players at a public university located in the southwestern United States. A structured online survey containing the Rotterâ€™s Locus of Control Scale (Rotter inÂ Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 80(1), 1â€“28,Â 1966), the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (Plante & Boccaccini inÂ Pastoral Psychology, 45(6), 429â€“437,Â 1997), and the Conner Davidson Resilience Scale (Connor & Davidson inÂ Depression and Anxiety, 18(2), 76â€“82,Â 2003) was completed by 91 Division II football players. Statistically significant correlations were found between LOC and resiliency (r = -.42) as well as religiosity and resiliency (r = .26).

A community survey was distributed via email by local LGBTQ+ community organizations between September and December 2020. Participants (cisgender, heterosexual people, n=63;cisgender sexual minority people, n=184;and gender minority people, n=74) were asked how COVID has impacted their life circumstances (i.e., physical health, mental health, financial stability, meeting basic needs, and social connectedness). A multivariate analysis of covariance was tested with these groups, demographic and HIV serostatus variables as independent variables and covariates, and outcomes as dependent variables. Compared to cisgender, heterosexual people, significantly more cisgender sexual minority people reported worsening physical health, and significantly more gender minority people reported worsening of all outcomes. Significantly more gender minority people reported worsening financial stability than cisgender sexual minority people.

The purpose of this study was to assess levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of healthcare employees working in hospitals and their use of formal and informal mental health supports. Data was gathered over a three-week period in December 2020 as COVID cases began to rise sharply in Ontario, Canada. Results from an online survey of 650 healthcare employees suggested that overall levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were mild. However, a significant minority of participants reported severe or extremely severe levels of depression (14.4%), anxiety (21.8%), and stress (13.5%). Levels of distress were higher among women, younger participants, those who did not work directly with COVID+ patients, and those who were redeployed. Use of formal mental health supports (e.g., Employee Assistance Plans, teletherapy) was very low (&lt;10%), with the most frequently-reported reason for not using supports being â€œproblems not severe enough to require this serviceâ€.

In this article, we use concepts relating to candidacy to enable a theoretically informed examination of experiences of access to secondary mental health services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. We report a qualitative study of the views and experiences of service users, carers, and healthcare professionals. Analysis of 65 in-depth interviews was based on the constant comparative method. We found that wide-ranging service changes designed to address the imperatives of the pandemic were highly consequential for people's candidacy. Macro-level changes, including increased emphasis on crisis and risk management and adapted risk assessment systems, produced effects that went far beyond restrictions in the availability of services: they profoundly re-structured service users' identification of their own candidacy, including perceptions of what counted as a problem worthy of attention and whether they as individuals needed, deserved, and were entitled to care. Services became less permeable, such that finding a point of entry to those services that remained open, required more work of service users and carers. Healthcare professionals were routinely confronted by complex decisions and ethical dilemmas about provision of care, and their implicit judgements about access may have important implications for equity. Many of the challenges of access exposed by the pandemic related to pre-existing resource deficits and institutional weaknesses in care for people living with mental health difficulties. Overall, these findings affirm the value of the construct of candidacy for explaining access to mental healthcare, but also enable deepened understanding of the specific features of candidacy, offering enduring learning and implications for policy and practice.","Liberati, Elisa, Richards, Natalie, Parker, Jennie, Willars, Janet, Scott, David, Boydell, Nicola, Pinfold, Vanessa, Martin, Graham, Jones, Peter B.; Dixon-Woods, Mary","https://www.google.com/search?q=Qualitative+study+of+candidacy+and+access+to+secondary+mental+health+services+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Social science & medicine (1982);2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25565,""
"Physical activity and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults in the COVID-19 pandemic era: A three-wave cross-lagged study","The aim of the study is to determine the trajectories of physical activity and depressive symptoms and their reciprocal relationship among community-dwelling older adults in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The study population consisted of a cohort of 511 participants aged 60 years and over, who were recruited from eight community health centers in Ya'an, China. The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and the Patient Health Questionnaire were respectively used to measure physical activity and depressive symptoms at three time points: before the COVID-19 outbreak (T0), during the outbreak period (T1), and after the subsidence of COVID-19 (T2). The results revealed that physical activity and depressive symptoms fluctuated substantially across T0, T1, and T2. In addition, more severe depressive symptoms at T0 and T1 were significantly associated with lower levels of physical activity at T1 and T2, but the obverse direction of physical activity being associated with subsequent depressive symptoms was not observed in the current study. These findings highlight the importance of supporting old people to remain physically active and combat mental distress early in a pandemic, and prevention and management of depressive symptoms may also be beneficial to promote physical activity.","Li, Yuan, Su, Shaoyu, Luo, Biru, Wang, Jing, Liao, Shujuan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Physical+activity+and+depressive+symptoms+among+community-dwelling+older+adults+in+the+COVID-19+pandemic+era:+A+three-wave+cross-lagged+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: International journal of disaster risk reduction : IJDRR;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25566,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and weight gain in American adults: A nationwide population-based study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people in many ways. However, little is known about weight gain in American adults during the pandemic. Aims and methods The purpose of this study was to conduct a national assessment of weight gain in adult Americans after the first year of the pandemic. An online questionnaire was employed to explore perceptions of adults regarding pandemic weight gain and the relationship between weight gain and sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic weight status, and psychological distress. Multiple methods were used to assess the psychometric properties of the questionnaire (i.e., face validity, content validity, and internal consistency reliability testing). Chi-Square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to assess group differences and predictors of weight gain in the study participants. Results A total of 3473 individuals participated in the study with weight changes distributed as: gained weight (48%), remained the same weight (34%), or lost weight (18%). Those who reported being very overweight before the pandemic were most likely to gain weight (65%) versus those who reported being slightly overweight (58%) or normal weight before the pandemic (40%). Weight gain was statistically significantly higher in those with anxiety (53%), depression (52%), or symptoms of both (52%). The final multiple regression model found that the statistically significant predictors of pandemic weight gain were psychological distress, pre-pandemic weight status, having children at home;and time since last bodyweight check. Conclusions Population health promotion strategies in the pandemic should emphasize stress reduction to help individuals manage body weight and avoid chronic diseases in the future.","Khubchandani, Jagdish, Price, James H.; Sharma, Sushil, Wiblishauser, Michael J.; Webb, Fern J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+pandemic+and+weight+gain+in+American+adults:+A+nationwide+population-based+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Diabetes & metabolic syndrome;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25567,""
"Family functioning and mental wellbeing impairment during initial quarantining for the COVID-19 pandemic: A study of Canadian families","Quarantine measures imposed due to COVID-19 have negatively impacted individual wellbeing. However, the research on the factors impacting mental health and functioning of families is limited. The current study explores socio-economic and demographic factors that mediate poor family functioning, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in response to quarantine measures in Canadian parents and children. 254 Canadian families completed an online questionnaire capturing demographic information and mental wellbeing of individuals and of the whole family. Family functioning was assessed using the Family Assessment Device General Functioning subscale (FAD-GF), and individual mental wellbeing was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Generalized linear models and logistic regression were used to model socio-demographic impacts on outcome variables. Problematic family functioning was found in 78.5% of families with a high proportion of parents reporting above-threshold symptoms of anxiety (62.9%) and depression (73.4%). Many children also reported above-threshold symptoms of anxiety (54.6%) and depression (70.7%). Family functioning was impacted by parent and child age, parental employment status and pre-existing conditions for children. Anxiety and depression experienced by parents and children was increased in families with parents aged &lt;45, household income&lt;$100,000 pre-existing psychiatric conditions, or having a child aged &gt;5 years. These findings show that most Canadian families observed in this study experienced above threshold symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor family functioning. Our study provides an initial step towards identifying characteristics of at-risk families and targeting interventions to mediate negative effects of quarantining.","Hwang, Philippe, Ipekian, Lara, Jaiswal, Nikhil, Scott, Gabie, Amirali, Evangelina Lila, Hechtman, Lily","https://www.google.com/search?q=Family+functioning+and+mental+wellbeing+impairment+during+initial+quarantining+for+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+A+study+of+Canadian+families","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Current psychology (New Brunswick, N.J.);: 1-13, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25568,""
"Perceived Impact of Hurricane Maria on Educators and Students in Puerto Rico","This qualitative study was designed to investigate the key academic, career, emotional/social, and mental health concerns identified by educators in the schools in Puerto Rico (elementary, secondary, and university). Key educational leaders, counseling professionals, and educators were interviewed to obtain more information about the impact that Hurricane Maria has had on the academic, career, and emotional/social development of students. The impact of the hurricane and post disaster response on educators was also explored. After a qualitative analysis of the written transcripts, during which only ubiquitous themes were retained, eighteen categories emerged that were grouped into six themes: (a) the importance of the community, (b) the impact on individuals, (c) coping strategies, (d) barriers to recovery, (e) outcomes and (f) expressed needs.

"EatLOCAL: a platform that connects local farmers, consumers, municipalities and non-governmental organisations","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to public health and supply chain systems around the globe. Local farmers businesses were impacted by the lockdowns and they still face difficulties in commercializing their production while requests for social, economic and food support pile up at municipalities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Meanwhile, working from home, constraints to workout, business and social life, are impacting citizensâ€™ work-life balance, eating habits and impacting populationsâ€™ physical and mental health globally. EatLOCAL proposes to address this issue by providing a service that is supported in an innovative digital platform that strengthens connections between suppliers, consumers, municipalities and NGOs working on food privation issues. Besides maximizing the opportunities for business to local farmers, this platform also creates a facilitated channel that promotes de access to fresh food by citizens and minimizes the social impact of the pandemic in most vulnerable groups.","Fortunato, Rafaela Bastos, Monteiro Zina, Ana Rute AraÃºjo, Breyer, Samantha, Malias Paulino, Diana Filipa, Santos, Carolina","https://www.google.com/search?q=EatLOCAL:+a+platform+that+connects+local+farmers,+consumers,+municipalities+and+non-governmental+organisations","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Procedia computer science; 196:566-571, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25570,""
"Microfinance loan officers before and during Covid-19: Evidence from India","The Microfinance industry has been severely affected by Covid-19. We provide detailed insights into how loan officers, the key personnel linking the lender to its borrowers, are affected in their performance and adapt their work to the pandemic. We use administrative records of an Indian Microfinance Institution and detailed panel survey data on performance, performed tasks, and work organization to document how the work environment became more challenging during the pandemic. Loan officers operate in a setting where work from home is hard to implement due to the nature of the tasks and technological constraints. The usual performance indicators appear to be mainly driven by external factors such as the nation-wide debt moratorium. Loan officers worked similar hours, but engaged less in planning activities and completed fewer of the usual tasks. Work perceptions and mental health of loan officers reflect these changes, and perceived stress was particularly high during the period of the debt moratorium.","Czura, Kristina, Englmaier, Florian, Ho, Hoa, Spantig, Lisa","https://www.google.com/search?q=Microfinance+loan+officers+before+and+during+Covid-19:+Evidence+from+India","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: World Development;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25571,""

"Mental Health and Psycho-social Responses to COVID-19 in Ethiopia: Lessons learnt from the first year of the pandemic","COVID-19 has a wide range of effects on the mental health of the public, people in isolation, vulnerable individuals, and health workers. This article has collected reports from the Ethiopian national public health emergency operations center, the Federal Ministry of Health- Ethiopia and the Health Professionals Advisory Council and included direct observations from the responses to review the mental health and psycho-social responses of Ethiopia to the COVID-19 pandemic, to share experiences and provide policy recommendations. The worldwide effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psycho-social aspects of the public, restrictions due to the State of Emergency in Ethiopia, the pre-existing resource limitations in mental health care and an increase in returnees with multiple needs had increased the need for mental health and psycho-social support of individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Multiple stakeholders from governmental institutions, professional associations and non-governmental organizations had come together to mitigate the impact. The response included training healthcare providers, preparing guiding documents, mental health messages to the public, and providing mental health and psycho-social support services to individuals admitted in quarantines and treatment centers as well as health workers. The inclusion of Mental Health and Psycho-social support in the emergency response has shown promising results in Ethiopia that can be adopted in the management of other public health emergencies. The effectiveness of mental health and psycho-social interventions relies on recognizing the need of mental health services and increasing metal health resource allocation.","Alemu, A.

"Evictions and tenant-landlord relationships during the 2020-2021 eviction moratorium in the US","This study provisionally examined the effects of the US eviction moratorium instituted in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Three waves of data collected May 2020-April 2021 from a nationally representative sample of middle- and low-income US tenants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3393 in Wave 1, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1311 in Wave 2, and 814 in Wave 3) were analyzed. Across three waves, 4.3% of tenants reported experiencing an eviction during the moratorium and 6%-23% of tenants reported delaying paying rent because of the moratorium. Multivariable analyses found that tenants who delayed paying their rent, were female, or had a history of mental illness or substance use disorder were more likely to report the eviction moratorium had a negative effect on their landlord relationship. COVID-19 infection was not predictive of eviction but tenants with a history of homelessness were more than nine times as likely to report an eviction than those without such a history. Together, these findings suggest the eviction moratorium may have had some unintended consequences on rent payments and tenant-landlord relationships that need to be considered with the end of the federal eviction moratorium.","Tsai, Huang, Blosnich, Elbogen","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12581","20220114","COVID-19; eviction; homelessness; housing; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25575,""
"Recovery of dialysis patients with COVID-19: Health outcomes 3 months after diagnosis in ERACODA","COVID-19-related short-term mortality is high in dialysis patients, but longer-term outcomes are largely unknown. We therefore assessed patient recovery in a large cohort of dialysis patients three months after their COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyzed data on dialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 1st, 2020-March 31st, 2021 from the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA). The outcomes studied were patient survival, residency, and functional- and mental health status (estimated by their treating physician) three months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Complete follow-up data was available for 854 surviving patients. Patient characteristics associated with recovery were analyzed using logistic regression. In 2449 hemodialysis patients (meanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â SD age: 67.5Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 14.4Ã‚Â years, 62% male) survival probabilities at three months after COVID-19 diagnosis were 90% for non-hospitalized patients (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1087), 73% for patients admitted to the hospital but not to an ICU (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1165) and 40% for those admitted to an ICU (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 197). Patient survival hardly decreased between 28 days and three months after COVID-19 diagnosis. At three months, 87% functioned at their pre-existent functional and 94% at their pre-existent mental level. Only few of the surviving patients were still admitted to the hospital (between 0.8 and 6.3%) or a nursing home (approximately 5%). Higher age and frailty score at presentation and ICU admission were associated with worse functional outcome. Mortality between 28 days and 3 months after COVID-19 diagnosis was low, and the majority of patients who survived COVID-19 recovered to their pre-existent functional and mental health level at three months after diagnosis.","Hemmelder, Noordzij, Vart, Hilbrands, Jager, Abrahams, Arroyo, Battaglia, Ekart, Mallamaci, Malloney, Oliveira, Rydzewski, Sridharan, Vogt, Duivenvoorden, Gansevoort, Franssen, van der Net, Essig, du Buf-Vereijken, van Ginneken, Maas, van Jaarsveld, Bemelman, Klingenberg-Salahova, Heenan-Vos, Vervloet, Nurmohamed, Abramowicz, Verhofstede, Maoujoud, Malfait, Fialova, Melilli, FavÃƒÂ , Cruzado, Perez, Lips, Krepel, Adilovic, Hengst, Konings, Braconnier, Weis, Gellert, Alferes, Radulescu, Zakharova, Ambuehl, Guidotti, Walker, Lepeytre, RabatÃƒÂ©, Rostoker, Marques, Azasevac, Majstorovic, Katicic, Ten Dam, KrÃƒÂ¼ger, Brzosko, Liakopoulos, Zanen, Logtenberg, Fricke, Kuryata, Slebe, ElHafeez, Kemlin, van de Wetering, Reinders, Hesselink, Gestel, Eiselt, Kielberger, El-Wakil, Verhoeven, Logan, Canal, Facundo, Ramos, Debska-Slizien, Veldhuizen, Tigka, Konsta, Panagoutsos, Postorino, Cambareri, Matceac, Nistor, Covic, Groeneveld, Jousma, van Buren, Diekmann, Oppenheimer, Blasco, Pereira, Dos Santos Junior, Arias-Cabrales, Crespo, LlinÃƒÂ s-Mallol, Buxeda, TÃƒÂ rrega, Redondo-Pachon, Jimenez, Mendoza-Valderrey, Martins, Mateus, Alvila, Laranjinha, Hofstra, Siezenga, Franco, Castellano, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Ferrero, Manzanos, Barrios, Lemahieu, Bartelet, Dirim, Demir, Sever, Turkmen, Ã…Å¾afak, Hollander, Kerckhoffs, BÃƒÂ¼ttner, de Vries, Meziyerh, van der Helm, Mallat, Bouwsma, Petruliene, Verberk, van der Sande, Christiaans, MohanKumar, Luca, TuÃ„Å¸lular, Kramer, Beerenhout, Luik, Kerschbaum, Tiefenthaler, Watschinger, Adema, Stepanov, Zulkarnaev, Turkmen, Gandolfini, Maggiore, Fliedner, Ãƒâ€¦sberg, Mjoen, Miyasato, de Fijter, Mongera, Pini, de Biase, van de Logt, Maas, Lebedeva, Lopez, Reichert, Verhave, Titov, Parshina, Zanoli, Marcantoni, van Kempen, van Gils-Verrij, Harty, Meurs, Myslak, Lentini, den Deurwaarder, Stendahl, Rahimzadeh, Schouten, Rychlik, Cabezas-Reina, Roca, Nauta, Sahin, Goffin, Kanaan, Labriola, Devresse, Diaz-Mareque, Coca, de Arriba, Meijers, Naesens, Kuypers, Desschans, Tonnerlier, Wissing, Dedinska, Pessolano, Malik, Dounousi, Papachristou, Berger, Meijer, Sanders, Ãƒâ€“zyilmaz, Ponikvar, Pernat, Kovac, Arnol, Molenaar, van Zuilen, Meijvis, Dolmans, Tantisattamo, Esposito, Krzesinski, Barahira, Gallieni, Martin-Moreno, Guglielmetti, Guzzo, Toapanta, Soler, Luik, van Kuijk, Stikkelbroeck, Hermans, Rimsevicius, Righetti, Islam, Heitink-Ter Braak","https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfac008","20220114","COVID-19; dialysis; functional health status; mental health status; survival","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25576,""
"Implementation of a Prenatal Naloxone Distribution Program to Decrease Maternal Mortality from Opioid Overdose","Maternal mortality rates have been increasing in the United States for decades. For several years, opioid overdoses have been a leading cause of maternal mortality in several states. New Hampshire (NH) is a particularly severe case, with 50% of all maternal deaths being caused by drug-related overdoses from 2016 to 2017. We report on the implementation of a point-of-care naloxone distribution program for an Ob/Gyn clinic in NH. Naloxone distribution was tracked to measure program implementation. Proportion of patients screened for naloxone need was calculated monthly. Proportion of patients with which discussions about naloxone took place was calculated quarterly. Patient and provider perspectives on the program were captured periodically. Statistical process control charts monitored change over time and evaluated for special-cause variation. The clinic has distributed 12 doses of naloxone since program implementation in April 2020. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, screening for naloxone need has remained at pre-pandemic rates (moving average: 73%), except for a decrease in April-May 2020. Patient-provider discussions about naloxone have also remained at pre-pandemic rates (moving average: 51%). Qualitative feedback from patients and providers has indicated that the program has been well-received by both groups. The purpose of this description is to provide a framework for other Ob/Gyn clinics to use in implementing similar naloxone distribution programs. Although too early to determine whether this intervention will result in a significant decrease in maternal mortality due to opioid overdose in our patients, this measure will continue to be tracked annually.Ã‚Â Implementation of a naloxone program in the obstetrical context provides an important way to improve outcomes for a vulnerable perinatal population.","Duska, Goodman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03307-z","20220114","Maternal mortality; Naloxone; Narcan; Overdose; Quality improvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25577,""
"Changes in Smoking Behavior, Stress, and Sleep Duration among Israeli Hospital Workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Being on the COVID-19 frontline could negatively impact healthcare workers mental health. We examined smoking behavior changes and the association with changes in stress levels and sleeping patterns among hospital workers during the pandemic. An online survey was conducted among employees of a large tertiary medical center in Israel. Data collected included socio-demographic characteristics, smoking status, changes in smoking behavior (for smokers only), stress levels, and sleeping duration during the pandemic, perceptions of risk for COVID-19 infection and disease severity, presence of a chronic illness, COVID-19 exposure and infection status, and involvement in treating COVID-19 patients, Multi-nominal logistic regression modeling assessed the effects of covariates on smoking behavior change. Overall, 920 healthcare workers participated. More than half (59%) reported an increase in stress and 28% reported changes in sleep duration. Thirty-five percent of current smokers (n=132), reported smoking more. Increased stress was associated with an increase in smoking (OR=3.45; 95% CI 1.2-9.4, p=0.016), and an increase in sleeping hours was significantly associated with a decrease in smoking (OR=6.62, 95% CI 1.2-32. p=0.02). Among smokers who reported perceived levels of stress to be the same or slightly higher than pre-pandemic, a strong inverse association was observed between sleep and smoking. The mental health consequences of the pandemic, specifically for health workers, could lead to negative changes in smoking behaviors. Together with offering stress-management skills and coping strategies, mental health support should target smoking behaviors and sleep disturbances. A high proportion of healthcare employees working in a large tertiary medical centre in Israel reported increased stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among smokers, increased stress levels were associated with increased smoking, suggesting that smoking may be a coping mechanism for COVID-19 related stress. Offering stress-management skills and coping strategies can mitigate the negative impact on health workers' smoking behaviour, and reduce stress-related increases in smoking behaviour.","Bar-Zeev, Shauly-Aharonov, Neumark, Hirshoren","https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntac014","20220114","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25578,""
"The effects of swimming sports on the prevention and restoration of COVID-19 and its variant strains: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Since 2019, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a new round of ""epidemic,"" which has brought about a major crisis to the world from national development, to people's life safety and mental health. Faced with the constant variation of viruses, from COVID-19 to Delta to Omicron. How to curb its further deterioration and enhance human defense against viruses is the focus of scientific researchers. From previous studies, we found that in addition to basic medical treatment, swimming with a certain amount of load and intensity can promote the ventilator of the human body, thereby playing an auxiliary and preventive role in the treatment of COVID-19 and its variant strains. This study searched China knowledge network, Web of science, Google scholar, PubMed database to search for the relevant research on swimming prevention and treatment for COVID-19, and the deadline for searching was December 2021. Two researchers independently screened and extracted the literature, and evaluated the bias risk of the included studies.

Our center is a level I trauma center located in south Gyeonggi-do, and we aimed to evaluate whether the characteristics of trauma patients changed after the COVID-19 pandemic.We retrospectively reviewed the trauma patients registered with the Korea Trauma Database of the Center from February 2019 to January 2021. The patients were dichotomized into pre-coronavirus disease (pre-COVID) and coronavirus disease (COVID) groups, and their trauma volumes, injury characteristics, intentionality, and outcomes were compared.A total of 2628 and 2636 patients were included in the pre-COVID and COVID groups, respectively. During the COVID-19 period, motorcycle accidents, bicycle accidents, and penetrating injury cases increased, and pedestrian traffic accidents, slips, and injury by machines decreased.

"""LONG COVID""-A hypothesis for understanding the biological basis and pharmacological treatment strategy","Infection of humans with SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a disease known colloquially as ""COVID-19"" with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. Initial pathology is due to the virus binding to the ACE-2 protein on endothelial cells lining blood vessels and entering these cells in order to replicate. Viral replication causes oxidative stress due to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Many (~60%) of the infected people appear to have eliminated the virus from their body after 28Ã‚Â days and resume normal activity. However, a significant proportion (~40%) experience a variety of symptoms (loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, cough, aching pain, ""brain fog,"" insomnia, shortness of breath, and tachycardia) after 12Ã‚Â weeks and are diagnosed with a syndrome named ""LONG COVID."" Longitudinal clinical studies in a group of subjects who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been compared to a non-infected matched group of subjects. A cohort of infected subjects can be identified by a battery of cytokine markers to have persistent, low level grade of inflammation and often self-report two or more troubling symptoms. There is no drug that will relieve their symptoms effectively. It is hypothesized that drugs that activate the intracellular transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) may increase the expression of enzymes to synthesize the intracellular antioxidant, glutathione that will quench free radicals causing oxidative stress. The hormone melatonin has been identified as an activator of NRF2 and a relatively safe chemical for most people to ingest chronically. Thus, it is an option for consideration of re-purposing studies in ""LONG COVID"" subjects experiencing insomnia, depression, fatigue, and ""brain fog"" but not tachycardia. Appropriately designed clinical trials are required to evaluate melatonin.","Jarrott, Head, Pringle, Lumbers, Martin","https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.911","20220114","COVID-19; NRF2; SARS-CoV-2; endothelium; melatonin; oxidative stress; tissue hypoxia; Ã¢â‚¬Å“LONG COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25581,""
"The Prevalence and Predictors of Depressive, Anxiety, and Stress Symptoms Among Tepi Town Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Ethiopia","As a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, many countries have imposed movement restrictions and implemented lockdowns. However, evidence from a variety of nations showed that the COVID-19 outbreak and its associated quarantine measures triggered a wide range of psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress in the general population. As a result, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among Tepi town residents during the pandemic lockdown. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among residents of Tepi town from September 15 through September 25, 2020, and residents who have lived in Tepi town for at least 6Ã‚Â months were included. We have employed the depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS-21) to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. The Chi-squared test of association and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among residents of Tepi town. For all statistical analysis, we used (IBM) SPSS version 25. According to the current study, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were 37.7%, 39.0%, and 44.2%, respectively, among residents of Tepi town. Estimated odds of having depression, anxiety, and stress were as follows: for being female 6.315, 4.591, and 3.155; smoking 1.787, 1.883, and 1.787; sleep problem 2.613, 2.254, and 1.721; chewing Khat 2.156, 2.053, and 2.110; quarantine for 14Ã‚Â days 2.251, 1.902, and 1.960; and frequent use of social media 3.126, 1.849, and 3.126 times more likely as compared to their corresponding reference group respectively. The odds of developing depression and anxiety respectively were as follows: for alcohol consumption 2.438 and 1.797 times higher than their corresponding reference group respectively. Those exposed to COVID-19 were 3.870 times more likely to develop depression symptoms. Estimated odds of having anxiety and stress symptoms for fear of COVID-19 were 1.776 and 1.835; social interactions altered were 3.197 and 2.069, moderate levels of hope were 2.687 and 2.849 respectively. The odds ratio for those taking traditional preventive medicine, and having family members infected with COVID-19 were 2.475 and 1.837 times more likely to experience anxiety symptoms respectively. In this study, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms was found to be high among residences in Tepi town. Being female, chewing Khat, smoking, being quarantined for 14Ã‚Â days, frequently using social media, and having sleeping problems were all found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, whereas alcohol consumption and family members infected by COVID-19 were considerably linked to depression and anxiety symptoms. Fear of COVID-19, influence on social interaction and having a moderate level of hope were substantially related to stress and anxiety symptoms, while taking preventive medicine was found to be a significant factor in anxiety symptoms among Tepi town residences. Interventions should be made to improve the mental health of Tepi residents.","Tareke, Lelisho, Hassen, Seid, Jemal, Teshale, Wotale, Pandey","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01195-1","20220114","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25582,""

"Effectiveness of a structured intervention to make routine clinical meetings therapeutically effective (DIALOG+) for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A cluster randomised controlled trial","DIALOG+ is a patient-centred, solution-focused intervention, which aims to make routine patient-clinician meetings therapeutically effective. Existing evidence suggests that it is effective for patients with psychotic disorders in high-income countries. We tested the effectiveness of DIALOGÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹+Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a middle-income country. We conducted a parallel-group, cluster randomised controlled trial of DIALOG+ in an outpatient clinic in Sarajevo. Patients inclusion criteria were: 18 years and older, a diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorders, and low quality of life. Clinicians and their patients were randomly allocated to either the DIALOGÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹+Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹intervention or routine care in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome, quality of life, and secondary outcomes, psychiatric symptoms and objective social outcomes, were measured at 6- and 12-months by blinded assessors. Fifteen clinicians and 72 patients were randomised. Loss to follow-up was 12% at 6-months and 19% at 12-months. Quality of life did not significantly differ between intervention and control group after six months, but patients receiving DIALOGÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹+Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹had significantly better quality of life after 12 months, with a medium effect size (Cohen's dÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹0.632, pÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹0.007). General symptoms as well as specifically anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower after six and 12 months, and the objective social situation showed a statistical trend after 12 months, all in favour of the intervention group. No adverse events were reported. Delivery of the intervention was variable and COVID-19 affected 12-month follow-up assessments in both groups.

"Early Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Outpatient Neurologic Care in Hawai'i","In March 2020, Hawai'i instituted public health measures to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including stay-at-home orders, closure of non-essential businesses and parks, use of facial coverings, social distancing, and a mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers. In response to these measures, Hawai'i Pacific Neuroscience (HPN) modified practice processes to ensure continuity of neurological treatment. A survey of patients was performed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic-related practice processes for quality improvement. Overall, 367 patients seen at HPN between April 22, 2020, and May 18, 2020, were surveyed via telephone. Almost half (49.6%) participated in a telemedicine appointment, with the majority finding it easy to use (87.4%) and as valuable as face-to-face appointments (68.7%). Many (44.5%) patients said they would have missed a health care appointment without the availability of telemedicine, and 47.3% indicated they might prefer to use telemedicine over in-person appointments in the future. Many reported new or worsening mental health problems, including depression (27.6%), anxiety (38.3%), or sleep disturbances (37.4%). A significant number reported worsening of their condition, with 33.1% of patients who experience migraines reporting increased symptom severity or frequency, 45.8% patients with Alzheimer's disease reporting worsened symptoms, 38.5% of patients with Parkinson's disease who had a recent fall, and 50.0% of patients with multiple sclerosis experiencing new or worsened symptoms.

"AI-Based Prediction and Prevention of Psychological and Behavioral Changes in Ex-COVID-19 Patients","The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse consequences on human psychology and behavior long after initial recovery from the virus. These COVID-19 health sequelae, if undetected and left untreated, may lead to more enduring mental health problems, and put vulnerable individuals at risk of developing more serious psychopathologies. Therefore, an early distinction of such vulnerable individuals from those who are more resilient is important to undertake timely preventive interventions. The main aim of this article is to present a comprehensive multimodal conceptual approach for addressing these potential psychological and behavioral mental health changes using state-of-the-art tools and means of artificial intelligence (AI). Mental health COVID-19 recovery programs at post-COVID clinics based on AI prediction and prevention strategies may significantly improve the global mental health of ex-COVID-19 patients. Most COVID-19 recovery programs currently involve specialists such as pulmonologists, cardiologists, and neurologists, but there is a lack of psychiatrist care. The focus of this article is on new tools which can enhance the current limited psychiatrist resources and capabilities in coping with the upcoming challenges related to widespread mental health disorders. Patients affected by COVID-19 are more vulnerable to psychological and behavioral changes than non-COVID populations and therefore they deserve careful clinical psychological screening in post-COVID clinics. However, despite significant advances in research, the pace of progress in prevention of psychiatric disorders in these patients is still insufficient. Current approaches for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders largely rely on clinical rating scales, as well as self-rating questionnaires that are inadequate for comprehensive assessment of ex-COVID-19 patients' susceptibility to mental health deterioration. These limitations can presumably be overcome by applying state-of-the-art AI-based tools in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of psychiatric disorders in acute phase of disease to prevent more chronic psychiatric consequences.","Ã„â€ osiÃ„â€¡, PopoviÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â arlija, KesedÃ…Â¾iÃ„â€¡, GambiraÃ…Â¾a, DropuljiÃ„â€¡, MijiÃ„â€¡, Henigsberg, Jovanovic","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.782866","20220114","artificial intelligence; ex-COVID-19 patients; facial/oculometric features; mental health disorders; neurophysiological features; prediction and prevention; semantic/acoustic features","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25587,""
"Magnitude and Factors Affecting Parental Stress and Effective Stress Management Strategies Among Family Members During COVID-19","The pandemic outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens proper family patterns by disrupting normal day-to-day activities, such as working patterns of parents by working from home, online children's education rather than regular school, a dilemma in children's education and health constrained movement by complete or partial home lockdowns to prevent disease spread, anxiety of disease spread, failure of home quarantine due to insufficient home situation and reduced personal protective equipment usage due to the extra financial burden, reduced social communications, increased health burdens than usual along with enormous toil with dependent family members, demands of financial burdens by multiple factors, reduced monthly income during pandemics, lack of employment or job insecurity, deviations in mental health among family members such as fear, anxiety, insomnia, severe depression, hetero aggression, child verbal or physical abuses, increased alcohol consumption and substance abuse or drug addictions, aggressive behavior, self-blaming or injury, unintentional suicidal tendencies, mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and failure to meet health demands due to a lack of health facilities. Many contributing factors are affecting the normal family status than usual circumstances such as reduced hospital equipment or resources which is due to pandemic effects, social isolation due to outside quarantine measures, insecurity of the future and ongoing pandemic situation, fear of vaccination side effects, and so on. Therefore, we hope to raise awareness about the magnitude of parental stress levels and contributing factors. Moreover, these findings would encourage effective stress management to overcome the factors that contribute to parenteral stress and to improve coping skills to face the coming darkness with ease.

"Mental Health Outcomes and Mental Hygiene in the COVID-19 Era: A Cross-Sectional Study Among Healthcare Workers from a Regional Hospital in Ghana","The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting healthcare workers (HCWs) in unique ways which include the risk of infection and subsequent transmission to their colleagues and families, the issue of vulnerability due to lack of PPEs and access to equipment needed to provide best care for patients, moral injury in making triage decisions, the lack of professional and/or social support and psychological burdens during this period. This study thus investigates the mental health outcomes (fear, depression, anxiety, and stress) and mental hygiene among HCWs in Ghana in this COVID-19 era. The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional design. Our findings revealed a shared count of psychological outcomes among HCWs in Ghana. State anxiety was a prominent psychological outcome among HCWs. Being a female HCW was significantly associated with state anxiety. Correlation analysis showed a positive and significant relationship among all the psychological outcomes at <i>P</i>&lt;0.05 and 0.01. There were no mental hygiene systems and/or structures in place at the regional hospital.

"Understanding the uneven spread of COVID-19 in the context of the global interconnected economy","The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex and multivariate process differentiated across countries, and geographical distance is acceptable as a critical determinant of the uneven spreading. Although social connectivity is a defining condition for virus transmission, the network paradigm in the study of the COVID-19 spatio-temporal spread has not been used accordingly. Toward contributing to this demand, this paper uses network analysis to develop a multidimensional methodological framework for understanding the uneven (cross-country) spread of COVID-19 in the context of the globally interconnected economy. The globally interconnected system of tourism mobility is modeled as a complex network and studied within the context of a three-dimensional (3D) conceptual model composed of network connectivity, economic openness, and spatial impedance variables. The analysis reveals two main stages in the temporal spread of COVID-19, defined by the cutting-point of the 44th day from Wuhan. The first describes the outbreak in Asia and North America, the second stage in Europe, South America, and Africa, while the outbreak in Oceania intermediates. The analysis also illustrates that the average node degree exponentially decays as a function of COVID-19 emergence time. This finding implies that the highly connected nodes, in the Global Tourism Network (GTN), are disproportionally earlier infected by the pandemic than the other nodes. Moreover, countries with the same network centrality as China are early infected on average by COVID-19. The paper also finds that network interconnectedness, economic openness, and transport integration are critical determinants in the early global spread of the pandemic, and it reveals that the spatio-temporal patterns of the worldwide spreading of COVID-19 are more a matter of network interconnectivity than of spatial proximity.","Tsiotas, Tselios","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-04717-3","20220114","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25590,""
"COVID-19 impact on mental health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a significant influence on public mental health. Current efforts focus on alleviating the impacts of the disease on public health and the economy, with the psychological effects due to COVID-19 relatively ignored. In this research, we are interested in exploring the quantitative characterization of the pandemic impact on public mental health by studying an online survey dataset of the United States. The analyses are conducted based on a large scale of online mental health-related survey study in the United States, conducted over 12 consecutive weeks from April 23, 2020 to July 21, 2020. We are interested in examining the risk factors that have a significant impact on mental health as well as in their estimated effects over time. We employ the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) method to deal with missing values and take logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method to identify risk factors for mental health. Our analysis shows that risk predictors for an individual to experience mental health issues include the pandemic situation of the State where the individual resides, age, gender, race, marital status, health conditions, the number of household members, employment status, the level of confidence of the future food affordability, availability of health insurance, mortgage status, and the information of kids enrolling in school. The effects of most of the predictors seem to change over time though the degree varies for different risk factors. The effects of risk factors, such as States and gender show noticeable change over time, whereas the factor age exhibits seemingly unchanged effects over time. The analysis results unveil evidence-based findings to identify the groups who are psychologically vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides helpful evidence for assisting healthcare providers and policymakers to take steps for mitigating the pandemic effects on public mental health, especially in boosting public health care, improving public confidence in future food conditions, and creating more job opportunities. This article does not report the results of a health care intervention on human participants.","Cui, Lu, Weng, Yi, He","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01411-w","20220114","COVID-19; Lasso; logistic regression; mental health; missing data; multiple imputation; survey data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","",25591,""
