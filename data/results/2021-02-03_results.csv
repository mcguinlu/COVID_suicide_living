"Stay Home and Stay Active? The impact of stay-at-home restrictions on physical activity routines in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","Government restrictions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK led to the disruption of many people's physical activity routines, with sports and leisure facilities closed and outdoor exercise only permitted once per day. In this study we investigated which population groups were impacted most in terms of reduced physical activity levels during these periods, and which groups benefitted in terms of increasing their usual level of physical activity. We surveyed UK residents, sampled through users of a rewards-for-exercise app (Sweatcoin; n=749) and an online panel (Prolific; n=907). Of the app users, n=487 further provided daily step-count data collected by the app, prior to, and during the periods of restrictions between March and June 2020. Regression models were applied to investigate factors associated with subjective change (perceived change in physical activity) and objective change (log-percentage change in daily step-count) in physical activity during the periods of restrictions. ANOVAs were used to further investigate the significant factors identified. Key factors associated with a substantial subjective reduction in physical activity included those classed as obese, gym users and people living in urban areas. All participants had a reduced step count during restrictions, with Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, students and urban dwellers showing the largest reductions. Therefore, targeted interventions are required to ensure that the physical and mental health impacts of sedentary behaviour are not exacerbated over the long-term by significant reductions in physical activity identified in these groups, particularly those who are also more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.","Victoria Eshelby; Muhammed Sogut; Kate Jolly; Ivo Vlaev; Mark T Elliott","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863","20210203","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10173,""
"One Year of Evidence on Mental Health in the COVID-19 Crisis - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","ABSTRACT Objective: This paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence rate of mental health issues of the major population, including general population, general healthcare workers (HCWs), and frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), in China over one year of the COVID-19 crisis. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: articles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and medRxiv up to November 16, 2020, one year after the first publicly known confirmed COVID-19 case. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: any COVID-19 and mental disorders relevant English studies with frontline/general healthcare workers, general adult population sample, using validated scales. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, distress, general psychological symptoms (GPS), insomnia, and PTSD and ran meta-regression to tease out the heterogeneity. Results: The meta-analysis includes 131 studies and 171 independent samples. The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, GPS, insomnia, and PTSD are 11%, 13%, 20%, 13%, 19%, and 20%, respectively. The meta-regression results uncovered several predictors of the prevalence rates, including severity (e.g., above severe vs. above moderate, p<0.01; above moderate vs. above mild, p<0.01) and type of mental issues (e.g., depression vs. anxiety, p=0.04; insomnia vs. anxiety p=0.04), population (frontline HCWs vs. general HCWs, p<0.01), sampling location (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan, p=0.04), and study quality (p=0.04). Limitations: First, we only focus on China population, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Second, 96.2% studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional. Last, since we only included studies published in English, we expect to have a language bias. Conclusion: Our pooled prevalence rates are significantly different from, yet largely between, the findings of previous meta-analyses, suggesting the results of our larger study are consistent with, yet fine-tune, the findings of the smaller, previous meta-analyses. Hence, this meta-analysis not only provides a significant update on the mental health prevalence rates in COVID-19 but also suggests the need to update meta-analyses continuously to provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence of mental illness during this ongoing health crisis. While prior meta-analyses focused on the prevalence rates of mental health disorders based on one level of severity (i.e., above mild), our findings also suggest a need to examine the prevalence rates at varying levels of severity. The one-year cumulative evidence on sampling locations (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan) corroborates the typhoon eye effect theory. Our finding that the prevalence rates of distress and insomnia and those of frontline healthcare workers are higher suggest future research and interventions should pay more attention to those mental outcomes and populations.

"Digitalization of social contacts among university students in Russia during Covid-19","Introduction of digital technologies affects different aspects of social life and leads to a gradual shift to digital society  Lockdown measures restricting social contacts to prevent the spread of COVID19 boosted digital interactions, and these changes primarily concern the youth  The data of the Covid19 International Student Wellbeing Study suggest that digital format enabled students to interact with each other during selfisolation  Penetration of digital technologies into life intensified intergenerational, interpersonal and common social interactions  Digital communications helped to reduce the risks of social isolation, to maintain social relationships and to keep the system of social relationships stable during the COVID19 selfisolation  Digital contacts are not aimed at replacing personal communication with family, partners or friends or diminishing the intensity of such contacts;instead, they just complement the existing opportunities  Intense communication with the immediate circle in whatever format has a positive impact on individual's social wellbeing and mental health and may prevent depression and loneliness sparking positive emotions  On the contrary, excessive social media usage, impersonal form of contacts ending up a failure to develop stable emotional bonds may result in depression and negatively impact student social and emotional wellbeing  Digitalization has a dual character: it can expand opportunities for social contacts with the immediate social circle in times of crisis or longdistance communication but heavy use of social media may have negative social and psychological impact  Â© 2020 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM  All rights reserved","Andreenkova, A.

"A systematic review and realist synthesis on toilet paper hoarding: COVID or not COVID, that is the question","Objective To explore whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with toilet paper hoarding and to assess which risk factors are associated with the risk of toilet paper hoarding  Design A systematic review and realist review were conducted  Data sources PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched (systematic review)  PubMed, pre-prints and grey literature were also searched (realist review)  The databases were searched from inception until October 2020  Study selection There were no restrictions on the study design  Outcomes and measures For the systematic review, toilet paper hoarding was the main outcome, and pathological use of toilet paper was the secondary outcome  For the realist review, the context-mechanisms-outcome (CMO) scheme included the COVID-19 pandemic (context), four proposed mechanisms, and one outcome (toilet paper hoarding)  The four potential mechanisms were (1) gastrointestinal mechanisms of COVID-19 (e g  diarrhoea), (2) social cognitive biases, (3) stress-related factors (mental illnesses, personality traits) and (4) cultural aspects (e g  differences between countries)  Eligibility criteria for selecting studies All studies of human populations were considered (including general population studies and clinical studies of patients suffering from mental health problems)  Results The systematic review identified 14 studies (eight studies for the main outcome, six studies for the secondary outcome)  Three surveys identified the role of the COVID-19 threat in toilet paper hoarding in the general population  One study pointed to an association between a personality trait (conscientiousness) and toilet paper buying and stockpiling as well as an additional significant indirect effect of emotionality through the perceived threat of COVID-19 on toilet paper buying and stockpiling  Six case reports of pathological use of toilet paper were also identified, although none of them were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic  The realist review suggested that of all the mechanisms, social cognitive biases and a bandwagon effect were potential contributors to toilet paper hoarding in the general population  The stressful situation (COVID-19 pandemic) and some personality traits (conscientiousness) were found to be associated with toilet paper hoarding  Cultural differences were also identified, with relatively substantial effects of toilet paper hoarding in several Asian regions (Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore)  Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a worldwide increase in toilet paper hoarding  Social media and social cognitive biases are major contributors and might explain some differences in toilet paper hoarding between countries  Other mental health-related factors, such as the stressful situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear of contagion, or particular personality traits (conscientiousness), are likely to be involved  Registration PROSPERO CRD42020182308","Labad, Javier, GonzÃ¡lez-RodrÃ­guez, Alexandre, Cobo, Jesus, PuntÃ­, Joaquim, FarrÃ©, Josep Maria","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10771","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: PeerJ;2021.; Publication details: PeerJ;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10179,""

"[COVID-19 and plastic surgery: aesthetic surgery or essential medical care? - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient care in the plastic surgery department at an university hospital]","Ã¢â‚¬â€šIn spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic required far-reaching changes and measures of unprecedented extent. These measures were implemented to reduce virus spread and to ensure the continuity of nation-wide medical care, in particular with a view to having sufficient intensive-care capacities in case of a large caseload of patients infected with COVID-19. With regard to surgical specialties, this implied a temporary hold on elective cases for an indefinite period of time. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these measures on the caseload of a level-three plastic surgery unit. Ã¢â‚¬â€šThis study retrospectively assessed the caseload at the Division of Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical University Graz during the so-called lockdown from 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°March 2020 to 27Ã¢â‚¬â€°April 2020 (6Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks) as well as two weeks before. The data was compared with the corresponding time period of the year 2019.Ã¢â‚¬â€°Surgical spectrum, procedural urgency, medical indication of surgical procedures as well as complication rates were compared. Ã¢â‚¬â€šThe suspension of elective cases led to a significant reduction in caseload of 57.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°% (2019: 353, 2020: 150 cases). There was a significant increase in emergency and acute case procedures performed during the lockdown compared with the previous year (2019: 41, 2020: 58 cases, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Furthermore, the number of self-inflicted injuries and suicide attempts increased significantly (2019: 0, 2020: 16 cases, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). With regard to private and work-related injuries, there was no significant difference. Also, there was no difference in complication rates (2019: 6.8, 2020: 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.219). Ã¢â‚¬â€šA significant amount of surgical procedures in plastic surgery at a supraregional academic health centre consists of emergency, acute and urgent medically necessary cases. During the lockdown, surgical procedures were performed without a significant increase in complication rates. Despite challenges during the pandemic, high-quality patient care was provided throughout. To process less urgent yet important cases accumulated during the lockdown in a reasonable amount of time and maintaining the same level of high-quality care, additional capacities regarding operating rooms, hospital beds and outpatient care are needed. These results point out the importance of plastic surgery for medical care, in particular during times of crisis. Ã¢â‚¬â€šIm FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 machte die COVID-19-Pandemie weitreichende VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen und MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen in bisher nie dagewesenem AusmaÃƒÅ¸ notwendig. Diese MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen zielten einerseits darauf ab die Ausbreitung der Virusinfektion einzudÃƒÂ¤mmen, und andererseits die landesweite Krankenversorgung weiterhin zu gewÃƒÂ¤hrleisten, insbesondere um im Falle einer grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÅ¸eren Anzahl an mit COVID-19 infizierten Patienten ausreichend IntensivkapazitÃƒÂ¤ten zur VerfÃƒÂ¼gung zu haben. In Bezug auf operative FÃƒÂ¤cher bedeutete dies das temporÃƒÂ¤re Aussetzen des Elektivprogramms auf unbestimmte Zeit. Ziel dieser Studie war es die Auswirkung dieser MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen auf das Behandlungsspektrum eines plastisch-chirurgischen Zentrums zu evaluieren. Ã¢â‚¬â€šDie Operationszahlen der klinischen Abteilung fÃƒÂ¼r Plastische, Ãƒâ€žsthetische und Rekonstruktive Chirurgie der medizinischen UniversitÃƒÂ¤t Graz wÃƒÂ¤hrend des sog. Lockdowns von 16.3.2020 bis 26.4.2020 (6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Wochen) sowie 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Wochen davor wurden retrospektiv erhoben. Die Daten wurden zum korrespondierende Vorjahreszeitraum verglichen. Untersucht wurden u.Ã¢â‚¬â€°a. Operationsspektrum, Dringlichkeit, Indikation und Komplikationsraten. Ã¢â‚¬â€šDurch den Wegfall des Elektivprogramms kam es wÃƒÂ¤hrend des Lockdowns im Jahresvergleich zu einem signifikanten RÃƒÂ¼ckgang der OP-Zahlen um 57,5Ã¢â‚¬â€°% (2019: 353, 2020Ã¢â‚¬â€°150Ã¢â‚¬â€°FÃƒÂ¤lle). WÃƒÂ¤hrend des Lockdowns wurden im Jahresvergleich signifikant mehr Notfall- und Akuteingriffe durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt (2019: 41, 2020: 58Ã¢â‚¬â€°FÃƒÂ¤lle, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,001). AuÃƒÅ¸erdem wurde eine signifikante HÃƒÂ¤ufung von Selbstverletzungen bzw. Suizidversuchen beobachtet (2019: 0, 2020: 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°FÃƒÂ¤lle, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,001). Hinsichtlich Privat- und ArbeitsunfÃƒÂ¤llen gab es keine signifikanten Unterschiede. Es zeigte sich auch kein signifikanter Unterschied bezÃƒÂ¼glich der Komplikationsrate (2019: 6,8, 2020: 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,219). Ã¢â‚¬â€šEin signifikanter Anteil plastisch-chirurgischer Operationen an einem UniversitÃƒÂ¤tsklinikum mit ÃƒÂ¼berregionalem Versorgungsauftrag besteht aus Notfalloperationen, akuten und dringenden medizinisch notwendigen Operationen. WÃƒÂ¤hrend des Lockdowns wurden Operationen ohne signifikanten Anstieg der Komplikationsrate durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt.

"Disability and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury","To identify the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), with particular attention to unique effects for individuals with chronic disability. Individuals with and without a history of TBI completed a web-based survey. Participants were recruited from the Vanderbilt Brain Injury Patient Registry in Nashville, TN and completed the survey from their homes between May and June 2020, during social distancing related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 47 individuals in the chronic phase of moderate-severe TBI (&gt;6 months post-injury) and 51 non-injured healthy comparison (NC) peers completed the survey. Participants, or respondents, answered a mix of multiple-choice and free-text questions about how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their work, education, medical care, social communication, sources of information and decision-making, and mental and physical well-being. Individuals with TBI also answered questions about how TBI has affected their experiences of the pandemic. As a group, respondents with TBI reported less pandemic-related behavior change (e.g., daily habits, virtual social visits, and masking) than NC peers. Both NCs and respondents with TBI identified healthcare providers as trusted sources of public health information. One third of individuals with TBI indicated that brain injury has made coping with the pandemic more difficult, and respondents identified mental health challenges and social isolation as key barriers. These results suggest that healthcare providers should look for ways to provide tailored education and reduce social isolation for individuals with disability during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss a number of direct suggestions from participant responses.","Morrow, Patel, Duff","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2021.01.064","20210202","COVID-19; disability; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10199,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply and demand in the WHO African Region","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected millions of people worldwide and caused disruptions at the global level including in healthcare provision. Countries of the WHO African region have put in place measures for the COVID-19 pandemic containment that may adversely affect blood system activities and subsequently reduce the supply and demand of blood and blood components. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply and demand in the WHO African Region and propose measures to address the challenges faced by countries. A survey questionnaire was sent to all 47 countries in the WHO African Region to collect information on blood supply and demand for the first 5Ã‚Â months of 2019 and 2020, respectively, and on COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma therapy in September 2020. Thirty-seven countries provided responses. The total number of blood donations dropped in 32 countries while it increased in five countries. The proportion of blood drives also decreased in 21 countries and increased in nine countries. The blood requested and issued for transfusion decreased for blood demand and for blood issued for transfusion in 30 countries. Ten countries reported some activities of convalescent plasma. However, very few units of this product collected have been transfused to COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction of blood related activities in the region, including the supply and demand. Countries preparedness plans for health emergencies need more emphasis to maintaining blood stock.","Loua, Kasilo, Nikiema, Sougou, Kniazkov, Annan","https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13071","20210202","COVID-19 pandemic; WHO African Region; blood demand; blood donation; blood supply; convalescent Plasma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10200,""
"Rapid expansion of direct-to-consumer telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case series","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought many challenges to patient care delivery. The need for social distancing and relaxing of federal and state telemental health regulations paved the way for widespread adoption of direct-to-consumer (DTC) ambulatory mental health video visits. We present cases that demonstrate the use of video visits across 6 clinical areas, each serving a unique population of patients, in a large behavioral health system. The benefits and limitations of this modality are illustrated in children, adults, and older adults with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, intellectual disability, substance use disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and schizophrenia. Although telephone visits were acceptable and necessary to serve some patients, there are many advantages to video visits in providing best patient care. Education and support for telemental health-delivered to both patients and clinicians-is critical to the success of the DTC model. DTC telemental health is a widespread clinical tool used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because this model has many strengths and advantages compared with traditional telemental health delivered in a clinic, regulators and insurers should be open to its continued use postpandemic when clinically appropriate.","Gannon, Schlesinger, Glance, Sujata, Fredrick, Wyler, Perez","https://doi.org/10.12788/acp.0020","20210202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10201,""
"Third Annual Summer Research Summit on Health Equity Organized by the Center of Excellence in Health Equity, Training and Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA on June 9, 2020","This year's summit was unique given the COVID-19 pandemic: a major global outbreak that has imposed severe restrictions in all aspects of our life. At the outset, we were faced with three mutually exclusive options. First option was to cancel the summit in its entirety: this was the easiest and most obvious choice once the COVID-19 pandemic forced a near total lockdown all over the country with unprecedented disruptions of normal daily activities as the disease announced its thunderous touchdown on United States (US) soil. It was also the most-logical response faced with uncertainty regarding summit logistics and expected poor attendance due to the raging pandemic. Second option was to conduct a digital summit restricted to local audiences at Baylor College of Medicine: this option entailed implementing a virtual summit with attendance restricted to participants from our institution only. It sounded like a reasonable choice but that would impede the presence of diversity of topics, perspectives, insights and experiential learning opportunities, which are what render the summit exciting and worth attending. And finally, the last option was to conduct a digital unrestricted summit open to all interested audiences throughout the US. The conduct of a virtual summit open to all participants from around the country was initially considered daunting given the likelihood of amplified technical problems associated with an array of internet access differentials around the country, which would require a strong Information Technology (IT) presence throughout the sessions. Nonetheless, the attractiveness of going national with a virtual summit, despite the pandemic and logistical challenges, slowly gained converts and became the dominant choice. The response and level of participation in this first virtual summit showed an unanticipated surge despite the increase in registration fees to cover IT costs. This year, we had attendees from all regions of the US as well as from the United Kingdom. The range of topics was quite diverse encompassing health disparities in relation to cancers, nutrition, musculo-skeletal disorders, amputation rates, vaccination uptakes and COVID-19 infections. Various solutions were passionately presented to address these disparities including novel health technologies, community engagement and partnerships, improvement in health literacy and alternative therapeutics. There were no hitches despite the complex breakout sessions, and above all, attendees were satisfied and offered outstanding evaluation scores. This was definitely a summit that metamorphosed from pessimism to a triumphant success! <i>Copyright Ã‚Â© 2020 Salihu et al. Published by Global Health and Education Projects, Inc.

"The impact of Covid-19-related distress on general health, oral behaviour, psychosocial features, disability and pain intensity in a cohort of Italian patients with temporomandibular disorders","This study aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 distress on psychological status, features of central sensitization and facial pain severity in people with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). In this prospective cohort study, 45 adults (19 chronic, 26 acute/subacute TMD) were recruited prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Baseline assessment took place before the outbreak while a follow-up was performed immediately after the lockdown period. Multiple variables were investigated including age, gender, perceived life quality, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, coping strategies, central sensitization, pain intensity, pain-related disability and oral behaviour. COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were applied at follow-up to measure the extent of COVID-related distress. CSS were significantly higher in those with chronic TMDs compared to those with acute/subacute TMDs (p&lt;0.05). In people with chronic TMD, the variation in anxiety and depression from baseline to follow-up was significantly correlated with scores on the CSS (r = 0.72; p = 0.002). Variations of the central sensitization inventory (r = 0.57; p = 0.020) and graded chronic pain scale (r = 0.59; p = 0.017) were significantly correlated with scores on the CSS. These initial findings indicate that people with chronic TMD were more susceptible to COVID-19 distress with deterioration of psychological status, worsening features of central sensitization and increased chronic facial pain severity. These findings reinforce the role of stress as a possible amplifier of central sensitization, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and pain-related disability in people with TMDs.

"Physical and mental health outcomes including behavior and attitudes in people having social contacts with COVID-19 patients","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread worldwide since late 2019. People who have social contacts with COVID-19 patients might be at higher risk of physical or mental health problems. This study investigated whether people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients would have poorer physical or mental outcomes, and different attitudes and behaviors. Chinese adults were recruited to fill in an online survey using snowball sampling during 21st-26nd February 2020. Physical symptoms, psychological outcomes, quality of life, COVID-19 related attitudes, and behaviors were measured. The differences in the outcomes between participants who had COVID-19 social contacts and those who had not were analyzed. The survey included 1,447 non-infected eligible participants. Among those, 173 (12.0%) reported at least one confirmed/suspected case in their social contacts. In the multiple regression adjusted for demographic data, the presence of confirmed/suspected infection cases in one's social contacts was significantly associated with poorer physical and mental outcomes, lower health-related quality of life, and different COVID-19 related attitudes and behaviors (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients were at risk of adverse health outcomes. Future studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts. Similarly, strategies to improve health outcomes for these people are needed.","Xu, Zhang, Xu, Li, Xie, Sun, Lee, Yip, Mo, Xiao, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245945","20210202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10204,""
"Retrospective study in clinical governance and financing system impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the hand surgery and microsurgery HUB center","The authors presented a retrospective study in the surgical activity of the HUB center for Hand Surgery and Microsurgery in Emilia-Romagna comparing the data between March and April 2020, in the peak of Covid pandemic, with the same period in 2019. During the two months period of March-April 2020 versus 2019 the authors analyzed the surgical procedures performed in elective and emergency surgery with hospitalization and Day or Outpatient surgery regime. Surgical treatments with no hospitalization were planned in the Day-Surgery Service. The financing system impacts were analyzed according to the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), the costs accounting method mostly used in European countries. An overall reduction of 68.5% was recorded in surgical procedures, with a more relevant reduction of 92.3% in elective surgery and a significantly less relevant reduction of 37.2% in urgent one. Replantation did not present a reduction in number of cases, while cutting lesions of tendons at the hand and fingers increased such as the bone and ligament injuries during domestic accidents. The negative impact in the financial system recorded a reduction of 32.5%. The epidemiology of hand trauma looks not only at the artisanal and industrial injuries, but also mostly at the accidents in daily life activities. The data of the study evidenced the significantly increase in the injuries occurring in the domestic environment. Elective surgery was canceled. The 86% of surgical procedures performed were urgent ones and the 72.8% of these were possible in Day and Outpatient surgery with significantly reduction in hospitalization. All procedures followed a rigid process for patient and healthcare workers with regard for personal protection and safety. Telemedicine was arranged in emergencies, and economic damage was analyzed also in the following rebound effect during summer period. The significantly less reduction recorded in urgent surgery vs the more relevant reduction in elective one showed how the hand injuries remained a major issue also during the lockdown. The data highlighted the relevant role of the organizational aspects of the surgical procedures and planning in hand trauma. Despite the financial impact of the elective surgery, the presence of a functional and skill Emergency Service and Day-Surgery Service resulted fundamental in the efficacy and efficiency of the patient management and in containment of economic damage. The telemedicine was significantly limited by liability and risk management issues.","Leti Acciaro, Montanari, Venturelli, Starnoni, Adani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-021-00700-3","20210202","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Hand surgery; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10205,""
"[Health-related consequences of social isolation: aÃ‚Â qualitative study on psychosocial stress and resources among older adults in the COVID-19 pandemic]","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to aÃ‚Â general uncertainty about risk and consequences of the disease. Older adults are specifically vulnerable with regard to severe courses of the disease and have been particularly encouraged to self-isolate during the pandemic. Subsequently, expressions of concern have been raised regarding the negative impact of disease risk and quarantine on the mental health of older people. Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study follows aÃ‚Â qualitative research design. Between May and June 2020 NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully transcribed. AÃ‚Â qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA. Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting points for older people. Older adults appear to be able to preserve their mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relevance of mental resources of older adults for supporting younger generations seems to be unrecognized.

"Assessment of Suicide in Japan During the COVID-19 Pandemic vs Previous Years","There are concerns that suicide rates may have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To assess whether suicide rates in Japan increased in April through November 2020 compared with previous years. This cross-sectional study used national data obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare from 2016 to 2020 on the monthly number of individuals who died of suicide in Japan from January to November of 2016 to 2020. 2020 vs previous years. The main outcome was monthly suicide rates, calculated as the number of individuals who died of suicide divided by the total population. A difference-in-difference regression model was used to estimate the change in monthly suicide rates in April to November 2020 vs these months in 2016 to 2019. Analyses included 90Ã¢â‚¬Â¯048 individuals (61Ã¢â‚¬Â¯366 [68.1%] men) who died of suicide from 2016 to 2020. The difference-in-difference analysis of men showed that there was no increase in suicide rates from April through September 2020 compared with these months in 2016 to 2019, but that suicide rates were increased in October (difference-in-difference, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.67] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population) and November (difference-in-difference, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.60] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population). Among women, suicide rates in 2020 compared with 2016 to 2019 increased in July (difference-in-difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.38] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population), August (difference-in-difference, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.45] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population), September (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population), October (difference-in-difference, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population), and November (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population). In secondary analyses in which the suicide rates of 2020 were compared with the expected rates based on trends from 2011 to 2019, the increases in suicide rates were most pronounced among men aged younger than 30 years (eg, November: observed vs expected rate ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.26-1.71]) and women aged younger than 30 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.76 to 2.52]) and 30 to 49 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.01 to 2.58]).

"Mobile Health-Supported HIV Self-Testing Strategy Among Urban Refugee and Displaced Youth in Kampala, Uganda: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Trial (Tushirikiane, Supporting Each Other)","HIV is the leading cause of mortality among youth in sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda hosts over 1.43 million refugees, and more than 83,000 live in Kampala, largely in informal settlements. There is limited information about HIV testing uptake and preferences among urban refugee and displaced youth. HIV self-testing is a promising method for increasing testing uptake. Further, mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been effective in increasing HIV testing uptake and could be particularly useful among youth. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two HIV self-testing implementation strategies (HIV self-testing intervention alone and HIV self-testing combined with an mHealth intervention) in comparison with the HIV testing standard of care in terms of HIV testing outcomes among refugee/displaced youth aged 16 to 24 years in Kampala, Uganda. A three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented across five informal settlements grouped into three sites, based on proximity, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1:1 method. Approximately 450 adolescents (150 per cluster) will be enrolled and followed for 12 months. Data will be collected at the following three time points: baseline enrollment, 8 months after enrollment, and 12 months after enrollment. Primary outcomes (HIV testing frequency, HIV status knowledge, linkage to confirmatory testing, and linkage to HIV care) and secondary outcomes (depression, condom use efficacy, consistent condom use, sexual relationship power, HIV stigma, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health stigma) will be evaluated. The study has been conducted in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. The study has received ethical approval from the University of Toronto (June 14, 2019), Mildmay Uganda (November 11, 2019), and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (August 3, 2020).

"Belgium: Health System Review","The Belgian health system covers almost the entire population for a large range of services. The main source of financing is social contributions, proportional to income. The provision of care is based on the principles of independent medical practice, free choice of physician and care facility, and predominantly fee-for-service payment. The Belgian population enjoys good health and long life expectancy. This is partly due to the population's good access to many high-quality health services. However, some challenges remain in terms of appropriateness of pharmaceutical care (overuse of antibiotics and psychotropic drugs), reduced accessibility for mental health and dental care due to higher user charges, socioeconomic inequalities in health status and the need for further strengthening of prevention policies. The system must also continue to evolve to cope with an ageing population, an increase of chronic diseases and the development of new technologies. This Belgian HiT profile (2020) presents the evolution of the health system since 2014, including detailed information on new policies. The most important reforms concern the transfer of additional health competences from the Federal State to the Federated entities and the plan to redesign the landscape of hospital care. Policy-makers have also pursued the goals of further improving access to high-quality services, while maintaining the financial sustainability and efficiency of the system, resulting in the implementation of several measures promoting multidisciplinary and integrated care, the concentration of medical expertise, patient care trajectories, patient empowerment, evidence-based medicine, outcome-based care and the so-called one health approach. Cooperation with neighbouring countries on pricing and reimbursement policies to improve access to (very high price) innovative medicines are also underway. Looking ahead, because additional challenges will be highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis, a focus on the resilience of the system is expected.","Gerkens, Merkur","https://www.google.com/search?q=Belgium:+Health+System+Review.","20210203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10211,""

Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify factors associated with psychological distress outcomes. Among the 834 patients with breast cancer included in the study, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was 21.6%, 15.5%, and 14.7%, respectively. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of these symptoms was observed between patients in Wuhan and those outside Wuhan. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that comorbidity, living alone, deterioration of breast cancer, and affected treatment plan were risk factors for psychological distress including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. When stratified by location, living alone was associated with depression and insomnia only among patients in Wuhan, but not those outside Wuhan. This study shows an elevated prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among patients with breast cancer during part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with comorbidity, living alone, deterioration of breast cancer, and whose treatment plan was affected should be paid more attention to prevent mental disorders.","Chen, Wang, Liu, Jiang, Wang, Zhou, Shao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-05994-4","20210202","Anxiety; Breast cancer; COVID-19; Depression; Insomnia; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10212,""
"Teaching Mental Health and Well-Being Online in a Crisis: Fostering Love and Self-compassion in Clinical Social Work Education","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has shifted clinical social work (CSW) and mental health education in Australia, and indeed throughout much of the globe, onto online delivery. The disruption caused by COVID-19 presents unexpected challenges in fostering the development of skill sets among social work educators in partnership with students. This article is a reflexive collaborative autoethnography written by four educators of different international and cultural backgrounds at a regional university in Queensland. Our university has experienced a shift from primarily a face-to-face delivery to online delivery due to social distancing. This article is grounded in an ethic of love, a values-based relationship-oriented practice promoting care, collaborative dialogue and solidarity between people, using self-compassion and reflexivity. We explore how COVID-19 has forced the authors to alter their teaching practice, cope with uncertainties, and respond with loving kindness to the shifting needs of students. We draw upon our experiences as educators of diverse cultural, linguistic, gender, and sexualities from Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Nigeria and reflect upon how we have simultaneously turned inward and outward through technology. We draw upon person-centered, narrative, trauma informed and anti-oppressive clinical and educational approaches when exploring self-compassion and loving approaches with the students. We discuss the need for self-compassion and love of others as we respond to the current crisis by modeling self-compassion and love for CSW students who are experiencing crises, including loss of employment, separation from family overseas and interstate, isolation from colleagues and loved ones, and healthcare issues.","Gates, Ross, Bennett, Jonathan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00786-z","20210202","Clinical educators; Clinical social work; Love; Online education; Reflexive collaborative autoethnography; Self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10213,""
"PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE SPANISH VERSION OF THE FEAR OF COVID-19 SCALE IN PARAGUAYAN POPULATION","The aim of this study is to test the psychometric properties of the Spanish validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Paraguayan population. Participants were recruited through an Internet-based survey. All participants whose scores in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and The Fear Questionnaire (FQ) were greater than zero were included. 1245 subjects responded voluntarily: 1077 subjects, scoring &gt;0, were considered. To establish construct validity of the FCV-19S, an exploratory factor analysis was performed using the KMO test, which was adequate, and the Bartlett sphericity test, which was significant (p &lt;.0001). The CFI, NFI, GFI, TLI and RMSEA indices were used to evaluate the model and showed good adjustment. Cronbach's alpha showed valid internal consistency (ÃŽÂ±=0.86). This validation is supported by significant correlation (p &lt;.001) with the HADS scale for anxiety and depression and with the FQ scale for specific phobia. The Spanish version of the FCV-19S, validated in Paraguayan population, is a 7-item scale with two dimensions, psychological symptoms (items 1, 2, 4, and 5) and physiological symptoms (items 3, 6, and 7) with robust psychometric properties.","Barrios, RÃƒÂ­os-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, O'Higgins, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Urbieta, GarcÃƒÂ­a, AlmirÃƒÂ³n-Santacruz, Navarro, Melgarejo, Ruiz DÃƒÂ­az, Castaldelli-Maia, Ventriglio, Torales","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.5","20210202","COVID-19; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; psychometrics; reliability; validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10214,""
"Practical tips for prevention of cardiovascular disease in women after quarantine for COVID-19 disease","To contain the spread of CoV-19 / SARS-CoV-2 infection, several governments have imposed collective quarantine on the population. All of these restrictions have influenced women's health and induced an unhealthy lifestyle that, in some cases, could persist after the lockdown. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on women's lifestyle. Quarantine is associated with stress and depression, which lead to unhealthy nutrition and reduced physical activity, particularly in women. Unhealthy diet is usually poor in fruit and vegetables, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a weapon in the fight against the Covid-19. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. In addition, women are less likely to engage in regular physical activity and have increased sitting time and sedentary behaviors during quarantine, which have led to weight gain. During quarantine strategies to increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet have been implemented. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy Diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage women to return to a good lifestyle routine.","Mattioli, Toni, Coppi, Farinetti","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10284","20210202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10215,""

High grade students, females and low-income families are at higher risk to develop psychiatric symptoms. Psychological distress can be reduced by maintaining contact with peers through social networks and by accurate updates provided by the government through the mass media. Online resources such as information about mental health education and preventive measure, video-counselling, telemedicine and telepsychiatry services, can be useful to reduce the psychosocial effects of the novel coronavirus. there is urgent need to plan new strategies for early psychological interventions in order to reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents mental health status.","Deolmi, Pisani","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10870","20210202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10216,""
"Meaning in life and demoralization: a mental-health reading perspective of suicidality in the time of COVID-19","Consequences on mental health have been reported in general population, vulnerable individuals, psychiatric patients, and healthcare professionals. It is urgently necessary to study mental health issues in order to set priorities for public health policies and implement effective interventions. Suicidality is one of the most extreme outcomes of a mental health crisis. It is currently too early to know what the effect of COVID-19 will be on suicidality. However, authoritative commentary papers alert that most of the factors precipitating suicide are, and probably will be for a long time, present at several individual existence levels. A number of prevention measures and research considerations have been drawn up. A point of the latter, recommended by the International COVID-10 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration, states that &quot;the COVID-19 suicide research response should be truly multidisciplinary. This will foster research that addresses the different aspects and layers of risk and resilience.It will also foster research that informs prevention efforts by taking a range of perspectives&quot; (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020). In this light, we would like to propose a reading perspective of suicidality that takes into account Meaning in Life (MiL) and demoralization. Both of the constructs were studied in heterogeneous populations with extreme life situations having led to a fracture between a &quot;before&quot; and an &quot;after&quot;, and play a role in affecting suicidality, respectively as resilience and risk factors. In clinical practice, during these unprecedent times, we wish that this more inclusive approach could: 1) contribute to prevention, by delineating more individualized suicidal risk profiles in persons conventionally non-considered at risk but here exposed to an extremely uncommon experience, 2) enrich supportive/psychotherapeutic interventions, by broadening the panel of means to some aspects constitutive of the existential condition of a person who is brutally confronted with something unexpected, incomprehensible and, in some ways, still unpredictable.","Costanza, Di Marco, Burroni, Corasaniti, Santinon, Prelati, Chytas, Cedraschi, Ambrosetti","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10515","20210202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10217,""

"Pandemic COVID-19: the residents' resilience","Healthcare workers are often exposed to secondary traumatic stress. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak caused intense psychological pressure in various healthcare professionals, with increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. Objective of our study was to evaluate the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder in italian residents in Intensive Care and Emergency Departments facing COVID-19 emergency. We developed a short, anonymous web-questionnaire to obtain data regarding sociodemographic, professional characteristics, history of psychological trauma, psychotherapy, use of psychiatric medications and the presence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Primary outcome was the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Secondary endpoint was to identify possible risk factors associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised.Ã‚ A cut-off of 33 identified a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder while a cut-off of 22 identified subclinical post-traumatic stress disorder. 503 residents completed the questionnaire. Among residents who were directly involved in the clinical assistance of COVID-19 patients, 34.3% presented a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, while 21.5% presented subclinical post-traumatic stress disorder. Female gender and history of psychological trauma were significantly associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Our data suggest a high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder in Italian residents working in Intensive Care Units and Emergency Departments during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This finding supports the importance of promptly implementing any strategy that might preserve staff mental health.","Pasin, Sella, Correale, Boscolo, Mormando, Zordan, Landoni, Navalesi","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10061","20210202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10219,""
"The effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a school-based intervention to improve sleep and psychological wellbeing in adolescents","Introduction: Adolescents are vulnerable to experiencing insufficient sleep which can increase the risk of developing insomnia, mental/physical health problems and mood regulation. School-based sleep improvement interventions (SBSII) have been developed utilising Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia techniques and found improvements in sleep knowledge and behaviour. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a school-based sleep improvement intervention (iSLEEP) for improving sleep and psychological wellbeing in adolescents. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. The participants (115, aged 12-15) were recruited from secondary schools in Scotland. iSLEEP comprised of three lessons, combining formal sleep education and CBT-I, and were delivered over three consecutive weeks. Baseline (1 week before lesson 1) and follow-up (1 week following lesson 3) assessments comprised of self-report questionnaires to measure change in sleep, depression, anxiety and stress. Two weeks following the final lesson, a convenience sample of 19 pupils (14 females) were recruited to participate in focus groups. Results: There were significant improvements in overall sleep and marginal differences between those who were categorised with â€˜probable insomniaâ€™ at baseline and likewise for â€˜good sleepersâ€™. There were no significant improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress. Two themes and two sub-themes were generated. Participants reported that iSLEEP was acceptable and improved their sleep. Conclusions: These findings indicate that iSLEEP is an effective, feasible and acceptable SBSII. Future research should aim to utilise a controlled design to further investigate the efficacy of iSLEEP.","Stephanie Mccrory et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-0BB-152","20210203","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention; school-based intervention; adolescent sleep","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10220,""
"Examining changes in parent-reported child and adolescent mental health throughout the UKâ€™s first COVID-19 national lockdown","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the lives of children and adolescents, forcing them into periods of prolonged social isolation and time away from school. Understanding the psychological consequences of the UKâ€™s lockdown for children and adolescents, the associated risk factors, and how trajectories may vary for children and adolescents in different circumstances is essential so that the most vulnerable children and adolescents can be identified and appropriate support can be implemented. Methods Parents and carers (n = 2988) in the U.K. with children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their childâ€™s mental health. Growth curve analysis was used to examine the changes in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms between the end of March/beginning of April and July using data from four monthly assessments. Additionally, growth mixture modelling identified mental health trajectories for conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms separately and subsequent regression models were used to estimate predictors of mental health trajectory membership. Results Overall levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over time whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July. Change over time varied according to child age, the presence of siblings, and with Special Educational Needs (SEN)/ Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ND). Subsequent growth mixture modelling identified three, four and five trajectories for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems and emotional symptoms, respectively. Though many children maintained â€œstable 3 lowâ€ symptoms, others experienced elevated symptoms by July. These children were more likely to have a parent/carer with higher levels of psychological distress, to have SEN/ND, or to be younger in age. Conclusions The findings support previous literature and highlight that certain risk factors were associated with poorer mental health trajectories for children and adolescents during the pandemic.","Jasmine Raw et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-08D-4C1","20210203","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; adolescents; children; covid-19; mental health; lockdown; united kingdom","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10221,""
"Storm Clouds and Silver Linings: Impacts of COVID-19 and Daily Emotional Health in Adolescent Girls","Objective: Changes to daily life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to contribute to adolescent girlsâ€™ emotional health in both positive and negative ways, but the effects of these profound changes on adolescent daily functioning are unknown. Method: We conducted a 10-day daily diary study in a sample of 93 U.S. adolescent girls (aged 12-17) enriched for temperamental risk for anxiety and depression. The study was conducted in April/May 2020 when all participants were under state-issued stay-at-home orders. Girls provided daily reports of positive and negative affect, depressive and anxious symptoms, activities, and positive and negative impacts resulting from the pandemic. Results: Girls reported engaging in many activities that may contribute to well-being. Positive impacts associated with improved same-day emotional health included spending more time with family, more time to relax, and reduced pressure from school and activities. Negative impacts associated with poorer same-day emotional health included problems with online schooling, lack of space/privacy, lack of a regular schedule, and family conflict. Conclusion: Findings suggest that, when safe and feasible, families and communities should prioritize in-person or quality online schooling, resources and space for learning, promoting daily routines, and spending time with their teens while reducing conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic also appears to have offered many adolescent girls a respite from the chronic stress associated with modern teen life, with time to relax and engage in creative and healthy pursuits showing benefits for daily emotional health, which should be considered following the return to normal life.","Jennifer Susan Silk et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614B-ADE-C32","20210202","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; daily diary; covid-19; emotion; anxiety; depression; adolescent","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-03","",10222,""
