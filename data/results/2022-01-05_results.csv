"Easing Burnout in Health Care","Health care workers were already stressed before the pandemic. Now, deep into the second year of COVID-19, many find their mental health sliding even further. In the USA, some have had to care for desperately ill but recalcitrant patients who had access to a vaccine but refused to take it. Others, in both the USA and around the world, are working in hospitals, especially rural ones, which are perilously short-staffed [1].","Reynolds","https://doi.org/10.1109/MPULS.2021.3128987","20220104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24569,""
"Developing mental health nursing strategies for the inbound quarantined population in China during the COVID-19 global pandemic","The aim of the study was to develop mental health nursing strategies for the inbound quarantined population based on the results of a survey study and frontline nursing experiences. A mixed research method was selected, we collected data by questionnaires from 128 quarantined people, and by semi-structured interviews from 5 registered nurses. Generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used in the quantitative research to identify the prevalence of psychological issues and risk factors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the qualitative study to conclude nursing experiences from RNs. The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were 34%, 41%, and 18% respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that social support, urban residence, and chronic disease were associated with mental health problems in certain aspects. Three themes were emerged from the analysis of RNs interviews: personality, chronic diseases, and social support. The prevalence of mental health issues in the inbound quarantined population was the same as the general population in the initial stage of COVID-19 outbreak, and significantly lower than people who lived in high-risk areas. Living in urban areas, with chronic diseases, and obtaining less social support are the risk factors. Finally, four nursing strategies were proposed by the research team for mental health well-being.","Zhao, Ma","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202112_27646","20220104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24570,""
"How physical activity behavior affected well-being, anxiety and sleep quality during COVID-19 restrictions in Iran","The Islamic Republic of Iran has displayed one of the highest rates of COVID-19 infection in the world and the highest rate of mortality in the Middle East. Iran has used a stringent package of preventive health measures to mitigate the spread of infection, which however has negatively affected individuals' physical and psychological health. This study aimed at examining whether physical-activity (PA) behavior, anxiety, well-being, and sleep-quality changed in response to the COVID-19-related public health restrictions enforced in Iran. An online questionnaire was disseminated to adults residing in Iran from November 17, 2020, to February 13, 2021 (~88 days), during Iran's strictest public health restrictions. Main outcome measures included Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. A total of 3,323 adults (mean age 30Ã‚Â±11 years, 54.3% female) participated in the survey. Firstly, the restrictions generally reduced PA behavior: (a) among inactive participants (IPs), 60.6% became less active vs. 5.1% who became more active; and (b) among active participants (APs), 49.9% became less active vs. 22.8% who became more active. Secondly, PA behavior was associated with higher well-being and sleep quality during the restrictions: (a) APs reported higher (or lower) levels of well-being and sleep quality (or anxiety) than did IPs; and (b) among IPs as well as among APs, the more active the participants, the greater (or lower) the levels of well-being and sleep quality (or anxiety). This study showed the beneficial role of PA behavior for well-being, anxiety, and sleep quality during the COVID-19 restrictions, whereas such restrictions appeared to decrease PA participation. Active lifestyle should be then encouraged during the COVID-19 outbreak while taking precautions.","Akbari, Pourabbas, Yoosefi, Briki, Attaran, Mansoor, Moalla, Damak, Dergaa, Teixeira, Nauman, Behm, Bragazzi, Ben Saad, Lavie, Ghram","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202112_27632","20220104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24571,""
"Psychological demands of health professionals in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Recent literature emphasizes how the specific stressors of the COVID-19 outbreak affect the general population and frontline professionals, including those conducting support or backup activities in health units, which can lead to vicarious traumatization. Vicarious traumatization has been used to describe negative emotional reactions in mental health professionals who assist or treat victims of traumatic events. Thus, the aim of this article is to report the actions used in the face of the psychological demands of professionals in a hospital, who were not on the frontline of COVID-19. We collected their sociodemographic information and checked the psychological impact using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), which was followed by a psychoeducational program (topics related to COVID-19 control and prevention), and individual psychological care for the most severe cases. A total of 118 professionals participated in this study; they were between 20 and 67Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old. Mild to moderate anxiety was observed in 36.5% of the medical teams, 83.3% of the administrative staff, and 65.7% of general service workers, while stress symptoms were observed in 80.2%, 83.3%, and 59.9%, respectively. Depressive symptoms (35.3%) were more frequent in general service workers. The medical teams reported the benefits of primary psychological care, while the other professionals demanded more institutional support services related to the prevention and use of personal protective equipment. This study highlights relevant psychological demands that have repercussions on the daily lives of professionals. The psychoeducational program was considered positive regarding clarification actions. However, it was not perceived as effective in reducing fear, which may result from vicarious traumatization and requires other intervention modalities.","Silva, Ioschpe, Diniz, de Oliveira, Saffi, Soares, de Almeida Rocca, de PÃƒÂ¡dua Serafim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41155-021-00204-w","20220104","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychoeducation; Psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24572,""
"A Scoping Review on the Medical and Recreational Use of Cannabis During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background/Introduction:</b> The shelter-in-place orders and social distancing regulations on account of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted lifestyles, including the use of cannabis. The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize both the gray and academic literature on the use of cannabis during the pandemic. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A total of 11 databases, including 2 medical databases, 7 social science databases, and 2 gray literature databases were searched resulting in 316 titles and abstracts of which 76 met inclusion criteria. <b>Results:</b> Nine themes emerged: (a) prevalence and trends of cannabis use during COVID[1]19; (b) demographics; (c) profile of mode of consumption; (d) context of using cannabis (i.e., solitary use vs. in groups); (e) factors contributing to use; (f) factors inhibiting use; (g) adverse clinical and psychiatric outcomes of cannabis use during the pandemic; (h) similarities between EVALI (E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury) and COVID-19 symptoms; (i) implications for policy and practice. Studies published until February 2, 2021 were included in this review. <b>Discussion:</b> Findings have highlighted that feelings of boredom, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic have contributed to an increase in the use of cannabis. Furthermore, accessibility to cannabis was noted to affect use during the pandemic. Adverse psychiatric and clinical outcomes were associated with the increased use of cannabis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Practitioners and policymakers are called to employ harm reduction strategies to respond to increasing cannabis use. There is a need for population-based studies and further examination of factors contributing to the increased use of cannabis during the pandemic and associated negative consequences.","Chong, Acar, West, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1089/can.2021.0054","20220104","COVID-19; cannabis; coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24573,""
"Analysis of Critical COVID-19 Cases Among Children in Korea","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generally asymptomatic or mild in otherwise healthy children, however, severe cases may occur. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics of children classified as critical COVID-19 in Korea to provide further insights into risk factors and management in children. This study was a retrospective case series of children &lt; 18 years of age classified as critical COVID-19. Cases were identified by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency surveillance system and medical records were reviewed. Critical COVID-19 was defined as cases with severe illness requiring noninvasive (high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, or bilevel positive airway pressure) or invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), between January 20, 2020 and October 7, 2021. Among 39,146 cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in subjects &lt; 18 years of age, eight cases (0.02%) were identified as critical COVID-19. The median age was 13 years (range 10 month-17 years) and male-to-female ratio was 1:1. Three children had underlying diseases; one child has asthma and major depressive disorder, one child had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and one child had mental retardation and was newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the eight children, seven were obese (body mass index range [BMI] median 29.3, range 25.9-38.2, weight-for-length &gt; 97% for infant) and one was overweight (BMI 21.3). All patients had fever, six patients had dyspnea or cough and other accompanied symptoms included sore throat, headache, lethargy and myalgia. Radiologic findings showed pneumonia within 1-8 days after symptom onset. Pneumonia progressed in these children for 2-6 days and was improved within 5-32 days after diagnosis. Among the eight critical cases, remdesivir was administered in six cases. Steroids were provided for all cases. Inotropics were administered in one case. Six cases were treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilator and three required mechanical ventilator. One case required ECMO due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. All cases were admitted to the intensive care unit and admission period ranged from 9-39 days. Among all critical COVID-19 cases &lt; 18 years of age, there were no fatal cases. To develop appropriate policies for children in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to monitor and assess the clinical burden in this population.","Lee, Choi, Park, Jo, Choi, Lee, Jung, Chung, Choe, Kim, Park, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e13","20220104","COVID-19; Child; Critical Care; Korea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24574,""

"Fear of COVID-19, compliance with recommendations against virus transmission, and attitudes towards vaccination in Sweden","Following the immense impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and everyday lives world-wide, people's fear of COVID-19 has been studied in a number of settings using the Fear of COVID scale. In Sweden, virus-preventing strategies have differed from comparable countries, with low use of formal lock-down procedures. It is crucial to study correlates of non-compliance with COVID-19 recommendations, and unwillingness to become vaccinated. This study aims to study whether fear of COVID is associated with mental distress and attitudes towards the pandemic, and to study correlates of non-compliance with key anti-COVID recommendations and with reluctancy to vaccination. This anonymous online survey study in web panel participants (N=1,501) aimed to study a range of behavioral changes during COVID-19. Recommendations and vaccinations reluctancy were analyzed in logistic regressions against socio-demographic data, COVID-19 status, and mental health history. Internal consistency of the Fear of COVID scale was calculated. The Fear of COVID scale had a satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach-alpha 0.84), and was significantly associated with compliance with all COVID-19 recommendations and with mental health. Non-compliance with recommendations was associated with low fear of disease and younger age, among other variables. Being against vaccination was associated, among other variables, with low fear of disease and with low education. In conclusion, the Fear of COVID scale appears to be associated with key attitudes towards the COVID-19 disease. Anti-virus strategies may need to promote compliance with recommendations in subgroups who feel low fear of disease or who believe not to be in a risk group for severe disease.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson, Claesdotter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08699","20220104","COVID-19; Fear of COVID scale; mental health; pandemic; recommendation; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24576,""
"Promising best practices implemented in long-term care homes during COVID-19 pandemic to address social isolation and loneliness: a scoping review protocol","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation and loneliness (SIL) affected at least one-third of the older people. The pandemic has prompted governments around the world to implement some extreme measures such as banning public gatherings, imposing social distancing, mobility restrictions and quarantine to control the spread and impact of the novel coronavirus. Though these unprecedented measures may be crucial from a public health perspective, they also have the potential to further exacerbate the problems of SIL among residents in long-term care homes (LTCHs). However, some LTCHs have developed promising best practices (PBPs) to respond to the current situation and prepare for future pandemics. Key aspects of such practices revolve around maintaining and strengthening social connections between residents and their families which helps to reduce SIL. This scoping review looks at existing PBPs that have been implemented to reduce SIL among LTCH residents during the most recent pandemics. We will follow Arksey and O'Malley's framework of scoping review, further developed by Levac <i>et al</i>. In addition, we will also apply the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' 'Methodology for Scoping Reviews'. Ten electronic databases and grey literature will be searched for articles published from January 2003 to March 2021 in either English or French. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts and then full texts for final inclusion. Data will be extracted using a standardised form from 'Evidence for Policy and Practice Information'. The results will be presented in a tabular form and will be summarised and interpreted using a narrative synthesis. Formal ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. Findings will be used to develop a solid knowledge corpus to address the challenges of SIL in LTCHs. Our findings will help to identify cutting edge practices, including technological interventions that could support health services in addressing SIL in the context of LTCHs and our ageing society.","Beogo, Tchouaket, Sia, Bationo, Collin, Tapp, Kassim, RamdÃƒÂ©, Gagnon","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053894","20220104","COVID-19; health informatics; information technology; organisation of health services; protocols &amp; guidelines; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24577,""
"Prospective longitudinal study of 'Sleepless in Lockdown': unpacking differences in sleep loss during the coronavirus pandemic in the UK","COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and women. Concern over direct and indirect effects may also impact on sleep. We explore the levels and social determinants of self-reported sleep loss among the UK population during the pandemic, focusing on ethnic and gender disparities. This prospective longitudinal study analysed data from seven waves of the Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study collected from April 2020 to January 2021 linked to prepandemic data from the 2019 mainstage interviews, providing baseline information about the respondents prior to the pandemic. The analytical sample included 8163 respondents aged 16 and above who took part in all seven waves with full information on sleep loss, defined as experiencing 'rather more' or 'much more' than usual sleep loss due to worry, providing 57Ã¢â‚¬â€°141 observations. Self-reported sleep loss. Mixed-effects regression models were fitted to consider within-individual and between-individual differences. Women were more likely to report sleep loss than men (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 2.4) over the 10-month period. Being female, having young children, perceived financial difficulties and COVID-19 symptoms were all predictive of sleep loss. Once these covariates were controlled for, the bivariate relationship between ethnicity and sleep loss (1.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.4) was reversed (0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). Moreover, the strength of the association between gender and ethnicity and the risk of sleep loss varied over time, being weaker among women in July (0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.7), September (0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.8), November (0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0) and January 2021 (0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9) compared with April 2020, but positively stronger among BAME individuals in May (1.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1), weaker only in September (0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.0). The pandemic has widened sleep deprivation disparities, with women with young children, COVID-19 infection and BAME individuals experiencing sleep loss, which may adversely affect their mental and physical health.","Falkingham, Evandrou, Qin, Vlachantoni","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053094","20220104","COVID-19; epidemiology; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","",24578,""
"Harm Reduction in Sexual Medicine","Introduction Strategies of harm reduction (HR) include policies and community-based measures aimed to reduce the risk of self-harm while continuing potentially hazardous behaviors, such as illegal drug, alcohol, and tobacco use. Objectives To assess whether and to which extent strategies of HR could have beneficial, or harmful, effects on sexual and reproductive health, for general and at-risk populations. Methods A literature research was performed between July 2020 and January 2021, investigating the association between harm reduction strategies and sexual and reproductive health. Results HR strategies are mostly aimed at providing support to at-risk population, such as injection drug users or sex workers. Alcohol and drug use, smoking and high-risk sexual behaviors are among the main targets for HR strategies. Barriers to access, such as stigma, marginalization or lacking awareness, are often present as negative risk factors and require attention from professionals. Preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), early/unwanted pregnancies and violence are the most important results HR programs could provide for sexual and reproductive health. However, evidence is limited and often qualitative, rather than quantitative. Conclusion HR strategies are important measures to improve sexual and reproductive health in at-risk populations. Increasing personal and social awareness is a key factor for the success of HR programs. A Sansone, E. Limoncin, E Colonnello, etÂ al. Harm Reduction in Sexual Medicine.
